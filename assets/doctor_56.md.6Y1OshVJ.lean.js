Currently, monitoring children in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) with pulse oximetry is recommended. However, pulse oximetry does not reliably recognize hypoventilation or apnea, particularly in the presence of supplemental oxygen. Capnography is a sensitive monitor of ventilation that is not often used in the PACU. AIM To determine the frequency of hypoventilation and apnea as detected by capnography among children in the PACU. METHODS In a cross-sectional study, capnography monitoring was applied to healthy children of age 1-17 years in the PACU of a tertiary care hospital. Staff was blinded to the capnography monitor; alarms were disabled. Staff provided routine care and monitoring with pulse oximetry to all patients. Vital signs, patient interventions, and medication administration were recorded by a research assistant every 30 s until all monitoring was discontinued by staff. Outcome measures included frequency of hypoventilation and apnea as measured by capnography and oxygen desaturations as measured by pulse oximetry, as well as staff interventions for these events. RESULTS Data from 194 children were analyzed. Capnography detected hypoventilation or apnea in 45.5% (95% CI 38.5%, 52.5%) of patients. Oxygen desaturations occurred in 19% (95% CI 13%, 24%) of patients. Interventions occurred in 9% (95% CI 5%, 13%) of patients. Patients who received narcotic medications were more likely to experience hypoventilation (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.02, 5.3) and apnea (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1, 7). Hypoventilation was seen more often among children who received supplemental oxygen (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1, 12). CONCLUSIONS Hypoventilation and apnea are common among children in the PACU; however, few interventions occur to address these events. Routine monitoring with capnography may improve recognition of respiratory depression and enhance patient safety in the PACU.","output":"Respiratory depression detected by capnography among children in the postanesthesia care unit: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Post-polio syndrome refers to the physical and psychological sequelae caused by poliovirus infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address this question, we report here the association between pre-infection Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and COVID-19 severity as assessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients with diabetes tested for COVID-19 in Leumit Health Services (LHSs), Israel, between 1 February and 30 April 2020. Using the LHS-integrated electronic medical records system, we were able to collect a large amount of clinical information including age, sex, socio-economic status, weight, height, body mass index, HbA1c, prior diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, smoking, and chronic lung disease. RESULTS: Of the patients included in the cohort, 183 (8.85%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 46 were admitted to hospital. More hospitalized patients were female, came from higher socio-economic background and had a higher baseline HbA1c. A prior diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident and chronic lung disease conferred an increased risk of hospitalization but not obesity or smoking status. In a multivariate analysis, controlling for multiple prior clinical conditions, the only parameter associated with a significantly increased risk for hospitalization was HbA1c &#8805; 9%.

Oncogenic PIK3CA results in an increase in arachidonic acid and a concomitant overproduction of eicosanoids, acting to promote cell proliferation beyond a cell-autonomous manner. Mechanistically, mutant PIK3CA drives a multimodal signaling network involving mTORC2-PKC-mediated activation of the calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Notably, inhibiting cPLA2 synergizes with fatty acid-free diet to restore immunogenicity and selectively reduce mutant PIK3CA-induced tumorigenicity.

Here, we report on a direct radiolabeling approach of rituximab with the (99m)Tc- and (188)Re-tricarbonyl core (IsoLink technology). METHODS The native format of the antibody (RTX(wt)) as well as a reduced form (RTX(red)) was labeled with (99m)Tc/(188)Re(CO)(3). The partial reduction of the disulfide bonds to produce free sulfhydryl groups (-SH) was achieved with 2-mercaptoethanol. Radiolabeling efficiency, in vitro human plasma stability as well as transchelation toward cysteine and histidine was investigated. The immunoreactivity and binding affinity were determined on Ramos and/or Raji cells expressing CD20. Biodistribution was performed in mice bearing subcutaneous Ramos lymphoma xenografts. RESULTS The radiolabeling efficiency and kinetics of RTX(red) were superior to that of RTX(wt) ((99m)Tc: 98% after 3 h for RTX(red) vs. 70% after 24 h for RTX(wt)). (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-RTX(red) was used without purification for in vitro and in vivo studies whereas (188)Re(CO)(3)-RTX(red) was purified to eliminate free (188)Re-precursor. Both radioimmunoconjugates were stable in human plasma for 24 h at 37 C. In contrast, displacement experiments with excess cysteine/histidine showed significant transchelation in the case of (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-RTX(red) but not with pre-purified (188)Re(CO)(3)-RTX(red). Both conjugates revealed high binding affinity to the CD20 antigen (K(d) = 5-6 nM). Tumor uptake of (188)Re(CO)(3)-RTX(red) was 2.5 %ID/g and 0.8 %ID/g for (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-RTX(red) 48 h after injection. The values for other organs and tissues were similar for both compounds, for example the tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-liver ratios were 0.4 and 0.3 for (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-RTX(red) and for (188)Re(CO)(3)-RTX(red) 0.5 and 0.5 (24 h pi).

In four experiments, we examined JOL reactivity effects by comparing JOL and no-JOL groups to other groups who engaged in relational-type encoding/judgment tasks.

The spreading of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could be associated with psychiatric implications. We investigated the psychopathological impact of COVID-19 in survivors, also considering the effect of clinical and inflammatory predictors. We screened for psychiatric symptoms 402 adults surviving COVID-19 (265 male, mean age 58), at one month follow-up after hospital treatment. A clinical interview and a battery of self-report questionnaires were used to investigate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptomatology. We collected sociodemographic information, clinical data, baseline inflammatory markers and follow-up oxygen saturation levels. A significant proportion of patients self-rated in the psychopathological range: 28% for PTSD, 31% for depression, 42% for anxiety, 20% for OC symptoms, and 40% for insomnia. Overall, 56% scored in the pathological range in at least one clinical dimension.

Taking advantage of this natural experiment, we examined how the proactive closure of elementary schools affected various outcomes related to children and family well-being. To identify the causal effects of the school closure, we exploited the discontinuity in the probability of not going to school at a certain threshold of age in months and conducted fuzzy regression discontinuity analyses. The data are from a large-scale online survey of mothers whose firstborn children were aged 4 to 10 years. The results revealed a large increase in children's weight and in mothers' anxiety over how to raise their children.

These recommendations are coherent to avoid the spread of SARSCoV-2 infection, but are in contradiction with comprehensive diabetes care, which requires regular patientCprovider interactions for patient education, prescriptions and possible management of complications or mental health. Moreover, confinement drives risk for unhealthy diets, decreased physical activity, mental health related concerns, in parallel to delayed care-seeking due to fear of contracting COVID-19. Another weakness in the current COVID-19 response is the focus on hospital care which overlooks the importance of Primary Care in guaranteeing continuity of care. Ensuring the availability of insulin, other medicines, self-monitoring and diagnostic tools is another challenge. These are all global concerns for the diabetes community, as well as for those suffering from other chronic conditions. Undoubtedly, the global priority is to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19. However, health systems still need to meet the needs of the entire population, including individuals with diabetes. Clear guidance for preparedness, crisis and post-crisis management of diabetes and chronic diseases during mass disruptions to health systems are lacking. Therefore, in parallel to the epidemic response efforts to ensure existing healthcare services keep running should be supported to avoid health consequences that might be worse than the epidemic itself.

The synthetic repurposing of drugs may prove to be more useful than the single repurposing in terms of reducing toxicity and enhancing efficacy. However, the researchers have not given it serious consideration. To address the issue, a novel datamining method is introduced and applied to repositioning of drugs for hypertension (HT) which is a serious medical condition and needs some improved treatment plans to help treat it. RESULTS: A novel two-step data mining method, which is based on the If-Then association rules as well as a novel discrete optimization algorithm, was introduced and applied to the synthetic repurposing of drugs for HT. The required data were also extracted from DrugBank, KEGG, and DrugR+ databases. The findings indicated that based on the different statistical criteria, the proposed method outperformed the other state-of-the-art approaches. In contrast to the previously proposed methods which had failed to discover a list on some datasets, our method could find a combination list for all of them. CONCLUSION: Since the proposed synthetic method uses medications in small dosages, it might revive some failed drug development projects and put forward a suitable plan for treating different diseases such as COVID-19 and HT.

Widespread application of this important marker of protective immunity is limited by logistical and technical challenges associated with live virus methods and venous blood collection. To address this gap, we validated an immunoassay-based method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction in a single drop of capillary whole blood, collected on filter paper as a dried blood spot (DBS) sample. Methods Samples are eluted overnight and incubated in the presence of spike antigen and ACE2 in a 96-well solid phase plate. Competitive immunoassay with electrochemiluminescent label is used to quantify neutralizing activity. The following measures of assay performance were evaluated: dilution series of confirmed positive and negative samples, agreement with results from matched DBS-serum samples, analysis of results from DBS samples with known COVID-19 status, and precision (intra-assay percent coefficient of variation; %CV) and reliability (inter-assay; %CV). Results Dilution series produced the expected pattern of dose-response. Agreement between results from serum and DBS samples was high, with concordance correlation = 0.991. Analysis of three control samples across the measurement range indicated acceptable levels of precision and reliability. Median % neutralization was 46.9 for PCR confirmed convalescent COVID-19 samples and 0.1 for negative samples. Conclusions Large-scale testing is important for quantifying neutralizing antibodies that can provide protection against COVID-19 in order to estimate the level of immunity in the general population. DBS provides a minimally-invasive, low cost alternative to venous blood collection, and this scalable immunoassay-based method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction can be used as a surrogate for virus-based assays to expand testing across a wide range of settings and populations.","output":"A surrogate virus neutralization test to quantify antibody-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in finger stick dried blood spot samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internalization of membrane proteins plays a key role in many physiological functions; however, highly sensitive and versatile technologies are lacking to study such processes in real-time living systems.

Overall survival, local recurrence and locoregional recurrence were evaluated depending on the time interval from surgery to the start of radiation therapy. Results: Patients that started radiotherapy within 21 days from surgery had a significantly decreased OS compared to patients treated after a longer interval from surgery (p < .01). There was no significant difference between patients treated  34 and 22-33 days from surgery (p = .210). In the univariate analysis, local control was superior for patients starting treatment 22-33 days from surgery compared to a later start (p = .049). This effect did not prevail in a multivariate model. There was no significant difference between patients treated within 21 days and patients treated more than 33 days after surgery (p = .203).

According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were divided into three groups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5 cases). The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the serum of each group were detected, and the changes of these indicators of the three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the clinical classification of the disease. Results: (1) The main symptoms of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms. Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial infection, respectively. (2) The blood test of the patients showed normal or decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29), increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal procalcitonin. In most patients, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was significantly increased (20/29), while albumin was decreased (15/29). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Tbil), serum creatinine (Scr) and other items showed no significant changes. (3) CT findings of typical cases were single or multiple patchy ground glass shadows accompanied by septal thickening. When the disease progresses, the lesion increases and the scope expands, and the ground glass shadow coexists with the solid shadow or the stripe shadow. (4) There were statistically significant differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6 in the serum of the three groups (P<0.05), among which the critical group was higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mild group. However, there were no statistically significant differences in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte count and LDH among the three groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are similar to those of common viral pneumonia. High resolution CT is of great value in the differential diagnosis of this disease. The increased expression of IL-2R and IL-6 in serum is expected to predict the severity of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia and the prognosis of patients.","output":"[Analysis of clinical features of 29 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Panic buying frequently occurs in health pandemics, disturbing both the market and people's lives. The situation is exacerbated by the easy spread of misinformation online. With a web-based experiment, the present study examined how user-generated anti-panic buying messages online could be leveraged to combat panic buying. It was found that user comments discussing how panic buying affects the lives of less advantaged social groups on social media, as well as high social endorsement of the comment, significantly reduced readers' derogation of the comment, thereby increasing negative attitudes toward panic buying and lowering intention to engage in it. The message format (narrative vs. non-narrative), however, did not influence the amount of impact it had on participants' attitude and purchase intentions. The findings contribute to research on message-based and heuristic-based persuasion processes in reading reactance-inducing messages online and guide the design of persuasive messages to reduce panic buying during health pandemics.

A new approach has been set up in the Acute Referral Clinic (ARC) at Musgrove Park Hospital and a survey has been conducted to measure the impact of the new method on patient and healthcare professionals' satisfaction with the new service. METHODS: A telephone-based consultation was introduced in ARC at Musgrove Park Hospital in March 2020 and patients were instructed to fill out a questionnaire containing eight items using a Likert Scale 1 ('very poor/disagree') to 4 ('very good/strongly agree') plus two boxes for open positive and negative comments respectively. Likewise a questionnaire was designed in order to assess the healthcare professionals' satisfaction using the new approach. Data collection took place over a two month period between the end of March 2020 and end of May 2020. The data underwent quality control and was analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Patient responses illustrated high satisfaction scores with an overall rating of very good (89.4%). The healthcare professionals' rating of the service was good (28.6% - 'very good/strongly agree', 57.1% - 'good/agree'). The safety rating of the new approach was overall rated 'very good' with 90.4% and 71.4% of patients and healthcare professionals respectively.

METHODS A literature search was performed on PubMed, Cochrane, and Clinical trials.gov from the date of inception to 12/08/2021. We identified 19 original studies reporting data on COVID-19 in HSCT recipients after screening 292 articles. Data was extracted following PRISMA guidelines. Quality evaluation was done using the NIH quality assessment tool. Inter-study variance was calculated using Der Simonian-Laird Estimator. Pooled analysis was conducted using MetaXL. A random-effects model was used to estimate the proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS Of 6711 patients in 19 studies, 2031 HSCT patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed. The median age of patients was 56.9 (range 1-81.6) years, and 63% patients were men according to 14 studies. The median time from transplant to SARS-CoV-2 infection for autologous (auto) and allogeneic (allo) HSCT patients was 23.2 (0.33- 350.5) months and 16.4 (0.2- 292.7) months respectively. The median follow-up time after COVID-19 diagnosis was 28 (0-262) days. The COVID-19 mortality rate was 19% (95% CI 0.15- 0.24, I2 = 76%, n = 373/2031).

While the two former groups have played a direct or indirect role in decisions related to public health measures, the latter has not. We expected all these relationships to be negative and mediated by the belief that the pandemic is instrumentalized by authorities to pursue secret agendas. In a study conducted with Belgian (N = 1136) and French (N = 374) convenience samples, conspiracy mentality negatively predicted trust in political institutions, and trust in scientific and medical institutions. These relations were partly mediated by belief that the pandemic is instrumentalized by authorities. In addition, distrust in political, medical and scientific institutions were highly and positively correlated, suggesting that these groups may be viewed as part of a same supra-ordinate category C the Elites. By contrast, we found a small negative relationship between conspiracy mentality and trust in the medical personnel in the Belgian sample, but not in the French sample. Trust in the medical personnel was unrelated to the belief that the pandemic is instrumentalized, and only weakly related to distrust in political institutions. This suggests that individuals with a susceptibility to believe in conspiracy theories may not have a propensity to distrust all actors involved in the management of the pandemic, but only those directly or indirectly tied to decisions pertaining to public health measures.","output":"Looking for Ties with Secret Agendas During the Pandemic: Conspiracy Mentality is Associated with Reduced Trust in Political, Medical, and Scientific Institutions C but Not in Medical Personnel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, drug repositioning emerges as a promising approach to develop efficient therapeutics in comparison to de novo drug development.

Evidence from previous epidemics suggests that negative psychological effects of quarantine measures can last or even worsen after the quarantine lift. The objective of this study was to assess the evolution of students' mental health and to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes 1 month after the lift of the lockdown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This repeated cross-sectional study collected data during the first quarantine in France (T1, N = 68,891) and 1 month after its lift (T2, N = 22,540), through an online questionnaire sent to all French University students. Using cross-sectional data, we estimated prevalence rates of suicidal thoughts, severe anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, State subscale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), and stress (Perceived Stress Scale) at T1 and T2. Using longitudinal data (N = 6,346), we identified risk factors of poor mental health outcomes among sociodemographic characteristics, precariousness indicators, health-related data, information on the social environment, and media consumption, adjusting for baseline mental health status. RESULTS: We found lower prevalence rates of severe stress (21.7%), anxiety (22.1%), and depression (139%) one month after the quarantine compared to the quarantine period (24.8%, 27.5%, and 16.1%, respectively). The prevalence rate of suicidal thoughts increased from 11.4 to 13.2%. Regardless of the existence of symptoms during quarantine, four factors were systematically associated with poor mental health outcomes 1 month after the quarantine was lifted: female gender, a low feeling of integration before the quarantine period, a low quality of social ties during the quarantine, and a history of psychiatric follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rates of severe stress, anxiety, and depression, although being lower than during the first lockdown, remained high after its lift. The prevalence rate of suicidal ideation increased. This stresses the need to consider the enduring psychological impact of the pandemic on students as a critical public health issue.","output":"Evolution in French University Students' Mental Health One Month After the First COVID-19 Related Quarantine: Results From the COSAMe Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutralizing antibodies that recognize the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein are the principal host defense against viral invasion. Variants of SARS-CoV-2 bear mutations that allow escape from neutralization by many antibodies, especially those belonging to classes widely distributed in the human population. Identifying antibodies that neutralize these variants of concern and determining their prevalence are important goals for understanding immune protection. To determine the Delta- and Omicron BA.1-variant specificity of B cell repertoires established by an initial Wuhan strain infection, we measured neutralization potencies of 73 antibodies from an unbiased survey of the early memory B cell response. Antibodies recognizing each of three, previously defined, epitopic regions on the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) varied in neutralization potency and variant-escape resistance. The ACE2 binding surface (RBD-2) harbored the binding sites of the neutralizing antibodies with highest potency but with the greatest sensitivity to viral escape; two other epitopic regions on the RBD (RBD-1 and RBD-3) bound antibodies of more modest potency but greater breadth. The structures of several Fab:spike complexes that neutralized all five variants of concern tested, including one Fab each from the RBD-1, -2 and -3 clusters, illustrated the determinants of broad neutralization and showed that B cell repertoires can have specificities that avoid immune escape driven by widely distributed (public) antibodies. The structure of the RBD-2-binding, broad neutralizer shows why it retains neutralizing activity for Omicron BA.1, unlike most others in the same public class. Our results correlate with real-world data on vaccine efficacy, which indicate mitigation of disease caused by Omicron BA.1.","output":"Antibodies induced by ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain that cross-neutralize variants from Alpha to Omicron BA.1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging and highly pathogenic coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and might even lead to death. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a new type of RNAs, are implicated in viral pathogenesis and host immune responses. However, their dynamic expression patterns and functions during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be unclear. We herein performed genome-wide dynamic analysis of circRNAs in human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at four time points. A total of 6118 circRNAs were identified at different genomic locations, including 5641 known and 477 novel circRNAs. Notably, a total of 42 circRNAs were significantly dysregulated, wherein 17 were up-regulated and 25 were down-regulated following infection at multiple phases. The gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that the parental genes of circRNAs were mainly involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Further, the RNA binding protein (RBP) prediction analysis indicated that the dysregulated circRNAs could regulate mRNA stability, immunity, cell death by binding specific proteins. Additionally, the circRNA-miRNA-gene network analysis showed that circRNAs indirectly regulated gene expression by absorbing their targeted miRNAs. Collectively, these results shed light on the roles of circRNAs in virus-host interactions, facilitating future studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis.","output":"Differential host circRNA expression profiles in human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the global pandemic, the frequency of digital financial services has increased, one of the reasons for which may be the fear of infection, which is not necessarily based on prudent orientation.

We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two formulations (frozen and lyophilised) of this vaccine. METHODS: We did two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies at two hospitals in Russia. We enrolled healthy adult volunteers (men and women) aged 18C60 years to both studies. In phase 1 of each study, we administered intramuscularly on day 0 either one dose of rAd26-S or one dose of rAd5-S and assessed the safety of the two components for 28 days. In phase 2 of the study, which began no earlier than 5 days after phase 1 vaccination, we administered intramuscularly a prime-boost vaccination, with rAd26-S given on day 0 and rAd5-S on day 21. Primary outcome measures were antigen-specific humoral immunity (SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies measured by ELISA on days 0, 14, 21, 28, and 42) and safety (number of participants with adverse events monitored throughout the study). Secondary outcome measures were antigen-specific cellular immunity (T-cell responses and interferon- concentration) and change in neutralising antibodies (detected with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay). These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04436471 and NCT04437875. FINDINGS: Between June 18 and Aug 3, 2020, we enrolled 76 participants to the two studies (38 in each study). In each study, nine volunteers received rAd26-S in phase 1, nine received rAd5-S in phase 1, and 20 received rAd26-S and rAd5-S in phase 2. Both vaccine formulations were safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse events were pain at injection site (44 [58%]), hyperthermia (38 [50%]), headache (32 [42%]), asthenia (21 [28%]), and muscle and joint pain (18 [24%]). Most adverse events were mild and no serious adverse events were detected. All participants produced antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein. At day 42, receptor binding domain-specific IgG titres were 14 703 with the frozen formulation and 11 143 with the lyophilised formulation, and neutralising antibodies were 4925 with the frozen formulation and 4595 with the lyophilised formulation, with a seroconversion rate of 100%. Cell-mediated responses were detected in all participants at day 28, with median cell proliferation of 25% CD4(+) and 13% CD8(+) with the frozen formulation, and a median cell proliferation of 13% CD4(+) and 11% CD8(+) with the lyophilised formulation.

Animals challenged by the intranasal and aerosol routes presented with mild, transient disease, while those challenged by the oral route presented with a subclinical immunological response. Animals challenged with MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012 by the aerosol route responded with primary and/or secondary pyrexia. Marmosets had minimal to mild multifocal interstitial pneumonia, with the greatest relative severity being observed in animals challenged by the aerosol route.

Humans typically exhibit fever, cough, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal issues, and breathing difficulties, which can lead to pneumonia and/or renal complications. This emerging disease resulted in the first human lethal cases in 2012 and has a case fatality rate of approximately 36%. Consequently, there is a need for medical countermeasures and appropriate animal models for their assessment.

We aimed to estimate the incidence of major bleeding events in this setting and to compare these risks against other vaccination routes. METHODS: This systematic review included all prospective and retrospective studies enrolling anticoagulated patients that received intramuscular vaccination, published until December 2020 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE. The outcomes of interest were major bleeding and haematoma related with vaccination. The incidence of the outcomes was estimated through a random-effects meta-analysis using the Freeman-Turkey transformation. The results are expressed in percentages, with 95%-confidence intervals (95%CI), limited between 0 and 100%. When studies compared intramuscular vaccination vs. other route, the data were compared and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Risk ratios (RR) with 95%CI were reported. RESULTS: Overall 16 studies with 642 patients were included. No major bleeding event was reported. The pooled incidence of haematomas following vaccination (mostly against Influenza) in patients treated with oral anticoagulants (mostly warfarin; no data with DOACs / NOACs) was 0.46% (95%CI 0-1.53%). Three studies evaluated the intramuscular vs. subcutaneous route of vaccination. Intramuscular vaccines did not increase the risk of haematoma (RR 0.53, 95%CI 0.10-2.82) compared with subcutaneous route. CONCLUSIONS: Intramuscular vaccination in anticoagulated patients is safe with very low incidence of haematomas and the best available evidence suggests that using the intramuscular route does not increase the risk of haematomas compared with the subcutaneous route.

Catching and introducing the wrong needle resulted in a knot formed around the right adnexa. DESIGN: A step-by-step demonstration of the mistake and technique to correct it. SETTING: A Para 0+V patient with cervical insufficiency was managed with laparoscopic interval cerclage [1,2,3]. The patient's two most recent pregnancies had been managed with emergency transvaginal cerclage, which failed to prolong her gestation beyond 24 weeks. INTERVENTIONS: Prior to the cerclage procedure a 2.0a?a?0.8cm deep endometriotic nodule was excised. Both curved needles were straightened extracorporeally, and the tape was dropped inside the peritoneal cavity. The 1st needle was introduced successfully through the right side. After insertion of - what was believed to be - the same needle through the left side following the opposite direction, it was discovered that a tight knot had been formed around the right adnexa (Figure 1). To avoid complete removal, the needles-less tape was pulled back completely from the right side (Supplemental Figure 1), and this end was stitched to a straight needle 2-0 polyglactin suture. The much thinner needle passed easily through the already created path, along with the tape (Supplemental Figure 2), and the procedure was completed as planned (Supplemental Figure 3).

This includes severe impacts on people's health and wellbeing such as stress, reduced physical activity and loneliness due to confinement. In parallel, people had to find ways to secure their food, with fresh food especially scarce in some regions due to lockdowns and restricted flow of goods. As in previous massive crises, the practice of home food gardening seemed to have increased during this pandemic. Yet we largely do not know which parts of society took to home food gardening, in which urban setting home food gardening was practiced, and to which extent this practice contributed to people's daily livelihoods during the pandemic. In this case study we explore (a) who practices home food gardening, (b) the garden characteristics, and (c) the main perceived benefits and barriers bound to home food gardening during the pandemic. We set up an online questionnaire targeted at the population of Santiago de Chile, for which we received 305 responses. Our results clearly show that the possibility of being in contact with nature and feeling less stress through practicing home food gardening were the most significant perceived benefits, while lack of or inadequate space to garden and limited knowledge on home food gardening were the main barriers. These findings highlight for the specific context of a metropolitan region in South America that access to gardens and green space could contribute to a just urban society. Likewise, the practice of home food gardening can be a relevant tool to cope with the adverse consequences of the pandemic by informing public initiatives to promote healthier lifestyles during this and future crises contexts and also in the awaited \\"ordinary\\" times.","output":"Home Food Gardening: Benefits and Barriers During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Santiago, Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has swept the world and poses a significant global threat to lives and livelihoods, with over 16 million confirmed cases and at least 650 000 deaths from COVID-19 in the first 7 months of the pandemic. Developing tools to measure seroprevalence and understand protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is a priority. We aimed to develop a serological assay using plant-derived recombinant viral proteins, which represent important tools in less-resourced settings. MethodsWe established an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the S1 and receptor-binding domain (RBD) portions of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2, expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. We measured antibody responses in sera from South African patients (n=77) who had tested positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were taken a median of six weeks after the diagnosis, and the majority of participants had mild and moderate COVID-19 disease. In addition, we tested the reactivity of pre-pandemic plasma (n=58) and compared the performance of our in-house ELISA with a commercial assay. We also determined whether our assay could detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA in saliva. ResultsWe demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins are readily detectable using recombinant plant-derived viral proteins, in patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Reactivity to S1 and RBD was detected in 51 (66%) and 48 (62%) of participants, respectively. Notably, we detected 100% of samples identified as having S1-specific antibodies by a validated, high sensitivity commercial ELISA, and OD values were strongly and significantly correlated between the two assays. For the pre-pandemic plasma, 1/58 (1.7%) of samples were positive, indicating a high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 in our ELISA. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG correlated significantly with IgA and IgM responses. Endpoint titers of S1- and RBD-specific immunoglobulins ranged from 1:50 to 1:3200. S1-specific IgG and IgA were found in saliva samples from convalescent volunteers. ConclusionsWe demonstrate that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in plants enable robust detection of SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses. This assay can be used for seroepidemiological studies and to measure the strength and durability of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients in our setting.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 antigens expressed in plants detect antibody responses in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020 many contributions have been produced on SLE.

The diagnosis and management of cancer is time sensitive and is likely to be substantially affected by these disruptions. We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care in India. METHODS: We did an ambidirectional cohort study at 41 cancer centres across India that were members of the National Cancer Grid of India to compare provision of oncology services between March 1 and May 31, 2020, with the same time period in 2019. We collected data on new patient registrations, number of patients visiting outpatient clinics, hospital admissions, day care admissions for chemotherapy, minor and major surgeries, patients accessing radiotherapy, diagnostic tests done (pathology reports, CT scans, MRI scans), and palliative care referrals. We also obtained estimates from participating centres on cancer screening, research, and educational activities (teaching of postgraduate students and trainees). We calculated proportional reductions in the provision of oncology services in 2020, compared with 2019. FINDINGS: Between March 1 and May 31, 2020, the number of new patients registered decreased from 112 270 to 51 760 (54% reduction), patients who had follow-up visits decreased from 634 745 to 340 984 (46% reduction), hospital admissions decreased from 88 801 to 56 885 (36% reduction), outpatient chemotherapy decreased from 173634 to 109 107 (37% reduction), the number of major surgeries decreased from 17 120 to 8677 (49% reduction), minor surgeries from 18 004 to 8630 (52% reduction), patients accessing radiotherapy from 51 142 to 39 365 (23% reduction), pathological diagnostic tests from 398 373 to 246 616 (38% reduction), number of radiological diagnostic tests from 93 449 to 53 560 (43% reduction), and palliative care referrals from 19 474 to 13 890 (29% reduction). These reductions were even more marked between April and May, 2020. Cancer screening was stopped completely or was functioning at less than 25% of usual capacity at more than 70% of centres during these months. Reductions in the provision of oncology services were higher for centres in tier 1 cities (larger cities) than tier 2 and 3 cities (smaller cities). INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable impact on the delivery of oncology services in India.

In this review, the authors propose a procedure for CPR in the intensive care unit that minimizes the number of personnel in the immediate vicinity of the patient and conserves the use of scarce personal protective equipment. Highlighting the low likelihood of successful resuscitation in high-risk patients may prompt patients to decline CPR. The authors recommend the preemptive placement of central venous lines in high-risk patients with intravenous tubing extensions that allow for medication delivery from outside the patients' rooms. During CPR, this practice can be used to deliver critical medications without delay.

Although these patients typically report relatively high pain intensity, the clinical course of their pain and disability remains unclear. Our objective was to review the literature and describe the clinical course of non-specific low back pain after an ED visit. METHODS Electronic searches were conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE from inception to March 2019. We screened for cohort studies or randomised trials investigating pain or disability in patients with non-specific low back pain presenting to EDs. We excluded studies that enrolled participants with minimal pain or disability scores at baseline. Two reviewers independently screened the full texts, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias and quality of evidence. Estimates of pain and disability were converted to a common 0-100 scale. We estimated pooled means and 95% CIs of pain and disability as a function of time since ED presentation. RESULTS Eight studies (nine publications) with a total of 1994 patients provided moderate overall quality evidence of the expected clinical course of low back pain after an ED visit. Seven of the eight studies were assessed to have a low risk of bias. At the time of the ED presentation, the pooled estimate of the mean pain score on a 0-100 scale was 71.0 (95% CI 64.2-77.9). This reduced to 46.1 (95% CI 37.2-55.0) after 1 day, 41.8 (95% CI 34.7 to 49.0) after 1 week and 13.5 (95% CI 5.8-21.3) after 26 weeks. The course of disability followed a similar pattern.

Prolonged MV induces diaphragmatic dysfunction in non-septic animals, but few reports describe the effects of prolonged MV in sepsis. We hypothesized that prolonged MV is not protective but worsens the diaphragmatic dysfunction induced by a mild sepsis, because MV and sepsis share key signaling mechanisms, such as cytokine upregulation. METHOD We studied the impact of prolonged MV (12 h) in four groups (n = 8) of male Wistar rats: 1) endotoxemia induced by intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, 2) MV without endotoxemia, 3) combination of endotoxemia and MV and 4) sham control. Diaphragm mechanical performance, pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations (Tumor Necrosis Factor-, Interleukin-1, Interleukin-6) in plasma were measured. RESULTS Prolonged MV and sepsis independtly reduced maximum diaphragm force (-27%, P = 0.003; -37%, P<0.001; respectively). MV and sepsis acted additively to further decrease diaphragm force (-62%, P<0.001). Similar results were observed for diaphragm kinetics (maximum lengthening velocity -47%, P<0.001). Sepsis and MV reduced diaphragm cross sectional area of type I and IIx fibers, which was further increased by the combination of sepsis and MV (all P<0.05). Sepsis and MV were individually associated with the presence of a robust perimysial inflammatory infiltrate, which was more marked when sepsis and MV were both present (all P<0.05). Sepsis and, to a lesser extent, MV increased proinflammatory cytokine production in plasma and diaphragm (all P<0.05); proinflammatory cytokine expression in plasma was increased further by the combination of sepsis and MV (all P<0.05). Maximum diaphragm force correlated negatively with plasma and diaphragmatic cytokine production (all p<0.05).

The findings showed that grassland type significantly impacted soil nutrients and the multifractal dimensions of soil PSDs, whereas management measures affected soil erodibility significantly.

However, these approaches have inherent drawbacks such as nonspecificity, high cost, are characterized by long turnaround times for test results, and can be labor\\\\intensive. Also, the circulating SARS\\\\COV\\\\2 variant of concerns, reduced antibody sensitivity and/or neutralization, and possible antibody\\\\dependent enhancement (ADE) have warranted the search for alternative potent therapeutics. Aptamers, which are single\\\\stranded oligonucleotides, generated artificially by SELEX (Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) may offer the capacity to generate high\\\\affinity neutralizers and/or bioprobes for monitoring relevant SARS\\\\COV\\\\2 and COVID\\\\19 biomarkers. This article reviews and discusses the prospects of implementing aptamers for rapid point\\\\of\\\\care detection and treatment of SARS\\\\COV\\\\2. We highlight other SARS\\\\COV\\\\2 targets (N protein, spike protein stem\\\\helix), SELEX augmented with competition assays and in silico technologies for rapid discovery and isolation of theranostic aptamers against COVID\\\\19 and future pandemics. It further provides an overview on site\\\\specific bioconjugation approaches, customizable molecular scaffolding strategies, and nanotechnology platforms to engineer these aptamers into ultrapotent blockers, multivalent therapeutics, and vaccines to boost both humoral and cellular immunity against the virus.

This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of mobile-based cognitive training exercises on COVID-19 related distress and maladaptive cognitions. Methods Following initial screening (n = 924), participants scoring 1 standard deviations above the mean of the COVID-19 Distress Scale were randomized into two groups. Participants in the immediate-app group (iApp; n = 25) started using the application at baseline (T0) for 12 days (from T0 to T1). Participants in the delayed-app group (dApp; n = 22) started using the mobile application at T1 (crossover) and used it for the following 12 days (T1 to T2). Results Intention to treat analyses indicated that the iApp group exhibited lower COVID-19 distress, lower depression, fewer intolerance of uncertainty and obsessive beliefs than the dApp group at T1. In addition, using the app for 12 consecutive days was associated with large effect-size reductions (Cohen's d ranging from 0.81 to 2.35) in COVID-19 distress and related maladaptive cognitions in the iApp group (from T0 to T1) and the dApp group (from T1 to T2).

A rapid review was conducted to determine the magnitude of association between potential risk factors and risk of severe outcomes of COVID-19. Methods: Methods, inclusion criteria, and outcomes were prespecified in a protocol that is publicly available. Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Epistemonikos COVID-19 in LOVE Platform, and McMaster COVID-19 Evidence Alerts, and select websites were searched to 15 June 2020. Studies needed to be conducted in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and have used multivariate analyses to adjust for potential confounders. After piloting, screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal were all performed by a single reviewer. Authors collaborated to synthesize the findings narratively and appraise the certainty of the evidence for each risk factor-outcome association. Results: Of 3,740 unique records identified, 34 were included in the review. The studies included median 596 (range 44 to 418,794) participants with a mean age between 42 and 84 years. Half of the studies (17/34) were conducted in the United States and 19/34 (56%) were rated as good quality. There was low or moderate certainty evidence for a large ([]2-fold) association with increased risk of hospitalization in people having confirmed COVID-19, for the following risk factors: obesity class III, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dementia, age over 45 years (vs. younger), male gender, Black race/ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic white), homelessness, and low income (vs. above average). Age over 60 and 70 years may be associated with large increases in the rate of mechanical ventilation and severe disease, respectively. For mortality, a large association with increased risk may exist for liver disease, Bangladeshi ethnicity (vs. British white), age over 45 years (vs. <45 years), age over 80 years (vs. 65-69 years), and male gender in those 20-64 years (but not older). Associations with hospitalization and mortality may be very large ([]5-fold increased risk) for those aged over 60 years. Conclusion: Among other factors, increasing age (especially >60 years) appears to be the most important risk factor for severe outcomes among those with COVID-19. There is a need for high quality primary research (accounting for multiple confounders) to better understand the level of risk that might be associated with immigration or refugee status, religion or belief system, social capital, substance use disorders, pregnancy, Indigenous identity, living with a disability, and differing levels of risk among children.

This disease frequently features cardiac amyloid fibril deposits that originate from dissociation of the tetrameric protein, transthyretin (TTR). Unlike hereditary TTR (ATTRm) amyloidosis, where amino acid replacements destabilize the native protein, in ATTRwt amyloidosis, amyloid-forming TTR lacks protein sequence alterations. The initiating cause of fibril formation in ATTRwt amyloidosis is unclear, and thus, it seems plausible that other factors are involved in TTR misfolding and unregulated accumulation of wild-type TTR fibrils. We believe that clusterin (CLU, UniProtKB P10909), a plasma circulating glycoprotein, plays a role in the pathobiology of ATTRwt amyloidosis. Previously, we have suggested a role for CLU in ATTRwt amyloidosis based on our studies showing that (1) CLU codeposits with non-native TTR in amyloid fibrils from ATTRwt cardiac tissue, (2) CLU interacts only with non-native (monomeric and aggregated) forms of TTR, and (3) CLU serum levels in patients with ATTRwt are significantly lower compared to healthy controls. In the present study, we provide comprehensive detail of compositional findings from mass spectrometry analyses of amino acid and glycan content of CLU purified from ATTRwt and control sera. The characterization of oligosaccharide content in serum CLU derived from patients with ATTRwt amyloidosis is novel data. Moreover, results comparing CLU oligosaccharide variations between patient and healthy controls are original and provide further evidence for the role of CLU in ATTRwt pathobiology, possibly linked to disease-specific structural features that limit the chaperoning capacity of CLU.","output":"Glycosylation of Serum Clusterin in Wild-Type Transthyretin-Associated (ATTRwt) Amyloidosis: A Study of Disease-Associated Compositional Features Using Mass Spectrometry Analyses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE Urgent tracheal intubation is performed frequently in intensive care units and incurs higher risk than when intubation is performed under more controlled circumstances. Video laryngoscopy may improve the chances of successful tracheal intubation on the first attempt; however, existing comparative data on outcomes are limited. OBJECTIVES To compare first-attempt success and complication rates during intubation when using video laryngoscopy compared with traditional direct laryngoscopy in a tertiary academic medical intensive care unit. METHODS We prospectively collected and analyzed data from a continuous quality improvement database of all intubations in one medical intensive care unit between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014. Propensity matching and multivariable logistic regression were used to reduce the risk of bias and control for confounding. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 809 intubations took place over the study period. Of these, 673 (83.2%) were performed using video laryngoscopy and 136 (16.8%) using direct laryngoscopy. First-attempt success with video laryngoscopy was 80.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.2-83.3%) compared with 65.4% (95% CI, 56.8-73.4%) for intubations performed with direct laryngoscopy (P < 0.001). In a propensity-matched analysis, the odds ratio for first-attempt success with video laryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy was 2.81 (95% CI, 2.27-3.59). The rate of arterial oxygen desaturation events during the first intubation attempt was significantly lower for video laryngoscopy than for direct laryngoscopy (18.3% vs. 25.9%; P = 0.04). The rate of esophageal intubation during any attempt was also significantly lower for video laryngoscopy (2.1% vs. 6.6%; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Video laryngoscopy was associated with significantly improved odds of first-attempt success at tracheal intubation by nonanesthesiologists in a medical intensive care unit. Esophageal intubation and oxygen desaturation occurred less frequently with the use of video laryngoscopy. Randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.","output":"Video Laryngoscopy Improves Odds of First-Attempt Success at Intubation in the Intensive Care Unit.

Here, we report a detailed study of vibrational-state-specific photodissociation dynamics of the CO(X1+) + O(1D2) channel via the 3P1u state by using the time-sliced velocity-mapped ion imaging apparatus combined with the single VUV photoionization detection scheme. By recording the sliced images of the O(1D2) photoproducts formed by VUV photoexcitation of CO2 to the individual vibrational structure of the 3P1u state, both the vibrational state distributions of the counterpart CO(X1+) photoproducts and the vibrational-state-specific product anisotropy parameters () are determined. The experimental results show that photodissociation of CO2 at 108.22, 107.50, 106.10, and 104.76 nm yields less anisotropic ( > 0) and inverted distributed CO(X1+, v) photoproducts. The possible dissociation mechanism for the CO(X1+) + O(1D2) channel may involve the non-adiabatic transition of excited CO2* from the initially prepared state to the 31A' state with potential energy barriers. While at 108.82 and 107.35 nm, the vibrational distributions are found to have the population peaked at a low vibrational state, and the anisotropy parameters turn out to be negative. Such variation indicates the possibility of another non-adiabatic dissociation pathway that may involve Coriolis-type coupling to the low-lying dissociative state. These observations show sclear evidence of the influence of the initially vibrational excitations on the photodissociation dynamics of CO2 via the 3P1u state.","output":"Photodissociation dynamics of CO2 + hv  CO(X1+) + O(1D2) via the 3P1u state."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although a broad range of viruses cause myocarditis, the mechanisms that underlie viral myocarditis are poorly understood. Here, we report that the M2 gene is a determinant of reovirus myocarditis. The M2 gene encodes outer capsid protein 1, which mediates host membrane penetration during reovirus entry. We infected newborn C57BL/6 mice with reovirus strain type 1 Lang (T1L) or a reassortant reovirus in which the M2 gene from strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) was substituted into the T1L genetic background (T1L/T3DM2). T1L was non-lethal in wild-type mice, whereas greater than 90% of mice succumbed to T1L/T3DM2 infection. T1L/T3DM2 produced higher viral loads than T1L at the site of inoculation. In secondary organs, T1L/T3DM2 was detected with more rapid kinetics and reached higher peak titers than T1L. We found that hearts from T1L/T3DM2-infected mice were grossly abnormal, with large lesions indicative of substantial inflammatory infiltrate. Lesions in T1L/T3DM2-infected mice contained necrotic cardiomyocytes with pyknotic debris, and extensive lymphocyte and histiocyte infiltration. In contrast, T1L induced the formation of small purulent lesions in a small subset of animals, consistent with T1L being mildly myocarditic. Finally, more activated caspase-3-positive cells were observed in hearts from animals infected with T1L/T3DM2 compared to T1L. Together, our findings indicate that substitution of the T3D M2 allele into an otherwise T1L genetic background is sufficient to change a non-lethal infection into a lethal infection. Our results further indicate that T3D M2 enhances T1L replication and dissemination in vivo, which potentiates the capacity of reovirus to cause myocarditis. IMPORTANCE Reovirus is a non-enveloped virus with a segmented double-stranded RNA genome that serves as a model for studying viral myocarditis. The mechanisms by which reovirus drives myocarditis development are not fully elucidated. We found that substituting the M2 gene from strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) into an otherwise type 1 Lang (T1L) genetic background (T1L/T3DM2) was sufficient to convert the non-lethal T1L strain into a lethal infection in neonatal C57BL/6 mice. T1L/T3DM2 disseminated more efficiently and reached higher maximum titers than T1L in all organs tested, including the heart. T1L is mildly myocarditic and induced small areas of cardiac inflammation in a subset of mice. In contrast, hearts from mice infected with T1L/T3DM2 contained extensive cardiac inflammatory infiltration and more activated caspase-3-positive cells, which is indicative of apoptosis. Together, our findings identify the reovirus M2 gene as a new determinant of reovirus-induced myocarditis.","output":"The M2 Gene Is a Determinant of Reovirus-Induced Myocarditis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The true impact of intubation and mechanical ventilation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients remains controversial. METHODS: We searched Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases from inception to October 30th, 2021 for studies containing comparative data of COVID-19 patients undergoing early versus late intubation from initial hospital admission. Early intubation was defined as intubation within 48 h of hospital admission. The primary outcomes assessed were all-cause in-hospital mortality, renal replacement therapy (RRT), and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) duration. RESULTS: Four cohort studies with 498 COVID-19 patients were included between February to August 2020, in which 28.6% had early intubation, and 36.0% underwent late intubation. Although the pooled hospital mortality rate was 32.1%, no significant difference in mortality rate was observed (odds ratio [OR] 0.81; 95% confidence interval 0.32C2.00; P = 0.64) among those undergoing early and late intubation. IMV duration (mean 9.62 vs. 11.77 days; P = 0.25) and RRT requirement (18.3% vs. 14.6%; OR 1.19; P = 0.59) were similar regardless of intubation timing. While age, sex, diabetes, and body mass index were comparable, patients undergoing early intubation had higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (mean 7.00 vs. 5.17; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The timing of intubation from initial hospital admission did not significantly alter clinical outcomes during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher SOFA scores could explain early intubation.

This study was conducted to clarify the patient's characteristics whose disease progressed to severe status. METHODS: The medical records of all consecutive 300 Japanese patients hospitalized at our institution between February and November 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical characteristics were evaluated to compare between mild (no oxygen needed), moderate (oxygen needs of 1-4 L/min), and severe diseases (oxygen needs of 5 L/min or more). RESULTS: The median age was 68 years old, with 123 (41.0%) males and 177 (59.0%) females. Of these, 199 patients (66.3%), 55 patients (18.3%), 46 patients (15.3%) patients were in the mild disease, moderate disease, severe disease groups, respectively. Patients with severe disease were more likely to be older, have more comorbidities, and tended to have higher body mass index. In laboratory data, lymphocyte count, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), LDH, and AST on admission were significantly associated with the severity. In multivariate analysis, age and CRP were the independent risk factors for severe disease (OR = 1.050, 1.130, respectively). The optimal cut-off value for age was 74 years old and that for CRP was 3.15 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Age and CRP were independently associated with disease severity of COVID-19 in multivariate analysis.

As we understand more about the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 it appears that a functional CTL (CD8+) response is required to clear the infection and COVID-19 severity is increased as the CD8+ response becomes somehow diminished or exhausted. This raises the hypothesis that the ELA-induced pro-inflammatory and senescent phenotype may play a role in determining the clinical course of COVID-19, and the convergence of ELA-induced senescence and COVID-19 induced exhaustion represents the worst-case scenario with the least effective T-cell response. If the correct data is collected, it may be possible to separate the early life elements that have made people particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 many years later. This will, naturally, then help us identify those that are most at risk from developing the severest forms of COVID-19. In order to do this, we need to recognize socioeconomic and early-life factors as genuine medically and clinically relevant data that urgently need to be collected. Finally, many biological samples have been collected in the ongoing studies. The mechanisms linking the early life environment with a defined later-life phenotype are starting to be elucidated, and perhaps hold the key to understanding inequalities and differences in the severity of COVID-19.","output":"The COVID-19 Pandemic: Does Our Early Life Environment, Life Trajectory and Socioeconomic Status Determine Disease Susceptibility and Severity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reports about cases of anaphylaxis to mRNA vaccines have created anxiety in the community and could increase vaccine hesitancy in the population.

There are also public health and security concerns that the pandemic has been accompanied and arguably further amplified by an infodemic spreading misinformation. Tests of the effect of social media consumption on future Covid-19 vaccine intentions using population samples have been relatively few to date. This study contributes to the evidence base by examining social media consumption and vaccine intentions using British and US population samples. Methods: Data were gathered on 1,663 GB adults and 1,198 US adults from an online panel on attitudes towards a future vaccine alongside self-reported social and legacy broadcast and print media consumption. Ordered and binomial logit models were used to assess reported intentions regarding a future Covid-19 vaccine, testing the effects of media consumption type. Respondents were categorised in terms of their media consumption using a fourfold typology, as less frequent social, less frequent legacy media consumers (low-low);high social, low legacy media consumers (high-low);low social, high legacy (low-high);and high social, high legacy (high-high). Results: In the British sample, regression results indicate that those who receive Covid-19 updates more frequently via legacy media (low-high), and those being updated more than daily via both online and legacy media consumers, tend to provide significantly less Covid-19 vaccine-hesitant responses than low-low consumers. There is no significant difference between high social, low legacy media consumers and low-low consumers. In the US sample, membership of the low-high group is associated with lower Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy compared with low-low consumers. However, respondents consuming both social and legacy media several times daily exhibit similar vaccine intentions on average to those consuming social media daily and legacy media less often, providing a contrast with the UK sample. We also identify differences in Covid-19 vaccine intentions relating to demographics and political values. Conclusions: Differences in vaccine attentions are associated with the extent and balance of consumption of news relating to Covid-19 and its source. Political values and ethnic identity also appear to structure attitudes to a future Covid-19 vaccine.","output":"Mode and Frequency of Covid-19 Information Updates, Political Values, and Future Covid-19 Vaccine Attitudes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively impacted family planning services worldwide.

This was a web-based cross-sectional study between September and December 2020 with 519 participants; of these 43.5% did not use any method. The most used methods were intrauterine devices, coitus interruptus and male condoms. Furthermore, 38.2% of women changed methods due to limited access to services and non-availability of methods. While 82.1% of women preferred modern methods before the pandemic, 79.7% became more acceptant of traditional methods. Moreover, 35.3% of women got pregnant during the curfew, and 90% were unplanned with a statistically significant higher rate in women who changed their routine method, accepted traditional methods, have been married for less than 10 years and multiparous women. National health policy makers should consider the impact of large-scale pandemics on family planning services.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Family planning services in Jordan have improved significantly over the last decade because of accessibility and availability of a wide range of contraceptive methods. Available methods are either traditional or modern. Because of the high failure rates of traditional methods, public health family planning programmes promote modern methods.What do the results of this study add? There are no published reports from Jordan on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and curfew on family planning methods. This study aims to report on what family planning methods women used during the pandemic, reporting if women changed their preferred methods and the reasons, assess women's knowledge about the natural methods of family planning which is probably an alternative method in situations where services and accessibility to more effective methods are limited and estimate unplanned pregnancies.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? National health policy makers should consider the impact of large-scale pandemics on family planning services.

We reviewed the evidence base on community health workers (CHWs) in humanitarian settings, with the goal of improving delivery of essential services to the most vulnerable populations. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of published and grey literature related to health and nutrition services provided by CHWs in humanitarian settings. Extracted data from retained documents were analyzed inductively for key themes. RESULTS: Of 3709 documents screened, 219 were included in the review. Key findings from the literature include: 1) CHWs were often able to continue providing services during acute and protracted crises, including prolonged periods of conflict and insecurity and during population displacement. 2) CHWs carried out critical emergency response activities during acute crises. 3) Flexible funding facilitated transitions between development and humanitarian programming. 4) Communities that did not have a locally-resident CHW experienced reduced access to services when travel was limited. 5) Community selection of CHWs and engagement of respected local leaders were crucial for community trust and acceptance and high utilization of services. 6) Selection of local supervisors and use of mobile phones facilitated continued supervision. 7) Actions taken to maintain supplies included creating parallel supply chains, providing buffer stocks to CHWs, and storing commodities in decentralized locations. 8) When travel was restricted, reporting and data collection were continued using mobile phones and use of local data collectors. 9) CHWs and supervisors faced security threats and psychological trauma as a result of their work. CONCLUSIONS: To achieve impact, policy makers and program implementers will have to address the bottlenecks to CHW service delivery common in stable low-income settings as well as the additional challenges unique to humanitarian settings.

METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study of Dutch NH residents with COVID-19 between 1 September 2020 and 1 March 2021. Prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms and functioning was determined using interRAI (ADL-Hierarchy Scale (ADL-HS), Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS) and Revised Index of Social Engagement (RISE)) at four time points. Descriptive and pattern analyses were performed. RESULTS: Eighty-six residents were included. Symptom prevalences after three months were higher than at baseline. At group level, functioning on all domains deteriorated and was followed by recovery towards baseline, except for ADL functioning. There were four trajectories; 9.3% had no deterioration. Total and partial recovery occurred in respectively 30.2% and 55.8% of the residents. In 4.7% there was no recovery.

Underpinned by the theories of social exchange and conservation of resources, these behaviors can be influenced by their level of job satisfaction (JS), defined as the extent to which employees like their work, and work engagement (WE), defined as a positive work-related state of mind. The present study investigates the mediating mechanism of WE in the relationship between JS and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs), which refer to discretionary behaviors that could benefit an organization (OCBs-O) and/or its members (OCBs-I). The mediational hypothesis is examined using structural equation modeling (SEM) among 719 Italian private and public sector employees. The significance of total, direct, and indirect effects was tested via bootstrapping. The results showed that JS was positively related to WE, which, in turn, was positively related to both OCBs-I and OCBs-O. The SEM results supported the hypotheses: WE fully mediated the relationship between JS and OCBs-I, and it partially mediated the relationship between JS and OCBs-O.

In adult ES, little is known about clinical features, disease associations, and outcomes. In this retrospective international study, we analyzed 116 adult patients followed at 13 European tertiary centers, focusing on treatment requirements, occurrence of complications, and death. ES was secondary to or associated with underlying conditions in 24 cases (21%), mainly other autoimmune diseases and hematologic neoplasms. Bleeding occurred in 42% of patients, mainly low grade and at ITP onset. Almost all patients received first-line treatment (steroids with or without intravenous immunoglobulin), and 23% needed early additional therapy for primary refractoriness. Additional therapy lines included rituximab, splenectomy, immunosuppressants, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, and others, with response rates >80%.

Analysis of TNFRSF13B in human kidney transplant recipients revealed that 33% of those with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) but fewer than 6% of those with stable graft function had TNFRSF13B missense mutations. To explore mechanisms underlying aggressive immune responses, we investigated alloimmunity and rejection in mice. Cardiac allografts in Tnfrsf13b-mutant mice underwent early and severe AMR. The dominance and precocity of AMR in Tnfrsf13b-deficient mice were not caused by increased alloantibodies. Rather, Tnfrsf13b mutations decreased natural IgM and compromised complement regulation, leading to complement deposition in allografted hearts and autogenous kidneys. Thus, WT TNFRSF13B and Tnfrsf13b support innate B cell functions that limit complement-associated inflammation; in contrast, common variants of these genes intensify inflammatory responses that help clear microbial infections but allow inadvertent tissue injury to ensue. The wide variation in inflammatory reactions associated with TNFRSF13B diversity suggests polymorphisms could underlie variation in host defense and explosive inflammatory responses that sometimes enhance morbidity associated with immune responses.","output":"TNFRSF13B genotypes control immune-mediated pathology by regulating the functions of innate B cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the global pandemic, in March 2020 we in academia and industry were abruptly forced into working from home.

Severe COVID-19 was associated with hypertension male gender (p < 0.001), hypertension (p = 0.006), hypercholesterolaemia (p = 0.046), and the ACE1- genotype (p = 0.049). In the multiple logistic regression hypertension (p = 0.02, OR = 2.26, 95%CI = 1.12-4.63) and male gender (p = 0.002; OR = 3.15, 95%CI = 1.56-6.66) remained as independent significant predictors of severity. The ACE2 polymorphism was not associated with the disease outcome. The ACE2 sequencing showed no coding sequence variants that could explain an increased risk of developing COVID-19. In conclusion, an adverse outcome of COVID-19 was associated with male gender, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and the ACE1 genotype. Our work suggested that the ACE1-I/D might influence COVID-19 severity, but the effect was dependent on the hypertensive status. This result requires further validation in other large cohorts.","output":"Angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE, ACE2) gene variants and COVID-19 outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Intracerebral hematoma involves two mechanisms leading to brain injury: the mechanical disruption of adjacent brain tissue by the hematoma and delayed neurological injury. Delayed neurological injury involves perihematomal edema (PHE) formation. Infectious complications following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are a significant contributor to post-ICH recovery. We sought to identify a correlation between PHE volumes and infectious complications following ICH. We also sought to explore the clinical impact of this association. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included 143 patients with spontaneous ICH. CT scans were performed on admission, and 3 h, 24 h, and 72 h following admission. Hematoma and PHE volumes were calculated using a semi-automatic method. The absolute PHE volume at each time point and changes in PHE volume (PHE) were calculated. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured from the obtained blood samples. Neurological deterioration (ND) was assessed in all patients. RESULTS Infectious complications were associated with PHE72-24 (P < 0.01), whereas there was no association between infectious complications and PHE24-3 (P = 0.09) or PHE3-ad (P = 0.81). There was a positive correlation between PHE72-24 and NLR (r = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79-0.90, P < 0.01) and between PHE72-24 and CRP levels (r = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.92, P < 0.01). The ND rate in the group of patients with infectious complications comorbid with high PHE72-24 was higher than the other patient groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS This study revealed a correlation between PHE72-24 and infectious complications after spontaneous ICH, which was associated with markers of systemic inflammation. This phenotype linkage is a negative cascade that drives ND.","output":"Impact of Perihematomal Edema on Infectious Complications after Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we first present a new concept of weight for 64 triplets and define a different weight for each kind of triplet.

Inverse probability weighting was used to estimate the excess rate of eGFR dip, risk of the composite cardiovascular outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, or all\\\\cause mortality, and risk of the composite kidney outcome of eGFR decline >50%, end\\\\stage kidney disease, or all\\\\cause mortality. In the first 6 months of therapy, compared with other antihyperglycemics, excess rates of eGFR dip >10% and eGFR dip >30% were 9.86 (95% CI: 8.83C11.00) and 1.15 (0.70C1.62) per 100 SGLT2i users, respectively. In mediation analyses that accounted for eGFR dipping, SGLT2i use was associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes (hazard ratio, 0.92 [0.84C0.99] and 0.78 [0.71C0.87], respectively); the magnitude of the association reduced by eGFR dipping was small for both outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS: The salutary association of SGLT2i with cardiovascular and kidney outcomes was maintained regardless of eGFR dipping; concerns about eGFR dipping should not preclude use, and occurrence of eGFR dip after SGLT2i initiation may not warrant discontinuation.","output":"Clinical Implications of Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Dip Following Sodium\\\\Glucose Cotransporter\\\\2 Inhibitor Initiation on Cardiovascular and Kidney Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online learning is becoming increasingly popular, whether for convenience, to accommodate work hours, or simply to have the freedom to study from anywhere. Especially, during the Covid-19 pandemic, it has become the only viable option for learning. The effectiveness of teaching various hard-core programming courses with a mix of theoretical content is determined by the student interaction and responses. In contrast to a digital lecture through Zoom or Teams, a lecturer may rapidly acquire such responses from students' facial expressions, behavior, and attitude in a physical session, even if the listener is largely idle and non-interactive. However, student assessment in virtual learning is a challenging task. Despite the challenges, different technologies are progressively being integrated into teaching environments to boost student engagement and motivation. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of various in-class feedback assessment methods such as Kahoot!, Mentimeter, Padlet, and polling to assist a lecturer in obtaining real-time feedback from students throughout a session and adapting the teaching style accordingly. Furthermore, some of the topics covered by student suggestions include tutor suggestions, enhancing teaching style, course content, and other subjects. Any input gives the instructor valuable insight into how to improve the student's learning experience, however, manually going through all of the qualitative comments and extracting the ideas is tedious. Thus, in this paper, we propose a sentiment analysis model for extracting the explicit suggestions from the students' qualitative feedback comments.","output":"A literature survey on student feedback assessment tools and their usage in sentiment analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Indonesia in March 2020, and the number of infections has grown exponentially. The situation is at its worst, overwhelming intensive care unit (ICU) resources and capacity. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a single-center observational case study of 21 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU from March 20, 2020, to April 31, 2020. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest imaging were obtained consecutively during patient care. We identified 21 patients with confirmed COVID-19 severe infection in our ICU. The mean ( standard deviation) age of the patients was 54  10 years; 95% were men, with shortness of breath (90.6%) the most common symptom. Hypertension was identified as a comorbidity in 28.6% of patients. The most common reason for admission to the ICU was hypoxemic respiratory failure, with 80% (17 patients) requiring mechanical ventilation. Half of the patients (10) died between day 1 and day 18, with septic shock as the primary cause of death. Of the 11 surviving patients, five were discharged home, while six were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital ward. Even then, the median length of ICU stay amongst survivors was 18 days. CONCLUSIONS: To date, there are no known effective antiviral agents or specific therapy to treat COVID-19. As severe systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ failure seems to be the primary cause of death, supportive care in maintaining oxygenation and hemodynamic stability remain the mainstay goals in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients.","output":"Severe COVID-19 in the intensive care unit: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Hypertension is thought to be a contributor to mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 patients; however, limited clinical data on the outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension are available. Methods: This study was designed to confirm whether hypertension affects the outcomes of COVID-19. Results: A total of 983 patients with COVID-19 (female, 48%; male, 52%) were enrolled. Significantly higher odds of 60-day mortality (p = .017) were observed in the hypertensive group. In the hypertensive group, even after adjustment in multivariate analysis, the subgroup of patients 70 years old and older had higher 28-day mortality and total 60-day mortality rates than the other age subgroups (bothp < .05). A total of 297 (89%) COVID-19 patients with hypertension survived, and 35 (11%) died. In addition, compared with hypertensive patients who survived COVID-19, non-survivors had more pre-existing conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and stroke, higher blood pressure on admission, more severe inflammation, and more liver and kidney damage. Conclusion: Hypertension does not affect the outcome of COVID-19, which is different than the conclusions drawn in other studies. However, the 28-day mortality and total 60-day mortality rates of hypertensive patients (age  70) with COVID-19 were significantly elevated, and compared with the group of survivors, non-surviving COVID-19 patients with hypertension were older, had more basic diseases and had a more severe clinical condition.","output":"Effects of hypertension on the outcomes of COVID-19: a multicentre retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pain is frequently encountered in the intensive care setting. Given the impact of pain assessment on patient outcomes and length of hospital stay, studies have been conducted to validate tools, establish guidelines and cast light on practices relating to pain assessment. OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent, range and nature of the evidence around pain assessment practices in adult patients who cannot self-report pain in the intensive care setting and summarise the findings from a heterogenous body of evidence to aid in the planning and the conduct of future research and management of patient care. The specific patient cohort studied was the sedated/ ventilated patient within the intensive care setting. DESIGN: A scoping review protocol utilised the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping review checklist (PRISMA-ScR). METHODS: The review comprised of five phases: identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection, charting the data and collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. Databases were systematically searched from January to April 2020. Databases included were Scopus, Web of Science, Medline via Ovid, CINAHL COMPLETE via EBSCO host, Health Source and PUBMED. Limits were applied on dates (2000 to current), language (English), subject (human) and age (adult). Key words used were \\"pain\\", \\"assessment\\", \\"measurement\\", \\"tools\\", \\"instruments\\", \\"practices\\", \\"sedated\\", \\"ventilated\\", \\"adult\\". A hand search technique was used to search citations within articles. Database alerts were set to apprise the availability of research articles pertaining to pain assessment practices in the intensive care setting. RESULTS: The review uncovered literature categorised under five general themes: behaviour pain assessment tools, pain assessment guidelines, position statements and quality improvement projects, enablers and barriers to pain assessment, and evidence appertaining to actual practices. Behaviour pain assessment tools are the benchmark for pain assessment of sedated and ventilated patients. The reliability and validity of physiologic parameters to assess pain is yet to be determined. Issues of compliance with pain assessment guidelines and tools exist and impact on practices. In some countries like Australia, there is a dearth of information regarding the prevalence and characteristics of patients receiving analgesia, type of analgesia used, pain assessment practices and the process of recording pain management. In general, pain assessment varies across different intensive care settings and lacks consistency.

Timely and accurate diagnosis of respiratory tract infections improves patient care and minimizes unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. We sought to develop a rapid nucleic acid tests for the detection of RSV within minutes, while retaining the high sensitivity achieved with RT-PCR. METHODS: We developed and evaluated a reverse transcription isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, reverse transcription strand invasion based amplification (RT-SIBA), for the rapid detection of RSV. RESULTS: The developed RT-SIBA assay showed good sensitivity by detecting as few as 10 copies of RSV RNA within 20 min compared with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which took approximately 2 h. The performance of the RT-SIBA RSV assay was further investigated using nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The RT-SIBA assay had a sensitivity of 100% (25/25) and a specificity of 100% (15/15). CONCLUSION: RT-SIBA did not require highly purified RNA for the rapid detection of RSV and was therefore compatible with rapid specimen processing methods. This reduces the complexity of specimen preparation and further shortens the total amount of time needed to detect RSV in clinical specimens.

Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented disruption in medical education and health care systems worldwide. Innovation in the teaching mode of cariology education is required to change the situation. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to evaluate the application effects of a case-based social mediaCassisted teaching method in cariology education. METHODS: Dental students of class 2019 were enrolled into the experimental group, while students of class 2018 served as control. A case-based social mediaCassisted teaching method was used in the experimental group, which included preclass activity via social media, additional discussion and practice process record in class, and questions and answers on the platform after class. The traditional teaching method, which consisted of conventional preparation before class, traditional lectures and demonstrations followed by students practice in class, and questions and answers step after class, was used in the control group. The teaching materials were the same in both groups. At the end of the program, students from both groups took cavity preparation skill evaluation tests. Questionnaires were tested on the case-based social mediaCassisted teaching group students anonymously. All data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software (version 22.0, IBM Corp). RESULTS: The mean student cavity preparation skill evaluation scores was 82.51 (SD 6.82) in the experimental group and 77.19 (SD 5.98) in the control group (P<.05). The questionnaire response rate was 100%. Of those, 94.3% (100/106) of the students recommended the case-based social mediaCassisted teaching method in cariology education.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Blood donors were recruited into four distinct groups [non-exposed (control), malarial area 'visitors', 'residents' and 'previous infection') and screened by using the Newmarket malarial antibody EIA. Assay specificity was evaluated in unexposed blood donors, and sensitivity was determined in acute clinical samples. RESULTS No parasitaemic donors were detected amongst 337 malarial 'visitors' who had returned from a malaria-endemic area less than 6 months previously, or for 402 'visitors' or 'residents' who had returned from a malaria-endemic area more than 6 months previously. The incidence of malarial antibodies within the exposed blood donor groups was 1.33% (10/751).

Classified as a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, ISAV is characterized by the presence of two surface glycoproteins termed hemagglutinin esterase (HE) and fusion protein (F), both of them directly involved in the initial interaction of the virus with the target cell. HE mediates receptor binding and destruction, while F promotes the fusion process of the viral and cell membranes. The carboxy-terminal end of F (F(2)) possesses canonical structural characteristics of a type I fusion protein, while no functional properties have been proposed for the amino-terminal (F(1)) region. In this report, based on in silico modeling, we propose a tertiary structure for the F(1) region, which resembles a sialic acid binding domain. Furthermore, using recombinant forms of both HE and F proteins and an in vitro model system, we demonstrate the interaction of F with a cell receptor, the hydrolysis of this receptor by the HE esterase, and a crucial role for F(1) in the fusion mechanism. Our interpretation is that binding of F to its cell receptor is fundamental for membrane fusion and that the esterase in HE modulates this interaction.","output":"Interaction of the Amino-Terminal Domain of the ISAV Fusion Protein with a Cognate Cell Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to examine trust in information provided by public authorities and financial measures put in place to address the impact of COVID-19.

The pattern of sequence variation in felids supports the role of the following factors in production and maintenance of MHC variation: (1) gradual spontaneous mutation; (2) selective pressure to conserve certain residues but also to vary in hypervariable regions, notably residues that functionally participate in antigen recognition and presentation; and (3) recombination-mediated gene exchange between alleles and between related genes. The overall amount of genetic variation observed among MHC class I genes in the Felidae family is no greater than the amount of variation within any outbred cat species (i.e., domestic cat, ocelot). The occurrence of equivalent levels of polymorphism plus the simultaneous persistence of the same sequence motifs in divergent feline species suggest that most MHC class I nucleotide site polymorphism predated species divergences. Ancient polymorphisms have been transmitted through the speciation events and modern feline MHC class I alleles were derived by recombinational exchange of polymorphic sequence motifs. Moreover, some of these sequence motifs were found in other mammalian MHC class I genes, such as classical human HLA-B5, nonclassical human HLA-E class I genes, and bovine class I genes. These results raise the prospect of an ancient origin for some motifs, although the possibility of convergence in parallel mammalian radiations cannot be excluded.","output":"Exchanges of short polymorphic DNA segments predating speciation in feline major histocompatibility complex class I genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transcriptional bursting is the stochastic activation and inactivation of promoters, contributing to cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression.

The objective of this study is to quantify our experience of telestroke (TS) consults at a large tertiary comprehensive stroke center during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed TS consults of patients presenting to our neuroscience network. Those with a confirmed diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemia attack were included. Data were compared from April 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020, which include consults prepandemic and during the crisis. Results: A total of 1,982 TS consults were provided in 1 year. Prepandemic, the mean monthly consults were 148. In April 2020, only 59 patients were seen (49% decline). Mobile stroke unit consults decreased by 72% in the same month. The 30-day moving average of patients seen per day was between five and six prepandemic declined to between two and three in April, and then began to uptrend during May. The mean percentage of patients receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was 16% from April 2019 to March 2020 and increased to 31% in April 2020. The mean percentage of patients receiving endovascular therapy was 10% from April 2019 to March 2020 and increased to 19% in April 2020. Conclusions: At our large tertiary comprehensive stroke center, we observed a significant and rapid decline in TS consults during the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot be certain of the reasons for the decline, but a fear of contracting coronavirus, social distancing, and isolation likely played a major role.

BACKGROUND. Many patients with COVID-19 suffer from arterial hypertension and have marked variations in blood pressure (BP) during the acute period of infection. The reasons for such changes are poorly understood. PURPOSE. To assess the relationship between the level of BP and the severity of changes in the main clinical and laboratory parameters in patients with arterial hypertension and with a moderate course of COVID-19 at the stage of the height of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The study included 86 hospitalized patients with verified coronavirus disease of moderate severity: 46 of them were male, the median age was 65 years. Patients received adequate hypertension therapy for a long time. After hospitalization, treatment was adjusted if necessary. The level of laboratory parameters in the acute period of the disease was determined, including the electrolytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, ferritin, general blood test, etc. BP measured daily. The relationship between laboratory parameters and BP level was evaluated by nonparametric correlation using the Spearman coefficient and multivariate analysis based on the \\"generalized nonlinear model\\". RESULTS. In 67.44% of patients with hypertension, an elevated BP level (>140/90) was observed against the background of moderate COVID-19. There was a significant negative correlation between the levels of CRP and BP throughout the stay in the hospital, the most significant is the 5th day of hospitalization. At the same time, a slightly stronger relationship is observed with diastolic BP (r = -0.4425) than with systolic BP (r = -0.3525). A similar trend is observed in all BP measurements. Besides, a negative correlation was found between potassium levels and BP values. The strongest association of potassium levels is with systolic BP on the day of hospitalization (r = -0.4850) and diastolic pressure on the 1st day of hospitalization (r = -0.3561). Multivariate analysis confirmed independent and reliable \\"influence\\" of CRP (p = 0.00018) and potassium (p = 0.03921) as independent predictors of diastolic pressure. CONCLUSIONS. Most patients with hypertension and moderate COVID-19 have elevated BP levels. There is a statistically significant negative relationship between the values of BP and levels of CRP and potassium. The obtained data may correspond to the existing hypothesis about the significant role of the kininCkallikrein system in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","output":"Blood pressure level and laboratory indicators of disease severity in patients with arterial hypertension and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Candida albicans and Candida glabrata are two common opportunistic fungi that can be co-isolated in oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC). Hypha is a hallmark of the biofilm formation of C. albicans, indispensable for the attachment of C. glabrata, which is seldom in mycelial morphology. Increasing evidence reveals a hypoxic microenvironment in interior fungal biofilms, reminding of a fact that inflammation is usually accompanied by oxygen deprivation. As a result, it is assumed that the disaggregation of hypha-mediated hypoxia of biofilms might be a solution to alleviate OPC. Based on this hypothesis, sodium houttuyfonate (SH), a well-identified traditional herbal compound with antifungal activity, is used in combination with fluconazole (FLU), a well-informed synthesized antimycotics, to investigate their impact on filamentation in C. albicans and C. glabrata dual biofilms and the underlying mechanism of their combined treatment on OPC. The results show that compared with the single therapy, SH plus FLU can inhibit the hyphal growth in the mixed biofilms in vitro, decrease the fungal burden of oral tissues and internal organs, restore mucosal epithelial integrity and function, and reduce hypoxic microenvironment and inflammation in a mice OPC model. The possible mechanism of the combined therapy of SH plus FLU can be attributed to the regulation of HIF-1/IL-17A axis through direct abrogation of the dual Candida biofilm formation. This study highlights the role of HIF-1/IL-17A axis and the promising application of SH as a sensitizer of conventional antifungals in the treatment of OPC.","output":"Sodium houttuyfonate enhances the mono-therapy of fluconazole on oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) through HIF-1/IL-17 axis by inhibiting cAMP mediated filamentation in Candida albicans-Candida glabrata dual biofilms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Diabetes and hyperglycemia are risk factors for critical COVID-19 outcomes; however, the impact of pre-diabetes and previously unidentified cases of diabetes remains undefined. Here, we profiled hospitalized patients with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes to evaluate its impact on adverse COVID-19 outcomes. We also explored the role of de novo and intrahospital hyperglycemia in mediating critical COVID-19 outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective cohort of 317 hospitalized COVID-19 cases from a Mexico City reference center. Type 2 diabetes was defined as previous diagnosis or treatment with diabetes medication, undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes using glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria and de novo or intrahospital hyperglycemia as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &#8805;140 mg/dL. Logistic and Cox proportional regression models were used to model risk for COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 159 cases (50.2%) had type 2 diabetes and 125 had pre-diabetes (39.4%), while 31.4% of patients with type 2 diabetes were previously undiagnosed. Among 20.0% of pre-diabetes cases and 6.1% of normal-range HbA1c had de novo hyperglycemia. FPG was the better predictor for critical COVID-19 compared with HbA1c. Undiagnosed type 2 diabetes (OR: 5.76, 95% CI 1.46 to 27.11) and pre-diabetes (OR: 4.15, 95% CI 1.29 to 16.75) conferred increased risk of severe COVID-19. De novo/intrahospital hyperglycemia predicted critical COVID-19 outcomes independent of diabetes status.

Drak2(-/-) mice are resistant to autoimmunity in mouse models of type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Resistance to these diseases occurs, in part, because Drak2 is required for the survival of autoreactive T cells that induce disease. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Drak2 affects T cell survival and autoimmunity are not known. A recent report demonstrated that Drak2 negatively regulated transforming growth factor- (TGF-) signaling in tumor cell lines. Thus, increased TGF- signaling in the absence of Drak2 may contribute to the resistance to autoimmunity in Drak2(-/-) mice. Therefore, we examined if Drak2 functioned as a negative regulator of TGF- signaling in T cells, and whether the enhanced susceptibility to death of Drak2(-/-) T cells was due to augmented TGF- signaling. Using several in vitro assays to test TGF- signaling and T cell function, we found that activation of Smad2 and Smad3, which are downstream of the TGF- receptor, was similar between wildtype and Drak2(-/-) T cells. Furthermore, TGF--mediated effects on na?ve T cell proliferation, activated CD8(+) T cell survival, and regulatory T cell induction was similar between wildtype and Drak2(-/-) T cells. Finally, the increased susceptibility to death in the absence of Drak2 was not due to enhanced TGF- signaling. Together, these data suggest that Drak2 does not function as a negative regulator of TGF- signaling in primary T cells stimulated in vitro. It is important to investigate and discern potential molecular mechanisms by which Drak2 functions in order to better understand the etiology of autoimmune diseases, as well as to validate the use of Drak2 as a target for therapeutic treatment of these diseases.","output":"Drak2 Does Not Regulate TGF- Signaling in T Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore how to build and maintain the resilience of frontline healthcare professionals exposed to COVID-19 outbreak working conditions.

Widely reported U.S. excess death estimates have not accounted for recent population changes, especially increases in the population older than 65 years. OBJECTIVE: To estimate excess deaths in the United States in 2020, after accounting for population changes. DESIGN: Surveillance study. SETTING: United States, March to August 2020. PARTICIPANTS: All decedents. MEASUREMENTS: Age-specific excess deaths in the United States from 1 March to 31 August 2020 compared with 2015 to 2019 were estimated, after changes in population size and age were taken into account, by using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provisional death data and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. Cause-specific excess deaths were estimated by month and age. RESULTS: From March through August 2020, 1 671 400 deaths were registered in the United States, including 173 300 COVID-19 deaths. An average of 1 370 000 deaths were reported over the same months during 2015 to 2019, for a crude excess of 301 400 deaths (128 100 non-COVID-19 deaths). However, the 2020 U.S. population includes 5.04 million more persons aged 65 years and older than the average population in 2015 to 2019 (a 10% increase). After population changes were taken into account, an estimated 217 900 excess deaths occurred from March through August 2020 (173 300 COVID-19 and 44 600 non-COVID-19 deaths). Most excess non-COVID-19 deaths occurred in April, July, and August, and 34 900 (78%) were in persons aged 25 to 64 years. Diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and heart disease caused the most non-COVID-19 excess deaths. LIMITATION: Provisional death data are underestimated because of reporting delays. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an estimated 218 000 excess deaths in the United States between March and August 2020, and 80% of those deaths had COVID-19 as the underlying cause. Accounting for population changes substantially reduced the excess non-COVID-19 death estimates, providing important information for guiding future clinical and public health interventions.

Generic antiviral drug remdesivir has been found to reduce time to clinical recovery but with insignificant clinical benefits and the antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine has been red flagged by USFDA for use as a prophylactic measure due to its cardiotoxicity. There is an acute requirement for a drug candidate that has significant clinical benefit with minimal to no side effects. With restricted access to wet laboratory techniques, an alternative approach is to engage in computational screening of lead molecules that could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at different stages of its infectious cycle. Several in silico studies on natural derivatives, especially that present in daily refreshments (tea and fruit juices), staple food (black rice, red onions, soy beans etc) and traditional medicines (extracts of herbs, leaves and flowers) have been identified as potential drug candidates that bind efficiently with the key viral proteins.

This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of manual hyperinflation in supine versus lateral decubitus position on arterial blood gases (ABG) in patients with VAP. Forty-two patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia with age range from 40 to 60 years were selected. They were randomly divided into two equal groups: group A who received manual hyperinflation from supine position and group B who received manual hyperinflation from lateral decubitus position (upper most affected). Both groups received respiratory physiotherapy. The patients received 2 sessions per day for 6 days. Outcome measures were arterial blood gases (PaO(2), PaCO(2), PaO(2)/FiO(2), and SaO(2)). They were assessed before the 1st morning session (pre), at day 3 (post 1), and at day 6 (post 2). RESULTS: After sessions, significant changes of measured variables (PaO(2), PaCO(2), PaO(2)/FiO(2), and SaO(2)) were obtained in both groups (P < 0.05, in all variables) and by comparison between groups post-intervention; a significant difference was observed between both groups in measures of oxygenation in favor of group B (P < 0.05), whereas there was a non-significant difference in the PaC02 between both groups (post 1 P = 0.52 and post 2 P = 0.33).

METHODS: Through Twitter Search Application Programming Interface, original tweets containing the hashtag #CDCGrandRounds (n = 6,966; April 21, 2011COctober 25, 2016) and the hashtag #VitalSigns (n = 15,015; March 19, 2013COctober 31, 2016) were retrieved respectively. Negative binomial regression models were applied to each corpus to estimate the associations between retweet frequency and three predictors (hashtag count, mention count, and URL link count). Each corpus was sub-set into cycles (#CDCGrandRounds: n = 58, #VitalSigns: n = 42). We manually coded the 30 tweets with the highest number of retweets for each cycle, whether it contained visual cues (images or videos). Univariable negative binomial regression models were applied to compute the prevalence ratio (PR) of retweet frequency for each cycle, between tweets with and without visual cues. FINDINGS: URL links increased retweet frequency in both corpora; effects of hashtag count and mention count differed between the two corpora. Of the 58 #CDCGrandRounds cycles, 29 were found to have statistically significantly different retweet frequencies between tweets with and without visual cues. Of these 29 cycles, one had a PR estimate < 1; twenty-four, PR > 1 but < 3; and four, PR > 3. Of the 42 #VitalSigns cycles, 19 were statistically significant.

Consequences may be more evident in patients with diabetes. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to identify the peculiarities of patients with DM among those in whom ICP were cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to identify subgroups in which the influence of DM has higher impact on the clinical outcome. METHODS: We included 2,158 patients in whom an elective ICP was cancelled or postponed during COVID-19 pandemic in 37 hospitals in Spain. Among them, 700 (32.4%) were diabetics. Patients with and without diabetes were compared. RESULTS: Patients with diabetes were older and had a higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors, previous cardiovascular history and co-morbidities. Diabetics had a higher mortality (3.0% vs. 1.0%; p = 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (1.9% vs. 0.4%; p = 0.001). Differences were especially important in patients with valvular heart disease (mortality 6.9% vs 1.7% [p < 0.001] and cardiovascular mortality 4.9% vs 0.9% [p = 0.002] in patients with and without diabetes, respectively).

Although literature is beginning to emerge on pregnancy as a risk factor for severe COVID-19, these studies are heterogeneous and use primary outcomes such as intensive care unit admission or hospitalization as surrogate markers that may subject analyses to misclassification bias in pregnant patients. OBJECTIVE: We aim determine the risk of severe COVID-19 among pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant women using non-admission based, standardized clinical criteria for severe disease. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of women aged 13-45 years and diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 between May 28-July 22, 2020. The primary outcome was severe COVID-19 as defined by two sets of non-admission based, clinical criteria: the World Health Organization Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement and the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team. Adjusted risk ratios were estimated using multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 262 women aged 13-45 years with symptomatic COVID-19, 22 (8.4%) were pregnant and 240 (91.6%) were non-pregnant. After adjusting for covariates potentially associated with the primary outcome, symptomatic pregnant women were at significantly increased risk for severe COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant women using both the World Health Organization Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (aRR 3.59, 95% CI 1.49-7.01) and Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team (aRR 5.65, 95% CI 1.36-17.31) criteria.

Emerging adulthood is a developmental phase with significant changes in the patterns of daily living; it is a risky phase for the onset of major mental illness. College students during the pandemic face significant risk, potentially losing several protective factors (eg, housing, routine, social support, job, and financial security) that are stabilizing for mental health and physical well-being. Individualized multiple assessments of mental health, referred to as multimodal personal chronicles, present an opportunity to examine indicators of health in an ongoing and personalized way using mobile sensing devices and wearable internet of things. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and provide an in-depth examination of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students through multimodal personal chronicles, we present a case study of an individual monitored using a longitudinal subjective and objective assessment approach over a 9-month period throughout 2020, spanning the prepandemic period of January through September. METHODS: The individual, referred to as Lee, completed psychological assessments measuring depression, anxiety, and loneliness across 4 time points in January, April, June, and September. We used the data emerging from the multimodal personal chronicles (ie, heart rate, sleep, physical activity, affect, behaviors) in relation to psychological assessments to understand patterns that help to explicate changes in the individual's psychological well-being across the pandemic. RESULTS: Over the course of the pandemic, Lee's depression severity was highest in April, shortly after shelter-in-place orders were mandated. His depression severity remained mildly severe throughout the rest of the months. Associations in positive and negative affect, physiology, sleep, and physical activity patterns varied across time periods. Lee's positive affect and negative affect were positively correlated in April (r=0.53, P=.04) whereas they were negatively correlated in September (r=-0.57, P=.03). Only in the month of January was sleep negatively associated with negative affect (r=-0.58, P=.03) and diurnal beats per minute (r=-0.54, P=.04), and then positively associated with heart rate variability (resting root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats) (r=0.54, P=.04). When looking at his available contextual data, Lee noted certain situations as supportive coping factors and other situations as potential stressors. CONCLUSIONS: We observed more pandemic concerns in April and noticed other contextual events relating to this individual's well-being, reflecting how college students continue to experience life events during the pandemic. The rich monitoring data alongside contextual data may be beneficial for clinicians to understand client experiences and offer personalized treatment plans. We discuss benefits as well as future directions of this system, and the conclusions we can draw regarding the links between the COVID-19 pandemic and college student mental health.","output":"Using Multimodal Assessments to Capture Personalized Contexts of College Student Well-being in 2020: Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E-learning is a widely used learning method, but with the development of society, traditional E-learning method has exposed some shortcomings, such as the boring way of teaching, so that it is difficult to increase the enthusiasm of students and raise their attention in class.

We examined the longitudinal associations of several ACEs across different early-life periods with longitudinal patterns of early-life inflammation and depression in young adulthood and assessed the mediating role of inflammation. The data came from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N = 3931). ACEs from the prenatal period through to adolescence were operationalised using cumulative scores, single adversities, and dimensions derived through factor analysis. Inflammation (C-reactive protein) was measured on three occasions (9-18 years) and depressive symptoms were ascertained on four occasions (18-23 years). Latent class growth analysis was employed to delineate group-based trajectories of inflammation and depression. The associations between ACEs and the inflammation/depression trajectories were tested using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Most types of ACEs across all early-life periods were associated with elevated depression trajectories, with larger associations for threat-related adversities compared with other ACEs. Bullying victimisation and sexual abuse in late childhood/adolescence were associated with elevated CRP trajectories, while other ACEs were unrelated to inflammation. Inflammation was also unrelated to depression and did not mediate the associations with ACEs. These results suggest that ACEs are consistently associated with depression, whereas the associations of inflammation with ACEs and depression are weak in young people.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research was to characterize how community pharmacy in Ontario (Canada) responded to the COVID-19 pandemic of winter/spring 2020, in particular in understanding what factors may influence or predict resiliency of individual practitioners and their workplaces. METHODS: One-on-one interviews mediated through technology (Microsoft Teams) were used, following a semi-structured interview protocol. Verbatim transcripts were produced and analyzed by two independent researchers, using an inductive coding process to identify and characterize themes. RESULTS: A total of 21 pharmacists participated in this study. Six themes were identified: a) use of and comfort with technology; b) early adoption of corporate and professional guidance; c) workplaces that emphasized task-focus rather than multi-tasking were more resilient; d) scheduling methods and practices in the workplace are important for personal resilience; e) dedicated specialty staff allowed pharmacists to focus on their work; and f) provision of personal protective equipment was essential. CONCLUSIONS: Traditionally, resilience in professional practice has been characterized as a personal, not a workplace, issue.

However, the pharmacological lectin-based approach has not been well studied. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of novel galectin-3 inhibitors by treating thyroid cancer cells with different concentrations of GB1107 or TD139. At high doses, TD139, but not GB1107, reduced cell viability and clonogenicity of thyroid cancer cells. TD139 induced apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells, as evident by an increase in the percentage of sub-G1 cells on cell cycle analysis, caspase-3 activation, and PARP1 cleavage. Either GB1107 or TD139 significantly inhibited cell coherence and counteracted anoikis resistance. Both inhibitors decreased migratory and invasive abilities in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, GB1107 and TD139 treatment attenuated AKT phosphorylation and decreased the expression of -catenin and MMP2. In conclusion, these novel galectin-3 inhibitors suppressed the anoikis resistance, motility, and invasive capacity of thyroid cancer cells at least partly through the AKT/-catenin pathway.

The accessory proteins have been less well characterized and are difficult to predict by classical bioinformatics methods.

Although big data analytics and artificial intelligence are widely used in the realms of health and medicine, researchers are only beginning to use these tools to explore the clinical characteristics and predictive factors of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Our primary objectives are to describe the clinical characteristics and determine the factors that predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission of patients with COVID-19. Determining these factors using a well-defined population can increase our understanding of the real-world epidemiology of the disease. METHODS: We used a combination of classic epidemiological methods, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (for predictive modeling) to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with COVID-19. We explored the unstructured free text in the EHRs within the Servicio de Salud de Castilla-La Mancha (SESCAM) Health Care Network (Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) from the entire population with available EHRs (1,364,924 patients) from January 1 to March 29, 2020. We extracted related clinical information regarding diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: A total of 10,504 patients with a clinical or polymerase chain reactionCconfirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified; 5519 (52.5%) were male, with a mean age of 58.2 years (SD 19.7). Upon admission, the most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea; however, all three symptoms occurred in fewer than half of the cases. Overall, 6.1% (83/1353) of hospitalized patients required ICU admission. Using a machine-learning, data-driven algorithm, we identified that a combination of age, fever, and tachypnea was the most parsimonious predictor of ICU admission; patients younger than 56 years, without tachypnea, and temperature <39 degrees Celsius (or >39 oC without respiratory crackles) were not admitted to the ICU. In contrast, patients with COVID-19 aged 40 to 79 years were likely to be admitted to the ICU if they had tachypnea and delayed their visit to the emergency department after being seen in primary care.

There were no statistically significant differences between AP and CP diagnostic performance (P > 0.05). NPVs of CP and both versions of AP (99.57 vs. 99.56%, P = 0.39), as well as the specificity (77.08 vs. 75.42%, P = 0.18), were substantially equivalent. Relative predictive value method did not reveal the presence of a statistically significant difference between the PPV of CP and both versions of AP (74.91 vs. 73.57%, P = 0.099). Analysis for single lesion confirmed that both CP and AP had equivalent results: CP and AP revealed 280 of 281 malignancies. NPVs of CP and both AP versions, as well as the specificity (P > 0.05), were substantially equivalent. Relative predictive value method did not reveal the presence of a significant difference between the PPV of CP and both AP versions (70.89 vs. 70.18%, P = 0.25; 70.89 vs. 70.00%, P = 0.13).

We sought to evaluate the early and late post-discharge outcomes in this patient population. Methods This case series includes 19 consecutive adult heart transplant recipients hospitalized for Covid-19 at our tertiary center between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021. After discharge, all patients were followed per standard post-transplant protocol for 6 months. Significant allograft dysfunction was defined as a decrease in LVEF  10% and myocardial damage was defined as at least 30% increase in troponin or NT-proBNP serum levels. CMV reactivation was defined as any positive PCR CMV requiring virostatic therapy. Results Of 19 recipients 15 (79%) were male with a mean age of 628 years and a mean time from transplantation of 4.53.4 years. 14 (73%) and 5 (26%) recipients had hypertension and diabetes, respectively. Immunosupressive (IS) regimen at the time of infection consisted of tacrolimus (TAC; mean C0 level 7.52.1 g/mL), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; mean dose 2052359 mg) and steroids (mean dose 4.64.7 mg). During hospital management IS was reduced in 6 (31%) patients with a maintenence of TAC serum levels (mean C0 7.71.9 g/mL pre-infection vs. 7.52.2 g/mL during infection, P=0.75) and a decrease of MMF dose (2052359 mg vs. 1906657 mg, P= 0.01). In 11 (58%) patients we applied oxygen supplementation; however none required non-invasive or invasive forms of ventilation. During hospitalisation 12 (63%) recipients received hyperimmune plasma, 13 (68%) were treated with remdesivir (cumulative dose 600 mg), and 11 (58%) received steroid therapy (mean methylprednisolone dose 2921 mg). All recipients survived to discharge (mean hospitalization time of 17.412.6 days) and to 6-month follow-up. We found no evidence of allograft dysfunction (LVEF 676% at baseline vs 687% at follow-up; P=0.88) or persistent myocardial damage (troponin: 2228 pg/mL vs. 1421 pg/mL; P=0.41 and NT-proBNP: 829823 pg/mL vs. 817940 pg/mL; P=0.96). CMV reactivation occured in 3 (16%) recipients and in 1 (5%) recipient a thrombotic event was noted.

Brazil is the second country with more deaths due to COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate excess cardiovascular mortality during COVID-19 pandemic in 6 Brazilian capital cities. METHODS: Using the Civil Registry public database, we evaluated total and cardiovascular excess deaths, further stratified in specified cardiovascular deaths (acute coronary syndromes and stroke) and unspecified cardiovascular deaths in the 6 Brazilian cities with greater number of COVID-19 deaths (S?o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, Recife, Belm, Manaus). We compared observed with expected deaths from epidemiological weeks 12C22 of 2020. We also compared the number of hospital and home deaths during the period. RESULTS: There were 65 449 deaths and 17 877 COVID-19 deaths in the studied period and cities for 2020. Cardiovascular mortality increased in most cities, with greater magnitude in the Northern capitals. However, while there was a reduction in specified cardiovascular deaths in the most cities, the Northern capitals showed an increase of these events. For unspecified cardiovascular deaths, there was a marked increase in all cities, which strongly correlated to the rise in home deaths (r=0.86, p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Excess cardiovascular mortality was greater in the less developed cities, possibly associated with healthcare collapse. Specified cardiovascular deaths decreased in the most developed cities, in parallel with an increase in unspecified cardiovascular and home deaths, presumably as a result of misdiagnosis. Conversely, specified cardiovascular deaths increased in cities with a healthcare collapse.","output":"Excess of cardiovascular deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazilian capital cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) and ethnic minority groups are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and adverse outcomes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination is now available for frontline UK HCWs; however, demographic/occupational associations with vaccine uptake in this cohort are unknown. We sought to establish these associations in a large UK hospital workforce. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted cross-sectional surveillance examining vaccine uptake amongst all staff at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. We examined proportions of vaccinated staff stratified by demographic factors, occupation, and previous COVID-19 test results (serology/PCR) and used logistic regression to identify predictors of vaccination status after adjustment for confounders. We included 19,044 HCWs; 12,278 (64.5%) had received SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Compared to White HCWs (70.9% vaccinated), a significantly smaller proportion of ethnic minority HCWs were vaccinated (South Asian, 58.5%; Black, 36.8%; p < 0.001 for both). After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, occupation, SARS-CoV-2 serology/PCR results, and COVID-19-related work absences, factors found to be negatively associated with vaccine uptake were younger age, female sex, increased deprivation, pregnancy, and belonging to any non-White ethnic group (Black: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.30, 95% CI 0.26C0.34, p < 0.001; South Asian: aOR 0.67, 95% CI 0.62C0.72, p < 0.001). Those who had previously had confirmed COVID-19 (by PCR) were less likely to be vaccinated than those who had tested negative. Limitations include data being from a single centre, lack of data on staff vaccinated outside the hospital system, and that staff may have taken up vaccination following data extraction. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic minority HCWs and those from more deprived areas as well as younger staff and female staff are less likely to take up SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. These findings have major implications for the delivery of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programmes, in HCWs and the wider population, and should inform the national vaccination programme to prevent the disparities of the pandemic from widening.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 vaccine uptake in a multi-ethnic UK healthcare workforce: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, the pandemic of coronavirus disease -2019 (Covid-19) has increased peoples focus on the importance of consuming a healthy diet to promote their immune defenses It has been established that many factors influence the immune system, including genetics, hormonal, and nutrition status This study reviews the effect of the different dietary patterns and some selected micronutrients that most populations suffer from its deficiency, such as vitamin D, zinc, selenium, and iron, on the immune system The aim was to focus on the impact of different diets and many nutrients on immunity which may protect or ameliorate COVID-19 patients Mediterranean diet (Mid Diet) is characterized by excellent vegetables, fruits, seeds, seafood, and moderate meat This dietary pattern is linked to a well-functioning immune system Med Diet contains many antioxidants as vitamin C, beta-carotene, and polyphenols that exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects Med Diet may be considered an effective and reasonably simple way to attenuate the intensity of COVID-19 infection The vegetarian diet (Veg Diet), the plant-based diet, is also linked to healthy immune responses It plays a criteria role in activating and strengthen both innate and adaptive immunity It increases gutmucosa health and reduces autoimmunity related disorders Contrariwise, the western diet (West Diet) is a popular pattern intake rich in carbohydrates, salt, saturated and trans lipid, while lacking in complex carbohydrates and fibers This dietary pattern leads indirectly to increase inflammatory markers, obesity, and many diseases Available evidence indicates that several micronutrients,including vitamin D, zinc, selenium, and iron, play an immune-supporting role, modulate the immune activity, and lower the possibility of infection Optimizing vitamin D and zinc status definitely has advantages in COVID-19 patients Evidence showed that various diet and different micronutrients play a role in the immune system and COVID-19 patients ? 2021 The Author(s)","output":"Impact of different dietary patterns and micronutrients on the immune system and covid-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, has been rapidly increasing in the United States.

According to the data provided by the New York State Department of Health, most of the cases of new COVID-19 infections in New York City have been found in the Queens county where 42,023 people have tested positive, and 3221 people have died as of 20 April 2020. Person-to-person transmission and travels were implicated in the initial spread of the outbreaks, but factors related to the late phase of rapidly spreading outbreaks in March and April are still uncertain. A few previous studies have explored the links between air pollution and COVID-19 infections, but more data is needed to understand the effects of short-term exposures of air pollutants and meteorological factors on the spread of COVID-19 infections, particularly in the U.S. disease epicenters. In this study, we have focused on ozone and PM2.5, two major air pollutants in New York City, which were previously found to be associated with respiratory viral infections. The aim of our regression modeling was to explore the associations among ozone, PM2.5, daily meteorological variables (wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, absolute humidity, cloud percentages, and precipitation levels), and COVID-19 confirmed new cases and new deaths in Queens county, New York during March and April 2020. The results from these analyses showed that daily average temperature, daily maximum eight-hour ozone concentration, average relative humidity, and cloud percentages were significantly and positively associated with new confirmed cases related to COVID-19; none of these variables showed significant associations with new deaths related to COVID-19. The findings indicate that short-term exposures to ozone and other meteorological factors can influence COVID-19 transmission and initiation of the disease, but disease aggravation and mortality depend on other factors.","output":"Short-Term Effects of Ambient Ozone, PM2.5, and Meteorological Factors on COVID-19 Confirmed Cases and Deaths in Queens, New York"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to assess the responses of local government to the COVID-19 and discusses the prospect of local government.

Conventional surgical approaches are technique sensitive and often result in alteration of the soft tissue architecture, which then requires additional corrective surgical procedures. This case series report presents the ability of flapless surgical techniques combined with a growth factor-enhanced bone matrix to provide esthetic ridge preservation at the time of extraction for compromised sockets. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS When considering esthetic dental implant therapy, preservation, or further enhancement of the available tissue support at the time of tooth extraction may provide an improved esthetic outcome with reduced postoperative sequelae and decreased treatment duration. Advances in minimally invasive surgical techniques combined with recombinant growth factor technology offer an alternative for bone reconstruction while maintaining the gingival architecture for enhanced esthetic outcome. The combination of freeze-dried bone allograft (FDBA) and rhPDGF-BB (platelet-derived growth factor-BB) provides a growth-factor enhanced matrix to induce bone and soft tissue healing. CONCLUSIONS The use of a growth-factor enhanced matrix is an option for minimally invasive ridge preservation procedures for sites with advanced bone loss. Further studies including randomized clinical trials are needed to better understand the extent and limits of these procedures. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The use of minimally invasive techniques with growth factors for esthetic ridge preservation reduces patient morbidity associated with more invasive approaches and increases the predictability for enhanced patient outcomes.

There has been a large interest in mathematical modeling to aid in the prediction of both the total infected population and virus-related deaths, as well as to aid government agencies in decision making. As the virus continues to spread, there are both economic and sociological incentives to minimize time spent with strict distancing mandates enforced, and/or to adopt periodically relaxed distancing protocols, which allow for scheduled economic activity. The main objective of this study is to reduce the disease burden in a population, here measured as the peak of the infected population, while simultaneously minimizing the length of time the population is socially distanced, utilizing both a single period of social distancing as well as periodic relaxation. We derive a linear relationship among the optimal start time and duration of a single interval of social distancing from an approximation of the classic epidemic SIR model. Furthermore, we see a sharp phase transition region in start times for a single pulse of distancing, where the peak of the infected population changes rapidly; notably, this transition occurs well before one would intuitively expect. By numerical investigation of more sophisticated epidemiological models designed specifically to describe the COVID-19 pandemic, we see that all share remarkably similar dynamic characteristics when contact rates are subject to periodic or one-shot changes, and hence lead us to conclude that these features are universal in epidemic models. On the other hand, the nonlinearity of epidemic models leads to non-monotone behavior of the peak of infected population under periodic relaxation of social distancing policies. This observation led us to hypothesize that an additional single interval social distancing at a proper time can significantly decrease the infected peak of periodic policies, and we verified this improvement numerically. While synchronous quarantine and social distancing mandates across populations effectively minimize the spread of an epidemic over the world, relaxation decisions should not be enacted at the same time for different populations.","output":"Universal Features of Epidemic Models Under Social Distancing Guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the covid-19 pandemic, physical distancing is being promoted to reduce the disease transmission and pressure on health systems Yet, what determines physical distancing?

We assessed 362 open datasets linked to first- or senior-authored papers published by 100 principal investigators (PIs) in the fields of ecology and evolution over a period of 7 years to identify predictors of data completeness and reusability (data archiving quality). Datasets scored low on these metrics: 56.4% were complete and 45.9% were reusable. Data reusability, but not completeness, was slightly higher for more recently archived datasets and PIs with less seniority. Journal open data policy, PI gender and PI corresponding author status were unrelated to data archiving quality. However, PI identity explained a large proportion of the variance in data completeness (27.8%) and reusability (22.0%), indicating consistent inter-individual differences in data sharing practices by PIs across time and contexts. Several PIs consistently shared data of either high or low archiving quality, but most PIs were inconsistent in how well they shared. One explanation for the high intra-individual variation we observed is that PIs often conduct research through students and postdoctoral researchers, who may be responsible for the data collection, curation and archiving. Levels of data literacy vary among trainees and PIs may not regularly perform quality control over archived files. Our findings suggest that research data management training and culture within a PI's group are likely to be more important determinants of data archiving quality than other factors such as a journal's open data policy.

Extrapulmonary manifestations involving the gastrointestinal tract, hepatobiliary system, cardiovascular and renal systems have been widely reported. However, the pathophysiology of many of these manifestations is controversial with questionable support for direct viral invasion and an abundance of alternative explanations such as pre-existing medical conditions and critical illness. Prior research on SARS-Co-V and NL63 was rapidly leveraged to identify angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as the key cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The distribution of ACE2 has been used as a starting point for estimating vulnerability of various tissue types to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sophisticated organoid and animal models have been used to demonstrate such infectivity of extrapulmonary tissues in vitro, but the clinical relevance of these findings remains uncertain. Clinical autopsy studies are typically small and inevitably biased towards patients with severe COVID-19 and prolonged hospitalization.

Here, we report the identification of one MOB1 protein in the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii. To characterize the function of MOB1, we generated gain-of-function transgenic lines with a ligand-controlled destabilization domain, and loss-of-function clonal lines obtained through CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Contrary to what has been characterized in other eukaryotes, MOB1 is not essential for cytokinesis in T. gondii.

Finally, using the proximity-biotinylation method, BioID, we identified novel members of the MOB1 interactome, a probable consequence of the observed lack of conservation of some key amino acid residues. Altogether, the results point to a complex evolutionary history of MOB1 roles in apicomplexans, sharing properties with other eukaryotes but also with divergent features, possibly associated with their complex life cycle.","output":"Characterization of a MOB1 Homolog in the Apicomplexan Parasite Toxoplasma gondii"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food environments are directly linked to diets and health outcomes such as overweight, obesity, and noncommunicable diseases. The digitalization of food environments is becoming a central issue in public health, yet little is known about this emerging field. We performed a systematic scoping review to map the research on the digital food environment and investigate how the eight dimensions of the food environment, according to an established framework (availability, prices, vendor and product properties, marketing and regulation, accessibility, affordability, convenience, and desirability), might be shifting in the context of a digital society. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between 2000 and 2019, using search terms covering digital technology and food environment, which yielded 13,580 unique records. Our analysis of 357 studies shows that digitalization is taking place in all dimensions of the food environment, and enabling the emergence of new forms of buying and selling food, such as online grocery shopping and online food delivery, which may be changing availability of foods and affecting the physical distance to shops and time allocated for shopping. Systematic reviews identified indicated that digital food marketing and social media can influence food choices, preferences and consumption.

Ongoing urbanization and urban densification are transforming the urban climate and complicating the pedestrian-level wind environment. Therefore, the main aim of this research is to evaluate the potential wind-cooling effect on human outdoor thermal conditions. Accordingly, the current research attempts determine the best wind directions for thermal comfort at the studied stations and how these factors will be changed under the effects of global warming. Outdoor thermal conditions were modeled based on the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) thermal index using RayMan software for the decades of the 2000s and the 2040s in different climate types of Iran (Csb, BWh, Csa, and BSh) To estimate the potential cooling effect of wind, the PET was calculated (1) under actual wind conditions, and (2) under calm wind (0.05 m/s) conditions. Then, the PET for these two conditions, which indicates the cooling potential effect (CPE) of the wind, was calculated for four representative stations (Ardebil, Bandar Abbas, Gorgan, and Shiraz). In comparison with the 2000s, the results indicated that by the 2040s, the predicted wind cooling potential will have increased in Ardebil, Shiraz, Bandar Abbas and Gorgan (CPE of 13.2 C, 13.1 C, 11.2 C, and 11 C, respectively). Based on the overall average of two climate change scenarios (A2 and B1) used in this study, the occurrence of \\"comfortable\\" conditions by the 2040s will have increased in Bandar Abbas, Shiraz, and Ardebil by 1.1%, 0.4%, and 0.3%, respectively, while it will have decreased in Gorgan by 1.5%. Accounting for the cooling effect of wind, the comfort cooling potential of wind is predicted to rise by an average of 1.6 C in the 2040s compared with the 2000s in all the studied stations. Therefore, this will affect the microclimates positively and could reduce the urban heat island effects.","output":"Evaluating the wind cooling potential on outdoor thermal comfort in selected Iranian climate types."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although surgery has become much safer, it has also becoming increasingly more complex and perioperative complications continue to impact millions of patients worldwide each year. Perioperative hemodynamic optimization utilizing Goal Directed Therapy (GDT) has attracted considerable interest within the last decade due to its ability to improve postoperative short and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing higher risk surgeries. The concept of GDT in this context can be loosely defined as collecting data from minimally invasive hemodynamic monitors with the intention of using such data (flow-related parameters and/or dynamic parameters of fluid responsiveness) to titrate therapeutic interventions (intravenous fluids and/or inotropic therapy administration) with the ultimate aim of optimizing end organ tissue perfusion. Recently, the increasing amount of evidence supporting the implementation of GDT strategies has been considered so robust as to allow for the creation of national recommendations in the United Kingdom (UK), France, and Europe. These recommendations from such influential scientific societies and the potential clinical and economic benefits of GDT protocols need to also be examined within the current shift from a \\"pay for service\\" to a \\"pay for performance\\" health care system. This shift is strongly encouraged within emerging systems such as the Perioperative Surgical Home (PSH) paradigm from the United States. As a result, hospitals and clinicians around the world have become increasingly incentivized to implement perioperative hemodynamic optimization using GDT strategies within their departments. Unfortunately, its adoption continues to be quite limited and a lack of standardized criteria for perioperative fluid administrations has resulted in significant clinical variability among practitioners. This current review will provide a brief up-to-date overview of GDT, discuss current clinical practice, analyze why implementation has been limited and finally, describe the newer closed-loop GDT concept along with its potential risks and benefits.","output":"Perioperative goal directed therapy using automated closed-loop fluid management: the future?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes asymptomatic infections, but also causes congenital infections when women were infected with HCMV during pregnancy, and life-threatening diseases in immunocompromised patients. To better understand the mechanism of the neutralization activity against HCMV, the association of HCMV NT antibody titers was assessed with the antibody titers against each glycoprotein complex (gc) of HCMV. METHODS: Sera collected from 78 healthy adult volunteers were used. HCMV Merlin strain and HCMV clinical isolate strain 1612 were used in the NT assay with the plaque reduction assay, in which both the MRC-5 fibroblasts cells and the RPE-1 epithelial cells were used. Glycoprotein complex of gB, gH/gL complexes (gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/UL128C131A [PC]) and gM/gN were selected as target glycoproteins. 293FT cells expressed with gB, gM/gN, gH/gL/gO, or PC, were prepared and used for the measurement of the antibody titers against each gc in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). The correlation between the IIFA titers to each gc and the HCMV-NT titers was evaluated. RESULTS: There were no significant correlations between gB-specific IIFA titers and the HCMV-NT titers in epithelial cells or between gM/gN complex-specific IIFA titers and the HCMV-NT titers. On the other hand, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the IIFA titers to gH/gL complexes and HCMV-NT titers.

Recent studies have shown that miR-451 regulates downstream molecules including AMPK/CAB39/MARK and mTOR to determine the balance between rapid proliferation and invasion in response to metabolic stress in the harsh tumor microenvironment. Surgical removal of the main tumor is inevitably followed by recurrence of the tumor due to inaccessibility of dispersed tumor cells in normal brain tissue. In order to address this complex process of cell proliferation and invasion and its response to conventional treatment, we propose a mathematical model that analyzes the intracellular dynamics of the miR-451-AMPK- mTOR-cell cycle signaling pathway within a cell. The model identifies a key mechanism underlying the molecular switches between proliferative phase and migratory phase in response to metabolic stress in response to fluctuating glucose levels. We show how up- or down-regulation of components in these pathways affects the key cellular decision to infiltrate or proliferate in a complex microenvironment in the absence and presence of time delays and stochastic noise. Glycosylated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain, contribute to the physical structure of the local brain microenvironment but also induce or inhibit glioma invasion by regulating the dynamics of the CSPG receptor LAR as well as the spatiotemporal activation status of resident astrocytes and tumor-associated microglia. Using a multi-scale mathematical model, we investigate a CSPG-induced switch between invasive and non-invasive tumors through the coordination of ECM-cell adhesion and dynamic changes in stromal cells. We show that the CSPG-rich microenvironment is associated with non-invasive tumor lesions through LAR-CSGAG binding while the absence of glycosylated CSPGs induce the critical glioma invasion. We illustrate how high molecular weight CSPGs can regulate the exodus of local reactive astrocytes from the main tumor lesion, leading to encapsulation of non-invasive tumor and inhibition of tumor invasion. These different CSPG conditions also change the spatial profiles of ramified and activated microglia. The complex distribution of CSPGs in the tumor microenvironment can determine the nonlinear invasion behaviors of glioma cells, which suggests the need for careful therapeutic strategies.","output":"Role of extracellular matrix and microenvironment in regulation of tumor growth and LAR-mediated invasion in glioblastoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In the last decades, nosocomial infections caused by drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa became a common problem in healthcare facilities. Antibiotics are becoming less effective as new resistant strains appear. Therefore, the development of novel enhanced activity antibacterial agents becomes very significant. A combination of nanomaterials with different physical and chemical properties enables us to generate novel multi-functional derivatives. In this study, graphene oxide and polyvinylpyrrolidone-stabilized silver nanoparticles hybrid nanocomposite (GO-Ag HN) were synthesized. The relation between antibiotic resistance and GO-Ag HN potential toxicity to clinical P. aeruginosa strains, their antibiotic resistance, and molecular mechanisms were assessed. Methods Chemical state, particle size distribution, and morphology of synthesized GO-Ag NH were investigated using spectroscopy and microscopy techniques (UV-Vis, FTIR, XPS, TEM, SEM, AFM). Broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa strains was determined using E-test. Antibiotic resistance genes were identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results In this study, the toxicity of the GO-Ag NH to the isolated clinical P. aeruginosa strains has been investigated. A high antibiotic resistance level (92%) was found among P. aeruginosa strains. The most prevalent antibiotic resistance gene among tested strains was the AMPC beta-lactamase gene (65.6%). UV-vis, FTIR, and XPS studies confirmed the formation of the silver nanoparticles on the GO nanosheets. The functionalization process occurred through the interaction between Ag nanoparticles, GO, and polyvinylpyrrolidone used for nanoparticle stabilization. SEM analysis revealed that GO nanosheets undergo partial fragmentation during hybrid nanocomposite preparation, which remarkably increases the number of sharp edges and their mediated cutting effect. TEM analysis showed that GO-Ag HN spherical Ag nanoparticles mainly 9-12 nm in size were irregularly precipitated on the GO nanosheet surface. A higher density of Ag NPs was observed in the sheets' wrinkles, corrugations, and sharp edges. This hybrid nanocomposite poses enhanced antibacterial activity against carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains through a possible synergy between toxicity mechanisms of GO nanosheets and Ag nanoparticles. With incubation time increasing up to 10 minutes, the survival of P. aeruginosa decreased significantly. Conclusion A graphene oxide and silver nanoparticles hybrid composite has been shown to be a promising material to control nosocomial infections caused by bacteria strains resistant to most antibiotics.","output":"Effect of Graphene Oxide and Silver Nanoparticles Hybrid Composite on P. aeruginosa Strains with Acquired Resistance Genes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase therefore health services in hospitals must adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in the frequency of hand washing and hand care, the onset of hand eczema (HE) and risk factors associated with HE since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Munich in January 2020. MATERIALS & METHODS: All dermatologic outpatients at the university hospital between April 6 and April 19 were asked to complete a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Data of 512 patients with a median age of 49 years (243 females, 267 males) were analysed. The frequency of hand washing and hand disinfection increased after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (p < 0.001, respectively). While symptoms associated with HE were reported by 29.9% (149/499) of patients, the actual diagnosis of HE was reported less frequently by 11.2% (53/473) with a median duration of 120 days. Frequent hand disinfection (p = 0.039), atopic dermatitis (p = 0.006) and young age (p = 0.0499) were identified as risk factors for symptoms of HE. Hand care was performed more frequently during the pandemic than before (p < 0.001). A high frequency of hand care during the pandemic was not significantly associated with symptoms of HE (p = 0.172), but was associated with self-recognition of HE symptoms (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: After the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the frequency of hand hygiene measures increased. A considerably high prevalence of HE symptoms was associated with frequent hand disinfection, atopic dermatitis and young age.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Sciences, and SCOPUS were searched for retrospective or prospective observational studies reporting data on cardiovascular risk factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Univariable and multivariable age-adjusted analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between cardiovascular risk factors and the occurrence of in-hospital death. RESULTS: The analysis included 45 studies enrolling 18,300 patients. The pooled estimate of in-hospital mortality was 12% (95% CI 9C15%). The univariable meta-regression analysis showed a significant association between age (coefficient: 1.06; 95% CI 1.04C1.09; p < 0.001), diabetes (coefficient: 1.04; 95% CI 1.02C1.07; p < 0.001) and hypertension (coefficient: 1.01; 95% CI 1.01C1.03; p = 0.013) with in-hospital death. Male sex and smoking did not significantly affect mortality. At multivariable age-adjusted meta-regression analysis, diabetes was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (coefficient: 1.02; 95% CI 1.01C1.05; p = 0.043); conversely, hypertension was no longer significant after adjustment for age (coefficient: 1.00; 95% CI 0.99C1.01; p = 0.820). A significant association between age and in-hospital mortality was confirmed in all multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that older age and diabetes are associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the drugs of choice for malaria management particularly across malaria-endemic countries. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess efficacy and safety of ACTs for uncomplicated malaria in pediatric populations. METHODS A body of evidence was searched for published ACT trials until March 06, 2020. The search was focused on efficacy and safety studies of ACTs for uncomplicated malaria in pediatrics. PubMed library was searched using best adapted search terms after multiple trials. References were exported to the endnote library and then to Covidence for screening. Data was extracted using the Covidence platform. The per-protocol analysis report for the efficacy and the intention-to-treat analysis for the safety were synthesized. Met-analysis was carried using Open Meta-Analyst software. Random effects model was applied and the heterogeneity of studies was evaluated using I2 statistic. RESULTS Nineteen studies were included in the final analysis. Overall, crude, PCR-corrected P. falciparum malaria treatment success rate was 96.3 and 93.9% for day 28 and 42, respectively. In the subgroup analysis, PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) was 99.6% (95% CI: 99.1 to 100%, I2 = 0%; 4 studies) at day 28 and 99.6% (95% CI of 99 to 100%, I2 = 0%; 3 studies) at day 42. Nine studies reported ACT related adverse drug reactions (ADR) (8.3%, 356/4304). The reported drug related adverse reactions ranged from 1.8% in DP (two studies) to 23.3% in artesunate-pyronaridine (AP). Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common ACT related adverse effects, and all ADRs were reported to resolve spontaneously. CONCLUSION ACTs demonstrated a high crude efficacy and tolerability against P. falciparum. The high treatment success and tolerability with low heterogeneity conferred by DP has implication for policy makers who plan the use of ACTs for uncomplicated falciparum malaria treatment in pediatrics.","output":"Efficacy and safety of artemisinin-based combination therapies for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in pediatrics: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Remdesivir has emerged as a novel treatment in hospitalized COVID19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation. Though there have been several case reports of remdesivir-associated sinus bradycardia, this association is still unclear. Furthermore, remdesivir's interaction with beta blockers has not been studied. Case: A 70-year-old woman with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) status post ablation presented with shortness of breath. She was tachycardic to 115 beats per minute (BPM) and hypoxemic to the 80s, requiring supplemental oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. She was found to have COVID19 pneumonia, for which dexamethasone and remdesivir were started. She developed marked bradycardia and eventually asymptomatic Mobitz type 1 atrioventricular block (AVB).

An optimal multimodal analgesia technique would include the use of nonopioid analgesics, including local/regional analgesic techniques such as surgical site local anesthetic infiltration. This article presents a novel approach to surgical site infiltration techniques for abdominal surgery based upon neuroanatomy. METHODS Literature searches were conducted for studies reporting the neuroanatomical sources of pain after abdominal surgery. Also, studies identified by preceding search were reviewed for relevant publications and manually retrieved. RESULTS Based on neuroanatomy, an optimal surgical site infiltration technique would consist of systematic, extensive, meticulous administration of local anesthetic into the peritoneum (or preperitoneum), subfascial, and subdermal tissue planes. The volume of local anesthetic would depend on the size of the incision such that 1 to 1.5 mL is injected every 1 to 2 cm of surgical incision per layer. It is best to infiltrate with a 22-gauge, 1.5-inch needle. The needle is inserted approximately 0.5 to 1 cm into the tissue plane, and local anesthetic solution is injected while slowly withdrawing the needle, which should reduce the risk of intravascular injection. CONCLUSIONS Meticulous, systematic, and extensive surgical site local anesthetic infiltration in the various tissue planes including the peritoneal, musculofascial, and subdermal tissues, where pain foci originate, provides excellent postoperative pain relief. This approach should be combined with use of other nonopioid analgesics with opioids reserved for rescue.

An adaptive strategy for the handling of thrombectomy for patients with large vessel occlusion has evolved at our center to optimize patient care while also minimizing risk of virus transmission. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the new thrombectomy protocol by comparing thrombectomy times and patient outcomes during the pandemic and pre pandemic period. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who underwent emergent thrombectomy from April 4th, 2020 to August 25th, 2020 (pandemic period) and between December 2nd, 2019 to April 3rd, 2020 (pre-pandemic period). The new protocol centered on a standardized approach to airway management in patients considered 'high-risk' for infection. An array of patient-specific factors and outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 126 patients were included in the study. There was no significant difference in door-to-recanalization or other time parameters between the two groups (138 minutes during the pandemic vs. 129 minutes pre-pandemic; p=0.37). However, outcomes measured as discharge modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were worse for patients during the pandemic (mRS &#8804; 2, 10/58; 17.2% during pandemic vs. 24/68; 35.3% pre-pandemic, pa?=a?0.02).

Of particular interest is the capability of BEA to dock to both the main coronavirus protease (Pockets A and B) and spike proteins. These results were validated by molecular dynamic simulation (Gromacs). Several parameters, such as root-mean-square deviation/fluctuation, the radius of gyration, H-bonding, and free binding energy were analyzed.

In this study, a comparative transcriptome analysis of lncRNAs was performed in RTG-2 cells with and without IHNV infection to determine their changes and the effects on IHNV infection. The results showed that IHNV infection significantly changed the expression levels of lncRNAs and mRNAs, including 3693 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) and 3503 differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNAs) respectively. These DE-lncRNAs and DE-mRNAs induced by IHNV were mostly associated with immune response, RNA processing, and viral diseases related pathways. Further analysis found that some DE-lncRNAs might participate in the regulation of extracellular matrix metabolism, apoptosis, lipid synthesis, autophagy, and immune responses referring to the functions of their target genes.

An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) model was created in group 1 (n = 2). Each AVM model was then embolized with AS18 or S18? alone with evaluation of a ratio between the volume of embolic agent divided by the volume of the AVM (evaluated by CT). For group 2 (n = 5), each agent was tested on three different kidneys (upper pole kidney artery).

There is an urgent need for evidence-based criteria to ensure patient safety before resuming exercise. Objective: To estimate the pooled prevalence of acute myocardial injury caused by COVID-19 and to provide an easy-to-use cardiovascular risk assessment toolkit prior to resuming sports activities after COVID-19 infection. Methods: We searched the Medline and Cochrane databases for articles on the prevalence of acute myocardial injury associated with COVID-19 infection. The pooled prevalence of acute myocardial injury was calculated for hospitalized patients treated in different settings (non-intensive care unit [ICU], ICU, overall hospitalization, and non-survivors). Statistical significance was accepted for p values <0.05. We propose a practical flowchart to assess the cardiovascular risk of individuals who recovered from COVID-19 before resuming sports activities. Results: A total of 20 studies (6,573 patients) were included. The overall pooled prevalence of acute myocardial injury in hospitalized patients was 21.7% (95% CI 17.3-26.5%). The non-ICU setting had the lowest prevalence (9.5%, 95% CI 1.5-23.4%), followed by the ICU setting (44.9%, 95% CI 27.7-62.8%), and the cohort of non-survivors (57.7% with 95% CI 38.5-75.7%). We provide an approach to assess cardiovascular risk based on the prevalence of acute myocardial injury in each setting. Conclusions: Acute myocardial injury is frequent and associated with more severe disease and hospital admissions. Cardiac involvement could be a potential trigger for exercise-induced clinical complications after COVID-19 infection. We created a toolkit to assist with clinical decision-making prior to resuming sports activities after COVID-19 infection.","output":"Cardiovascular Risk Assessment after COVID-19 Infection before Resuming Sports Activities - Practical Flowchart and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine hesitancy, which embodies the unwillingness to receive vaccines when vaccination services are available and accessible, is one of the greatest threats to global health. Although vaccine hesitancy has existed among a small percentage of people for centuries, its harmful effects are likely to be more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic than ever before. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy will pose substantial risks for both people who delay or refuse to be vaccinated and the wider community. It will make communities unable to reach thresholds of coverage necessary for herd immunity against COVID-19, thus unnecessarily perpetuating the pandemic and resulting in untold suffering and deaths. Vaccine hesitancy is pervasive, misinformed, contagious, and is not limited to COVID-19 vaccination. Our work shows that vaccine hesitancy is a complex and dynamic social process that reflects multiple webs of influence, meaning, and logic. People's vaccination views and practices usually comprise an ongoing engagement that is contingent on unfolding personal and social circumstances, which can potentially change over time. Therefore, as COVID-19 vaccination rolls out globally, scientists and decision-makers need to investigate the scale and determinants of vaccine hesitancy in each setting; so that tailored and targeted strategies can be developed to address it.","output":"Vaccine hesitancy in the era of COVID-19: could lessons from the past help in divining the future?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and dengue virus has not been previously reported.

We studied various statistical properties of the -PRRA- insertion at the RNA level (CCUCGGCGGGCA). The nucleotide composition and codon usage of this sequence are different from the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. One of such features is two tandem CGG codons, although the CGG codon is the rarest codon in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This suggests that the insertion sequence could cause ribosome pausing as the result of these rare codons. Due to population variants, the Nextstrain divergence measure of the CCU codon is extremely large. We cannot exclude that this divergence might affect host immune responses/effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, possibilities awaiting further investigation. Our experimental studies show that the expression level of original RNA sequence \\"wildtype\\" spike protein is much lower than for codon-optimized spike protein in all studied cell lines. Interestingly, the original spike sequence produces a higher titer of pseudoviral particles and a higher level of infection. Further mutagenesis experiments suggest that this dual-effect insert, comprised of a combination of overlapping translation pausing and furin sites, has allowed SARS-CoV-2 to infect its new host (human) more readily. This underlines the importance of ribosome pausing to allow efficient regulation of protein expression and also of cotranslational subdomain folding.","output":"The Functional Consequences of the Novel Ribosomal Pausing Site in SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nematodes are among the most diverse and abundant metazoans on Earth, but research on them has been biased toward parasitic taxa and model organisms. Free-living nematodes, particularly from the clades Enoplia and Dorylaimia, have been underrepresented in genome-scale phylogenetic analyses to date, leading to poor resolution of deep relationships within the phylum. RESULTS: We supplemented publicly available data by sequencing transcriptomes of nine free-living nematodes and two important outgroups and conducted a phylum-wide phylogenomic analysis including a total of 108 nematodes. Analysis of a dataset generated using a conservative orthology inference strategy resulted in a matrix with a high proportion of missing data and moderate to weak support for branching within and placement of Enoplia. A less conservative orthology inference approach recovered more genes and resulted in higher support for the deepest splits within Nematoda, recovering Enoplia as the sister taxon to the rest of Nematoda. Relationships within major clades were similar to those found in previously published studies based on 18S rDNA. CONCLUSIONS: Expanded transcriptome sequencing of free-living nematodes has contributed to better resolution among deep nematode lineages, though the dataset is still strongly biased toward parasites. Inclusion of more free-living nematodes in future phylogenomic analyses will allow a clearer understanding of many interesting aspects of nematode evolution, such as morphological and molecular adaptations to parasitism and whether nematodes originated in a marine or terrestrial environment.

Restart and recovery processes will be influenced by the need to protect patients and staff from disease transmission, but data on the risk of COVID-19 transmission after endoscopy are sparse. This is of particular importance in later pandemic phases when the risk of harm from delayed or missed significant diagnoses is likely to far outweigh the risk of infection. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidance for restarting endoscopy included stratification of diagnostic procedures according to aerosol generation or assessment of infectious risk as well as pragmatic guidance on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). We sought to document the risk of COVID-19 transmission after endoscopy in this 'COVID-minimised' environment. Prospective data were collected from 18 UK centres for n=6208 procedures, with follow-up telephone assessment of patients at 7 and 14 days. No cases of COVID-19 were documented by any centre after endoscopy in either patients or staff, with 3/2611 (0.11%) asymptomatic patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab testing pre-endoscopy. While these data cannot determine the relative contribution of each component of a COVID-minimised pathway, they provide clear support for such an approach, are reassuring and should aid planning for outpatient diagnostics in the COVID-19 recovery phase.","output":"A multi-centre prospective study of COVID-19 transmission following outpatient Gastrointestinal Endoscopy in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a cross-sectional study, impact of management in dairy farms on calf mortality rates and prevalence of rotavirus and Cryptosporidium parvum in feces of calves was investigated.

We performed in-person interviews and fecal specimens in samples of all-female calves of age 7 up to 21 days. Management data were documented on farm level. A Multiscreen Ag-ELISA was performed to determine rotavirus and Cryptosporidium parvum. Associations between two calf mortality rates, detection of C. parvum and rotavirus, and predictors were examined with GLM models. In farms with routine vaccination against respiratory diseases, 31-days mortality rate was 4.2% +/-1.26 compared to 7.6% +/-0.97 (p = 0.040) on non-vaccinating farms. Six-months mortality was lower in farms that continued feeding milk to calves during periods of diarrhea compared to farms that did not (6.9% +/-0.8 vs. 12.4% +/-2.3). In case of a routine shifting of calves from the calving box into calf boxes less C. parvum was detected compared to an individual moving of calves (33.3% +/-2.6 vs. 19.6% +/-5.3; p = 0.024). Our model confirms a positive association between occurrence of aqueous feces and frequency of detection of C. parvum (45.4% +/-23.6 vs. 21.4% +/-18.7; p < 0.001).

Data were from the HABITAT study (Australia). We analysed data from three survey waves (2007, 2009, 2011) using multilevel logistic regression stratified by gender (n = 7758). Findings indicate that having dependent children was associated with bicycling for transportation and recreation in contrasting ways for men and women. The odds of bicycling were higher in men with 2 children aged under 18y than men without children (transportation: OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.26, 2.98; recreation: OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.67, 3.37). Over time, the odds of recreational bicycling were lower in women with 2 children than women without children (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.93).

Blood was taken from 32 infants during primary RSV bronchiolitis and three months later. Using flow cytometry, we found that absolute numbers of both CD3+/CD4+ T-helper lymphocytes (P = 0029) and CD3+/CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) (P = 0043) were significantly reduced during acute infection. Up-regulated expression both of Fas (P < 0001) and tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor (P < 0001) was found during acute illness on both CD3+/CD4+ and CD3+/CD8+ lymphocytes, when compared with convalescent samples. Expression of Fas on CD4+ lymphocytes was inversely related to CD4+ number (P = 003). Plasma levels of soluble Fas ligand (P = 0028) and caspase-1 (P = 0037), determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were increased during bronchiolitis. Plasma interleukin-18, a product of caspase-1 activity, was not raised.

The present survey was thus conducted to assess the knowledge, risk perception, attitude, and preparedness of the dentists in India about COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out among registered dentists in India. A self-administered, anonymous, questionnaire comprising of 25 closeended questions was circulated to gather the relevant information. A total of 765 dentists submitted a response, out of which 646 complete responses were included in the statistical analysis. Pearsons Chi-square test was used for inter-group statistical comparison. Results: The majority (80.8%) of the dentists had a fair knowledge about the characteristics of COVID-19. Nearly 60.7% and 49.7% of the dentists had taken infection control training and special training for COVID-19, respectively. Nearly 50% of the dentists had the perception that COVID-19 is very dangerous. Only 41.8% of the dentists were willing to provide emergency services to patients. Most of the dentists had an opinion that there is a need to enhance personal protective measures. During the survey, it was found that varied technological advances are offered to dentists to ensure good clinical practice. They also concurred that there was a need to standardize the tools and measures available to carry out dental practices. Conclusion: In the present study, Indian dentists have presented satisfactory knowledge with adequate preparedness as the majority of them had a fair level of knowledge with significantly higher knowledge among female respondents and those with post-graduation studies.

Methods: A cohort of patients with confirmed COVID-19 (ICD10 diagnosis code or positive PCR or antigen test result) were identified within a large US electronic health record (EHR) dataset (Optum, Inc.) during the time period Feb 1, 2020 through Oct 14, 2020. From these, we identified RA patients (ICD10 RA diagnosis code) with treatment (most recent of JAK inhibitor [JAKi], biologic [bDMARD] or conventional synthetic [csDMARD] only) within the 12 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis (i.e., index). The primary outcome was any hospitalization on or within 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression models compared users of JAKi's to non-TNFi bDMARDs and csDMARDs (separately), as well as users of TNFi's to non-TNFi bDMARDS and csDMARDs (separately), and were adjusted for age, gender, index month and baseline corticosteroid use.

In multivariable-adjusted models, no differences in risk of hospitalization were found comparing JAKi users to csDMARD users (aOR=0.71;95% CI 0.37-1.36) or TNFi users to csDMARD users (aOR=0.67;95%CI 0.43-1.06). Compared to non-TNFi bDMARD users, JAKi use and TNFi use was associated with reduced risk of hospitalization (JAKi aOR=0.32;95%CI 0.14-0.71;TNFi aOR=0.34;95%CI 0.18-0.62). Age and corticosteroid use were positively associated with 30-day hospitalization in all models. Results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main findings. Conclusion: In this study, roughly a quarter of RA patients with recent DMARD treatment were hospitalized within 30 days after COVID diagnosis. Patients treated with JAKi and TNFi therapies experienced the lowest risk of hospitalization, with risk of hospitalization significantly lower than non-TNFi bDMARDs. However, recent therapy recorded in the EHR may not reflect exposure at time of COVID-19 diagnosis and small sample size per treatment may limit interpretation.","output":"Real world population-based assessment of COVID-19 outcomes among rheumatoid arthritis patients using biologic or synthetic DMARDs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In December 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown cause were announced in Wuhan, China The causative agent of pneumonia was identified as coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Purpose To evaluate the usefulness of computed thoracic tomography (CT) and postero anterior (PA) thoracic radiography in patients with COVID-19 Material and Methods Between March and June 2020, the patients who arrived at our hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed Thorax CT findings of the 281 patients (142 females and 139 males;age range 3C91 years) with positive PCR tests were evaluated Lesions in the lung parenchyma were examined according to their number, localization, and distribution PA chest radiograms were classified into two groups, positive and negative for the lung parenchymal lesions Results Of the total 281 patients with PCR-positive COVID-19, CT examinations were normal in 107 (38 1%), and positive CT findings for pneumonia were found in 174 patients (61 9%) Bilateral involvement was observed in 100 (57 5%) of the 174 patients with positive CT findings, and unilateral involvement was observed in 74 (42 5%) of them According to the localization of the lesions, peripheral subpleural distribution occurred in 160 of the 174 patients (91 9) The most common lesion was the ground glass opacities (GGO) In 77 of 281 PCR-positive patients (27 4), pulmonary lesions were found on PA chest radiograms Conclusion The presence of bilateral posterior subpleural GGO, nodule, and consolidation in thoracic CT are significant in terms of COVID-19 pneumonia","output":"Chest computed tomographic findings of patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we analyze a stochastic coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic model which is perturbed by both white noise and telegraph noise incorporating general incidence rate.

Existing methods such as single-cell genomics, lacking a spatial context, and traditional immunofluorescence, capturing only 2-6 molecular features, cannot resolve these issues. Imaging technologies have been developed to address these problems, but each possesses limitations that constrain widespread use. Here we report a new method that overcomes major impediments to highly multi-plex tissue imaging. Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity (IBEX) uses an iterative staining and chemical bleaching method to enable high resolution imaging of >65 parameters in the same tissue section without physical degradation. IBEX can be employed with various types of conventional microscopes and permits use of both commercially available and user-generated antibodies in an open system to allow easy adjustment of staining panels based on ongoing marker discovery efforts. We show how IBEX can also be used with amplified staining methods for imaging strongly fixed tissues with limited epitope retention and with oligonucleotide-based staining, allowing potential cross-referencing between flow cytometry, Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq), and IBEX analysis of the same tissue. To facilitate data processing, we provide an open source platform for automated registration of iterative images. IBEX thus represents a technology that can be rapidly integrated into most current laboratory workflows to achieve high content imaging to reveal the complex cellular landscape of diverse organs and tissues. Significance Statement Single cell flow cytometry and genomic methods are rapidly increasing our knowledge of the diversity of cell types in metazoan tissues. However, suitably robust methods for placing these cells in a spatial context that reveal how their localization and putative interactions contribute to tissue physiology and pathology are still lacking. Here we provide a readily accessible pipeline (IBEX) for highly multi-plex immunofluorescent imaging that enables a fine-grained analysis of cells in their tissue context. Additionally, we describe extensions of the IBEX workflow to handle hard to image tissue preparations and a method to facilitate direct integration of the imaging data with flow cytometry and sequencing technologies.","output":"IBEX C A versatile multi-plex optical imaging approach for deep phenotyping and spatial analysis of cells in complex tissues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As winter is knocking the door, the risk of respiratory tract infection is increasing at present scenario due to no prophylaxis of Covid-19.

A vaccine is like many other outcomes if the vaccine would be available; we cannot say about the effectiveness of the vaccine. Several drugs are testing to save the people life from pandemic; azithromycin is one of them. This work is a review article with the updated findings of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19. The option of azithromycin with regards to COVID-19 is justified by its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-fibrotic effects and their pharmacokinetic properties, leading to effective concentrations in the target tissue. Azithromycin tends to be an effective candidate for SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibition that block the initial stage of the viral life cycle. Clinical trials at a preliminary scale and final stage show the significant results of azithromycin in supportive care therapy. Azithromycin was an early candidate for the medication of Covid-19 with or without hydroxychloroquine. It is exercised mostly as an outpatient antibiotic in COVID-19. In summing-up, any primary anti-viral and antibiotic treatment is not the only possibility of fighting COVID-19 pharmacologically. It will be an injustice with them who require broader spectrum antibiotic if we do not exercise azithromycin to them.

In response, numerous universities have seen a growing trend towards online learning scenarios. Thus, learning takes place not just within a person, but within and across the networks. However, the current implementations of open learning scenarios are facing many challenges, including: a) there is no systematic feature to track, evaluate and report the online learning activities of students;b) lack of immediacy and personal feedback;and c) lack of self-reflection. Consequently, Learning Analytics (LA) is one of the most distinguished solutions to address these challenges. In this study, the two kinds of LA dashboard, behavioral and cognitive, have been investigated. The methodological approach taken in this investigation was adopted from a design-based research framework, which blends empirical educational research with the theory-driven design of online learning environments. The initial sample consisted of 320 undergraduate nursing students. The cohort was divided into two groups according to the two types of LA dashboard. The findings have argued that behavioral dashboards took precedence over data evaluation items, while cognitive dashboards had the advantage in achieving the goals of LA C e.g., awareness, self-reflection, and impact on learning process.

Prior to the development of the rash, he had received 4 cycles of combination therapy with pemetrexed, carboplatin, and pembrolizumab, followed by 2 cycles of pembrolizumab monotherapy. On physical examination, violaceous scaly erythema grouped on his scalp and upper extremities. Histologically, the scalp lesions demonstrated irregular acanthosis that formed a characteristic saw-tooth appearance with hypergranulosis and typical lichenoid tissue reaction. These findings suggested that the scalp lesions were lichen planus. Two-week administration of topical corticosteroid dramatically improved the rash. Immunotherapy with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, can induce T-cell activation that results in various immune-related adverse effects such as lichenoid tissue reaction. However, lichen planus is generally found on the extremities and/or oral mucosa, and unlike in this case, the scalp is rarely affected. Although the exact mechanism underlying predominant scalp involvement is unknown, the present case indicates that anti-PD-1 therapy-induced lichen planus can develop not only on the extremities and oral mucosa but also on the scalp. Interestingly, the lesions were not induced by the combination of chemotherapy and pembrolizumab; rather, they occurred soon after initiation of pembrolizumab monotherapy. In the present case, pembrolizumab-induced T-cell activation which triggered lichenoid tissue reaction may have been suppressed by chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression.

This paper presents an advanced empirical framework for the need-based approach to health workforce planning with an open-access simulation tool in Microsoft(?) Excel to facilitate real-life health workforce planning in countries. Two fundamental mathematical models are used to quantify the supply of, and need for, health professionals, respectively. The supply-side model is based on a stock-and-flow process, and the need-side model extents a previously published analytical frameworks using the population health needs-based approach. We integrate the supply and need analyses by comparing them to establish the gaps in both absolute and relative terms, and then explore their cost implications for health workforce policy and strategy. To illustrate its use, the model was used to simulate a real-life example using midwives and obstetricians/gynaecologists in the context of maternal and new-born care in Ghana. Sensitivity analysis showed that if a constant level of health was assumed (as in previous works), the need for health professionals could have been underestimated in the long-term.

Despite the positive results in different pathologies through musculoskeletal physiotherapy, there are few reports in post-COVID-19 patients. This case describes an intervention based on musculoskeletal physiotherapy in a post-COVID-19 adult woman with physical sequelae. METHODS As part of an initial evaluation in a woman with physical sequelaes post-COVID-19, it was decided to conduct a musculoskeletal physiotherapy over a course of 5 weeks distributed in 15 visits. To evaluate her progress the joint ranges were evaluated according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS), the Numerical pain scale was used, the muscle strength evaluated according to the Daniel Scale, and finally the Unipodal Station Test used. RESULTS Musculoskeletal physiotherapy improved the patient's physical symptoms. The patient's pain was reduced from a value of 10 to 3; the strength of the musculature increased from a value of 2 to 4; initial joint ranges were expanded from 67% to 100% in various body segments. Finally, the woman managed to stay up to 8 s in the monopodal position. DISCUSSION Using musculoskeletal physical therapy and measuring progress through quantitative measurements at each visit, a post-COVID-19 woman was able to resume her daily physical activities.

JAKs are important signaling mediators of many proinflammatory cytokines and represent compelling pharmacological targets for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Pan-acting small-molecule JAK inhibitors were approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. However, their limited selectivity among JAK members have led to undesirable side effects, driving a search toward specific JAK inhibitors. Recently, TYK2 has emerged as a target of choice for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and severe COVID-19 with an optimum balance between efficacy and safety, based on observations from human genetics studies and clinical outcomes of several agents targeting cytokine pathways for which TYK2 plays an essential role. In this article, we address selective targeting of TYK2 from the genetic sequence space through development of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against TYK2 mRNA. Potent ASO candidates were identified from the screening of over 200 ASOs using locked nucleic acid gapmer design. The lead ASOs exhibited potent and selective knockdown of TYK2 mRNA and protein across a panel of model human cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, showing no reduction in the mRNA and protein expression levels of other JAK paralogs. In agreement with the depletion of TYK2 proteins, several TYK2-mediated cytokine signaling pathways, including IFN-&#945; and IL-12, were inhibited upon ASO treatment. Our results established the TYK2 ASOs as investigational tool compound and potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and severe COVID-19.","output":"Potent and Selective Knockdown of Tyrosine Kinase 2 by Antisense Oligonucleotides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health care providers and their legal counsel play pivotal roles in preparing for and responding to public health emergencies.

Inflammation and decrease in vascularization are key factors in the degeneration of articular cartilage and the associated pain and decrease in function. To combat this process, the use of biologics including umbilical cord-derived Whartons Jelly (UC-derived WJ) has grown. UC-derived WJ contains large quantities of regenerative factors, including growth factors (GFs), cytokines (CKs), hyaluronic acid (HA), and extracellular vesicles (EVs). The proposed study evaluates the safety and efficacy of intraarticular injection of UC-derived WJ for treatment of knee OA symptoms. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, prospective study in which the safety and efficacy of intraarticular UC-derived WJ in patients suffering from grade II/III OA will be assessed. Twelve patients with grade II/III OA who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited for this study which will be conducted at up to two sites within the USA. The participants will be followed for 1 s. Participants will be assessed using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), 36-item short form survey (SF-36), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), physical exams, plain radiography, and Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score for improvements in pain, satisfaction, function, and cartilage regeneration. DISCUSSION: This prospective study will contribute to the limited amount of data on UC-derived WJ, particularly with regard to its safety and efficacy.

This study assessed the effect of HT on sarcopenia in postmenopausal women. METHODS: The present study included 4,254 postmenopausal women who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys from 2008 to 2011. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by weight (ASM/Wt) and the prevalence of sarcopenia were analyzed in groups of women stratified by duration of HT use. RESULTS: ASM/Wt was higher and the prevalence of sarcopenia was lower in participants with a history of prolonged (13 mo) HT use than in participants with a shorter duration of HT use or no HT use. After adjusting for multiple confounding factors, prolonged use of HT remained significantly associated with estimated mean ASM/Wt and the prevalence of sarcopenia (odds ratio: 0.60; 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.88; P = 0.01). In addition, the prevalence of sarcopenia was linearly associated with history of hypertension, duration of hypertension, physical activity, and duration of HT use. Subgroup analysis showed that the association between duration of HT use and the prevalence of sarcopenia was maintained in younger (<65 y old) and leaner (body mass index <25 kg/m(2)) postmenopausal women.

Left untreated, athymia is fatal within 1-2 years. It can be successfully treated by thymus transplantation, using cultured thymic tissue obtained from infant donors when necessarily removed during cardiac surgery. In Europe, thymus transplantation is only offered at our centre. Following increased awareness and progressive international implementation of newborn screening (NBS) for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), we received a record number of referrals in 2020. Significant restrictions on worldwide travel and reallocation of healthcare resources during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the temporary interruption of international admissions. In order to facilitate the timely admission for this life-saving treatment, we developed a modified care pathway (MCP) to address the challenges identified at local, national and international levels. Objectives Optimisation of resource allocation to prevent negative impacts of delayed treatment in athymic infants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued delivery of high quality, complex patient care and positive patient experience through a MCP. Methods We conducted a service evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the MCP and the impact on time-to-admission for transplantation. We completed short interviews with accompanying parents and referring clinicians to survey their experience of the thymus transplantation programme during the pandemic. Results With the support of our Trust and NHS England, a MCP was agreed and implemented to ensure safe transfer, admission and repatriation. We regularly amended our admission protocol to reflect the evolving local and national infection prevention control (IPC) policies. We gained adherence from all referring teams and families, while observing the local requirements of the referring teams in 6 European countries and New Zealand. Due to the limited access to donor tissue, secondary to reduced elective cardiac surgery, admissions required optimised coordination between multidisciplinary teams to allow for thymus transplantation within 20 days of donor tissue collection and culture. From May 2020 to March 2021, 10 patients underwent thymus transplantation, reflecting a 50% increase in activity on previous years. The average time for referral-admission was 5 months. 4 patients were identified by NBS in their respective countries and in line with current SCID management guidelines, 2 of them were transplanted by the age of 4 months. One patient tested positive for SARS-CoV2 on return to their home country and made a full recovery. This prompted further changes in our transfer guidance and local IPC practice. Parental interviews highlighted anxieties around international travel, restricted hospital access for the second parent and non-aligned IPC practices in comparison with referring centres. Equally, they accepted and embraced the additional restrictions in order to access their child's essential and only, treatment option. Conclusions Upon prompt identification of challenges and risks to treatment delay for athymic infants during the COVID-19 pandemic, we overcame them in collaboration with referring centres, multi-disciplinary hospital teams and the patient families, resulting in the successful delivery of a record number of thymus transplant procedures following a MCP, maximising the opportunity for improved long-term outcomes.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of The European thymus transplantation programme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The analysis involved thermograms of the lower limbs of a patient suffering from symptomatic L-S segment discopathy with spinal root compression syndrome (symptomatic lumbar discopathy) qualified for surgical treatment.

Unlike the human, the rats had a single major septal artery arising from the proximal part of the left coronary artery (n = 30) or right coronary artery (n = 20). There were three branching patterns of left circumflex artery (LCX): 33 (66%) had LCX branching peripherally from a long left main coronary artery (LMCA), while the remainder 17 (34%) had the LCX branching from the proximal part of the septal artery or a short LMCA. The rats with distal coronary ligation presented myocardial infarction localized to an anterior territory irrespective of LCX branching pattern. In the rats with proximal coronary ligation, 64% (n = 16) had broad myocardial infarction involving the anterior and lateral territories, while the remainder (36%, n = 9) had myocardial infarction localized to an anterior territory with the intact LCX arising proximally from a short LMCA. The interventricular septum was spared from infarction in all rats because of its anatomical location. Infarct size variations were caused not only by ligation site but also by varying LCX branching patterns. There are potential risks to create different sizes of myocardial infarction, particularly when targeting a broad range of myocardial infarction.

In this pilot study, we explore SEOP in gas mixtures with up to 45% 4He content under a wide range of experimental conditions. When an aluminum jacket cooling/heating design was employed (GEN-3 hyperpolarizer), 129Xe polarization (%PXe) of 55.9  0.9% was observed with mono-exponential build-up rate SEOP of 0.049  0.001 min-1 for the 4He-rich mixture (1000 Torr Xe/900 Torr He, 100 Torr N2), compared to %PXe of 49.3  3.3% at SEOP of 0.035  0.004 min-1 for the N2-rich gas mixture (1000 Torr Xe/100 Torr He, 900 Torr N2). When forced-air cooling/heating was used (GEN-2 hyperpolarizer), %PXe of 83.9  2.7% was observed at SEOP of 0.045  0.005 min-1 for the 4He-rich mixture (1000 Torr Xe/900 Torr He, 100 Torr N2), compared to %PXe of 73.5  1.3% at SEOP of 0.028  0.001 min-1 for the N2-rich gas mixture (1000 Torr Xe and 1000 Torr N2).

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women that usually involves phenotypically diverse populations of breast cancer cells and an heterogeneous stroma. In recent years, automated microscopy technologies are allowing the study of live cells over extended periods of time, simplifying the task of compiling large image databases. For instance, there have been several studies oriented towards building machine learning systems capable of automatically classifying images of different cell types (i.e. motor neurons, stem cells). In this work we were interested in classifying breast cancer cells as live or dead, based on a set of automatically retrieved morphological characteristics using image processing techniques. Our hypothesis is that live-dead classification can be performed without any staining and using only bright-field images as input. We tackled this problem using the JIMT-1 breast cancer cell line that grows as an adherent monolayer. First, a vast image set composed by JIMT-1 human breast cancer cells that had been exposed to a chemotherapeutic drug treatment (doxorubicin and paclitaxel) or vehicle control was compiled. Next, several classifiers were trained based on well-known convolutional neural networks (CNN) backbones to perform supervised classification using labels obtained from fluorescence microscopy images associated with each bright-field image. Model performances were evaluated and compared on a large number of bright-field images. The best model reached an AUC = 0.941 for classifying breast cancer cells without treatment. Furthermore, it reached AUC = 0.978 when classifying breast cancer cells under drug treatment. Our results highlight the potential of machine learning and computational image analysis to build new diagnosis tools that benefit the biomedical field by reducing cost, time, and stimulating work reproducibility. More importantly, we analyzed the way our classifiers clusterize bright-field images in the learned high-dimensional embedding and linked these groups to salient visual characteristics in live-dead cell biology observed by trained experts.","output":"Learning deep features for dead and living breast cancer cell classification without staining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the ongoing acute Covid-19 pandemic, the study presented here investigated whether Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) with Riboflavin (vitamin B2) and a specially designed Laser/LED treatment kit can be used to treat patients with Covid-19 at early disease stages.

AVH's preparedness measures enabled its agile response. These proactive and innovative preparedness measures included: implementing a facility-level preparedness and response plan; utilizing multidisciplinary team-based and evidence-informed approaches to decision making; prioritizing health workers' safety and education; establishing in-house PCR testing to scale up timely screenings; and accommodating health workers, patients, and their relatives at hospital hotels, to maintain daily, continuous and critical health care for cancer patients and limit the spread of infection. At the facility-level, the biggest challenge faced by AVH was continuing essential and daily care for immunocompromised patients while protecting them from potential infection from relatives, hospital staff and other suspected patients. At the national level, the lack of preparedness, inequalities in vaccine distribution, political instability, violence, delays in obtaining medical exit permits to reach Jerusalem, weakened AVH's response.

Previous studies have attempted to analyse factors influencing length of stay in mental health units, focussing mostly on patient factors. These models fail to sufficiently explain the variation in duration of inpatient stay. We assess how the type of service delivered by a trust, in addition to patient factors, influences length of stay. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case cohort study in a large inner-city NHS mental health trust for all admissions in a 1 month period. Data was gathered from electronic notes of 105 patients. Descriptive univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted on the data, with multiple regression analysis conducted on statistically significant data. RESULTS: Short-stay assessment ward admission significantly reduced length of stay. Patients under outpatients or under care co-ordination, admitted through Mental Health Act assessment and formally detained all had longer length of stay. Out of area admissions, locum Consultant care, changing Responsible Clinician and ward transfers all led to longer length of stay. Factors indicating more severe illness such as increased observation level and polypharmacy, as well as diagnoses of psychosis or bipolar disorder were associated with longer duration of stay. Discharges requiring referral to accommodation or rehabilitation led to longer stays. The most significant factors that influenced length of stay were higher observation levels, diagnosis of psychotic illness or bipolar, and discharge to rehabilitation placement. The final model, taking into account all these factors, was able to account for 59.6% of the variability in length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: The study backs up existing literature which shows patient-factors have an influence on length of stay. The study also demonstrates that service-level factors have an impact on the duration of stay. This data may be used to inform further studies which may aid provision of inpatient and community services in the future.","output":"Patient and service-level factors affecting length of inpatient stay in an acute mental health service: a retrospective case cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic Caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), this infection may remain asymptomatic The European Society of Medical Oncology and the Portuguese Health Authority recommended both a symptomatic survey and laboratory testing in all cancer patients (pts) undergoing immunosuppressive treatment (IT) The impact of this measure is still unknown We report our experience in a Portuguese center Methods: Since March 2020, a symptomatic survey has been performed at our institution before each hospital visit From April 6 through May 8, 2020, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 testing was added on cancer pts before undergoing IT The impact of this intervention was evaluated comparing the hospitalization rate of cancer pts due to COVID-19, before and after the introduction of RT-PCR testing Retrospective analysis of clinical data was performed Results: 444 tests were carried out on 244 pts and laboratory SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 11 (5%);5 were male, with a median age of 65 years [34-76] Breast and colorectal cancer were prevalent;2 pts had lung cancer;6 advanced disease Ongoing IT in these pts was temporarily suspended: 9 pts under chemotherapy, 1 atezolizumab and 1 rituximab Only 1 patient was symptomatic (9%) and previously hospitalized No admission due to COVID-19 was registered in this group Since March 7, 179 pts were admitted due to COVID-19 at our center: 12 were active cancer pts (6 7%) of which 4 were under IT 6 of the oncological pts passed away, all of them had advanced diseases, 1 was under IT Of the dead pts, lung and breast tumors were prevalent Among all COVID-19 hospitalizations, the prevalence of pts under IT was similar before and after the implementation of the RT-PCR testing (2 2% vs 2 4%) Conclusions: We found a significant percentage of active cancer pts diagnosed with asymptomatic COVID-19 Due to the small sample size of COVID-19 pts under IT, it is difficult to evaluate the impact of RT-PCR testing However, on a long-term analysis, this intervention may reduce the risk of severe complications related to COVID-19 in cancer pts Health education and dynamic organization are also important measures Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors Funding: Has not received any funding Disclosure: All authors have declared no conflicts of interest","output":"Impact assessment of SARS-CoV-2 testing on cancer patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple small- to middle-scale cities, mostly located in northern China, became epidemic hotspots during the second wave of the spread of COVID-19 in early 2021. Despite qualitative discussions of potential social-economic causes, it remains unclear how this unordinary pattern could be substantiated with quantitative explanations. Through the development of an urban epidemic hazard index (EpiRank) for Chinese prefectural districts, we came up with a mathematical explanation for this phenomenon. The index is constructed via epidemic simulations on a multi-layer transportation network interconnecting local SEIR transmission dynamics, which characterizes intra- and inter-city population flow with a granular mathematical description. Essentially, we argue that these highlighted small towns possess greater epidemic hazards due to the combined effect of large local population and small inter-city transportation. The ratio of total population to population outflow could serve as an alternative city-specific indicator of such hazards, but its effectiveness is not as good as EpiRank, where contributions from other cities in determining a specific citys epidemic hazard are captured via the network approach. Population alone and city GDP are not valid signals for this indication. The proposed index is applicable to different epidemic settings and can be useful for the risk assessment and response planning of urban epidemic hazards in China.

We describe challenges encountered while undertaking an SLR on comorbidities and COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: Using PRISMA guidelines and pre-specified criteria, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were searched on December 7, 2020 to identify studies that included epidemiology, healthcare resource utilization, and mortality related to COVID-19 among patients with either asthma or COPD. Studies were not restricted by language. Preprints and s were excluded. Results: 258 full-text articles reported COVID-19-related outcomes at the cut-off date. Several challenges were identified during the analysis of this SLR. Firstly, differing definitions and identification of relevant populations exist both when identifying COVID-19 through RT-PCR (RT-PCR: n=218;not-specified: n=40), but more commonly when identifying comorbidities. A limited number of studies (14/258) reported clinically confirmed diagnoses of asthma or COPD through primary care records;chart reviews (n=146) were most often used to identify comorbidities. It was not possible to account for geographic differences in definitions of comorbidities. These differing definitions relates to the quality of studies, with a minority using established databases/registries (n=54) and a majority being retrospective, single-center studies (n=110). Secondly, significant heterogeneity in the COVID-19 population existed with patients identified as hospitalized (n=135) or as ICU admissions (n=12);specifically pediatric (n=7) or elderly (n=6);others as testing COVID-19 positive (n=49). Thirdly, many studies collected data from the start of the pandemic within their region despite an evolution in best practices. Finally, the rapidity of COVID-19 research, with number of studies doubling over 6 months, immediately outdates any analysis. Conclusions: Challenges exist when evaluating COVID-19 research.

Pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone in RRMM has demonstrated significant activity and improvement in progression-free survival in LEN-refractory patients (Richardson et al Lancet Oncol 2019 Jun;20(6):781-794). Ixazomib is a novel oral proteasome inhibitor (PI) that is currently approved in combination with LEN and dexamethasone in RRMM. Ixazomib is administered on a once weekly schedule and its oral route of administration is particularly attractive, not least in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Twice weekly dosing of ixazomib has been studied in combination with LEN demonstrating promising activity in NDMM (Richardson et al, Br J Haematol. 2018 Jul;182(2):231-244). Moreover, safety and efficacy has been shown in RRMM as twice weekly monotherapy on this schedule (Richardson et al, Blood 2014 Aug 14;124(7):1038-46). We hypothesized that a twice weekly ixazomib schedule in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone will lead to enhanced efficacy and comparable safety in RRMM. Methods: This is a phase I/II multicenter, single-arm, open label study evaluating the combination of twice weekly ixazomib with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in RRMM. Primary objective for phase I portion is to determine safety and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of this combination using a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. Ixazomib is studied at doses of 3mg or 4mg on days 1, 4, 8, 11, pomalidomide at a dose of 2mg, 3mg and 4mg on days 1-14 and dexamethasone is administered at a dose of 12mg on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12 (8mg for patients > 75 years old) on a 21 day cycle (Table 1). Patients were included if they received 2 prior lines of therapy, but 1 prior line was allowed if first line treatment included a PI and an immunomodulatory agent and disease relapse occurred within 60 days of last therapy. Patients who received prior ixazomib were excluded. Results: At the time of data cutoff, 12 patients have been enrolled across cohorts 0, 1 and 2 and enrollment in the final cohort 3 is ongoing. Median age at the time of enrollment was 70 years old with slight male predominance (58%). ISS stage at diagnosis was II or greater in 75% of patients and 9 out of 12 (75%) patients had high-risk FISH as follows: del 17p (17%), gain 1q (50%), and t(4;14) (8%). Median prior lines of therapy was 2 (range 1-3) with 100% of patients having prior treatment with lenalidomide and 92% with prior bortezomib. Forty-two percent of patients had a prior autologous stem cell transplant. Most common treatment-related toxicities were mainly low grade and included neutropenia (58%), hyperglycemia (42%), fatigue (33%), anemia (25%), thrombocytopenia (25%), and rash (25%). Grade 3 or greater toxicities included neutropenia (17%), anemia (8%), bacterial lung infection (8%), and atrial fibrillation (8%). There was 1 dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in cohort 2 due to lung infection necessitating a delay in initiation of cycle 2 and no further DLTs have been noted. Dose reductions occurred in 4 patients and predominantly involved dexamethasone due to weight gain, insomnia, atrial fibrillation and fatigue. There have been no discontinuations due to toxicity and no treatment related mortality at the time of data cutoff. In response evaluable patients, 5 out of 12 patients have demonstrated a partial response or better (42%), with 1 very good partial response (VGPR) and all patients at least achieving stable disease. Conclusions: Twice weekly ixazomib in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone is a generally well-tolerated regimen with promising early activity in a high-risk RRMM cohort. Maximal tolerated dose and recommend phase II dose has not yet been reached and this study continues to accrue robustly, reflecting in part the convenience and safety of an all oral approach in the current era of COVID-19. Moreover, the ability to perform remote laboratory testing, telemedicine visits and to send medications directly to patients has been an additional value-add to this trial.

DESIGN: We will use a 2 (Expectation: teach/test) x 2 (Instruction: analogy/explicit) x 2 (Posttest: high-pressure/low-pressure) mixed-factor design, with repeated measures on the last factor. METHODS: A minimum of 148 participants will be quasi-randomly assigned (based on sex) to one of four groups. Participants in the teach/analogy and teach/explicit groups will practice golf putting with the expectation of teaching putting to another participant, and analogy instructions or explicit instructions, respectively. Participants in the test/analogy and test/explicit groups will practice golf putting with the expectation of being tested on their putting, and analogy instructions or explicit instructions, respectively. The next day all participants will complete low- and high-pressure putting posttests, with their putting accuracy serving as the dependent variable.","output":"Does learning a skill with the expectation of teaching it impair the skills execution under psychological pressure if the skill is learned with analogy instructions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Full-thickness macular hole (FTMH) formation following rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) repair may limit post-operative visual acuity and often requires a return to the operating room, but little is known about this phenomenon. METHODS This study included all patients with a FTMH that developed after RRD repair from January 1, 2015-July 31, 2020. The main outcome was the rate of FTMH formation following RRD repair as well as characteristics of FTMH following RRD repair that spontaneously close. RESULTS There were 470 eyes with a diagnosis of both a FTMH and a RRD during the study period. Of these, 27 (0.28%) developed a FTMH following RRD repair. The median time to FTMH diagnosis was 91 days (25th, 75th quartiles 40, 204 days). The mean minimum hole diameter was 514.5  303.6 microns. There were 4 FTMHs (14.8%) that spontaneously closed without surgical intervention. The spontaneous closure was noted from 4 to 12 weeks after the initial diagnosis of the FTMH. These holes were smaller than the holes that did not close spontaneously (mean minimum diameter 161.8  85.2 vs 588.7  279.3 microns, p = 0.0058). Of the 27 post-operative FTMHs, there were 23 eyes (85%) that underwent surgical intervention with pars plana vitrectomy and internal limiting membrane peeling. Nineteen eyes (83%) closed with one surgery, 20 eyes (87%) ultimately closed, while 3 eyes (11.1%) did not close. CONCLUSIONS FTMH is relatively uncommon to occur following RRD repair with a prevalence of 0.28% in our series with 87% of these holes achieving closure following surgery or spontaneously. Approximately 15% of FTMHs following RRD repair closed spontaneously and these holes were significantly smaller.","output":"Full-thickness macular holes after surgical repair of primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachments: incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article investigates the response to the coronavirus crisis by Evangelical Christian nationalists in the USA.

A number of already approved and marketed drugs are being tested for repurposing, including Favipiravir. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19 patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We registered the protocol in the PROSPERO (CRD42020180032). All clinical trials which addressed the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in comparison to other control groups for treatment of patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 were included. We searched electronic databases including LitCovid/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Scientific Information Database up to 31 December 2020. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using Cochrane Collaboration criteria. All analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2, and the risk ratio index was calculated. Egger and Begg test was used for assessing publication bias. Nine studies were included in our meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis revealed a significant clinical improvement in the Favipiravir group versus the control group during seven days after hospitalization (RR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.41; P = 0.001). Viral clearance was more in 14 days after hospitalization in Favipiravir group than control group, but this finding marginally not significant (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.98-1.25; P = 0.094). Requiring supplemental oxygen therapy in the Favipiravir group was 7% less than the control group, (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.67-1.28; P = 0.664). Transferred to ICU and adverse events were not statistically different between two groups. The mortality rate in the Favipiravir group was approximately 30% less than the control group, but this finding not statistically significant. Favipiravir possibly exerted no significant beneficial effect in the term of mortality in the general group of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. We should consider that perhaps the use of antiviral once the patient has symptoms is too late and this would explain their low efficacy in the clinical setting.","output":"The efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has brought unprecedented disruptions to the global economies and has led to income loss and high unemployment rates. But scant, if any, evidence exists on gender gaps in economic outcomes such as income, expenditure, savings, and job loss in a multi-country setting. We investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on gender inequality in these outcomes using data from a six-country survey that covers countries in different geographical locations and at various income levels. Our findings suggest that women are 24 percent more likely to permanently lose their job than men because of the outbreak. Women also expect their labor income to fall by 50 percent more than men do. Perhaps because of these concerns, women tend to reduce their current consumption and increase savings. Factors such as the different participation rates in work industries for men and women may take an important part in explaining these gender gaps. Our estimates also point to country heterogeneity in these gender differences that is likely due to varying infection rates and shares of women in the labor force.","output":"Gender inequality during the COVID-19 pandemic: Income, expenditure, savings, and job loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humoral immunity is crucial for protection against invading pathogens. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) provide sterilizing immunity by targeting conserved regions of viral variants and represent the goal of most vaccination approaches. While antibodies can be selected to bind virtually any region of a given antigen, consistent induction of bnAbs in the context of influenza and HIV has been representing a major roadblock. Many possible explanations have been considered, however, none of the arguments proposed so far seems to fully recapitulate the observed counter-selection for broadly protective antibodies. Antibodies can influence antigen presentation by enhancing the processing of CD4 epitopes adjacent to the binding region while suppressing the overlapping ones. We analyzed the relative positioning of dominant B and T cell epitopes in published antigens that elicit strong and poor humoral responses. In strong immunogenic antigens, regions bound by immunodominant antibodies are frequently adjacent to CD4 epitopes, potentially boosting their presentation. Conversely, poorly immunogenic regions targeted by bnAbs in HIV and influenza overlap with clusters of dominant CD4 epitopes, potentially conferring an intrinsic disadvantage for bnAb-bearing B cells in germinal centers. Here we propose the theory of immunodominance relativity, according to which relative positioning of immunodominant B and CD4 epitopes within a given antigen drives immunodominance. Thus, we suggest that relative positioning of B-T epitopes may be one additional mechanism that cooperates with other previously described processes to influence immunodominance. If demonstrated, this theory can improve the current understanding of immunodominance, provide a novel explanation on HIV and influenza escape from humoral responses, and pave the way for new rational design of universal vaccines.","output":"Relative positioning of B and T cell epitopes drives immunodominance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemia is a highly dynamic situation characterized by therapeutic and logistic uncertainties.

This increases their risk of cardiovascular disease, premature mortality, diabetes-related complications and mental health problems. There is a paucity of research that has evaluated interventions aimed at reducing and breaking up sitting in people with T2DM. The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of delivering and evaluating a tailored intervention to reduce and break up sitting in ambulatory adults with T2DM. METHODS: This is a mixed-methods randomised controlled feasibility trial. Participants (n=70) with T2DM aged 18-85 years who sit 7 h/day and are able to ambulate independently will be randomly allocated to receive the REgulate your SItting Time (RESIT) intervention or usual care (control group) for 24 weeks. RESIT is a person-focused intervention that delivers a standardised set of behaviour change techniques to the participants, but the mode through which they are delivered can vary depending on the tools selected by each participant. The intervention includes an online education programme, health coach support, and a range of self-selected tools (smartphone apps, computer-prompt software, and wearable devices) that deliver behaviour change techniques such as self-monitoring of sitting and providing prompts to break up sitting. Measures will be taken at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. Eligibility, recruitment, retention and data completion rates will be used to assess trial feasibility. Sitting, standing and stepping will be measured using a thigh-worn activity monitor. Cardiometabolic health, physical function, psychological well-being, sleep and musculoskeletal symptoms will also be assessed. A process evaluation will be conducted including evaluation of intervention acceptability and fidelity. DISCUSSION: This study will identify the feasibility of delivering a tailored intervention to reduce and break up sitting in ambulatory adults with T2DM and evaluating it through a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. The findings will inform a fully powered RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.

Methods: Three methods for disinfection using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (group A), plasma circulation air sterilizer (group B), and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation plus plasma circulation air sterilizer (group C) were utilized to sanitize the air in the CT room dedicated to COVID-19 cases. Single-factor ANOVA was used to evaluate and compare the disinfection effect of the three air disinfection methods; an air microbial sampler was used to sample and measure the number of bacteria in the air of the machine room. Results: The number of bacteria in the air immediately after disinfection was significantly lower than before disinfection (p < 0.01). All three disinfection methods met the disinfection requirement. No significant differences in the number of air bacteria in the machine room immediately after disinfection were observed among the three methods (p > 0.05). In addition, the effect of disinfection after 2 h was compared, and the number of bacteria in group C after 2 h was significantly lower than that in group A and group B. Conclusions: All three disinfection methods have significant disinfection effects. In addition, using ultraviolet disinfection lamps combined with a plasma air disinfection machine to sterilize the air in CT machine room has the best disinfection effect for the longest duration. Therefore, we recommend the combined disinfection method (ultraviolet disinfection lamps plus plasma air disinfection), as well as formulating relevant disinfection management norms, which should thus be the method to use during pandemics.","output":"Effects of Different Methods of Air Disinfection of Computed Tomography Rooms Dedicated to COVID-19 Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is spreading all over Iran, and Kerman is one of the most affected cities. We conducted this study to predict COVID-19-related deaths, hospitalization, and infected cases under different scenarios (scenarios A, B, and C) by 31 December 2021 in Kerman. We also aimed to assess the impact of new COVID-19 variants and vaccination on the total number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations (scenarios D, E, and F) using the modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model. We calibrated the model using deaths reported from the start of the epidemic to August 30, 2021. A Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) uncertainty analysis was used to estimate 95% uncertainty intervals (UI). We also calculated the time-varying reproductive number (R(t)) following time-dependent methods. Under the worst-case scenario (scenario A; contact rate = 10, self\\\\isolation rate = 30%, and average vaccination shots per day = 5,000), the total number of infections by December 31, 2021, would be 1,625,000 (95% UI: 1,112,000C1,898,000) with 6,700 deaths (95% UI: 5,200C8,700). With the presence of alpha and delta variants without vaccine (scenario D), the total number of infected cases and the death toll were estimated to be 957,000 (95% UI: 208,000C1,463,000) and 4,500 (95% UI: 1,500C7,000), respectively. If 70% of the population were vaccinated when the alpha variant was dominant (scenario E), the total number of infected cases and deaths would be 608,000 (95% UI: 122,000C743,000) and 2,700 (95% UI: 700C4,000), respectively. The R(t) was 1 almost every day during the epidemic.

Therefore, two cases of individuals with DKA due to COVID-19 are presented in this study to inform other researchers about the details of this phenomenon. Material and Methods: Demographic characteristics, medical histories, physical examinations, laboratory investigations, real-time RT-PCR tests, computed tomography (CT) imaging studies, given treatments, clinical courses, and management outcomes were documented prospectively. Results: In the present experience, the manifestation of COVID-19 disease in the second case with a history of diabetes was more severe than in the first case. In the second case, with underlying diabetes and COVID-19, the DKA manifestation was associated with consciousness loss, severe restlessness, and respiratory distress;however, in the first case, with COVID-19 without diabetes, the DKA manifestation was associated with anorexia, weight loss, and lack of respiratory distress, which were milder symptoms than the second case.

Comparison between the percent change in IOS parameters as compared to reference standards and changes in actual IOS parameters was done to diagnose wheezing episodes. Methodology Three to six years old children with a history of fever, cough, cold, and/or breathlessness with noisy breathing and who were not on any regular medications, whose parents gave consent were recruited in the study. The children underwent an impulse oscillometry system examination as per the guidelines. The test was repeated after they were given nebulization by salbutamol (2.5 mg) (before COVID 19 pandemic).

METHODS: All adult acute medical admissions from the ED between 31(st) March to 31(st) July 2021 with valid ID NOW and RT-PCR results were included. The diagnostic accuracy of ID NOW (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) was calculated against the laboratory reference standard. Discrepant results were further explored using cycle threshold values (Ct) and clinical data. FINDINGS: 2.0% (124/6050) of medical admissions were SARS-CoV-2 positive on RT-PCR. Compared to PCR, ID NOW had a sensitivity and specificity of 83.1% (95% CI:75.4C88.7) and 99.5% (95% CI:99.3C99.6) respectively.

OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate the overall safety profile and incidence rate of AEs of special interest (AESIs), including serious infections and tuberculosis, in CT-P13-treated patients. METHODS: Data were pooled from six observational studies representing authorised indications of CT-P13 (ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, adult and paediatric Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis). Patients were analysed by indication and treatment (patients who received CT-P13 or those who switched from reference infliximab to CT-P13  6 months prior to enrolment or during the study). RESULTS: Overall, 4393 patients were included (n = 3677 CT-P13 group; n = 716 switched group); 64.03% of patients had inflammatory bowel disease and 6.31% of patients were antidrug antibody positive. Overall, 32.94% and 9.58% of patients experienced treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and treatment-emergent serious AEs, respectively. Across indications, TEAEs were more frequent with CT-P13 than with the switched group. Infections including tuberculosis were the most frequent serious AESI overall (2.48%) and by treatment group or indication. In total, 14 patients (0.32%) reported active tuberculosis. Overall incidence rates per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval) were 3.40 (2.788C4.096) for serious infections including tuberculosis and 0.44 (0.238C0.732) for active tuberculosis.

Expression of RCAN1, NF-B signaling pathway-related genes and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S-100 and acetylcholine (Ach) level, and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity were determined with neuron apoptosis detected to further explore the function of NF-B signaling pathway. RCAN1 could influence the development of HIBD. In the HIBD model, the expression of RCAN1 and NF-B-related genes increased, and NF-B p65 showed a significant nuclear shift. By activation of NF-B or overexpression of RCAN1, the number of neuronal apoptosis, S-100 protein level, and AchE level increased significantly, Ach activity decreased significantly, and GFAP positive cells increased. In addition, after the activation of NF-B or overexpression of RCAN1, the learning and memory ability of HIBD rats was inhibited. All the results show that activation of NF-B signaling pathway promotes RCAN1 expression, thus increasing neuronal apoptosis and aggravating cognitive impairment in HIBD rats.","output":"NF-B signaling pathway inhibition suppresses hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and cognitive impairment via RCAN1 in neonatal rats with hypoxic-ischemic brain damage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging viral diseases have increased in recent decades. In December 2019, an epidemic with low respiratory infections emerged in Wuhan, China. The disease, Covid-19 was found to be caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of October 14, 2021, WHO has confirmed greater than 239,000,000 global cases, nearly 5 million deaths worldwide, including greater than 720,000 in the USA. Fortunately, a vaccine has been approved and distributed, yet there are no approved therapeutics for infected individuals, and the threat of emerging vaccine-resistant strains remain. From advances in biotechnology, the genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2 is known. Three proteins are anchored in the viral envelope, Spike (S), Envelope (E), and Membrane (M), which is linked to the Nucleocapsid (N) protein connecting to the viral RNA genome. Our lab is developing an innovative therapy that delivers multiple therapeutic microRNAs to block the expression of distinct Covid viral proteins. The design of the anti-Covid microRNAs 1) mimics human microRNA cluster 17-92a structural stability, 2) forms guide-RNA substrates for the RNA induced silencing complex, and 3) are complementary to specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome without off-targets effects in the human genome. Twenty-one microRNA sequences were designed to target the S gene, six for N, two for M, and one for E. These were cloned into our microRNA-17-92 therapy vector which expresses six distinct anti-Covid RNA therapeutics simultaneously. We have transfected the S gene into our tissue culture model to measure the efficacy of the anti-Covid microRNA therapy to down-regulate the S gene expression. In our preliminary experiments we show a significant 2.5-fold reduction in the relative abundance of the Spike mRNA in the treated cells (p < 0.05). We are currently testing additional therapies and verifying changes in spike protein levels. Next steps are to examine the secondary structure of our RNA therapy using SHAPE-MAP to optimize RNA therapeutic stability in comparison to the stable structure based on the human gene, microRNA Cluster 17-92a.","output":"Anti-CovidMicroRNA Therapy Blocksthe Expression of the SpikeGeneof SARS-CoV-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current pandemic, testing continues to be the most important tool for monitoring and curbing the disease spread and early identification of the disease to perform health-related interventions like quarantine, contact tracing and etc. Therefore, the ability to verify the testing status is pertinent as public places prepare to safely open.

Objective We aimed to assess how mutations in RBD affected recognition of immune sera by antibodies induced by natural infection versus immunization with BNT162b2, a mRNA-based vaccine against COVID-19. Methods We produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants with single mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) region (E484K, K417N, N501Y) or with all 3 mutations combined, as occurring in the newly emerged variants B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil). Using standard and avidity ELISAs, we determined the binding capacities to mutant RBDs of antibodies induced by infection versus vaccination. Results These binding assays showed that vaccination induced antibodies recognize both wildtype and mutant RBDs with higher avidities than those raised by infection. Nevertheless, recognition of mutants RBDK417N and RBDN501Y was 2.5-3-fold reduced while RBDE484K and the triple mutant were 10-fold less well recognized, demonstrating that the mutation at position 484 was key for the observed loss in cross-reactivity. Conclusion Our binding data demonstrate improved recognition of mutant viruses by BNT162b2-induced antibodies compared to those induced by natural infection. Recognition may, however, be 10-fold reduced for the variants B.1.351/P.1, suggesting that the development of a new vaccine is warranted. The E484K mutation is an key hurdle for immune recognition, convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibody therapy as well as serological assays based on the wildtype sequence may therefore seriously impaired.

Quality-of-life (QOL) assessments provide a patient-reported estimate of well-being that may be clinically relevant. Although the sinonasal tract is integral to ESBS, the change in sinonasal-related QOL with ESBS has not been well studied. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess QOL before and after ESBS using validated outcome measures. METHODS Consecutive adult patients undergoing ESBS for anterior skull base lesions were prospectively enrolled from a tertiary referral center. Each patient was asked to complete the 22-item Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) and the Anterior Skull Base Questionnaire (ASBQ) preoperatively, and again at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS Eighty-five patients were included for study, 44.7% of whom underwent ESBS for nonpituitary pathology. Mean SNOT-22 scores transiently worsened in the early postoperative period, and significantly improved at 1 year after surgery (p < 0.01). Gross-total tumor resection and use of autologous grafting materials were associated with improved SNOT-22 scores at later time points (p < 0.05). Type of reconstruction, tumor pathology, and functionality did not affect QOL scores. Correlation between SNOT-22 and ASBQ scores was good at all time points (r < -0.50). Cerebrospinal fluid leak and other complications were uncommon. CONCLUSION ESBS does not have a detrimental long-term effect and is associated with ultimate improvement in sinonasal-related QOL. Short-term impairments of sinonasal-related QOL are predictable and self-limited.

RESULTS: By relying on case studies produced in the context of a hospital ethnography, we will emphasize the importance of allowing, even within these TPE practices, the passage from what is said to the act of saying, or from the subject of the statement to the subject of the saying. CONCLUSIONS: Our conclusions show firstly that from a relational point of view, a narrative approach makes it possible to consolidate the triad of care by allowing a better identification of needsa; secondly, from a therapeutic point of view, we will see that if the narration helps in the identity reorganization of these children confronted with fragmented pieces of life - acknowledging that the work of putting things into words participates in creating new meaning and links -, it also makes it conceivable to describe the possibilities of being that arise for the children themselves and for their immediate kin in terms of individual and collective experience of the disease.","output":"[Therapeutic education patient and epilepsy in children: recounting bodies and feelings]./ ducation thrapeutique du patient et pilepsie chez l'enfant mise en rcit des corps et des ressentis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on European health and social care systems, with demands on testing, hospital and intensive care capacity exceeding available resources in many regions. This has led to concerns that some vulnerable groups, including autistic people, may be excluded from services. METHODS: We reviewed policies from 15 European member states, published in March-July 2020, pertaining to (1) access to COVID-19 tests; (2) provisions for treatment, hospitalisation and intensive care units (ICUs); and (3) changes to standard health and social care. In parallel, we analysed survey data on the lived experiences of 1301 autistic people and caregivers. RESULTS: Autistic people experienced significant barriers when accessing COVID-19 services. First, despite being at elevated risk of severe illness due to co-occurring health conditions, there was a lack of accessibility of COVID-19 testing. Second, many COVID-19 outpatient and inpatient treatment services were reported to be inaccessible, predominantly resulting from individual differences in communication needs. Third, ICU triage protocols in many European countries (directly or indirectly) resulted in discriminatory exclusion from lifesaving treatments. Finally, interruptions to standard health and social care left over 70% of autistic people without everyday support. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated existing healthcare inequalities for autistic people, probably contributing to disproportionate increases in morbidity and mortality, mental health and behavioural difficulties, and reduced quality of life. An urgent need exists for policies and guidelines on accessibility of COVID-19 services to be updated to prevent the widespread exclusion of autistic people from services, which represents a violation of international human rights law.","output":"COVID-19 health and social care access for autistic people: European policy review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SCOPE The antidepressant-like effect of psychobiotics has been observed in both pre-clinical and clinical studies, but the molecular mechanisms of action are largely unclear. To address this, the psychobiotic strain Bifidobacterium breve CCFM1025 was investigated for its genomic features, metabolic features, and gut microbial and metabolic modulation effect. METHODS AND RESULTS Unlike Bifidobacterium breve FHLJDQ3M5, CCFM1025 significantly decreased the chronically stressed mice's depressive-like behaviors and neurological abnormalities. CCFM1025 has more genes encoding glycoside hydrolases when comparing to FHLJDQ3M5's genome, which means CCFM1025 has a superior carbohydrate utilization capacity and living adaptivity in the gut. CCFM1025 also produced higher levels of neuromodulatory metabolites, including hypoxanthine, tryptophan, and nicotinate. The administration of CCFM1025 reshaped the gut microbiome of chronically stressed mice. It resulted in higher cecal xanthine, tryptophan, short-chain fatty acid levels, and enhanced fatty acid and tryptophan biosynthesis capability in the gut-brain interaction (identified by in silico analyses) than FHLJDQ3M5-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS Genomic and metabolic features involving glycoside hydrolases and neuromodulatory metabolites may determine the antidepressant-like effect of Bifidobacterium breve CCFM1025.

The goal of this update is to discuss current practices concerning antithrombosis prophylaxis and the management of recently developed anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. The duration of prophylaxis is 1 month for oncological surgery. The recommended doses in bariatric surgery are twice daily injections of low-molecular weight heparin without exceeding a total dose of 10,000 IU/day. Dual antiplatelet therapy is necessary for 6 weeks after placement of bare-metal stents, from 6-12 months for drug-eluting stents, and 12 months after an acute coronary artery syndrome. Abrupt discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy exposes the patient to an increased risk of thrombosis. Data are insufficient to make specific recommendations for antiplatelet therapy in gastrointestinal surgery. For major digestive surgery, prescription of daily aspirin should be discussed case by case. If discontinuation of treatment is absolutely necessary, this should be as short as possible (aspirin: 3 days, ticagrelor and clopidogrel: 5 days, prasugrel: 7 days). The modalities for elective management of new oral anticoagulants are similar to those for classical vitamin K antagonists (VKA) therapy, except that any overlapping with heparin administration must be avoided.

Sporadic KS cases have mainly been found in Africa. Isolated splenic KS in Asia has rarely been reported. We present here a case of KS primarily involving the spleen in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative Chinese patient. CASE SUMMARY: A 50-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital due to abdominal distension and discomfort, reduced food intake and weight loss. Medical examination revealed that the patient had moderate anemia, a low platelet count, slight fatty liver and a huge mass in the spleen. Spleen lymphoma was considered. An anti-HIV test was negative. The whole spleen was surgically excised. The final pathological diagnosis was nodular stage spleen KS, and the patient underwent total splenectomy. He recovered well and was discharged from hospital 12 d after surgery. Two weeks later, the patient developed liver metastasis and died within 1 mo after surgery. CONCLUSION: KS is difficult to diagnose and pathological examination is necessary.

Olive oil polyphenols are known to induce beneficial effects in several pathological conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, and to contrast the proliferation of cancer cells or hypercholesterolemia. Polyphenols are also present in waste products derived from the olive industry: olive mill wastewaters (OMWW) are rich in polyphenols and there is an increasing interest in using OMWW in animal nutrition. OMWW are attributed with positive effects in promoting chicken performance and the quality of food-derived products. However, a tissue-specific transcriptome target analysis of chickens fed with OMWW has never been attempted. RESULTS: We explored the effect of dietary OMWW on the intestinal function in broilers. A morphological analysis of the jejunum revealed that OMWW reduced crypt depth, whereas no significant modifications were observed for villus height and the villus height/crypt depth ratio. An RNA Sequencing analysis was performed on isolated, intestinal, epithelial cells and 280 differentially expressed genes were found using a count-based approach. An enrichment analysis revealed that the majority of up regulated genes in the OMWW group were over-represented by the regulation of viral genome replication-related GO-Terms, whereas down regulated genes were mainly involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism.

METHODS: We included participants with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions followed by specialists at Johns Hopkins. Participants completed periodic surveys querying comorbidities, disease-modifying medications, exposures, COVID-19 testing and outcomes, social behaviors, and disruptions to healthcare. We assessed whether COVID-19 risk is higher among those on immunomodulating or suppressive agents and characterized pandemic-associated changes to care and mental health. RESULTS: 265 (5.6%) developed COVID-19 over 9 months of follow-up (April-December 2020). Patient characteristics (age, race, comorbidity, medications) were associated with differences in social distancing behaviors during the pandemic. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 in models incorporating behavior and other potential confounders (OR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.08, 1.89).

Genetic variation affects the establishment of the gene regulatory landscape and thus gene expression, and we hypothesized that this contributes to the observed heterogeneity in individual responses to exogenous cellular insults. OBJECTIVES: We performed an in vivo study of how genetic variation and chromatin organization may dictate susceptibility to DNA damage, and influence the cellular response to such damage, caused by an environmental toxicant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured DNA damage, messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) expression, and genome-wide chromatin accessibility in lung tissue from two genetically divergent inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ, both in unexposed mice and in mice exposed to a model DNA-damaging chemical, 1,3-butadiene. RESULTS: Our results showed that unexposed CAST/EiJ and C57BL/6J mice have very different chromatin organization and transcription profiles in the lung. Importantly, in unexposed CAST/EiJ mice, which acquired relatively less 1,3-butadiene-induced DNA damage, we observed increased transcription and a more accessible chromatin landscape around genes involved in detoxification pathways. Upon chemical exposure, chromatin was significantly remodeled in the lung of C57BL/6J mice, a strain that acquired higher levels of 1,3-butadieneCinduced DNA damage, around the same genes, ultimately resembling the molecular profile of CAST/EiJ. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that strain-specific changes in chromatin and transcription in response to chemical exposure lead to a compensation for underlying genetic-driven interindividual differences in the baseline chromatin and transcriptional state. This work represents an example of how chemical and environmental exposures can be evaluated to better understand gene-by-environment interactions, and it demonstrates the important role of chromatin response in transcriptomic changes and, potentially, in deleterious effects of exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1937","output":"Variation in DNA-Damage Responses to an Inhalational Carcinogen (1,3-Butadiene) in Relation to Strain-Specific Differences in Chromatin Accessibility and Gene Transcription Profiles in C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first case of human infection by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia in June 2012, more than 2260 cases of confirmed MERS-CoV infection and 803 related deaths have been reported since the 16th of October 2018.

A number of ecologic epidemiological studies that considered COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates across countries appeared to support this suggestion. Ecologic studies, however, are primarily hypothesis-generating, given their well-known limitations in extrapolating to the individual-person level. The present study, which employed anonymized records of U.S. Military Veterans treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs was principally a case-control study of COVID-19 infections with a retrospective cohort study of mortality nested within the infections.

The combination of country and year of birth was used as a surrogate for infant BCG vaccination. The study did not support the hypothesis that BCG in infancy was protective against COVID-19. The odds ratio for infection was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03, 1.11) and the risk ratio for mortality among the COVID-19 cases was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.18).

DESIGN: population-based observational study based on a record linkage procedure of databases included in the electronic health information system of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the study group consisted of individuals who resided in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region and who underwent COVID-19 testing from 01.03 to 24.04.2020. The study group was identified from the laboratory database, which contains all the microbiological testing performed in regional facilities. Tested people were categorized into positive or negative cases, based on test results. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: probability of being tested for and cumulative incidence of COVID-19. RESULTS: the cumulative probability of being tested for COVID-19 was 278/10,000 inhabitants, while the cumulative incidence was 22 cases/10,000. Out of 33,853 tested people, 2,744 (8.1%) turned out to be positive for COVID-19. Women were tested more often than men (337 vs 216/10,000), and they showed a higher incidence of infection than men (25 and 19 infected cases/10,000 residents, respectively). Both cumulative incidence and cumulative probability of being tested were higher in the elderly population. About 25% of infected people was hosted in retirement homes and 9% was represented by healthcare workers. Thirty seven percent of positive cases had hypertension, 15% cardiologic diseases, while diabetes and cancer characterized 11.7% and 10% of the infected population, respectively. The geographic distribution of positive cases showed a faster spread of the infection in the city of Trieste, an urban area with the highest regional population density.

METHODS The scoping review was performed by searching PubMed, Cinahl, Embase, EconLit and Health Technology Assessment. English-, Danish-, Norwegian-, German-, Italian-, French- and Swedish-language studies, published 1.1.2009-1.5.2020 about mobile X-ray outside the hospital were included. Participants were patients examined using mobile X-ray as the intervention. PRISMA was used when eligible to build up the review. To extract data from the selected articles, we used a structured summary table. RESULTS We included 12 studies in this scoping review. The results were divided into four topics:1. Target population 2. Population health 3. Experience of care and 4. Cost effectiveness. The main findings are that target population could be larger for instance including hospice patients for palliative care, group dwelling for people with intellectual disabilities, or psychiatric patients, population health may be improved, image quality seems to be good and mobile X-ray may be cost effective. Limitations of language, databases and grey literature may have resulted in studies being missed. CONCLUSIONS Mobile X-ray may be used outside hospital. There seems to be potential benefits to both patients and health care staff.

We studied the bacteriological aspects and we searched for the presence of virulence factors (SpA, FnbpA, Hla, and PVL genes) in the strains, and we also studied the clinical and biological aspects of the infections. The average age of our patients was of 36 years and they were predominantly males (sex ratio = 3.37). A severe head trauma or a history of coma was noted in 73.43% of the patients. The average duration of ventilation was 29 days. Among the studied strains, five were Methicillin-resistant S. aureus of which three expressed the mecA gene. Overall, the Hla gene was detected in 85.7% of the strains and it was more prevalent in Methicillin-susceptible than Methicillin-resistant strains (93.3% versus 40%; P = 0.014). FnbpA, Spa, and PVL genes were detected, respectively, in 80%, 45.7%, and 20% of the strains. Therefore, our studied strains were essentially associated with the production of Hla and FnbpA genes.

To do so, we analyse 24 episodes of unexpected market closure through a novel datasets of 133 million Bitcoin transactions involving 31 dark markets and their users, totalling 4 billion USD. We show that coordinated user migration from the closed market to coexisting markets guarantees overall systemic resilience beyond the intrinsic fragility of individual markets.

This raises the possibility that increased viscosity may contribute to endothelial damage and multiorgan failure in COVID-19, and that therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) to decrease viscosity may improve patient outcomes. Here we sought to share our experience using TPE in the first 6 patients treated for COVID-19-associated hyperviscosity. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Six critically ill COVID-19 patients with plasma viscosity levels ranging from 2.6 to 4.2 centipoise (cP; normal range, 1.4-1.8 cP) underwent daily TPE for 2-3 treatments. RESULTS: TPE decreased plasma viscosity in all six patients (Pre-TPE median 3.75 cP, range 2.6-4.2 cP; Post-TPE median 1.6 cP, range 1.5-1.9 cP). TPE also decreased fibrinogen levels in all five patients for whom results were available (Pre-TPE median 739 mg/dL, range 601-1188 mg/dL; Post-TPE median 359 mg/dL, range 235-461 mg/dL); D-dimer levels in all six patients (Pre-TPE median 5921 ng/mL, range 1134-60 000 ng/mL; Post-TPE median 4893 ng/mL, range 620-7518 ng/mL); and CRP levels in five of six patients (Pre-TPE median 292 mg/L, range 136-329 mg/L; Post-TPE median 84 mg/L, range 31-211 mg/L). While the two sickest patients died, significant improvement in clinical status was observed in four of six patients shortly after TPE.

The three major therapeutic areas for which mRNA delivery is currently being explored are antigen production, including the COVID-19 vaccine, protein replacement therapy, and genome engineering. It was demonstrated 30 years ago that introducing in vitro transcribed mRNA intramuscularly results in detectable protein expression for specific antigens protecting against the likes of influenza and cancer. Utilizing mRNA as a therapeutic modality, however, is challenging. mRNA is large and anionic and, as a result, cannot passively diffuse across the negatively charged plasma membrane. In addition, RNases present in the bloodstream and tissues rapidly degrade mRNA, and its administration induces the innate immune response. In consequence, lipid-, polymer-, dendrimer-, and natural membrane-based mRNA drug delivery systems have been developed to deliver mRNA to target cells. Significant efforts and investments have been made to translate some of these systems into the clinic. Specifically, systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have delivered mRNA to the liver, and intramuscularly administered LNPs have delivered mRNA to immune cells to protect against coronavirus disease of 2019. However, clinically relevant delivery in non-liver tissues such as the spleen, lungs, heart, eye, central nervous system, and lymphatics requires improved drug delivery systems.In this Account, we provide an overview of key advances that have led us to Food and Drug Administration approval for the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and Emergency Use Authorization for the Moderna mRNA-based vaccine against the same disease, and we explain how these developments will contribute to the clinical translation of mRNA therapeutics targeted outside of the liver. We first focus on the chemical modifications and sequence optimization that can improve the potency of mRNA, resulting in greatly improved pharmacokinetics. After detailing what makes an ideal mRNA payload, we review drug delivery systems used to deliver the payload into target cells. We describe efforts to reduce clearance by the liver, a key obstacle to the development of non-liver therapies.

In patients hospitalized for or suspected of COVID-19 infection with the presence of either a) DVT clinical symptoms, b) a strong DVT clinical probability (Wells score > 2) or c) elevated D-dimer levels without DVT clinical symptoms and without PE on lung CT angio-scan, DVT should be investigated with DUS. In the presence of PE diagnosed clinically and/or radiologically, additional systematic DVT screening using DUS is not recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of 4-points compression DUS for DVT screen and diagnosis is the most appropriate method in this context. Discussion. Systematic DUS for DVT screening in asymptomatic COVID patients is not recommended unless the patient is in the ICU.

DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial conducted in 2016-2017. METHODS A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken using Monte Carlo simulations from input distributions to estimate costs and effects associated with using FAW to reduce risk of thermal discomfort for patients receiving sedation in a cardiac catheterisation laboratory. A range of willingness to pay threshold values were tested with results plotted on a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Costs were calculated in Australian currency ($AUD). RESULTS Estimated total costs were $5.21 (SD 3.26) higher per patient for FAW in comparison to standard care. Estimated probability of success (rating of thermal comfort) was 0.16 (0.06) higher for FAW. Forced air warming becomes more likely to result in a net benefit than standard care at a willingness to pay threshold of $34. CONCLUSION Forced air warming could be considered cost-effective for procedures performed with sedation in a cardiac catheterisation laboratory if the extra cost of an incremental gain in thermal comfort is less than the decision maker's willingness to pay for it.

Variable influence differed depending on MCS, with age being the most influential factor in the LASSO-PCI model, whereas haematocrit and estimated glomerular filtration rate were the highest-ranking factors in the LASSO-PCI-MCS model. CONCLUSION Data-driven prognosis models outperformed established risk scores in patients with AMICS receiving acute PCI and exhibited good discriminative abilities.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted in tertiary hospitals in the Uusimaa region, Finland, with 1072 volunteers being enrolled in the study from among the HCWs at the Helsinki University Hospital. Overall, 866 (80.8%) HCWs (including 588 nurses, 170 doctors, and 108 laboratory and medical imaging nurses) completed the questionnaire by July 15, 2020, with 52% of the participants taking care of COVID?19 patients. The participants answered a structured questionnaire regarding their use of PPE, the ability to follow safety guidelines, exposure to COVID?19, and the source of potential COVID?19 infections. The participants with COVID?19 symptoms were tested with the SARS-CoV-2 realtime polymerase chain reaction method. All infected participants were contacted, and their answers were confirmed regarding COVID?19 exposure. RESULTS In total, 41 (4.7%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with 22 (53.6%) of infections being confirmed or likely occupational, and 12 (29.3%) originating from colleagues. In 14 cases (63.6%), occupational infections occurred while using a surgical mask, and all infections originating from patients occurred while using a surgical mask or no mask at all. No occupational infections were found while using an FFP2/3 respirator and following aerosol precautions. The combined odds ratio for working at an intensive care unit, an emergency department, or a ward was 3.4 (95% CI: 1.2-9.2, p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS A high infection rate was found among HCWs despite safety guidelines. Based on these findings, the authors recommend the use of FFP2/3 respirators in all patient contacts with confirmed or suspected COVID?19, along with the use of universal masking, also in personnel rooms.","output":"Sources of healthcare workers' COVID?19 infections and related safety guidelines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many United States health-systems are grappling with how to safely resume elective surgery amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We used online crowdsourcing to explore public perceptions and concerns towards resuming elective surgery during the pandemic, and to determine factors associated with the preferred timing of surgery after health-systems reopen. METHODS: A 21-question survey was completed by 722 members of the public using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with the timing of preferred surgery after health-systems reopen. RESULTS: Most (61%) participants were concerned with contracting COVID-19 during the surgical process, primarily during check-in and in waiting-room areas, as well as through excessive interactions with staff. Overall, 57% would choose to have their surgery at a hospital over an outpatient surgery center. About 1 in 4 (27%) would feel comfortable undergoing elective surgery in the first month of health-systems reopening. After multivariable adjustment, native English speaking (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.04-6.4; P=0.042), male sex (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.7; P<0.001), and Veterans-Affairs insurance (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.1-18.7; P=0.036) were independent predictors of preferring earlier surgery. CONCLUSION: Women and non-native English speakers may be more hesitant to undergo elective surgery amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite concerns of contagion, more than half of the public favors a hospital setting over an outpatient surgery center for their elective surgery. Concerted efforts to minimize patient congestion and unnecessary face-to-face interactions may prove most effective in reducing public anxiety and concerns over the safety of resuming elective care.","output":"Public Perceptions of Resuming Elective Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An experimental study investigated the effects of applying principles of the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Focusing on epistemic beliefs (EBs) in inclusive science classes, we compared four groups who worked with learning environments based more or less on UDL principles and filled out an original version of a widely used EBs questionnaire or an adapted version using the Universal Design for Assessment (UDA) Based on measurement invariance analyses, a multiple indicator, and multiple cause (MIMIC) approach as well as multi-group panel models, the results do not support an outperformance of the extensive UDL environment Moreover, the UDA-based questionnaire appears to be more adequately suited for detecting learning gains in an inclusive setting The results emphasize how important it is to carefully adopt and introduce the UDL principles for learning and to care about test accessibility when conducting quantitative research in inclusive settings","output":"Universal Design for Learning: The More, the Better?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent rise of right-wing populism has given new momentum to the discussion about the meaning of populism around the world and the covid-19 pandemic added yet another layer to the issue.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common presentation when kidney is involved. There is evidence that kidney damage is determined through different pathological mechanisms. Has been observed that pathological kidney lesions can be due to the direct cytopathic effect of the virus on tubular cells or by pro-inflammatory cytokine storm. Aim of this observation is to evaluate the clinical and pathological patterns of kidney damage mediated by Coronavirus. METHOD: We analysed kidney autopsies of 4 patients with COVID-19 infection, hospitalized between March and April 2020, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. The tissue samples have been observed by light microscopy and immunofluorescence. RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 was performed in all cases. RESULTS: CASE 1: female, 69 y; affected by obesity, previous ictus; smoking habit. Admitted for COVID-related pneumonia. At onset creatinine 0.45 mg/dl. Progression of lung failure and exitus after 3 days. Autopsy: diffuse alveolar damage. Renal autopsy: acute tubular necrosis; mild glomerular ischemia, lymphocyte T CD4+ parenchyma infiltration. CASE2: male, 66 y; affected by hypertension with cardiac involvement. Admitted for persistent fever. At onset creatinine 0.98 mg/dl. Nasopharingeal swab COVID-19 positive. Progression of lung failure and oligoanuric AKIn 3 (creatinine 4.5 mg/dl, urea 239 mg/dl), dialysis dependent. Exitus after one week for diffuse alveolar damage and sepsis. Renal autopsy: proximal and distal acute tubular moderate injury, mild diffuse glomerular ischemia, glomerular capillaritis, overlap chronic nephropathy. CASE 3: male 45 y; affected by obesity and diabetes. Admitted for COVID-related pneumonia with acute lung failure requiring ECMO. After one week developed AKIn 3 dialysis dependent. Exitus for cardio-respiratory arrest. Renal autopsy: diffuse acute tubular necrosis, glomerular capillaritis, overlap chronic diabetic nephropathy. CASE 4: male, 51 y; affected by CKD grade IV, hypertension, previous ictus; drug abuser. Admitted for AKIn 2 and COVID-related pneumonia. After 3 days progression of lung and renal failure requiring intubation and dialysis treatment. Exitus the day after for diffusive alveolar damage and lymphocytic myocarditis. Renal autopsy: diffused acute tubular necrosis, glomerular ischemia with mild tuft collapsing, diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes CD4+. In all cases light microscopy examination showed diffuse proximal tubular injury, with isomeric and non-isomeric vacuolar degeneration; collapsing tuft, and interstitial inflammation. Virus RNA performed by RT-PCR on kidney tissue was positive in all patients. Moreover in some cases our patients showed multi-systemic organ involvement: lung in 4 cases, heart in 1, liver in 1. CONCLUSION: Our observations show that the main pathological effect caused by Coronavirus is a direct cytopathic effect on the proximal tubules with variable degree of damage until acute tubular necrosis (ATN). In addition to this pathway, other factors contributing to kidney damage include systemic hypoxia, microvascular capillaritis. Associated sepsis can worse overall and renal survival.

Omicron S requires a substantially higher level of host receptor ACE2 for efficient membrane fusion than other variants, possibly explaining its unexpected cellular tropism. Mutations not only remodel the antigenic structure of the N-terminal domain of the S protein, but also alter the surface of the receptor-binding domain in a way not seen in other variants, consistent with its remarkable resistance to neutralizing antibodies.

In this study, we start from the hypothesis that engaging with containment measures in a pandemic situation should be more comfortable for some people than for other people. Thus, individual differences should be associated with engagement with containment measures.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in the volume of seriously ill patients in EDs and a consequent rapid increase in PC integration in many EDs. OBJECTIVE: To describe the new PC-ED delivery innovations that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this qualitative study of PC programs in EDs, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ED and PC clinicians between June 30, 2020 and August 18, 2020. Participants were asked about PC-ED integration before, during and after COVID. We conducted a two-phased rapid analysis (RA) using a RA template and consolidated matrix to identify innovations. RESULTS: Using purposive and snowball sampling, we interviewed 31 participants, representing 52 hospitals. Several new innovations in care delivery were identified. These included elements of fully embedded PC, the use of PC extenders, technology both within the electronic medical record (EMR) and outside of it, and innovations in training emergency clinicians in primary palliative care skills to support care delivery. Most PC efforts focused on increasing goals of care conversations. Institutions that implemented these programs reported that they increased PC utilization in the ED, were well received by clinicians, and changed patients care trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Several new innovations in PC-ED care delivery emerged during COVID. Many innovations leveraged different types of clinicians to deliver care, an increased physical presence of PC in the ED, and used technology to enhance care delivery. These innovations may serve as a framework for institutions as they plan for evolving needs in the ED during and after COVID.

METHOD Twenty-two semistructured interviews with psychiatrists and neurologists were analysed with NVivo, a qualitative analysis software to code and organise transcribed data. RESULTS Different views and approaches regarding decision-making capacity in the context of euthanasia emerged from the data.Most of the physicians have some knowledge of the cognitive ability approach on decision-making capacity. According to this approach, four abilities constitute decision-making capacity: communication, understanding, appreciation and reasoning. We observed differences in the way these abilities are valued in relation to competence. Some physicians take additional elements into consideration when assessing decision-making capacity.Physicians acquired their knowledge on the subject in many different ways. Most of the physicians reported that decision-making capacity was not part of their training. CONCLUSION We conclude that physicians assess decision-making capacity in different ways and that personal values and beliefs influence their approach. As such, a common approach in assessing the decision-making capacity of a patient among the interviewed physicians is lacking. Less arbitrariness could be obtained by consistently implementing the cognitive ability approach.","output":"Assessment of patient decision-making capacity in the context of voluntary euthanasia for psychic suffering caused by psychiatric disorders: a qualitative study of approaches among Belgian physicians."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionCoronaviruses typically cause influenza like illness which progresses to ARDS along with other systemic manifestations.

In contrast, second wave plasma cross-neutralization of first wave virus was more effective, showing only a 2.3-fold decline relative to first wave plasma neutralization of first wave virus. While we only tested one plasma elicited by E484K alone, this potently neutralized both variants.

The failure patterns, prognostic factors, and efficacy of additional chemotherapy were assessed. RESULTS The median follow-up time was 78 months for 298 patients. The 5-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), nodal recurrence-free survival (NRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), failure-free survival (FFS), and overall survival (OS) were 95.2%, 99.3%, 94.8%, 89.8%, and 92.9%, respectively. The rate of treatment failure remained high in patients with T4 disease (35.4%, 17/48), including eight of local recurrence, two of nodal recurrence, and seven of distant metastasis. Multivariate analyses showed that the primary gross tumor volume (GTVp) was significantly associated with LRFS, DMFS, FFS, and OS. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with GTVp  42.5 cc had better 5-year LRFS (98.7% vs 81.4%, P < .001), 5-year DMFS (97.8% vs 82.5%, P < .001), 5-year FFS (96.1% vs 65.4%, P < .001), and 5-year OS (96.6% vs 78.2%, P < .001) than patients with GTVp > 42.5 cc.

Findings will inform the need for policy action to mitigate the impact of IRDs. METHODS: The costs of IRDs were estimated using a cost-of-illness methodology, based on the prevalence of IRDs in each country. Intangible costs of reduced wellbeing were also estimated using disability-adjusted life years which were then converted to monetary values using the value of a statistical life. RESULTS: Using base prevalence rates, total costs attributable to IRDs in the US were estimated to range between US$13,414.0 and US$31,797.4 million in 2019, comprising both economic costs (between US$4,982 and US$11,753.9 million; 37% of total costs) and wellbeing costs (between US$8,431.7 and US$20,043.6 million; 63%). Total costs attributable to IRDs in Canada were estimated to range between CAN$1637.8 and CAN$6687.5 million in 2019, comprising both economic costs (between CAN$566.6 and CAN$2,305.7 million; 34%) and wellbeing costs (between CAN$1,071.4 and CAN$4,381.9 million; 66% of total costs).

This paper identified the source locations and strengths by solving inverse contaminant transport with the quasi-reversibility (QR) and pseudo-reversibility (PR) methods. The QR method replaces the second-order diffusion term in the contaminant transport equation with a fourth-order stabilization term. By using the airflow pattern calculated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the time when the peak contaminant concentration was measured by a sensor in downstream, the QR method solves the backward probability density function (PDF) of contaminant source location. The PR method reverses the airflow calculated by CFD and solves the PDF in the same manner as the QR method. The position with the highest PDF is the location of the contaminant source. The source strength can be further determined by scaling the nominal contaminant concentration computed by CFD with the concentration measured by the sensor. By using a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional aircraft cabin as examples of enclosed spaces, the two methods can identify contaminant source locations and strengths in the cabins if the sensors are placed in the downstream location of the sources. The QR method performed slightly better than the PR method but with a longer computing time. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS The paper presents a method that can be used to find a gaseous contaminant source location and determine its strength in enclosed spaces with the data of contaminant concentration measured by one sensor. The method can be a very useful tool to find where, what, and how the contamination has happened. The method is also useful for optimally placing sensors in enclosed spaces.

Preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel is the main intervention. We aimed to assess the effect of preventive chemotherapy on schistosomiasis prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa, comparing 2000C10 with 2011C14 and 2015C19. METHODS: In this spatiotemporal modelling study, we analysed survey data from school-aged children (aged 5C14 years) in 44 countries across sub-Saharan Africa. The data were extracted from the Global Neglected Tropical Diseases database and augmented by 2018 and 2019 survey data obtained from disease control programmes. Bayesian geostatistical models were fitted to Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni survey data. The models included data on climatic predictors obtained from satellites and other open-source environmental databases and socioeconomic predictors obtained from various household surveys. Temporal changes in Schistosoma species prevalence were estimated by a categorical variable with values corresponding to the three time periods (2000C10, 2011C14, and 2015C19) during which preventive chemotherapy interventions were scaled up. FINDINGS: We identified 781 references with relevant geolocated schistosomiasis survey data for 2000C19. There were 19 166 unique survey locations for S haematobium and 23 861 for S mansoni, of which 77% (14 757 locations for S haematobium and 18 372 locations for S mansoni) corresponded to 2011C19. Schistosomiasis prevalence among school-aged children in sub-Saharan Africa decreased from 230% (95% Bayesian credible interval 221C241) in 2000C10 to 96% (91C102) in 2015C19, an overall reduction of 583%. The reduction of S haematobium was 679% (646C711) and that of S mansoni 536% (452C583) when comparing 2000C10 with 2015C19. INTERPRETATION: Our model-based estimates suggest that schistosomiasis prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa has decreased considerably, most likely explained by the scale-up of preventive chemotherapy. There is a need to consolidate gains in the control of schistosomiasis by means of preventive chemotherapy, coupled with other interventions to interrupt disease transmission.

Using a survey of 350 respondents in Chonju, we find that risk perceptions and a belief that influenza vaccination reduces the incidence of SARS explain behavioral intentions for influenza vaccination and purchase responses to a hypothetical SARS vaccine. Those respondents who believe that an influenza vaccination will very likely reduce SARS incidence have a high probability (79%) of intending to vaccinate, but a much lower WTP for a SARS vaccine than those without such a belief. This belief undoubtedly was influenced by a reframing of influenza vaccination as preventing SARS. Such reframing may lead to short-term improvements in vaccination rates to the detriment of long-term SARS vaccination development.

We use an age-stratified eight compartment epidemiological model to depict COVID-19 transmission in the community and within households. With a simulated 120-day outbreak period data we obtain a post 180-days period optimal control strategy solution. Our results show that easing social distancing between adults by the end of the 180-day period requires very strict testing a month later and then daily testing rates of 5% followed by isolation of positive cases. Relaxing social distancing rates in adults from 50% to 25% requires both children and seniors to maintain social distancing rates of 50% for nearly the entire period while maintaining maximum testing rates of children and seniors for 150 of the 180 days considered in this model.

The available theories indicate that these cells are resistant to apoptosis and accumulate at the causal sites of many chronic disorders and diseases, are metabolically active, and may acquire a proinflammatory, pro-apoptotic secretory phenotype that destroys healthy tissues. This results in the release of tissue-damaging pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and proteases. The most disturbing phenomenon is the innate immunity of aging cells to these factors. Aging cells undergo also metabolic changes, i.e. decreased use of fatty acids, increased glycolysis, and increased production of reactive oxygen species, which can affect other cells and even spread the aging process. Senolytic drugs (including Dasatinib, Quercetin, Fisetin, Navitoclax) have the ability to temporarily turn off the ability to defend against apoptosis. The senescent cells take weeks to accumulate again, so these substances can be given intermittently, reducing the likelihood of side effects. In preclinical models, it was shown that senolytics delay the processes of e.g. weakness, cancer, and dysfunction of the cardiovascular system, liver, kidneys, musculoskeletal system, lungs, eyes. However, ongoing clinical trials for diabetes, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, COVID-19, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and bone marrow transplantation have not yet been completed. Pending the results confirming the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of these substances, they cannot be used by patients until then. Despite this, many senolytic substances are now available in the form of dietary supplements. The pharmaceutical market and the production of dietary supplements are developing very dynamically, new technologies and new applications are constantly being discovered. However, supplements are not subject to any control as to the quality of the finished preparations and their composition, which may increase the danger of their use. By assumption, supplements contain ingredients that are supposed to support the functioning of our body, not to heal. Therefore, it is worth considering the need for supplementation, especially since supplements can be overdosed and may also react with drugs, which may have unforeseen effects. ? 2021 Polish Pharmaceutical Society.

The results of the model estimated on the time series of the number of infections for the Italian provinces show that the containment measures, despite being globally effective in reducing both the spread of contagion and its self-sustaining dynamics, have had nonlinear impacts across provinces. The impact has been relatively stronger in the northern local areas, where the disease occurred earlier and with a greater incidence. This evidence may be explained by the shared popular belief that the contagion was not a close-to-home problem but rather restricted to a few distant northern areas, which, in turn, might have led individuals to adhere less strictly to containment measures and lockdown rules.","output":"Assessing the effect of containment measures on the spatio-temporal dynamic of COVID-19 in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is anticipated that effective vaccines will enable the resumption of social and economic normalcy.

Using bond market data from nine Asian markets, we uncover a transmission mechanism of uncertainty shocks via the bond market. The mechanism works as a crowding-out effect due to government-led excessive market borrowing with supply-side consequences for the private sector, as opposed to economic policy or global stock market uncertainty which works more like a demand shock as in the literature.

One group is that of nitric oxide increasing supplements, so-called NO-boosters, which are claimed to improve the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the muscle by enhancing vasodilation. The aim of this study was to investigate 3 of these supplements in healthy male athletes for their muscle perfusion-enhancing potential using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). METHODS: This placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized cross-over trial will be carried out at the Center for Orthopedics, Trauma Surgery and Spinal Cord Injury of the University Hospital Heidelberg. Three commercial NO enhancing products including 300 mg of the specific green tea extract VASO6 and a combination of 8 g L-citrulline malate and 3 g L-arginine hydrochloride will be examined for their potential to increase muscular perfusion in 30-male athletes between 18 and 40 years and will be compared with a placebo. On each of the 3 appointments CEUS of the dominant biceps muscle will be performed at rest and after a standardized resistance training. Every athlete receives each of the 3 supplements once after a wash-out period of at least 1 week. Perfusion will be quantified via VueBox quantification software. The results of CEUS perfusion measurements will be compared intra- and interindividually and correlated with clinical parameters.

This work proposes a modern approach to examine the degree to which the HPAI-H5N1disease event is being influenced by climate variability as a potential risk factor using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). GEE model revealed that the effect of climate variability differs according to the timing of the outbreak occurrence. Temperature and relative humidity could have both positive and negative effects on disease events. During the cold seasons especially in the first quarter, higher minimum temperatures, consistently show higher risks of disease occurrence, because this condition stimulates viral activity, while lower minimum temperatures support virus survival in the other quarters of the year with the highest negative effect in the third quarter. On the other hand, relative humidity negatively affects the outbreak in the first quarter of the year as the humid weather does not support viral circulation, while the highest positive effect was found in the second quarter during which low humidity favors the disease event.","output":"Possible ramifications of climate variability on HPAI-H5N1 outbreak occurrence: Case study from the Menoufia, Egypt."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research paper's focus is to portray and analyse different ways of how participants of the educational system in the Republic of Croatia have reacted to the pandemic caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Pupils' right to education, as one of their basic rights, was enabled by the Government of the Republic of Croatia's decision to organise distance learning. The part of the system which encountered most challenges during transitioning to online education was in classes first to fourth due to the pupils, because of chronological age and digital and computer literacy level, requiring parents' assistance in order to successfully accomplish educational outcomes. The involvement of parents, who because of child's impossibility to independently carry out duties, have taken on a role of a substitute teacher overnight which consequentially resulted in their overload. The key element in distance learning is independence of pupils which is questionable in the chosen segment of the educational system. In addition to independence of pupils, this paper distinguishes two other important factors: pupils' spatial-material-technical learning conditions necessary to undertake distance learning and cooperative relationship between parents (as substitute teachers) and \\"real\\" teachers which takes on a new dimension in the newly emerged situation. The empirical research's goal was an inquiry into parents' attitudes and experiences in three categories (independence of pupils, spatial-material-technical conditions and teachers' requirements).

We aimed to measure perceptions and responses towards COVID-19 in three countries to understand how population-level anxiety can be mitigated in the early phases of a pandemic. METHODS Between February and March 2020, we conducted online surveys in Singapore, China and Italy with a total of 4505 respondents to measure respondents' knowledge, perceptions, anxiety and behaviours towards the COVID-19 epidemic, and identified factors associated with lower anxiety and more positive behavioural responses. RESULTS Respondents reported high awareness of COVID-19 and its accompanying symptoms, comparable information-seeking habits and similarly high levels of information sufficiency, adherence to and acceptance of public health control measures. Higher self-efficacy was associated with lower anxiety levels in all three countries, while willingness to comply with restrictive measures and greater information sufficiency were associated with more positive behavioural changes to reduce spread of infection.

In recent years, epitope-based subunit vaccines have been introduced as a safer alternative to traditional vaccines. However, they suffer from limited immunogenicity. Nanotechnology has shown value in solving this issue. Different kinds of nanovaccines have been employed, among which virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) and self-assembled peptide nanoparticles (SAPNs) seem very promising. Recently, SAPNs have attracted special interest due to their unique properties, including molecular specificity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. They also resemble pathogens in terms of their size. Their multivalency allows an orderly repetitive display of antigens on their surface, which induces a stronger immune response than single immunogens. In vaccine design, SAPN self-adjuvanticity is regarded an outstanding advantage, since the use of toxic adjuvants is no longer required. SAPNs are usually composed of helical or -sheet secondary structures and are tailored from natural peptides or de novo structures. Flexibility in subunit selection opens the door to a wide variety of molecules with different characteristics. SAPN engineering is an emerging area, and more novel structures are expected to be generated in the future, particularly with the rapid progress in related computational tools.

Rare complications as air embolism, penetration of the heart and transection of the lungs are seldom reported in the literature. We present a case of an 81-year-old female presented with covid-19 pneumonia who developed bilateral spontaneous pneumothoraces requiring bilateral pigtail insertion. The patient developed worsening hypoxia and chest imaging revealed that the left pigtail was transected into the lung parenchyma. With this case report, we hope to bring to light a rare complication of pigtail placement.","output":"Transection of lung as rare complication of pigtail catheter placement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses, are known to have a high incidence of infection during winter, especially in temperate regions Dry and cold conditions during winter are the major drivers for increased respiratory tract infections as they increase virus stability and transmission and weaken the host immune system The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China in December 2020 and swiftly spread across the globe causing substantial health and economic burdens Several countries are battling with the second wave of the virus after a devastating first wave of spread, while some are still in the midst of their first wave It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 will eventually become seasonal or will continue to circulate year-round In an attempt to address this question, we review the current knowledge regarding the seasonality of respiratory viruses including coronaviruses and the viral and host factors that govern their seasonal pattern Moreover, we discuss the properties of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential impact of meteorological factors on its spread","output":"Seasonality of Respiratory Viral Infections: Will COVID-19 Follow Suit?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Universities have shifted from face-to-face learning environments to e-learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the sudden change to online teaching has raised concerns among lecturers about students' readiness for e-learning. This study investigates students' readiness for e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic and specifically assesses any significant differences between students' gender, age, ethnicity, level of education, field of study and their readiness for an e-learning environment. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a non-experimental quantitative research design. Data were gathered from a sample of 298 undergraduate and 101 postgraduate students. WINSTEPS Rasch model measurement software was used to determine the reliability and validity of the research instrument.

The new adaptive challenges faced at night were recurrent enough to amplify existing psychological variation in our species. Night-time is dangerous and mysterious, so it selects for individuals with higher tendencies for paranoia, risk-taking, and sociability (because of security in numbers). During night-time, individuals are generally tired and show decreased self-control and increased impulsive behaviors. The lower visibility during night-time favors the partial concealment of identity and opens more opportunities for disinhibition of self-interested behaviors. Indeed, individuals with an evening-oriented chronotype are more paranoid, risk-taking, extraverted, impulsive, promiscuous, and have higher antisocial personality traits. However, under some circumstances, such as respiratory pandemics, the psychobehavioral traits favored by the nocturnal niche might be counter-productive, increasing contagion rates of a disease that can evade the behavioral immune system because its disease cues are often nonexistent or mild. The eveningness epidemiological liability hypothesis presented here suggests that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the evening-oriented psychobehavioral profile can have collectively harmful consequences: there is a clash of core tendencies between the nocturnal chronotype and the recent viral transmission-mitigating safety guidelines and rules. The pandemic safety protocols disrupt much normal social activity, particularly at night when making new social contacts is desired. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is contagious even in presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, which enables it to mostly evade our evolved contagious disease avoidance mechanisms. A growing body of research has indirectly shown that individual traits interfering with social distancing and anti-contagion measures are related to those of the nocturnal chronotype. Indeed, some of the social contexts that have been identified as superspreading events occur at night, such as in restaurants, bars, and nightclubs. Furthermore, nocturnal environmental conditions favor the survival of the SARS-CoV-2 virus much longer than daytime conditions. We compare the eveningness epidemiological liability hypothesis with other factors related to non-compliance with pandemic safety protocols, namely sex, age, and life history. Although there is not yet a direct link between the nocturnal chronotype and non-compliance with pandemic safety protocols, security measures and future empirical research should take this crucial evolutionary mismatch and adaptive metaproblem into account, and focus on how to avoid nocturnal individuals becoming superspreaders, offering secure alternatives for nocturnal social activities.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic on Fire: Evolved Propensities for Nocturnal Activities as a Liability Against Epidemiological Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus emergency has accelerated the digitization processes of Italian schools, bringing new challenges to inclusive teaching We present the remote teaching experience that is still in progress at the Scuola Audiofonetica in Brescia, and describe actions taken and initial results achieved The families appreciated the school's educational choices, and from this positive experience, some good practices can be derived and shared at technological, methodological and organizational levels ?

This study utilises novel nationwide data to calculate the transmission risk and potential inequity of infectious disease outbreaks through use of network analysis. METHODS: Nationwide employment and education microdata (4.7 million individuals in Aotearoa New Zealand) were used to develop the Aotearoa Co-incidence Network (ACN). The ACN considers connections generated when individuals are employed at the same workplaces or enrolled at the same schools. Through forms of network analysis, connections between geospatial areas can be established and provide proxy measures of infectious disease transmission risk. The ACN was also overlayed with nationwide population vulnerability data based on the number of older adults (>65 years) and individuals with long-term health conditions. FINDINGS: We identify areas that have both high potential transmission risk (i.e., highly connected) and high vulnerability to infectious diseases. Community detection identified geographic boundaries that can be relevant to the application of regional restrictions for limiting infectious disease transmission. INTERPRETATION: Integrating novel network science and geospatial analytics provides a simple way to study infectious disease transmission risk and population vulnerability to outbreaks. Our replicable method has utility for researchers globally with access to such data. It can help inform equitable preparation for, and responses to infectious disease outbreaks.

Small exogenous noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as siRNA and shRNA are the active silencing agents, intended to target and cleave complementary mRNAs in a specific way. They are widely and successfully employed in functional studies, and several ongoing and already completed siRNA-based clinical trials suggest encouraging results in the regulation of overexpressed genes in disease. siRNAs share many aspects of their biogenesis and function with miRNAs, small ncRNA molecules transcribed from endogenous genes which are able to repress the expression of target mRNAs by either inhibiting their translation or promoting their degradation. Although siRNA and artificial miRNA molecules can significantly reduce the expression of overexpressed target genes, cancer and other diseases can also be triggered or sustained by upregulated miRNAs. Thus, in the past recent years, molecular tools for miRNA silencing, such as antagomiRs and miRNA sponges, have been developed. These molecules have shown their efficacy in the derepression of genes downregulated by overexpressed miRNAs. In particular, while a single antagomiR is able to inhibit a single complementary miRNA, an artificial sponge construct usually contains one or more binding sites for one or more miRNAs and functions by competing with the natural targets of these miRNAs. As a consequence, natural miRNA targets are reexpressed at their physiological level. In this chapter we review the most successful methods for the computational design of siRNAs, antagomiRs, and miRNA sponges and describe the most popular tools that implement them.","output":"Computational Design of Artificial RNA Molecules for Gene Regulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with a wide range of clinical symptoms Objectives: The present study aims to investigate the neurological manifestations among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Rouhani Hospital in Babol Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional survey conducted in March and April 2020 on patients admitted to Rouhani Hospital in Babol with COVID-19 A number of 230 medical records were selected randomly from a list The data were collected using the demographic characteristics questionnaire and a checklist for the neurological symptoms Results: Among the 230 patients with COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 59 85 [16 22] years;138 men [60%]), 127 (56%) patients had at least one neurologic symptom The most common symptoms of the central nervous system disorder were headache (34%), dizziness (25%), and impaired consciousness (20%), and the most prevalent symptoms of the peripheral nervous system disorder were taste impairment (17%) and smell impairment (16%) The occurrence of transient ischemic attack (TIA) in women was significantly higher than in men (P = 0 02) Moreover, the incidence of dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), anorexia, and smell impairment had a significant relationship with age (P &lt; 0 05) Conclusions: The neurological manifestations are prevalent and substantial among patients with COVID-19 Therefore, it is sug-gested that the healthcare workers take these symptoms seriously, especially in the outbreak of COVID-19, and take the pertinent preventive and protective measures ? 2020, Author(s)","output":"Neurological manifestations of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 in Babol, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has challenged health care systems and put societies to the test in the world beyond expectations.

Methods: We present and discuss data collated from various sources - published scientific studies, pre-print material, agency reports, media communication, public surveys, etc. - with specific focus on the approach itself, Covid-19 trends, healthcare system response, policy and measures overview, and implications. Results: The main intervention to manage the curve has been the general recommendations to adhere to good hand hygiene, beware of physical distance to others, to refrain from large gatherings and restrain from non-essential travel. Persons with suspected Covid-19 infection were recommended to stay at home and avoid social contacts. Additionally, visits to the elderly care homes and meetings with more than 50 people were forbidden. As a result, the healthcare system in the country has so far, never been overwhelmed. However, the relatively high mortality among the elderly, together with the vulnerability of some migrants, points out the drawbacks. Conclusions: Many countries have both marvelled and criticized the Swedish strategy that is formed in a close partnership between the government and the society based on a mutual trust giving the responsibility to individuals.

Assistive technology has the potential to support the work of social professionals in promoting social inclusion and assistance of the older people. In this context, this paper aims to investigate the expectations of social operators toward assistive technology before and during the COVID-19 emergency. It also explores how the said emergency could guide us to implement social services in the future, including a discussion on the barriers to the adoption of assistive technologies. A total of 72 social professionals participated in this study comprising of three phases: two online questionnaires and one semi structured interview. In the first two phases, the two online questionnaires were administered before and during the COVID-19 emergency to 62 social professionals. In the third phase, 10 social workers were interviewed to discuss the results of the previous questionnaires to gain an in-depth understanding. The results highlight that the COVID-19 emergency is responsible for an increased perceived need of services involving telepresence, proposing a hybrid paradigm of assistance with both remote and in-presence assistance. Furthermore, the identified barriers to technology adoption are lack of organizational structure and ready-to-use technology. As for the facilitators for the technology adoption, social workers suggested investing in education and training of social professionals to reduce skepticism towards the usefulness of technology. The social professionals involved in this study highlight a generally positive view of technology in supporting their work. Finally, the lessons learned is also presented as a guideline for researchers in this field.

Routinary examinations result in datasets with a predominant amount of negative samples. A potential solution to such class-imbalance is joining forces across multiple institutions. Developing a collaborative computer-aided diagnosis system is challenging in different ways. Patient privacy and regulations need to be carefully respected. Data across institutions may be acquired from different devices or imaging protocols, leading to heterogeneous non-IID data. Also, for learning-based methods, new optimization strategies working on distributed data are required. Recently, federated learning has emerged as an effective tool for collaborative learning. In this setting, local models perform computation on their private data to update the global model. The order and the frequency of local updates influence the final global model. Hence, the order in which samples are locally presented to the optimizers plays an important role. In this work, we define a memory-aware curriculum learning method for the federated setting. Our curriculum controls the order of the training samples paying special attention to those that are forgotten after the deployment of the global model. Our approach is combined with unsupervised domain adaptation to deal with domain shift while preserving data privacy. We evaluate our method with three clinical datasets from different vendors.

They could save more as a precautionary action for future difficulties or save less with a carpe diem attitude. This study aims to attempt to shed light on this debate with empirical observations on how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected household saving decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The two waves of the survey data allowed us to investigate both instantaneous and ongoing effects of Covid-19 on household saving decisions. The instantaneous effect refers to the immediate impact of the crisis, while the ongoing effect refers to the lasting impact of the pandemic when economic recovery had started. The variation in the number of confirmed cases across cities during the two waves provides the source of power for identification. The authors extend their analyses of the impact of Covid-19 on the household saving decision by using ordinary least squares models. Due to the ordered nature of survey responses, the authors also rerun all baseline models using the ordered probit regression method. Findings - This paper studied the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on household saving decisions in China. This study found that households in the most affected cities would save more during the Covid-19 but tend to save less when the disaster started fading away. Combining findings in Kun et al. (2013) and Filipski et al. (2015), people do become more pessimistic during and after the Covid-19, possibly driving their observed precautionary and cape diem behaviors during the two points of time. Heterogeneity analysis shows that specific households would dramatically change their saving behavior. These observations might be useful for policymakers who concern the economic recovery after this pandemic disaster.

A better understanding of human immunity to this parasite can provide new insights for vaccine development. Plasmodium vivax Reticulocyte Binding Proteins (RBPs) are key parasite proteins that interact with human proteins during erythrocyte invasion and are targets of the human immune response. The aim of this study is to characterize the human antibody response to RBP2P1, the most recently described member of the RBP family. METHODS: The levels of total IgG and IgM against RBP2P1 were measured using plasmas from 68 P. vivax malaria patients and 525 villagers in a malarious village of western Thailand. The latter group comprises asymptomatic carriers and healthy uninfected individuals. Subsets of plasma samples were evaluated for anti-RBP2P1 IgG subtypes and complement-fixing activity. RESULTS: As age increased, it was found that the level of anti-RBP2P1 IgG increased while the level of IgM decreased. The main anti-RBP2P1 IgG subtypes were IgG1 and IgG3. The IgG3-seropositive rate was higher in asymptomatic carriers than in patients. The higher level of IgG3 was correlated with higher in vitro RBP2P1-mediated complement fixing activity. CONCLUSIONS: In natural infection, the primary IgG response to RBP2P1 was IgG1 and IgG3. The predominance of these cytophilic subtypes and the elevated level of IgG3 correlating with complement fixing activity, suggest a possible role of anti-RBP2P1 antibodies in immunity against P. vivax.","output":"Naturally induced humoral response against Plasmodium vivax reticulocyte binding protein 2P1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The emergence of COVID\\\\19 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) as a novel coronavirus in late 2019 necessitated public health measures that have impacted the provision of care for people living with dementia and their families.

Additionally, isolation resulting from social distancing may be harming well\\\\being for families as formal and informal supports become less accessible. METHOD: To understand lived experiences and necessary changes in models of care delivery for people living with dementia during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in Canada, we remotely interviewed 20 dyads of people living with dementia and their care partners who normally attend a dementia specialty clinic in Calgary, Alberta, during a period where essential businesses were closed and health care had abruptly transitioned to telemedicine. Participants were 50% female and a majority of clinic patients in the dyad had a diagnosis of Alzheimers Disease (75%). A reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyze the interview and field note data. RESULT: Themes regarding virtual service provision emerged through the iterative qualitative data analysis: (1) continuation of community\\\\based services for care partners and families delivered in innovative ways to meet support needs during the pandemic; (2) guidance in adapting to technology to enable accessible and effective treatment in a virtual care environment; (3) adapting the process and structure of virtual appointments to operationalize critical information provision while maintaining dignity for the person living with dementia. CONCLUSION: The rapid move to virtual healthcare has influenced how and when people access health services. Health system innovation in the way we structure service models and care provision can mitigate barriers to maintaining high quality virtual health care for people living with dementia.

METHODS: We invited people using PrEP who had an STI in the past 24 months to participate in this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, AB/BA crossover superiority trial at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium. Using block randomisation (block size eight), participants were assigned (1:1) to first receive Listerine Cool Mint or a placebo mouthwash. They were required to use the study mouthwashes daily and before and after sex for 3 months each and to ask their sexual partners to use the mouthwash before and after sex. Participants were screened every 3 months for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea at the oropharynx, anorectum, and urethra. The primary outcome was combined incidence of these STIs during each 3-month period, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all participants who completed at least the first 3-month period. Safety was assessed as a secondary outcome. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03881007. FINDINGS: Between April 2, 2019, and March 13, 2020, 343 participants were enrolled: 172 in the Listerine followed by placebo (Listerine-placebo) group and 171 in the placebo followed by Listerine (placebo-Listerine) group. The trial was terminated prematurely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 151 participants completed the entire study, and 89 completed only the first 3-month period. 31 participants withdrew consent, ten were lost to follow-up, and one acquired HIV. In the Listerine-placebo group, the STI incidence rate was 1404 per 100 person-years during the Listerine period, and 1026 per 100 person-years during the placebo period. In the placebo-Listerine arm, the STI incidence rate was 1339 per 100 person-years during the placebo period, and 1475 per 100 person-years during the Listerine period. We did not find that Listerine significantly reduced STI incidence (IRR 117, 95% CI 084-164).

To study this, the formation of episodic memories was evaluated by free recall, recognition, and episode order tasks for an aversive and neutral content. The results indicated that aversive episodic memory is impaired both in the free recall task and in the recognition task. Even the beneficial effect that emotional memory usually has for the episodic order was undermined as there were no differences between the neutral and aversive condition.

Because unintended hypothermia has significant consequences, there is a need for more effective warming strategies. The effectiveness of warming technologies that apply heat through the skin is based on surface-area contact with the heat source and the duration of pre-warming. Therefore, we sought to test the therapeutic effectiveness of combined above- and below-warming therapies. Our hospital prohibits forced-air warming before the patient is draped, so a secondary goal was to determine the effect of preoperative warming using a system that does not interfere with airflow in the operating room. METHODS We prospectively randomized 35 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty into two groups: 1) forced-air warming/water mattress, using both WarmTouch? upper-body forced-air warming (Medtronic/Covidien Inc., Dublin, Ireland) and a Norm-O-Temp? underbody water mattress (CSZ/Gentherm Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA), and 2) conductive fabric warming, using a HotDog? electric upper-body blanket (Augustine Temperature Management LLC, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) and a HotDog? underbody mattress. RESULTS Throughout the surgical procedure, group 2 patients had significantly higher temperatures; this group experienced superior pre-warming during preoperative preparations and thus the redistribution temperature drop following the induction of anesthesia was reduced.

Iron dyshomeostasis and peroxidation damage of neurons in some particular brain regions are closely related to a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases known as \\"tauopathies,\\" in which intracellular aggregation of microtubule-associated protein tau is the common neuropathological feature. However, the relationship between ferroptosis and tau aggregation is not well understood. The current study demonstrates that erastin-induced ferroptosis can promote tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation in mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2a cells). Moreover, ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 can alleviate tau aggregation effectively. In-depth mechanism research indicates that activated glycogen synthase kinase-3? (GSK-3?) is responsible for the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau. More importantly, proteasome inhibition can exacerbate tau degradation obstacle and accelerate tau aggregation in the process of ferroptosis. Our results indicate that ferroptosis can lead to abnormal aggregation of tau protein and might be a promising therapeutic target of tauopathies.","output":"Ferroptosis promotes microtubule-associated protein tau aggregation via GSK-3? activation and proteasome inhibition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding collective mobility patterns is crucial to plan the restart of production and economic activities, which are currently put in stand-by to fight the diffusion of the epidemics. In this report, we use mobile phone data to infer the movements of people between Italian provinces and municipalities, and we analyze the incoming, outcoming and internal mobility flows before and during the national lockdown (March 9th, 2020) and after the closure of non-necessary productive and economic activities (March 23th, 2020). The population flow across provinces and municipalities enable for the modelling of a risk index tailored for the mobility of each municipality or province. Such an index would be a useful indicator to drive counter-measures in reaction to a sudden reactivation of the epidemics. Mobile phone data, even when aggregated to preserve the privacy of individuals, are a useful data source to track the evolution in time of human mobility, hence allowing for monitoring the effectiveness of control measures such as physical distancing. We address the following analytical questions: How does the mobility structure of a territory change? Do incoming and outcoming flows become more predictable during the lockdown, and what are the differences between weekdays and weekends? Can we detect proper local job markets based on human mobility flows, to eventually shape the borders of a local outbreak?","output":"Mobile phone data analytics against the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy: flow diversity and local job markets during the national lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Clinical ethics support services (CESS) have been developing worldwide with growing interest in evaluating their quality. Paediatric-specific CESSs (p-CESS) have received little attention, and evidence from adult services might not be generalisable. Evidence on service models and practices is crucial to inform further research and debate on quality evaluation and minimum standards for p-CESSs. We aim to systematically identify, appraise and synthesise evidence for p-CESS structures, processes and outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a mixed-studies systematic review including peer-reviewed empirical studies published in English or Spanish language providing data on the evaluation and/or impact on any aspect of p-CESS. We will search seven electronic databases: MEDLINE, Philosophers Index, EMBASE, PsycINFO, LILACS, Web of Science and CINHAL, without filters applied. Search terms will be related to clinical ethics support AND paediatrics AND structure/process/outcome. Reference and citation list of included studies will be handsearched. A 10% random sample of retrieved titles/abstracts and all full texts will be independently dual-screened. We will conduct narrative and thematic synthesis for quantitative and qualitative data, respectively, following sequential explanatory synthesis guided by Donabedians framework of structure, process and outcomes.

To perform detection and classification of breast cancer many computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been established because the inspection of the mammogram images by the radiologist is a difficult and time taken task. To early diagnose the disease and provide better treatment lot of CAD systems were established. There is still a need to improve existing CAD systems by incorporating new methods and technologies in order to provide more precise results. This paper aims to investigate ways to prevent the disease as well as to provide new methods of classification in order to reduce the risk of breast cancer in womens lives. The best feature optimization is performed to classify the results accurately. The CAD systems accuracy improved by reducing the false-positive rates.The Modified Entropy Whale Optimization Algorithm (MEWOA) is proposed based on fusion for deep feature extraction and perform the classification. In the proposed method, the fine-tuned MobilenetV2 and Nasnet Mobile are applied for simulation. The features are extracted, and optimization is performed. The optimized features are fused and optimized by using MEWOA. Finally, by using the optimized deep features, the machine learning classifiers are applied to classify the breast cancer images. To extract the features and perform the classification, three publicly available datasets are used: INbreast, MIAS, and CBIS-DDSM. The maximum accuracy achieved in INbreast dataset is 99.7%, MIAS dataset has 99.8% and CBIS-DDSM has 93.8%.

Telehealth (online videoconferencing) interventions may be able to address the gap in tailored, evidence-based supportive interventions. We evaluated an online, group-based, videoconference-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention (Recapture Life) in a randomized trial. Forty cancer survivors between the ages of 15C25 years participated. No positive impacts on participants quality of life emerged immediately following the intervention, but Recapture Life participants reported using more adaptive coping skills. Recapture Life participants also reported higher negative impact of cancer, anxiety and depression at a 12-month follow-up. Additional analyses suggested that survivors benefitted differently from the two online interventions (Recapture Life vs. peer-support group) depending on how recently they had completed their cancer treatment. Our data highlight that different survivor sub-groups may find group-based, telehealth psychological interventions more or less helpful at different points in survivorship. ABSTRACT: Telehealth interventions offer a practical platform to support adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors mental health needs after treatment, yet efficacy data are lacking. We evaluated an online, group-based, videoconferencing-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention (Recapture Life) in a 3-arm randomized-controlled trial comparing Recapture Life with an online peer-support group, and a waitlist control, with the aim of testing its impact on quality of life, emotional distress and healthcare service use. Forty AYAs (M(age) = 20.6 years) within 24-months of completing treatment participated, together with 18 support persons. No groupwise impacts were measured immediately after the six-week intervention. However, Recapture Life participants reported using more CBT skills at the six-week follow-up (OR = 5.58, 95% CI = 2.00C15.56, p = 0.001) than peer-support controls. Recapture Life participants reported higher perceived negative impact of cancer, anxiety and depression at 12-month follow-up, compared to peer-support controls. Post-hoc analyses suggested that AYAs who were further from completing cancer treatment responded better to Recapture Life than those who had completed treatment more recently. While online telehealth interventions hold promise, recruitment to this trial was challenging. As the psychological challenges of cancer survivorship are likely to evolve with time, different support models may prove more or less helpful for different sub-groups of AYA survivors at different times.","output":"Online, Group-Based Psychological Support for Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivors: Results from the Recapture Life Randomized Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction/Background*The SARS-CoV-2 global-pandemic has caused a crisis disrupting health systems worldwide. Whilst efforts are afoot to determine the extent of disruption, impact on gynaecological oncology trainees/training has not been explored. We present data from an international survey on impact of SARS-CoV-2 on clinical practice, medical education, and mental wellbeing of surgical gynaecological oncology trainees.MethodologyIn our prospective cohort study, a customised web-based-survey was circulated to surgical gynaecological oncology trainees from national/international organisations (May-November 2020). Validated questionnaires assessed mental wellbeing. Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fishers exact test tested hypothesis about differences in means and proportions. Multiple linear regression evaluated effect of variables on psychological/mental wellbeing outcomes. Outcomes included clinical practice, medical education, anxiety & depression, distress, mental wellbeingResult(s)*127 trainees from 34 countries responded. 52% (66/127) were from countries with national training programmes (UK/USA/Netherlands/Canada/Australia) and 48% (61/127) from non-national training programme countries. 28% had suspected/confirmed COVID19;28% experienced drop in household income;20% self-isolated from households;45% had to re-use personal protective equipment and 22% purchased their own. 32.3% (41/127) trainees (national training programme trainees=16.6% (11/66);non national training programme trainees=49.1% (30/61), p=0.02) require additional time to complete their training fellowship. The additional training time anticipated did not differ between trainees from countries with/without national training programmes (p=0.11). Surgical training was detrimentally impacted for 50% trainees, with more national training programme trainees (62.3% (38/61) than non national training programme trainees (38.5% (25/65), p=0.01) reporting a detrimental impact despite a greater reduction in mean surgical exposure reported by non national training programme trainees. Departmental teaching continued throughout the pandemic for 69% (87/126) trainees, albeit at reduced frequency for 16.1% (14/87), and virtually for 88.5% (77/87). Trainees reporting adequate pastoral support had better mental wellbeing with lower-levels of anxiety/depression (p=0.02) and distress (p<0.001). National training programme trainees experienced higher levels of distress (p=0.01). Mean mental wellbeing scores were significantly higher pre-pandemic (8.3 (SD=1.6) versus post-pandemic (7 (SD=1.8);p=<0.01).Conclusion*SARS-CoV-2 has negatively impacted surgical training, household income and psychological/mental wellbeing of surgical gynaecological oncology trainees.

This pathogen primarily infects the respiratory system of the afflicted, usually resulting in pneumonia and in a severe case of acute respiratory distress syndrome. These disease developments result in the formation of different pathological structures in the lungs, similar to those observed in other viral pneumonias that can be detected by the use of chest X-rays. For this reason, the detection and analysis of the pulmonary regions, the main focus of affection of COVID-19, becomes a crucial part of both clinical and automatic diagnosis processes. Due to the overload of the health services, portable X-ray devices are widely used, representing an alternative to fixed devices to reduce the risk of cross-contamination. However, these devices entail different complications as the image quality that, together with the subjectivity of the clinician, make the diagnostic process more difficult. In this work, we developed a novel fully automatic methodology specially designed for the identification of these lung regions in X-ray images of low quality as those from portable devices. To do so, we took advantage of a large dataset from magnetic resonance imaging of a similar pathology and performed two stages of transfer learning to obtain a robust methodology with a low number of images from portable X-ray devices.

A previous drug repurposing screen identified the approved anthelminthic drug niclosamide as a small molecule inhibitor of Zika virus infection. However, as antihelminthic drugs are generally designed to have low absorption when dosed orally, the very limited bioavailability of niclosamide will likely hinder its potential direct repurposing as an antiviral medication. Here, we conducted SAR studies focusing on the anilide and salicylic acid regions of niclosamide to improve physicochemical properties such as microsomal metabolic stability, permeability and solubility. We found that the 5-bromo substitution in the salicylic acid region retains potency while providing better drug-like properties. Other modifications in the anilide region with 2'-OMe and 2'-H substitutions were also advantageous. We found that the 4'-NO2 substituent can be replaced with a 4'-CN or 4'-CF3 substituents. Together, these modifications provide a basis for optimizing the structure of niclosamide to improve systemic exposure for application of niclosamide analogs as drug lead candidates for treating Zika and other viral infections. Indeed, key analogs were also able to rescue cells from the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating relevance for therapeutic strategies targeting the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Application of niclosamide and analogs as small molecule inhibitors of Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aims at identifying main barriers faced by people living with diabetes in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on people with diabetes in Brazil.

Data analysis A retrospective analysis of an eight-week period (February-April 2020) collated 1,471 patient records and examined diagnoses, procedures performed and COVID-19 status of patients and staff. Any attempts made to access routine dental care before presentation in secondary care were recorded. Results In the study period, one member of staff was confirmed as COVID-19-positive. Sixty-three patients had formal COVID-19 tests; all were negative. Forty-three patients were admitted for drainage of odontogenic fascial space infections; 53% reported delayed or failed attempts to access dental care before their infection.

People often imagine how events might have turned out \\"if only\\" something had been different. The \\"fault lines\\" of reality, those aspects more readily changed, indicate that counterfactual thoughts are guided by the same principles as rational thoughts. In the past, rationality and imagination have been viewed as opposites. But research has shown that rational thought is more imaginative than cognitive scientists had supposed. In The Rational Imagination, I argue that imaginative thought is more rational than scientists have imagined. People exhibit remarkable similarities in the sorts of things they change in their mental representation of reality when they imagine how the facts could have turned out differently. For example, they tend to imagine alternatives to actions rather than inactions, events within their control rather than those beyond their control, and socially unacceptable events rather than acceptable ones. Their thoughts about how an event might have turned out differently lead them to judge that a strong causal relation exists between an antecedent event and the outcome, and their thoughts about how an event might have turned out the same lead them to judge that a weaker causal relation exists. In a simple temporal sequence, people tend to imagine alternatives to the most recent event. The central claim in the book is that counterfactual thoughts are organised along the same principles as rational thought. The idea that the counterfactual imagination is rational depends on three steps: (1) humans are capable of rational thought; (2) they make inferences by thinking about possibilities; and (3) their counterfactual thoughts rely on thinking about possibilities, just as rational thoughts do. The sorts of possibilities that people envisage explain the mutability of certain aspects of mental representations and the immutability of other aspects.","output":"Prcis of The rational imagination: how people create alternatives to reality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Australia's response to the coronavirus outbreak has widely been considered to be among the most successful in the world A bipartisan 'national government' akin to that in wartime, a fairly unified COVID response by the federal and all the state governments, international border closures and quarantine, some of the best coronavirus testing in the world, and widespread public acceptance of physical distancing, all contributed to Australia being able to call itself the 'lucky country' in its successful navigation of the COVID crisis The country clearly had a plan for the mental health consequences of COVID The impacts of lockdown were identified early, and steps taken to mitigate them There was no spike in tertiary mental health presentations Telehealth was embraced, support services mobilized, and public awareness of mental health issues made part of the conversation While anxiety seemed raised nationwide, much of this lays at a subclinical level, manifesting through activities such as increased consumption of alcohol Management of the burden of increased nationwide anxiety was carried out through online-based nongovernmental organizations, often directly recommended by the government itself","output":"Mental health impact of COVID-19: Australian perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rapid spread of SARS\\\\CoV2 has come a rapid proliferation of clinical research studies, resulting in considerable strain on research ethics committees (RECS), which need to review study proposals.

A monovalent pH1N1 vaccine was separately produced in addition to the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine. Formulation of the seasonal influenza vaccine (injectable trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [TIV] vs. intranasal live, attenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV]) was postulated to have impacted the efficacy of the pH1N1 vaccination. METHODS: We reviewed electronic health and databases, which included vaccination records, and healthcare encounters for influenza-like illness (ILI), influenza, and pneumonia among US military members. We examined rates by vaccination type to identify factors associated with the risk for study outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with those receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine alone, subjects receiving the pH1N1 vaccine, either alone (RR, 0.49) or in addition to the seasonal vaccine (RR, 0.51), had an approximately 50% reduction in ILI, 88% reduction in influenza (RR, 0.11 and 0.12, respectively), and 63% reduction in pneumonia (RR, 0.37 and 0.35, respectively). There was no clinically significant difference in ILI, influenza, or pneumonia attack rates among those receiving the pH1N1 vaccine with or without presence of the seasonal vaccine. Similarly, there was no clinically relevant difference in pH1N1 effectiveness between seasonal TIV and LAIV recipients. CONCLUSIONS: During the 2009C2010 pandemic, the pH1N1 vaccination was effective in reducing rates of ILI, influenza, and pneumonia. Administration of the seasonal vaccine should continue without concern of potential interference with a novel pandemic vaccine, though more studies are needed to determine if this is applicable to other influenza seasons.","output":"Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Impact on Pandemic H1N1 Vaccine Efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study was conducted to evaluate the status of depression and anxiety of healthcare workers and to explore the risk factors during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China.

The growing number of Internet-of-things (IoT) high-wattage appliances, such as air conditioners and electric vehicles, being connected to the power grid, together with the high dependence of ICT and control interfaces, make CPES vulnerable to high-impact, low-probability load-changing cyberattacks. Moreover, the side-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate a modification of electricity consumption patterns with utilities experiencing significant net-load and peak reductions. These unusual sustained low load demand conditions could be leveraged by adversaries to cause frequency instabilities in CPES by compromising hundreds of thousands of IoT-connected high-wattage loads. This article presents a feasibility study of the impacts of load-changing attacks on CPES during the low loading conditions caused by the lockdown measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. The load demand reductions caused by the lockdown measures are analyzed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), focusing on the March-to-July 2020 period and the New York region as the most impacted time period and location in terms of load reduction due to the lockdowns being in full execution. Our feasibility study evaluates load-changing attack scenarios using real load consumption data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) and shows that an attacker with sufficient knowledge and resources could be capable of producing frequency stability problems, with frequency excursions going up to 60.5 Hz and 63.4 Hz, when no mitigation measures are taken.","output":"On the Feasibility of Load-Changing Attacks in Power Systems During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza A virus (IAV) has caused seasonal influenza epidemics and influenza pandemics, which resulted in serious threat to public health and socioeconomic impacts.

Currently, the standard paradigm for HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) is based on central air systems that tie delivery of heating and cooling to delivery of fresh air. To prevent heat loss, the delivery of fresh air must be tightly controlled and often limited through recirculation of already heated air. Buildings are designed with air-tight envelopes, which do not allow for natural ventilation, and depend on energy-intensive central-air systems. As closed environments, buildings have become sites of rapid COVID-19 transmission. In this research, we demonstrate the energy cost of increasing outdoor air supply with standard systems per COVID-19 recommendations and introduce an alternative HVAC paradigm that maximizes the decoupling of ventilation and thermal control. We first consider a novel analysis of the energy costs of increasing the amount of conditioned fresh air using standard HVAC systems to address COVID-19 concerns. We then present an alternative that includes a novel membrane-assisted radiant system we have studied for cooling in humid climates, in place of an air conditioning system. The proposed system can work in conjunction with natural ventilation and thus decreases the risk of indoor spread of infectious diseases and significantly lowers energy consumption in buildings. Our results modeling HVAC energy in different climates show increased outdoor air in standard HVAC systems can double cooling costs, while increasing natural ventilation with radiant systems can halve HVAC costs. More specifically it is possible to add up to 100 days' worth of natural ventilation while saving energy, when coupling natural ventilation and radiant systems. This combination decreases energy cost by 10-45% in 60 major cities globally, while increasing fresh air intake.","output":"A Fresh (Air) Look at Ventilation for COVID-19: Estimating the global energy savings potential of coupling natural ventilation with novel radiant cooling strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We identified a strain of Alphacoronavirus 1, FCoV-SB22, from a pool of fecal samples from domestic cats from a rural settlement in the municipality of Santa Brbara, Par, Brazil.

Vitamin D deficiency has been postulated as a determinant of severity. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence relevant to vitamin D and COVID-19. METHODS: Narrative review. RESULTS: Regression modelling shows that more northerly countries in the Northern Hemisphere are currently (May 2020) showing relatively high COVID-19 mortality, with an estimated 4.4% increase in mortality for each 1 degree latitude north of 28 degrees North (P = 0.031) after adjustment for age of population. This supports a role for ultraviolet B acting via vitamin D synthesis. Factors associated with worse COVID-19 prognosis include old age, ethnicity, male sex, obesity, diabetes and hypertension and these also associate with deficiency of vitamin D or its response. Vitamin D deficiency is also linked to severity of childhood respiratory illness. Experimentally, vitamin D increases the ratio of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to ACE, thus increasing angiotensin II hydrolysis and reducing subsequent inflammatory cytokine response to pathogens and lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial evidence supports a link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity but it is all indirect. Community-based placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation may be difficult. Further evidence could come from study of COVID-19 outcomes in large cohorts with information on prescribing data for vitamin D supplementation or assay of serum unbound 25(OH) vitamin D levels.

As descending serotonergic projections from the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) to the spinal dorsal horn develop postnatally, this study aims to investigate the long-term effect of repetitive neonatal procedural pain on the descending serotonergic RVM-spinal dorsal horn network. A well-established rat model of repetitive noxious procedures is used in which neonatal rats received four noxious needle pricks or tactile stimulation with a cotton swab per day in the left hind paw from day of birth to postnatal Day 7. Control animals were left undisturbed. When animals reached adulthood, tissue was collected for quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in the RVM and spinal dorsal horn. Both repetitive noxious and tactile procedures in the neonate decreased the 5-HT staining intensity in the adult ipsilateral but not contralateral spinal dorsal horn. Repetitive neonatal noxious procedures resulted in an increased area covered with 5-HT staining in the adult RVM ipsilateral to the side of injury, whereas repetitive neonatal tactile stimulation resulted in increased 5-HT staining intensity in both the ipsi- and contralateral RVM. The number of 5-HT cells in adult RVM is unaffected by neonatal conditions. This detailed anatomical study shows that not only neonatal noxious procedures but also repetitive tactile procedures result in long-lasting anatomical changes of the descending serotonergic system within the RVM and spinal dorsal horn. Future studies should investigate whether these anatomical changes translate to functional differences in descending serotonergic modulation after neonatal adverse experiences.","output":"Anatomical changes in descending serotonergic projections from the rostral ventromedial medulla to the spinal dorsal horn following repetitive neonatal painful procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care in a tertiary hospital of South Korea without the specific lockdown measures. Methods: A retrospective cohort of cancer patients from one of the largest tertiary hospitals in South Korea was used to compare the healthcare utilization in different settings (outpatient clinic, emergency department (ED), and admission) between the period of January 1 and December 31, 2020 and the same time period in 2019. The percent changes in healthcare utilization between two periods were calculated. Results: A total of 448,833 cases from the outpatient cohort, 26,781 cases from the ED cohort, and 14,513 cases from the admission cohort were reviewed for 2019 and 2020. The total number of ED visit cases significantly decreased in 2020 than in 2019 by 18.04%, whereas the proportion of cancer patients maintained. The reduction in ED visits was more prominent in cases with COVID-19 suspicious symptoms, with high acuity, and those who lived in non-capital city area. There were no significant changes in the number of total visits and new cases in the outpatient clinic between two periods. No significant differences in the total number of hospitalizations were observed between two periods.

This descriptive study analyzes the exposure characteristics of HCWs to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: In March 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, a total of 58 HCWs in a regional hospital in Greece were exposed to three patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. These three index cases had taken part in an 8-day religious tour, during which 52 travelers spent 10 h every day in a tour bus. A study was made of the circumstances of the hospital exposure. Results: Of the 52 travelers in the bus, 48 contracted SARS-CoV2. None of the 58 HCW contacts developed symptoms related to COVID-19, although, 43% were exposed to a SARS-CoV-2 infected patient for more than 15 min, and 74% were within a distance of <1 m, and half of the contacts were not wearing a surgical mask. Additional information was that 63% of the contacts were exposed in a room sized more than 15 m(2), and in more than 80% of cases, the window or the door to the room was open during their exposure. In about one-third of the exposure events, the HCW contacts were not wearing a mask and were at a distance of <1 m, and just under half of them were exposed for more than 15 min. One-fourth of the contacts underwent RT-PCR testing, and 11% IgG/IgM antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2, all of which were negative. All observed quarantine at home for 14 days. Conclusion: This observational study was made before the extent of the SARS-CoV-2 became apparent, and before routine preventive measures were observed by all HCWs. Comparing the conditions of exposure in the two different settings (bus vs. regional health facility), it is apparent that the duration of exposure and the small, enclosed nature of the bus are the distinguishing factors.

We examined hospitals based on their size, location, trauma certification, median household income, and reliance on public insurance. COVID-19 inpatient burdens (ie, beds occupied by COVID-19 patients), relative to overall facility capacity (ie, total beds), were reported and assessed using thresholds established by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation to approximate the stress induced by different COVID-19 levels. RESULTS: Maximum (ie, peak) daily COVID-19 occupancy averaged 27.5% (SD 11.2%) across the 28 hospitals. However, there was dramatic variation between hospitals, with maximum daily COVID-19 occupancy ranging from 5.7% to 50.0%. Smaller hospitals remained above 20% COVID-19 capacity for longer (small hospital median 27.5 days [interquartile range {IQR}: 4 to 32]; medium hospital median 18.5 days [IQR: 0.5 to 37]; large hospital median 13 days [IQR: 6 to 32]). Trauma centers reached 20% capacity sooner (median 19 days [IQR: 16-25] versus nontrauma median 30 days [IQR: 20 to 128]), remained above 20% capacity for longer (median 31 days [IQR: 11 to 38]; nontrauma median 8 days [IQR: 0 to 30]), and had higher observed burdens relative to their total capacity (median 5.8% [IQR: 2.4% to 8.3%]; nontrauma median 2.5% [IQR: 1.6% to 2.8%]). Urban location was also predictive of higher COVID-19 patient burden (urban median 3.8% [IQR: 2.6% to 6.7%]; suburban median 2.2% [IQR: 1.5% to 2.8%]). Heat map analyses demonstrated that hospitals in lower-income areas and hospitals in areas of higher reliance on public insurance also exhibited substantially higher COVID-19 occupancy and longer periods of higher COVID-19 occupancy. CONCLUSION: Substantial discrepancies in COVID-19 inpatient burdens existed among Philadelphia-region adult acute care facilities during the initial COVID-19 surge. Trauma center status, urban location, low household income, and high reliance on public insurance were associated with both higher COVID-19 burdens and longer periods of high occupancy.

METHODS A questionnaire was designed for completion by a senior clinician or service manager in each participating unit between April-September 2020. The survey was incorporated into existing national-level audits in Germany (n=71), Scotland (n=16), and Ireland (n=16). Responses from a further 81 units were obtained via online survey. RESULTS There were 185 units from 14 countries that returned the survey. 102/160 (63.7%) units reported a worsening of overall service quality, which was attributed predominantly to staff redistribution, reallocation of inpatient areas, and reduced access to surgical facilities. There was a high rate of redeployment of staff to other services, with two thirds having lost specialist orthopaedic nurses, a third orthogeriatrics services, and a quarter physiotherapists. Reallocation of inpatient areas resulted in patients being managed by non-specialised teams in generic wards, which increased the patients and staff transit between clinical areas. There was reduced operating department access, with 74/160 (46.2%) centres reporting a >50% reduction. Reduced theatre efficiency was reported by 135/160 (84.4%) and was attributed to staff and resource redistribution, longer anaesthetic and transfer times, and delays for preoperative COVID-19 testing and using personal protective equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION Hip fracture services were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic and this may have a sustained impact on health and social care. Protection of hip fracture services is essential to ensure satisfactory outcomes for this vulnerable patient group.","output":"IMPACT of COVID-19 on hip fracture services: a global survey by the International Multicentre Project Auditing COVID-19 in Trauma & Orthopaedics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The immunity conferred after a first SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent risk of persistent infection or reinfection are not fully elucidated.

A descriptive study design was deployed. A total of 56 health workers and four service user participants responded to a structured questionnaire (n = 50) or took part in key informant interviews (n = 10) in five high HIV-prevalence provinces. Most participants did not disclose if they were living with HIV, except for four participants who responded to the questionnaire and were selected for being open about living with HIV. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with health workers in key government health facility positions. The questions were standardized and used a Likert scale. Descriptive statistical and thematic analyses were applied to the data. Results show that antiretroviral treatment (ART) has an impact on stigma reduction. Almost half the participants agreed that treatment is reducing levels of HIV stigma. However, fears of exposure of HIV status and labelling and judgemental attitudes persist. No comprehensive stigma reduction policies and guidelines in healthcare facilities were mentioned. Informal flexible systems to deliver HIV services were in place for health workers living with HIV, illustrating how stigma can be quietly navigated. Lack of confidentiality in healthcare facilities plays a role in fuelling disclosure issues and hampering access to testing and treatment. Stigma reduction training needs standardization.

The quality of the included papers was appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Data of interest were collected and evaluated for their compatibility for the meta-analysis. Cumulative calculations to determine the correlation and effect estimates were performed using the Z test. Results: In total, 19 papers recording 1,934 mild and 1,644 severe cases of COVID-19 were included. Based on the initial evaluation, 62 potential risk factors were identified for the meta-analysis. Several comorbidities, including chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were observed more frequent among patients with severe COVID-19 than with the mild ones. Compared to the mild form, severe COVID-19 was associated with symptoms such as dyspnea, anorexia, fatigue, increased respiratory rate, and high systolic blood pressure. Lower levels of lymphocytes and hemoglobin; elevated levels of leukocytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, high-sensitivity troponin, creatine kinase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin; and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also associated with severe COVID-19.

The preparation of the ACAF was performed through chemical and physical activation processes with the presence of ZnCl(2) and at a temperature of 450 C. The ACAF yield was 44.7% of the fresh Azolla filiculoides. The results obtained from the characterization study indicate that the prepared ACAF has excellent surface and internal properties to be used as an adsorbent. The surface area, porosity, and pore volume were estimated to be 716.4 m(2)/g, 51.2%, and 0.621 cm(3)/g, respectively. The functional groups in ACAF that were responsible for the adsorption of ampicillin molecules were detected using FTIR analyses. The maximum efficiency (96.84%) and uptake (114.3 mg/g) of ACAF to remove ampicillin were achieved under the following conditions: ACAF dose = 0.8 g/L, pH = 7, concentration of ampicillin = 100 mg/L, contact time = 60 min, and temperature = 45 C. It was found that the kinetic and isotherm data matched the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models with high precision values, respectively. Considering the thermodynamics of the adsorption, the endothermic and spontaneous nature of the ampicillin adsorption onto ACAF was approved. The ampicillin adsorption capacity by ACAF was not significantly affected by the presence of different concentrations of NaNO(3) competitor ion. The considerably higher adsorption capacity of the ACAF for ampicillin (114.3 mg/g) than other previously used adsorbents with excellent regeneration level (five cycles) depicts the superior performance of ACAF in the adsorption systems.

Both experiences of care and satisfaction are important to measure so that quality can be monitored and improved. Globally, women experience mistreatment during childbirth at facilities; however, there is limited evidence exploring the mistreatment and womens satisfaction with care during childbirth. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey within the WHO study How women are treated during facility-based childbirth exploring the mistreatment of women during childbirth in Ghana, Guinea, Myanmar and Nigeria. Womens experiences of mistreatment and satisfaction with care during childbirth was explored. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was conducted to evaluate the association between mistreatment, womens overall satisfaction with the care they received, and whether they would recommend the facility to others. RESULTS: 2672 women were included in this analysis. Despite over one-third of women reporting experience of mistreatment (35.4%), overall satisfaction for services received and recommendation of the facility to others was high, 88.4% and 90%, respectively. Women who reported experiences of mistreatment were more likely to report lower satisfaction with care: women were more likely to be satisfied if they did not experience verbal abuse (adjusted OR (AOR) 4.52, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.85), or had short waiting times (AOR 5.12, 95% CI 3.94 to 6.65). Women who did not experience any physical or verbal abuse or discrimination were more likely to recommend the facility to others (AOR 3.89, 95% CI 2.98 to 5.06). CONCLUSION: Measuring both womens experiences and their satisfaction with care are critical to assess quality and provide actionable evidence for quality improvement.

The models will divide the populations of both countries in three categories: the subpopulation susceptible to be infected of the disease, the subpopulation which is already infected and thus is infectious, and the subpopulation which has already recovered from the disease so is considered immune. The transmission rate is calculated within these models while considering the different locations and, more importantly, the lockdown measures implemented during 2020. The efficiency of these measures is compared between the areas of infection and the different levels of lockdown. ABSTRACT: Two discrete mathematical SIR models (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) are proposed for modelling the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) through Spain and Italy. One of the proposed models is delay-free while the other one considers a delay in the propagation of the infection. The objective is to estimate the transmission, also known as infectivity rate, through time taking into account the infection evolution data supplied by the official health care systems in both countries. Such a parameter is estimated through time at different regional levels and it is seen to be strongly dependent on the intervention measures such as the total (except essential activities) or partial levels of lockdown. Typically, the infectivity rate evolves towards a minimum value under total lockdown and it increases again when the confinement measures are partially or totally removed.","output":"A Modelization of the Propagation of COVID-19 in Regions of Spain and Italy with Evaluation of the Transmission Rates Related to the Intervention Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently submitted 784 SARS-nCoV2 whole genome sequences from NCBI Virus database were taken for constructing phylogenetic tree to look into their similarities.

RESULTS: The Screening routine is variably well-integrated into daily clinical practice. Structural barriers such as time pressure and a lack of focus on mental distress in nursing are present. Barriers on the side of nurses are primarily a lack of knowledge and communication insecurities when dealing with patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for training and implementation of a disciplinary screening approach. The structural and organizational barriers, which are a challenge for the successful screening process due to unfavorable interdisciplinary team communication and clinical daily structure, should be addressed in further studies.

Swelling was still present after 6 weeks. In the second case, remdesivir infiltration occurred in a 72-year-old male, resulting in edema, hematoma, and pain at the area of infiltration. The hematoma lasted for 7 days. The third case concerned a 67-year-old woman, in whom remdesivir infiltration led to edema and a small hematoma. The hematoma regressed to a negligible size within 3 days. However, a week after infiltration, redness had reappeared. In 2 cases, the patient was immediately treated with hyaluronidase injections, but no specific treatments were provided in the other case. CONCLUSION: Based on the product information provided by remdesivir's manufacturer, we believe symptoms and signs observed in the 3 cases may have resulted from the low pH (~4) of the nonbuffered remdesivir solution, although the patients were not formally assessed for caustic injury. Previous experience with other noncytotoxic medications suggests that infusion-specific factors (eg, volume of leaked fluid) and patient-specific factors (eg, advanced age) may have a role in the outcome of remdesivir infiltration. The possibility of symptoms caused by cyclodextrins in the formulation or by intrinsic toxicity of remdesivir warrants exploration.","output":"Peripheral infiltration of remdesivir in 3 patients with COVID-19: Case series and discussion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past few months, our fellow citizens have heard more about public health than ever before. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shed light on the vital role played by public health for health protection and provided telling evidence about current public health capacity as well as the corrective measures to be taken and milestones to be achieved in the future. To this end, we identify several ways forward to re-empower public health in Qubec and thus ensure that it can significantly contribute to population health.

Periods of acute functional decline, triggered by acute disease, are common. Rehabilitation is often necessary to restore functioning. Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in the Netherlands have developed evidence-based geriatric rehabilitation for Parkinson (GR-P) programs. However, data on the experiences and needs of patients and their caregivers are lacking. This study aims to address these, in order to propose recommendations for improvement. METHODS: We performed a qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews in two Dutch SNFs offering GR-P. Nine patients with PD and six informal caregivers were included. We subjected verbatim transcripts of 15 interviews to qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Data saturation was reached after 15 interviews. Three overarching themes emerged: (1) autonomy, (2) sharing information and (3) contact with others. Loss of autonomy was linked to the underlying disease and the rehabilitation environment itself. Patients and caregivers felt overwhelmed by events before and during rehabilitation, expressing a need to receive information and discuss prior experiences. They considered communication between hospitals and SNFs to be poor. Patients did not always appreciate contact with peers. Both patients and caregivers appreciated empathic healthcare personnel with a firm knowledge on PD. CONCLUSIONS: Autonomy, sharing information and contact with others are central themes for patients and caregivers during GR-P in SNFs. We recommend actively exploring these three central themes with every patient and caregiver entering a GR-P program and offering staff continuing education on PD, in order to improve care.","output":"Parkinson rehabilitation in nursing homes: a qualitative exploration of the experiences of patients and caregivers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM AND OBJECTIVES To investigate the effect of a short-term Balint group on the improvement in communication ability and self-efficacy of pre-examination and triage nurses during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). BACKGROUND Working on the front lines of COVID-19 has brought unprecedented psychological stress on pre-examination and triage nurses. Nurse-patient communication ability and the level of self-efficacy are both significant for nurses' psychosomatic health and work input. However, limited empirical evidence exists regarding nurse-patient communication and self-efficacy and specific psychological intervention effects. DESIGN Cross-sectional research fulfilling the completed checklist of items that should be included in reports of cross-sectional studies (Supplementary File 1). METHODS Nurses (n=41) in the first layer of pre-examination and triage were engaged in a Balint group activity twice a week for two weeks. They were assessed with the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) pre- and postintervention, and a nurse-patient communication survey form was developed for further postintervention evaluation. The sample was recruited from a class A third -grade hospital in Sichuan, China. RESULTS Most of the subjects reported improvement in nurse-patient communication, increased cooperation between patients and their families, and a decreased missed examination rate after the intervention. Moreover, the total mean score of the GSES of nurses after the intervention was increased, but the difference was not statistically significant. The scores of all items in the GSES were improved, and the scores increase for item 4 (I am confident that I can effectively deal with any unexpected event) was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, a short-term Balint group activity can improve the communication ability and self-efficacy level of front-line nurses to some extent. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE This information may provide some theoretical support for the development of early psychological interventions during major epidemic situations.","output":"The effect of a short-term Balint group on the communication ability and self-efficacy of pre-examination and triage nurses during COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Italy was among the most severely hit European country by COVID-19 pandemic and, just as in other countries, healthcare workers emerged as a group at increased risk of becoming infected with the virus.

TAM signaling, which has largely studied in the immune system and in cancer, has been involved in coagulation-related pathologies. Because of these established biological functions, the GAS6-PROS1/TAM system is postulated to play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and progression complications. The participation of the TAM system in vascular function and pathology has been previously reported. However, in the context of COVID-19, the role of TAMs could provide new clues in virus-host interplay with important consequences in the way that we understand this pathology. From the viral mimicry used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells, to the immunothrombosis that is associated with respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients, TAM signaling seems to be involved at different stages of the disease. TAM targeting is becoming an interesting biomedical strategy, which is useful for COVID-19 treatment now, but also for other viral and inflammatory diseases in the future.","output":"Role of Vitamin K-Dependent Factors Protein S and GAS6 and TAM Receptors in SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19-Associated Immunothrombosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Doxorubicin is an effective chemotherapeutic agent prescribed to treat solid tumors (e.g., ovary, breast, and gastrointestinal cancers). This anti-cancer drug has various side effects, such as allergic reactions, cardiac damage, hair loss, bone marrow suppression, vomiting, and bladder irritation. The most dangerous side effect of doxorubicin is cardiomyopathy, leading to congestive heart failure. The exact mechanisms of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity remain incompletely understood. Alteration in myocardial structure and functional cardiac disorders is provoked by doxorubicin administration; subsequently, cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure can occur. Congestive heart failure due to doxorubicin is associated with mortality and morbidity. Probably, doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity starts from myocardial cell injury and is followed by left ventricular dysfunction. Many factors and multiple pathways are responsible for the creation of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress pathways, mitochondrial damage, intracellular Ca2+ overload, iron-free radical production, DNA, and myocyte membrane injuries have critical roles in the pathophysiology of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Unfortunately, there are currently a few medications for the treatment of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in clinical settings. Extensive basic and clinical researches have been carried out to discover preventive treatments.

Macroeconomic euphoria and external uncertainty make its evolutionary patterns highly complex. We propose a two-stage granular framework to perform predictive analysis of the natural gas futures for the USA (NGF-USA) and the UK natural gas futures for the EU (NGF-UK) for pre-and during COVID-19 phases. The residuals of the previous stage are introduced as a new explanatory feature along with standard technical indicators to perform predictive tasks. The importance of the new feature is explained through the Boruta feature evaluation methodology. Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transformation (MODWT) is applied to decompose the original time-series observations of the natural gas prices to enable granular level forecasting. Random Forest is invoked on each component to fetch the respective predictions. The aggregated component-wise sums lead to final predictions. A rigorous performance assessment signifies the efficacy of the proposed framework. The results show the effectiveness of the residual as a feature in deriving accurate forecasts. The framework is highly efficient in analyzing patterns in the presence of a limited number of data points during the uncertain COVID-19 phase covering the first and second waves of the pandemic.

In 20 of them the instrument was re-applied 1-2 days later. Translation and Back Translation was made. The clinical diagnosis was reached with the SCAN v.2.0 and the IPDE. The Symptoms Rating Scale for Depression and Anxiety (SRSDA) and the EPQ were applied for cross-validation purposes. The Statistical Analysis included the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and the calculation of Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS The State score for healthy subjects was 34.30 +/- 10.79 and the Trait score was 36.07 +/- 10.47. The respected scores for the depressed patients were 56.22 +/- 8.86 and 53.83 +/- 10.87. Both State and Trait scores followed the normal distribution in control subjects. Cronbach's alpha was 0.93 for the State and 0.92 for the Trait subscale. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient between State and Trait subscales was 0.79. Both subscales correlated fairly with the anxiety subscale of the SRSDA. Test-retest reliability was excellent, with Pearson coefficient being between 0.75 and 0.98 for individual items and equal to 0.96 for State and 0.98 for Trait.

However, adoption of COVID-19-related preventive behaviours remain relatively unknown. This study investigated predictors of preventive behaviours. METHODS An analytical sample of 897 Singaporean adults who were quota sampled based on age, gender, and ethnicity were recruited through a web-enabled survey. Outcomes were adoption of, or increased frequency of preventive behaviours (avoiding social events; avoiding public transport; reducing time spent shopping and eating out; wearing a mask in public; avoiding hospitals/clinics; keeping children out of school, washing hands/using sanitisers; keeping surroundings clean; avoiding touching public surfaces; working from/studying at home). Public perceptions regarding COVID-19 (chances of getting COVID-19; perceived likelihood of COVID-19-related intensive care unit (ICU) admission; government trust; self-efficacy; perceived appropriateness of COVID-19 behaviours; response efficacy), anxiety, and demographic characteristics (age; ethnicity; marital status; education; chronic conditions; current living arrangements) were investigated as predictors of preventive behaviours adopted during COVID-19 in binomial and ordered logistic regressions. RESULTS Though adoption of preventive behaviours among Singaporeans varied, it was, overall, high, and consistent with government recommendations. Nearly a quarter reported moderate to severe anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 7-item - GAD-7 scores). Respondents who perceived higher COVID-19 risks, had higher government trust, higher self-efficacy, and perceived that others acted appropriately reported increased adoption/frequency of preventive measures. The strongest indicator of behavioural change was response efficacy. Respondents who were older, highly educated, anxious and married reported higher adoption/frequency of preventive measures. CONCLUSION To successfully influence appropriate preventive behaviours, public health messages should highlight response efficacy, increase self-efficacy, and promote trust in governmental response.

Switching from oral prednisone to intravenous dexamethasone sodium phosphate showed a more favorable clinical and biochemical response. CONCLUSION: Macrophage activation syndrome is less commonly detected in adult patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.

The Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) conducts studies on the etiology and characteristics of U.S. hospitalized adults with influenza. It began enrolling patients with COVID-19 hospitalizations in March 2020. Patients with influenza were compared with those with COVID-19 in the first months of the U.S. epidemic. METHODS: Adults aged &#8805; 18 years admitted to hospitals in 4 sites with acute respiratory illness were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19. Demographic and illness characteristics were collected for influenza illnesses during 3 seasons 2016-2019. Similar data were collected on COVID-19 cases admitted before June 19, 2020. RESULTS: Age groups hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 914) were similar to those admitted with influenza (n = 1937); 80% of patients with influenza and 75% of patients with COVID-19 were aged &#8805;50 years. Deaths from COVID-19 that occurred in younger patients were less often related to underlying conditions. White non-Hispanic persons were overrepresented in influenza (64%) compared with COVID-19 hospitalizations (37%). Greater severity and complications occurred with COVID-19 including more ICU admissions (AOR = 15.3 [95% CI: 11.6, 20.3]), ventilator use (AOR = 15.6 [95% CI: 10.7, 22.8]), 7 additional days of hospital stay in those discharged alive, and death during hospitalization (AOR = 19.8 [95% CI: 12.0, 32.7]). CONCLUSIONS: While COVID-19 can cause a respiratory illness like influenza, it is associated with significantly greater severity of illness, longer hospital stays, and higher in-hospital deaths.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Versus Influenza in Hospitalized Adult Patients in the United States: Differences in Demographic and Severity Indicators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic, the possibility of recurrence of the disease after recovery has become a debated issue We report a case of an 84-years-old male patient who was admitted to our hospital for dyspnea and fever Lab and clinical workout showed that he had COVID-19 After a full recovery of symptoms and a double negative nasopharyngeal swab of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by realtime polymerase chain reaction assay, he was discharged from the hospital One month later, he developed dyspnea and fever again with lung involvement Surprisingly, the nasopharyngeal swab of SARS-CoV-2 was positive Since he denied contacts with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, he probably experienced a reactivation of a persistent infection The failed eradication of the virus could depend on both virus' escape mechanisms and dysfunctional immune response Further studies are needed to confirm the hypothesis of viral reactivation and identify signs of an incomplete clearance","output":"Recurrence of COVID-19 related symptoms and viral detection in a patient discharged after complete recovery and test negativization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent advances in single-cell technologies enable scientists to measure molecular data at high-resolutions and hold the promise to substantially improve clinical outcomes through personalised medicine.

By generating molecular representation using scFeatures for single-cell RNA-seq, spatial proteomic and spatial transcriptomic data, we demonstrate that different types of features are important for predicting different disease outcomes in different datasets and the downstream analysis of features uncover novel biological discoveries.","output":"scFeatures: Multi-view representations of single-cell and spatial data for disease outcome prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to hardship for individuals across the globe, and research to-date has indicated a significant impact of the pandemic on mental health functioning. In order to promote psychological resilience during this time, it is important to understand modifiable targets for clinical intervention. The current study examined demographic characteristics, pandemic-related adversity, and psychological flexibility in relation to general and peritraumatic distress in a sample of United States survey respondents during May of 2020. Participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), N = 485. Participants completed measures of pandemic-related adversity, psychological flexibility components (openness to experience, behavioral awareness, and valued action), peritraumatic distress, and general distress. Hierarchical regression analyses examined whether demographic characteristics, pandemic-related adversity, and components of psychological flexibility were associated with general and peritraumatic distress. Results indicated that higher pandemic-related adversity, lower openness to experience, and lower behavioral awareness were significantly associated with higher general distress. Greater pandemic-related adversity, lower openness to experience, lower behavioral awareness, and higher valued action were significantly associated with higher peritraumatic distress. Adding the components of psychological flexibility to the model increased the amount of variance accounted for in both measures of distress. The results indicated that psychological flexibility components may be particularly important targets for prevention and intervention efforts in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although various therapeutic options are available for melasma, its treatment remains challenging. The present study evaluated the safety and efficacy of intradermal microinjection of tranexamic acid (TA) plus ascorbic acid in treating melasma lesions compared with TA and placebo. METHODS: From September 2019 to May 2020, 24 patients with symmetrical melasma were enrolled in a prospective, double\\\\blind, split\\\\face, randomized controlled clinical trial. Each patient received 50 mg/ml TA and 50 mg/ml ascorbic acid for one side of the face (A) and 50 mg/ml TA and placebo for the other side (B) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. The Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) score, Physician Global Assessment, and pain were measured at baseline and at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software version 16, and data were reported as mean  standard deviation or median and interquartile range.  (2) and Fisher's exact tests were used to test differences between the groups. RESULTS: Both groups experienced a significant decrease in MASI scores compared with the baseline. The MASI score was significantly less in the intervention group than the placebo group at the 8th and 12th weeks. However, burning pain was significantly more prominent in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: Intradermal injection of ascorbic acid combined with TA can be beneficial in treating melasma. Currently, there are numerous treatment modalities for melasma.

This association is analysed in a case study of Italian voters, where PPs can be found in the government and in the opposition. By conducting a cross-sectional analysis during the third wave of panel data fielded in December 2020, this article shows that individuals who have anti-vax attitudes and who also have a higher propensity to believe in conspiracy theories are more likely to vote for PPs, although it is worth considering the roles PPs play in either the government or in the opposition.","output":"The Covid pandemic enters the ballot box: The impact of conspiracy theories on Italians' voting behaviour during the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and is the second most common cause of death in women. Estrogen plays an important role in breast tumor etiopathogenesis. Tamoxifen and other anti-estrogen drugs are used in breast cancer patients who have a positive estrogen receptor (ER). While angiotensin II plays a key role in breast cancer etiology and causes tamoxifen resistance, angiotensin 1C7 has been reported to may reduce the spread and invasion of breast cancer. During the COVID-19 infection, the virus blocks ACE2, and angiotensin 1C7 production discontinued. Angiotensin III production may increase as angiotensin II destruction is reduced. Thus, aminopeptidase upregulation may occur. Increased aminopeptidase may develop resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Estrogen can have a protective effect against COVID-19. Estrogen increase causes ER- upregulation in T lymphocytes. Thus, estrogen increases the release of interferon I and III from T lymphocytes. Increasing interferon I and III alleviates COVID-19 infection. Tamoxifen treatment causes down-regulation, mutation, or loss in estrogen receptors. In the long-term use of tamoxifen, its effects on estrogen receptors can be permanent. Thus, since estrogen receptors are damaged or downregulated, estrogen may not act by binding to these receptors. Tamoxifen is a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, independent of its effect on estrogen receptors. It suppresses T cell functions and interferon release. We think tamoxifen may increase the COVID-19 risk due to its antiestrogen and P-glycoprotein inhibitory effects.","output":"COVID-19 infection can cause chemotherapy resistance development in patients with breast cancer and tamoxifen may cause susceptibility to COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cross-sectional study uses surveillance data to assess temporal trends in suicide attempts among children admitted to a pediatric emergency department in Paris, France, in the decade before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Temporal Trends in Suicide Attempts Among Children in the Decade Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Paris, France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of venous thrombosis, mostly pulmonary embolism (PE), ranging from local immunothrombosis to central emboli, but also deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) is reported to be remarkably high.

The virus made its first appearance in the U.S. in 2013, where it caused substantial neonatal mortality and economic losses in the U.S. pork industry. Based on outbreak investigations, it is hypothesized that the virus could be transmitted through contaminated feed or contaminated feed surfaces. This potential risk created a demand for research on the inactivation kinetics of PEDV in different environments. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of PEDV in 9 different feed ingredients when exposed to 60, 70, 80, and 90 C, as well as the survival on four different surfaces (galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic). RESULTS: Overall, there were no differences (P > 0.05) in virus survival among the different feed matrices studied when thermally processed at 60 to 90 C for 5, 10, 15, or 30 min. However, the time necessary to achieve a one log reduction in virus concentration was less (P < 0.05) when ingredients were exposed to temperatures from 70 C (3.7 min), 80 C (2.4 min), and 90 C (2.3 min) compared with 60 C (4.4 min). The maximum inactivation level (3.9 log) was achieved when heating all ingredients at 90 C for 30 min. There were no differences in the amount of time necessary to cause a one log reduction in PEDV concentration among the different surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that PEDV survival among the 9 feed ingredients evaluated was not different when exposed to thermal treatments for up to 30 min. However, different combinations of temperature and time resulted in achieving a 3 to 4 log reduction of PEDV in all feed ingredients evaluated.

The development and commercialization of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines illustrate how licensing practices of public research organizations can contribute to high prices of the resulting product and affect accessibility to vulnerable populations. Efforts by the international community to improve access to medicines have recognised this issue and promote the public health-sensitive management of research conducted by public research organizations. This paper explores: how medical knowledge is exchanged between public and private actors; what role inventor scientists play in this process; and how they view the implementation of public health-sensitive knowledge exchange strategies. METHODS: We conducted a systematic qualitative literature review on medical knowledge exchange and qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of public sector scientists working on HPV vaccines. We explored the strategies by which knowledge is exchanged across institutional boundaries, how these strategies are negotiated, and the views of scientists regarding public health-sensitive knowledge exchange. RESULTS: We included 13 studies in the systematic review and conducted seven semi-structured interviews with high-ranking scientists. The main avenues of public-private medical knowledge exchange were publications, formal transfer of patented knowledge, problem-specific exchanges such as service agreements, informal exchanges and collaborative research. Scientists played a crucial role in these processes but appeared to be sceptical of public health-sensitive knowledge exchange strategies, as these were believed to deter corporate interest in the development of new medicines and thus risk the translation of the scientists research. CONCLUSION: Medical scientists at public research institutions play a key role in the exchange of knowledge they generate and are concerned about the accessibility of medicines resulting from their research. Their scepticism towards implementing public health-sensitive knowledge management strategies appears to be based on a biased understanding of the costs and risks involved in drug development and a perceived lack of alternatives to private engagement. Scientists could be encouraged to exchange knowledge in a public health-sensitive manner through not-for-profit drug development mechanisms, education on industry engagement, and stronger institutional and legal backing.","output":"Public-private knowledge transfer and access to medicines: a systematic review and qualitative study of perceptions and roles of scientists involved in HPV vaccine research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the possible biological effect of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) combined with tissue fusion technology on the anastomosis.

The aim of this review is to highlight the role of telemental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: An electronic search was carried out between January 01, 2020 and October 31, 2020 to explore the utilization of telehealth services for mental health problems among adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary source of literature was the structured search of major electronic databases from the MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL Plus, Science Direct and the Web of Science. We included nine published studies meeting the the eligibility criteria. RESULTS: The role of telehealth identified in this review mainly focused on the applicability of this modality for assessing and managing various mental health problems in these unprecedented times. It also pointed out that the provision of telemental health support reduced the burden of mental health diseases and promoted the wellbeing of the individual. Further, it was witnessed that patients preferred remote consultation as compared to face-to-face visits in order to avoid contracting the virus and found online mental health interventions and psychological counseling very helpful to cope up with the current crisis. CONCLUSION: The current COVID-19 lockdown has changed the management of the mental health problems of patients.

This study aims to describe the overall mortality in the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine independent risk factors for overall survival & 29 days mortality. METHODS: This is a retrospective single-center study; data for adult patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 between 1(st) March 2020 to 31(st) December 2020 were extracted and reviewed. Overall survival was described using Kaplan-Meier curves with reporting of median overall survival and 29 days survival estimates. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards model and multivariate logistic regression model. Figure 1. Study flow chart [Image: see text] Table 1. Demographic characteristics categorized by Gender [Image: see text] RESULTS: Eligible subjects were 209 (Figure 1) and subjects demographics are summarized in (Table1). Observed death events were 82 (39.2% of the total cohort), 61% of deaths reached at 2 weeks of ICU stay (n.= 50), median overall survival (OS) was reached at day 23, as shown in (Figure 2). The multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis (Figure 3) showed elevated SOFA score [aHR= 1.10, P < 0.001] and Vasopressors [aHR= 3.23, P= 0.002] as independent risk factors for overall ICU mortality. Independent protective factors were: Systemic corticosteroids use (P= 0.019), Insulin use (P= 0.026) and Liposomal Amphotericin B (LAMB) use (P= 0.019). For mortality at day 29, the multivariate logistic regression model (Figure. 4) showed elevated SOFA score (P= 0.005), any need for ventilation escalation after ICU admission (P= 0.014), Ribavirin use (P=0.016) and Vasopressors use ( P< 0.001) as independent risk factors. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) use was a protective factor (P=0.025). Figure 2.

Multivariate logistic regression model for factors associated with 29 days mortality in patients admitted to the ICU due to COVID-19 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: SOFA score and vasopressors are independent predictors for overall survival and 29-day mortality in the ICU. The need for ventilation escalation after ICU admission appeared to lead to poor prognosis in regard to 29-day mortality only. Systemic corticosteroids are lifesaving, further studies are required to confirm the observed clinical benefits with insulin, LAMB and ACEi use in the ICU and to investigate any hazardous impact of ribavirin on COVID-19 outcomes.

Enhancing the ability to track and assess patients during this initial trial evaluation offers the potential for improved understanding regarding the suitability of permanent device implantation as well as identification of the SCS-based neurostimulative modalities and parameters that may provide substantial analgesia in a patient-specific manner. OBJECTIVE: In this report, we aimed to describe a preliminary, real-world assessment of a new, real time tracking, smart, device-based digital app used by patients with chronic pain undergoing trial screening for SCS therapy. METHODS: This is a real-world, retrospective evaluation of 13,331 patients diagnosed with chronic pain who used the new mySCS mobile app during an SCS screening trial. The app design is health insurance portability and accountability act (HIPAA)-compliant and compatible with most commercially available smartphones (eg, Apple, iPhone, and Android). The app enables tracking of user-inputted health-related responses (ie, pain relief, activity level, and sleep quality) in addition to personal trial goals and a summary of overall experience during the SCS trial. A deidentified, aggregate analysis of user engagement, user-submitted responses, and overall trial success was conducted. RESULTS: When provided the opportunity, the percentage of users who engaged with the tracking app for 50% of the time during their trial was found to be 64.43% (n=8589). Among the 13,331 patients who used the app, 58.24% (n=7764) entered a trial goal. Most patients underwent SCS screening with a trial duration of at least 7 days (n=7739, 58.05%). Of those patients who undertook a 7-day SCS trial, 62.30% (n=3456) engaged the app for 4 days or more. In addition, among all who submitted descriptive responses using the app, health-related improvements were reported by 77.84% (n=10,377) of patients who reached day 3 of the screening phase assessment and by 83.04% (n=11,070) of those who reached trial completion. A trial success rate of 91% was determined for those who used the app (versus 85% success rate for nonusers). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this initial, real-world examination of a mobile, digital-healthCbased tracking app (mySCS), as used during the SCS screening phase, demonstrate that substantial patient engagement can be achieved while also providing for the acquisition of more real time patient-outcome measures that may help facilitate improved SCS trial success.","output":"User Engagement and Assessment of Treatment Effectiveness in Patients Using a Novel Digital mHealth App During Spinal Cord Stimulation Screening Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) measures on the hospitalization of patients with epilepsy and status epilepticus (SE).

RESULTS From July 2016 to June 2019, we worked with 107 local partners and conducted 151 outreaches. Of the total number of people who attended cancer health education sessions, 201 568 (77.9%) were reached through outreaches. Ninety-two (95%) cancer awareness TVs and radio talk-shows conducted were sponsored by local partners. Of the total people screened; 22 795 (63.0%) cervical, 22 014 (64.4%) breast, and 4904 (38.7%) prostate screening were reached through community outreach model. The screen-positive rates were higher in hospital-based screening except for Prostate screening; cervical, 8.8%, breast, 8.4%, prostate, 7.1% than in outreaches; cervical, 3.2%, breast, 2.2%, prostate, 8.2%.

Coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), fuse at the plasma membrane or use receptor-mediated endocytosis and fuse with endosomes depending on the cell or tissue type. The virus Spike (S) protein mediates fusion with the host cell membrane. We have shown previously that an Abl kinase inhibitor, imatinib, significantly reduces SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viral titers and prevents endosomal entry by HIV SARS S and MERS S pseudotyped virions. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are classified as BSL-3 viruses, which can make experimentation into the cellular mechanisms involved in infection more challenging. Here, we use IBV, a BSL-2 virus, as a model for studying the role of Abl kinase activity during coronavirus infection. We found that imatinib and two specific Abl kinase inhibitors, GNF2 and GNF5, reduce IBV titers by blocking the first round of virus infection. Additionally, all three drugs prevented IBV S-induced syncytia formation prior to the hemifusion step. Our results indicate that membrane fusion (both virus-cell and cell-cell) is blocked in the presence of Abl kinase inhibitors. Studying the effects of Abl kinase inhibitors on IBV will be useful in identifying host cell pathways required for coronavirus infection.

Here, we tested the antibody response developed after the first dose of the mRNA based vaccine encoding the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein (BNT162b2) in 124 healthcare professionals of which 57 had a previous history of COVID-19 (ExCOVID). Post-vaccine antibodies in ExCOVID individuals increase exponentially within 7-15 days after the first dose compared to naive subjects (p<0.0001). We developed a multivariate Linear Regression (LR) model with l2 regularization to predict the IgG response for SARS-COV-2 vaccine. We found that the antibody response of ExCOVID patients depends on the IgG pre-vaccine titer and on the symptoms that they developed during the disorder, with anosmia/dysgeusia and gastrointestinal disorders being the most significantly positively correlated in the LR. Thus, one vaccine dose is sufficient to induce a good antibody response in ExCOVID subjects. On the contrary, a second dose might switch-off the immune response due to antigen exhaustion, which occurs in response to several viruses or drive the development of low-affinity antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 which may foster an antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) reaction when re-exposed to the virus.

In the first epidemic, HCWs accounted for 12% of all national COVID-19 cases. We evaluated the burden of COVID-19 among HCWs and other non-health-care workers (nHCWs) in a large Italian hospital. METHODS: From March 1st to May 31st 2020, we performed a retrospective study at ASST Civil Hospital, in the Province of Brescia, Lombardy. The study population included all hospital personnel (n = 9265), categorized by professional status. RESULTS: A SARS-CoV-2 test was performed in 3572 workers (38.5%), with a positive result in 552 (5.9% of all hospital personnel). The temporal trend of SARS-CoV-2 cases in hospital staff broadly reflected that in the community, with a great majority of infections occurred during March 2020 (87.7%). From April onward, a steep decrease of positive cases was observed among hospital personnel, while in the community the decrease was much slower. Medical doctors (8.9%) and nurses (8.5%) were the most affected professional categories with a significantly higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 1.436 and OR 1.410, respectively p < 0.0001). HCWs in COVID-19 units presented a significantly higher risk of infection compared to HCWs in non-COVID units (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: HCWs were severely affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, probably associated with an overwhelming burden of work and lack of preparedness in prevention of nosocomial transmission of the infection.

Studies focusing on more severe presentations (hospitalized patients or requiring intensive care) most frequently evaluate mortality and adverse events, while hospital admission and viral detection/load are most frequently assessed in the community setting. Outcome measurement instruments are poorly reported and heterogeneous. In general, simple instruments that can control for important sources of bias are favoured. Follow-up does not exceed one month in 64.3% of these earlier trials, and long-term COVID-19 burden is rarely assessed. The methodological issues identified could delay the introduction of potentially life-saving treatments in clinical practice. Our findings demonstrate the need for consensus in the design of RCTs.

Such management systems often come in an architecture that is not only a distributed one but also decoupled from the applications. Although an arrangement like this promotes scalability, it unfortunately makes the recovery of applications dependent on the fault management system itself. This work introduces two novel equations to meet the performance objectives of applications. To this end, we first create an equation that estimates the maximum number of jobs to be handled by an application instance for meeting a given performance objective. This formula is then used by admission control mechanism to restrict the number of jobs (targeted for operational application instances) to be allowed to enter the system. Next, we create a second equation that computes the response time distribution of an application. Thereafter, we develop a simulation model that predicts the impact of the failure of four sample fault management architectures on applications performance. Exploiting our equations, we compare the architectures in terms of three distinct ways of handling affected jobs when application instances failallow job loss; retry jobs resulting in overload; employ admission control to mitigate the overload. Our simulation results show that boosting the number of managers may not always be beneficial; rather, it could possibly be the interconnection topology (i.e. the layout of interconnects linking the architectural components) of the management architecture, together with the model parameter values that may sometimes have a bigger role to play in the applications performance.","output":"Fault-Detection Managers: More May Not Be the Merrier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global health concern.

While other developing regions seem to be making progress toward achieving SDG6, sub\\\\Saharan Africa (SSA) is lagging behind significantly, particularly with regard to access to water supply and sanitation (WSS). As a result, most studies evaluating progress toward the achievement of water security SDGs in SSA have focused on WSS while the rest of the SDG6 targets have received scant attention, often using fragmented or incomplete evidence. Here, we fill this knowledge gap by conducting a comprehensive assessment of the status of SDG6 in all 48 countries in SSA. We provide a review of the progress made, the challenges affecting each SDG6 target and examine the different political, socioeconomic, and environmental factors with potential to undermine the achievement of SDG6 in the region. Our review clearly demonstrates that it is likely that most countries may not achieve water security by 2030. The complex nature of the challenges and factors impeding the achievement of water security in SSA outlined here suggests that a holistic intervention involving local, national, and international stakeholders and the research community is urgently needed to address SDG6 if the 2030 target date is to be met.

However, such assemblies are available for only a few non-microbial species(1C4). To address this issue, the international Genome 10K (G10K) consortium(5,6) has worked over a five-year period to evaluate and develop cost-effective methods for assembling highly accurate and nearly complete reference genomes. Here we present lessons learned from generating assemblies for 16 species that represent six major vertebrate lineages. We confirm that long-read sequencing technologies are essential for maximizing genome quality, and that unresolved complex repeats and haplotype heterozygosity are major sources of assembly error when not handled correctly. Our assemblies correct substantial errors, add missing sequence in some of the best historical reference genomes, and reveal biological discoveries. These include the identification of many false gene duplications, increases in gene sizes, chromosome rearrangements that are specific to lineages, a repeated independent chromosome breakpoint in bat genomes, and a canonical GC-rich pattern in protein-coding genes and their regulatory regions.

Countries with higher prevalence of exposed obese individuals experienced the highest number of mortalities.

Therefore, obese individuals are worse in condition because of a higher presence of adiposity increases the number of ACE2 expressing cells. Furthermore, in silico interactions of ACE2 and different variants of coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) spike S1 protein suggest that mutant strains are more infectious than wildtype as they bind to host ACE2 protein with high binding affinities. Certain specific cancers including cervical cancer, pancreatic and rectal adenocarcinomas have more expression of such receptors and pose additional risk to already immunocompromised cancer patients.

We decompose changes in the wage distribution into composition, structural and selection effects. Composition effects have increased wages at all quantiles while the impact of the structural effects varies by time period and quantile. Changes in the role of selection only appear at the lower quantiles of the wage distribution. The evidence suggests that there is positive selection in the 1970s which diminishes until the later 1990s. This reduces wages at lower quantiles and increases wage inequality. Post 2000 there appears to be an increase in positive sorting which reduces the selection effects on wage inequality.","output":"Selection and the Distribution of Female Hourly Wages in the U.S"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 reached pandemic level in March 2020 and the number of confirmed cases continues to increase worldwide.

The present study aimed to assess the presence of symptoms related to the feeding behavior occurred during and/or after COVID-19 in adults residing in Portugal and to link them to disease severity using a multivariate approach. Data were collected from May to September 2020, through a questionnaire answered online containing questions about general and specific symptoms before, during and after COVID-19. 362 participants were included: 201 were symptomatic, being 15 hospitalized and 186 non-hospitalized. Cluster analysis grouped the non-hospitalized participants as mild and severe cases. For these patients, the most frequent symptoms related to the feeding process were smell disorders in 40% and 62%, taste disorders in 37% and 60%, and dry mouth, in 23% and 48% of mild and severe cases, respectively. Dry mouth was significantly associated with difficulty to swallow, pain during swallow, choking when eating or drinking, and preference for mushy/pasty foods (p<0.01; Chi-squared test). Among the severe cases, the incidence of coughing during the meal (31%), difficulty (19%) and pain during swallow (17%), preference for mushy/pasty foods (10%) and choking when eating or drinking (6%) were clinically relevant and may indicate the presence of swallowing disorders. This group also showed a higher frequency of general symptoms, such as fever, headache, abdominal pain, tiredness, diarrhea, nausea, and shortness of breath (p<0.05; Chi-squared test). Smell disorders, taste disorders and dry mouth were the most frequent symptoms related to the feeding behavior for both mild and severe cases.

A novel T-cell-receptor (TCR)-like single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody specific for the T-cell epitope consisting of the WT1/HLA-A2 complex was isolated from a human scFv phage library. This scFv was affinity-matured by mutagenesis combined with yeast display and structurally analyzed using a homology model. This monovalent scFv showed a 100-fold affinity improvement (dissociation constant (K(D))=3 nm) and exquisite specificity towards its targeted epitope or HLA-A2(+)/WT1(+) tumor cells. Bivalent scFv-huIgG1-Fc fusion protein demonstrated an even higher avidity (K(D)=2 pm) binding to the T-cell epitope and to tumor targets and was capable of mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or tumor lysis by chimeric antigen receptor-expressing human T- or NK-92-MI-transfected cells. This antibody demonstrated specific and potent cytotoxicity in vivo towards WT1-positive leukemia xenograft that was HLA-A2 restricted. In summary, T-cell epitopes can provide novel targets for antibody-based therapeutics.

Depth of sedation has evolved over the last 40 years (no-sedation, deep sedation, daily emergence, minimal sedation, etc.). Most guidelines now recommend determining the depth of sedation and minimizing the use of benzodiazepines and opioids. The broader use of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (alpha-2 agonists) led to sedation regimens beginning at admission to the CCU that contrast with hypnotics+opioids (conventional sedation), with major consequences for cognition, ventilation and circulatory performance. The same doses of alpha-2 agonists used for cooperative sedation (ataraxia, analgognosia) elicit no respiratory depression but modify the autonomic nervous system (cardiac parasympathetic activation, attenuation of excessive cardiac and vasomotor sympathetic activity). Alpha-2 agonists should be selected only in patients who benefit from their effects (personalized indications, as opposed to a one size fits all approach). Then, titration to effect is required, especially in the setting of systemic hypotension and/or hypovolemia.

Patient presentation complicated with cardiopulmonary arrest, requiring intubation and CPR. Examination revealed tachycardia (105/min), hypotension (82/45) and hypothermia (32.3), obesity (BMI 38), bilateral rhonchi, soft abdomen with negative Collens and Grey-turner signs. Laboratory testing was remarkable for leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance (17.5 x10(3)/mcL), hyperkalemia (6.6 mmol/L), elevated lipase levels (4248U/L), high-anion gab metabolic acidosis (anion gab 35, arterial pH &lt;7.000), lactatemia, ketosis, negative alcohol screen.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old female seeking medical attention through teleconsultation presents with profound dyspnea, oppressive chest pain, fatigue, episodic hallucinations, and difficulty sleeping, for what she originally sought medical attention at an ER but could not be admitted due to saturation of the health system. A positive PCR test for COVID-19, and a CT scan of the chest showing bilateral consolidations with ground-glass opacities confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was managed at home, with corticosteroids, nitazoxanide and a single dose of 40 mg of subcutaneous enoxaparin. Colchicine was added at the third day of treatment. Standard oxygen therapy through nasal cannula was also recommended. Daily follow-ups were established to monitor for signs of clinical improvement. Two weeks later from the initial consultation the patient presents marked improvement in her symptoms, as well as in her CT scan, which prompted in discontinuation of the medications and the oxygen therapy. CONCLUSIONS: There are several limitations in this report regarding the clinical data and the management, but such limitations do also reflect the state of emergency and the chaos that resides in the health care systems of developing nations. For the ambulatory care of COVID-19 patients, several aspects of disease management may differ from current guidelines and basic requirements may represent a huge challenge to cover. Further research is needed to assist physicians in the daily clinical decision making, to optimize patient outcomes, and to reduce the probability of adverse scenarios of patients with COVID-19 managed in the ambulatory setting.","output":"The unusual experience of managing a severe COVID-19 case at home: what can we do and where do we go?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Due to active involvement with patients for COVID-19 treatments, nurses are susceptible to adverse psychological outcomes amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the distress, studies have suggested that nurses are able to experience positive changes (i.e. posttraumatic growth;PTG) during the pandemic. Research on other populations has also indicated that COVID-19-specific worries and work-related coping resources are associated with peoples positive changes during the pandemic. Objective This study examined how socio-demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related worries, and work-related variables (satisfaction with work and workplace pandemic guidelines) were associated with PTG among nurses in Hong Kong. Methods Nurses (N = 1510) working in hospitals and community settings were recruited through nursing associations in Hong Kong between 8 August 2020 and 22 September 2020. They were invited to complete a cross-sectional survey measuring their sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 worries, and satisfaction with work and workplace pandemic-control measures. Results Results from hierarchical regressions found that those working non-full-time ( = ?0.06), affiliating with a religion ( = 0.24), having higher COVID-19-related worries and psychological distress (s ranging from 0.12C0.15), and having higher work satisfaction ( = 0.14) were associated with higher PTG (ps < .05). Moreover, a significant interaction between psychological distress and satisfaction with workplace pandemic control guidelines emerged in explaining PTG ( = 0.08, p < .05), such that guideline satisfaction was only associated with higher PTG among those with higher distress ( = 0.09, p = .03), but not those with lower distress ( = ?0.05, p > .05). Conclusions Nurses in Hong Kong did report positive changes amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies could focus on the contributing factors of PTG to design for effective strategies to enhance resources for nurses to promote positive psychosocial outcomes. HIGHLIGHTS Work satisfaction was associated with nurses posttraumatic growth (PTG) amid COVID-19. Workplace pandemic control guidelines satisfaction was associated with PTG only among nurses with higher distress.

METHODS This research was conducted as a cross-sectional and descriptive study. The questionnaires used in this study included demographic information to obtain the required information such as age, sex, clinical symptoms, underlying disease, type of drug used, smoking, occupation, hours of work, number of daily clients, use of mask or shield, type of working hours, weight and height and body mass index, number Family, place of residence, role in the family, presence of an infected person in the family, communication with the suspect, observance or non-observance of health protocols. Our sample size consisted of 774 subjects, all patients at the Ardabil Imam Khomeini Hospital. The subjects were selected randomly. RESULTS The results of this study showed that the mean age of patients was 56.70 years, with a standard deviation of 18.20 years. Three hundred and sixty participants (46.5%) were female, and 414 (53.5%) were male. In terms of occupation distribution, 317 patients (41%) were housewives. In addition, 57 people (7.4%) were farmers or ranchers.

We aimed to assess whether there are differences in clinical manifestations between COVID-19 patients from the East (East and South-East Asian countries including China, South Korea, and Thailand) and the West (North American, European, and Middle East countries, including the United States, Italy, France, and Iran). METHODS: For this meta-analysis, we searched for eligible studies about COVID-19 in three databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Studies were divided into two cohorts for analysis: the East and the West. Stata 131 software was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Of the 1527 studies initially identified by the literature search, 169 full-text articles were retrieved and screened for eligibility. Fifty-seven of these, describing 19 353 patients, were deemed eligible for inclusion. Of these, 45 studies with 8 416 patients were from the East while 12 studies with 10 937 patients were from the West. The results indicated that the incidences of cough, headache, dizziness, nasal congestion, and digestive symptoms in COVID-19 patients from the East were lower than those in the West. The laboratory data showed that there were no significant differences in the levels of lymphocytes, leukocytes, C-reactive protein, and platelet counts between the two groups. In addition, our results also showed that the incidence of cardiac and kidney injury, as well as increased levels of creatinine, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase, were significantly higher in patients from the West than from the East. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis indicated that there are differences in the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in patients from the East and the West.

METHODS: We calculated excess deaths between the date the cumulative total of COVID-19 deaths reached 10 in a country to 15th May 2020 for nine countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland). Gender- and age-specific excess deaths and Years of Potential Productive Life Lost (YPPLL) between 30 and 74 years were calculated and converted into premature mortality productivity costs 2020 for paid and unpaid work using the Human Capital and the Proxy Good Approaches. Costs were discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS: Total estimated excess deaths across the nine countries were 18,614 (77% in men) and YPPLL were 134,190 (77% male). Total paid premature mortality costs were 1.07 billion (87% male) with Spain (0.35 billion, 33.0% of total), Italy (0.22 billion; 20.6%) and The Netherlands (0.19 billion; 17.5%) ranking highest. Total paid and unpaid premature mortality costs were 2.89 billion (77% male). Premature mortality costs per death ranged between 40,382 (France) and 350,325 (Switzerland).

It has also been reported that vitamin D deficiency may play a role in this, possibly because of the multi\\\\gene regulatory function of the vitamin D receptor. As a result, increased dietary intake and/or supplementation to attain adequate 25\\\\hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels could benefit people in these ethnicities. The present study aimed to review the literature examining the changes in 25(OH)D in different types of vitamin D supplementation from randomised controlled trials in this population. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines. Electronic databases were systematically searched using keywords related to vitamin D supplementation in Black and Asian ethnicities. RESULTS: Eight studies were included in the review. All the included studies found that supplementation of vitamin D (D(2) and D(3)), regardless of dosage, increased 25(OH)D levels compared to a placebo. All trials in which participants were vitamin D deficient at baseline showed increased 25(OH)D levels to a level considered adequate. Two studies that used food fortification yielded smaller 25(OH)D increases compared to similar studies that used oral supplementation (10.2 vs. 25.5 nmol L(?1), respectively). Furthermore, vitamin D(2) supplementation yielded significantly lower 25(OH)D increases than vitamin D(3) supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Oral vitamin D supplementation may be more efficacious in increasing 25(OH)D levels than food fortification of Black and Asian ethnicities, with vitamin D(3) supplementation possibly being more efficacious than vitamin D(2). It is recommended that people with darker skin supplement their diet with vitamin D(3) through oral tablet modes where possible, with recent literature suggesting a daily intake of 7000C10,000 IU to be potentially protective from unfavourable COVID\\\\19 outcomes.

Recently, many high-resolution apo and inhibitor-bound structures of Mpro, a cysteine protease, have been determined, facilitating structure-based drug design. Mpro plays a central role in the viral life cycle by catalyzing the cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins. In addition to the catalytic dyad His41-Cys145, Mpro contains multiple histidines including His163, His164, and His172. The protonation states of these histidines and the catalytic nu-cleophile Cys145 have been debated in previous studies of SARS-CoV Mpro, but have yet to be investigated for SARS-CoV-2. In this work we have used molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a function of the protonation assignments for these residues. We simulated both the apo and inhibitor-bound enzyme and found that the conformational stability of the binding site, bound inhibitors, and the hydrogen bond networks of Mpro are highly sensitive to these assignments. Additionally, the two inhibitors studied, the peptidomimetic N3 and an -ketoamide, display distinct His41/His164 protonation-state-dependent stabilities. While the apo and the N3-bound systems favored N (HD) and N? (HE) protonation of His41 and His164, respectively, the -ketoamide was not stably bound in this state. Our results illustrate the importance of using appropriate histidine protonation states to accurately model the structure and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in both the apo and inhibitor-bound states, a necessary prerequisite for drug-design efforts.","output":"Inhibitor binding influences the protonation states of histidines in SARS-CoV-2 main protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While telerehabilitation (TR) makes it possible to respond to many significant health system problems, TR still gives rise to debates, particularly concerning ethical issues.

Although urologists are less involved in the direct treatment of COVID-19 patients, the current situation strongly affects the urological work routine. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of work and personal life among urologists in Germany. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 589 urologists in Germany participated in an online survey between March 27 and April 11, 2020. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Participants were stratified into subgroups according to professional characteristics. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Most urologists rated Germany as well prepared and the increasing restrictions of social life as very positive. Routine operation was more restricted in hospitals than in the outpatient sector (p = 0.046). Moreover, urologists from the outpatient sector felt significantly less prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic (p = 0.001), reported a higher shortage of protective medical equipment (p < 0.001), and described a tendency toward a higher level of threat (p = 0.054). Although restrictions regarding telemedicine approaches were reported by 60% of participants, the outpatient sector used telehealth more frequently than hospitals (25.5% vs 17.0%, p < 0.001). Limitations include the national design and the restricted survey period. CONCLUSIONS: This survey systematically evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on personal and professional aspects of German urologists. We identified several issues, such as a higher shortage of medical protective equipment in the outpatient sector that could trigger specific measures to further improve the quality of urological care in Germany. PATIENT SUMMARY: We evaluated a potential impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on professional and personal aspects of the urologists in Germany.

In the present work, a 3D mathematical model of the airflow distribution near the cylindrical surface of a face shield was explored. The model is based on a numerical solution of the NavierCStokes gas dynamics equations. The simulation results are compared with full-scale experiments. A probability model is also considered. Quantitative conclusions are made about the effectiveness of the protective face shields. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Protective Face Shield Effectiveness: Mathematical Modelling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adult tissue-derived organoids allow for the expansion and maintenance of primary epithelial cells in a near-native state. These 3-dimensional and self-organizing organotypic cultures derived from adult tissues have been increasingly used in fundamental and translational research. A key feature of this organoid system is that it recapitulates the stem cell lineage and thus, the differentiated cell type heterogeneity of the in vivo tissue of origin. Importantly, we and others have shown that organoids can be manipulated to expand different cell lineages, allowing for the study of rare cell types that would otherwise be very difficult to analyze. Here, focusing specifically on organoids of the small intestine, we discuss recent advances and future directions of this new avenue of organoid research. We highlight methods used to enrich for specific cell types including stem cells, enterocytes, Paneth cells, goblet cells, micro-fold (M)-cells, tuft cells, and enteroendocrine cells (EECs) in intestinal organoids, and focus on what each of these methods has taught us about the differentiation of adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs) to specific cell fates. Furthermore, we highlight how these new cell type-enriched intestinal organoids can be used to answer a diversity of questions relevant to human biology and disease.","output":"Intestinal organoids as tools for enriching and studying specific and rare cell types: advances and future directions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TikTok, the most popular social media, brings various benefits to nowadays living. However, the problematic use of TikTok has also elicited a range of health problems, such as sleep problems. Physical activity (PA) appears to play a protective role in the problematic use of TikTok and its health consequences, but the pathways between PA and sleep health are understudied. Therefore, we aimed to propose a framework to check whether PA can benefit the sleep health of TikTok users by reducing bedtime delays for TikTok. Stress and mental health issues were also considered as they are potential mediators between PA and sleep health and may also influence the problematic use of smartphones. A cross-sectional investigation that involved 660 Chinese TikTok users was conducted in April 2021. The volume of PA, perceived stress (PSS-10), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), bedtime delay for TikTok use, and sleep quality (PSQI) were investigated through an online questionnaire survey. Structural equation modeling was employed to examine pathways from PA to sleep quality through stress, mental health issues (depression and anxiety), and bedtime delay for TikTok. We found that PA exerted a significant effect on sleep quality through indirect pathways ( = ?0.056, p = 0.001). Stress was a critical mediator of all indirect pathways, and the pathway mediated by stress and mental health issues made a major contribution to the total effect ( = ?0.048, p = 0.002). The identified pathways mediated by bedtime delay for TikTok were relatively weak but significant. PA showed a distinct effect on bedtime delay for TikTok through stress and mental health issues ( = ?0.043, p = 0.001). In conclusion, our framework highlights some pathways to understanding the benefits of PA on TikTok users sleep quality. Future research is warranted to explore extra indirect pathways and re-examine the causal relationships between variables.","output":"Using Structural Equation Modeling to Examine Pathways between Physical Activity and Sleep Quality among Chinese TikTok Users"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Different cardiovascular presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 can be seen because of the systemic involvement.

DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model reflecting local practices for LTBI treatment. SETTING: A remote Canadian arctic community with a high incidence of TB. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical patients with LTBI. INTERVENTIONS: The cost effectiveness of 3HP was compared with the existing standard of care in the study region which consists of 9 months of twice weekly isoniazid (9H) given by directly observed therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with model parameters were derived from historical programmatic data, a local implementation study of 3HP and published literature. Costs from the perspective of the Nunavut healthcare system were measured in 2019 US dollars and were obtained primarily from local, empirically collected data. Secondary health outcomes included estimated TB cases and TB deaths averted using 3HP versus 9H. One way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The 3HP regimen was dominant over 9H: costs were lower (US$628 vs US$924/person) and health outcomes slightly improved (20.14 vs 20.13 QALYs/person). In comparison to 9H, 3HP treatment resulted in fewer TB cases (27.89 vs 30.16/1000 persons) and TB deaths (2.29 vs 2.48/1000 persons). 3HP completion, initiation and risk of fatal adverse events were the primary drivers of cost effectiveness. CONCLUSION: In a remote Canadian arctic setting, using 3HP instead of 9H for LTBI treatment may result in cost savings and similar or improved health outcomes.","output":"Cost-effectiveness analysis of 3 months of weekly rifapentine and isoniazid compared to isoniazid monotherapy in a Canadian arctic setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic causes significant strain on healthcare infrastructure and medical resources. So, it becomes crucial to identify reliable predictor biomarkers for COVID-19 disease severity and short term mortality. Many biomarkers are currently investigated for their prognostic role in COVID-19 patients. Our study is retrospective and aims to evaluate role of semi-quantitative CT-severity scoring versus LDH as prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19 disease severity and short-term clinical outcome. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-six patients between April 2020 and November 2020 with positive RT-PCR results underwent non-enhanced CT scan chest in our hospital and were retrospectively evaluated for CT severity scoring and serum LDH level measurement. Data were correlated with clinical disease severity. CT severity score and LDH were significantly higher in severe and critical cases compared to mild cases (P value < 0.001). High predictive significance of CT severity score for COVID-19 disease course noted, with cut-off value  13 highly predictive of severe disease (96.96% accuracy); cut-off value  16 highly predictive of critical disease (94.21% accuracy); and cut-off value  19 highly predictive of short-term mortality (92.56% accuracy). CT severity score has higher sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values as well as overall accuracy compared to LDH level in predicting severe, critical cases, and short-term mortality. CONCLUSION: Semi-quantitative CT severity scoring has high predictive significance for COVID-19 disease severity and short-term mortality with higher sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy compared to LDH. Our study strongly supports the use of CT severity scoring as a powerful prognostic biomarker for COVID-19 disease severity and short-term clinical outcome to allow triage of need for hospital admission, earlier medical interference, and to effectively prioritize medical resources for cases with high mortality risk for better decision making and clinical outcome.","output":"Comparative evaluation of semi-quantitative CT-severity scoring versus serum lactate dehydrogenase as prognostic biomarkers for disease severity and clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SCOPE The apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT, SLC10A2) is important in the enterohepatic cycling of bile acids and thereby in the intestinal absorption of lipids. ASBT inhibition has been shown to improve aspects of the metabolic syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms have remained unclear. Here we investigated the effect of ASBT inhibition on the uptake of specific fatty acids and its consequences for diet-induced obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS Intestinal fat absorption was determined in mice receiving an ASBT inhibitor and in Asbt-/- mice. Metabolic disease development was determined in Asbt-/- mice receiving a low fat control diet or high fat diet (HFD) rich in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) or PUFAs. RESULTS Both ASBT inhibition and Asbt gene inactivation reduced total fat absorption, particularly of SFAs. Asbt gene inactivation lowered bodyweight gain, improved insulin sensitivity and decreased the NAFLD activity score upon feeding a HFD rich in SFAs but not in PUFAs. CONCLUSIONS The beneficial metabolic effects of ASBT inactivation on diet-induced obesity depend on decreased intestinal absorption of SFAs, and thus on the dietary fatty acid composition.

Managers are at risk of suffering from mental disorders during the pandemic because they face particular hardship. Objective: We aim to predict mental disorder (anxiety and depression) symptoms of managers across countries using country-level COVID-19 statistics. Methods: A two-wave online survey of 406 managers from 26 countries was finished in May and July 2020. We used logistic panel regression models for our main analyses and performed robustness checks using ordinary least squares regressions. In the sample of 406 managers from 26 countries, 26.5% of managers reached the cut-off levels for anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7; GAD-7) and 43.5% did so for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ- 9) symptoms. Findings: We found that cumulative COVID-19 statistics (e.g., cumulative cases, cumulative cases per million, cumulative deaths, and cumulative deaths per million) predicted managers' anxiety and depression symptoms positively, whereas daily COVID-19 statistics (daily new cases, smoothed daily new cases, daily new deaths, smoothed daily new deaths, daily new cases per million, and smoothed daily new cases per million) predicted anxiety and depression symptoms negatively. In addition, the reproduction rate was a positive predictor, while stringency of governmental lockdown measures was a negative predictor. Individually, we found that the cumulative count of deaths is the best single predictor of both anxiety and depression symptoms. Conclusions: Cumulative COVID-19 statistics predicted managers' anxiety and depression symptoms positively, while non-cumulative daily COVID-19 statistics predicted anxiety and depression symptoms negatively.

The supply chains of beauty and personal care products in Bangladesh are also heavily interrupted during this pandemic. While these products are perceived as essential by mass people, retailers are struggling to get the supply of the products and maintain a smooth delivery to the people. Considering such facts, the purposes of the study are to identify how the supply of retailers of these products is interrupted and how they can overcome the interruptions to ensure supply resilience.Design/methodology/approachA case study method has been used in this study. The data has been collected through interviews from 16 retailers of beauty and personal care products.FindingsThe results show that the supply of retailers of beauty and personal care products is interrupted in several ways. These include product shortage, limited delivery service, interruption of supplier payment, limited credit facility and irregularity in product delivery. To minimize the impacts of the interruptions and enhance supply resilience, retailers can undertake several strategies including intensive interactions and developing cooperation with the distributors and manufacturers, ordering bulk quantity, formulating an adjusted credit ratio and focusing on product availability over brand preference.Research limitations/implicationsThe context of this study is limited to the beauty and personal care products of Bangladesh. Further study can be conducted in other countries and also supply chains of other products to enhance the generalizability of the findings of this study.Practical implicationsSupply interruptions are identified, and strategies are suggested to ensure the supply resilience of retailers of beauty and personal care products.

Safe and effective TB vaccines that can rapidly reduce disease burden are essential for achieving TB elimination. We assessed future costs, cost-savings, and cost-effectiveness of introducing novel TB vaccines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for a range of product characteristics and delivery strategies. Methods: We developed a system of epidemiological and economic models, calibrated to demographic, epidemiological, and health service data in 105 LMICs. For each country, we assessed the likely future course of TB-related outcomes under several vaccine introduction scenarios, compared to a 'no-new-vaccine' counterfactual. We estimated the incremental impact of vaccine introduction for a range of health and economic outcomes. In the base-case, we assumed a vaccine price of $4.60, and used a 1x per-capita GDP cost-effectiveness threshold (both varied in sensitivity analyses). Findings: Vaccine introduction was estimated to require substantial near-term resources, offset by future cost-savings from averted TB burden. From a health system perspective, vaccination was cost-effective in 65 of 105 LMICs. From a societal perspective (including productivity gains and averted patient costs), vaccination was projected to be cost-effective in 75 of 105 LMICs and cost-saving in 57 of 105 LMICs, including 96% of countries with higher TB burden.

Properties of the host response are not measured but are key in determining outcome. Although metabolic profiles are well suited to capture host state, most metabolomics studies are either underpowered, measure only a restricted subset of metabolites, compare infected individuals against uninfected control cohorts that are not suitably matched, or do not provide a compact predictive model. OBJECTIVES: Here we provide a well-powered, untargeted metabolomics assessment of 120 COVID-19 patient samples acquired at hospital admission. The study aims to predict the patients infection severity (i.e., mild or severe) and potential outcome (i.e., discharged or deceased). METHODS: High resolution untargeted UHPLC-MS/MS analysis was performed on patient serum using both positive and negative ionization modes. A subset of 20 intermediary metabolites predictive of severity or outcome were selected based on univariate statistical significance and a multiple predictor Bayesian logistic regression model was created. RESULTS: The predictors were selected for their relevant biological function and include deoxycytidine and ureidopropionate (indirectly reflecting viral load), kynurenine (reflecting host inflammatory response), and multiple short chain acylcarnitines (energy metabolism) among others. Currently, this approach predicts outcome and severity with a Monte Carlo cross validated area under the ROC curve of 0.792 (SD 0.09) and 0.793 (SD 0.08), respectively. A blind validation study on an additional 90 patients predicted outcome and severity at ROC AUC of 0.83 (CI 0.74C0.91) and 0.76 (CI 0.67C0.86).

The predictability of this extreme event has been studied on a wide range of space and time scales, from subseasonal to convection resolving, using a variety of model setups and initial conditions. The subseasonal experiment produces a precipitation anomaly that, even if underestimated, indicates some predictability beyond the second forecast week. At shorter ranges, results indicate that there is a consistent improvement in the precipitation forecast going from low-resolution hydrostatic to high-resolution nonhydrostatic models. It is only at very high resolution (500 m) that the convective activity extending to the north of the divide line of the Ligurian Apennines, which was responsible for the flood of the Tanaro River, is predicted with an intensity comparable with rain gauge observations.

Vaccination has become the most effective means of controlling COVID-19. Traditional neutralizing tests of sera are complex and labor-intensive, therefore, a rapid test for detecting neutralizing antibodies and antibody status post-immunization is needed. Methods : Based on the fact that antibodies exhibit neutralizing activity by blocking the binding of the S protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) to ACE2, we developed a rapid neutralizing antibody test, ACE2-Block-ELISA. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity, we used 54 positive and 84 negative serum samples. We also tested the neutralizing activities of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and 214 sera samples from healthy individuals immunized with the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Results : The sensitivity and specificity of the ACE2-Block ELISA were 96.3% and 100%, respectively. For neutralizing mAb screening, ch-2C5 was selected for its ability to block the ACE2CS-RBD interaction. A plaque assay confirmed that ch-2C5 neutralized SARS-CoV-2, with NT50 values of 4.19, 10.63, and 1.074 g/mL against the SARS-CoV-2 original strain, and the Beta and Delta variants, respectively. For the immunized sera samples, the neutralizing positive rate dropped from 82.14% to 32.16% within 4 months post-vaccination.

Here, we developed a real-time monitoring system for airborne influenza H3N2 viruses by integrating electronically addressable silicon nanowire (SiNW) sensor devices, microfluidics and bioaerosol-to-hydrosol air sampling techniques. When airborne influenza H3N2 virus samples were collected and delivered to antibody-modified SiNW devices, discrete nanowire conductance changes were observed within seconds. In contrast, the conductance levels remained relatively unchanged when indoor air or clean air samples were delivered. A 10-fold increase in virus concentration was found to give rise to about 20-30% increase in the sensor response. The selectivity of the sensing device was successfully demonstrated using H1N1 viruses and house dust allergens. From the simulated aerosol release to the detection, we observed a time scale of 1-2 min. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests revealed that higher virus concentrations in the air samples generally corresponded to higher conductance levels in the SiNW devices.

Although coughs have been characterized, little work has been done to examine coughs from infected individuals. The WeCoF project aims at providing evidence to support prevention measures to mitigate person-to-person influenza transmission in critical locations, such as hospitals, and during pandemics. FINDINGS: A novel experimental cough chamber facility C the FLUGIE C has been developed to study the far-field aerodynamics and aerosol transport of droplets produced by the coughs from humans naturally-infected with influenza. The flow field of each cough is measured using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). A preliminary study involving 12 healthy individuals has been carried out in order to quantify the strengths of their coughs at a distance of 1 m from the mouth. The spatially averaged maximum velocity was determined and the average value was 0.41 m/s across 27 coughs of good data quality.

Whilst significant efforts have been made to examine and enhance patient experience, to date little has progressed in relation to provider experience. This review aims to explore this knowledge gap by capturing evidence of clinician experience, and how this experience is defined and measured in the context of health system change and innovation. METHODS A rapid review of published and grey literature review was conducted utilising a rapid evidence assessment methodology. Seventy-nine studies retrieved from the literature were included in the review. Fourteen articles were identified from the grey literature search and one article obtained via hand searching. In total, 94 articles were included in the review. This study was commissioned by and co-designed with the New South Wales, Ministry of Health. RESULTS Clinician experience of delivering health care is inconsistently defined in the literature, with identified articles lacking clarity regarding distinctions between experience, engagement and work-related outcomes such as job satisfaction. Clinician experience was commonly explored using qualitative research that focused on experiences of discrete health care activities or events in which a change was occurring. Such research enabled exploration of complex experiences. In these contexts, clinician experience was captured in terms of self-reported information that clinicians provided about the health care activity or event, their perceptions of its value, the lived impacts they experienced, and the specific behaviours they displayed in relation to the activity or event. Moreover, clinician's experience has been identified to have a paucity of measurement tools. CONCLUSION Literature to date has not examined clinician experience in a holistic sense. In order to achieve the goals identified in relation to value-based care, further work is needed to conceptualise clinician experience and understand the nature of measurement tools required to assess this. In health system application, a broader 'clinician pulse' style assessment may be valuable to understand the experience of clinical work on a continuum rather than in the context of episodes of change/care.","output":"Clinicians' experience of providing care: a rapid review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Image segmentation approaches typically incorporate weak regularity conditions such as boundary length or curvature terms, or use shape information. High-level information such as a desired area or volume, or a particular topology are only implicitly specified. In this paper we develop a segmentation method with explicit bounds on the segmented area. Area constraints allow for the soft selection of meaningful solutions, and can counteract the shrinking bias of length-based regularization. We analyze the intrinsic problems of convex relaxations proposed in the literature for segmentation with size constraints. Hence, we formulate the area-constrained segmentation task as a mixed integer program, propose a branch and bound method for exact minimization, and use convex relaxations to obtain the required lower energy bounds on candidate solutions. We also provide a numerical scheme to solve the convex subproblems. We demonstrate the method for segmentations of vesicles from electron tomography images.","output":"Segmentation with Area Constraints"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two new SARS-CoV-2 lineages with the N501Y mutation in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein spread rapidly in the United Kingdom.

Respiratory allergy is associated with significant reductions in the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which is the entry receptor for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To observe COVID-19 susceptibility in patients with bronchial asthma, analyze the prevalence of asthma in a large cohort of consecutive outpatient subjects who were tested with the RT-PCR assay for COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective population-based cross-sectional study using data from a large nationwide health maintenance organization in Israel. All health maintenance organization enrollees who had been tested for COVID-19 from February to June 2020 were included. Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the subjects with negative and positive COVID-19 RT-PCR test results and between COVID-19 RT-PCR-positive subjects with and without asthma were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 37,469 subjects were tested for COVID-19 RT-PCR, and results for 2,266 (6.05%) of them were positive. A significantly higher proportion of smokers was observed in the COVID-19-negative group than in the COVID-19-positive group (4734 [13.45%] vs 103 [4.55%]; P < .001). Asthma was found in 153 (6.75 %) subjects of the COVID-19-positive group and in 3388 (9.62%) subjects of the COVID-19-negative group (P < .001). No significant impact of antileukotrienes, inhaled corticosteroids, and long-acting beta-blockers use was revealed on COVID-19 positivity proportions. Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, smoking, and comorbidity revealed a negative association of asthma with the likelihood of being positive for COVID-19 (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.87; P = .001).

Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI are two gadolinium-based contrast agent perfusion imaging techniques that provide complementary information about the tumor vasculature. However, each requires a separate administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the feasibility of synthesizing relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps, as computed from DSC MRI, from DCE MRI of brain tumors. METHODS: One hundred nine brain-tumor patients underwent both DCE and DSC MRI. Relative CBV maps were computed from the DSC MRI, and blood plasma volume fraction maps were computed from the DCE MRIs. Conditional generative adversarial networks were developed to synthesize rCBV maps from the DCE MRIs. Tumor-to-white matter ratios were calculated from real rCBV, synthetic rCBV, and plasma volume fraction maps and compared using correlation analysis. Real and synthetic rCBV in white and gray matter regions were also compared. RESULTS: Pearson correlation analysis showed that both the tumor rCBV and tumor-to-white matter ratios in the synthetic and real rCBV maps were strongly correlated (&#961; = 0.87, P < .05 and &#961; = 0.86, P < .05, respectively). Tumor plasma volume fraction and real rCBV were not strongly correlated (&#961; = 0.47). Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference between the synthetic and real rCBV tumor-to-white matter ratios of 0.20 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.47. CONCLUSION: Realistic rCBV maps can be synthesized from DCE MRI and contain quantitative information, enabling robust brain-tumor perfusion imaging of DSC and DCE parameters with a single gadolinium-based contrast agent administration.","output":"Synthetic generation of DSC-MRI-derived relative CBV maps from DCE MRI of brain tumors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To report the complications and outcome of dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated gall bladder disease. STUDY DESIGN Multi-institutional case series. ANIMALS Client-owned dogs (n=20). METHODS Medical records of dogs that underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy were reviewed and signalment, history, clinical and ultrasound examination findings, surgical variables, and complications were collated. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed using a multiport approach. Data were compared between dogs with successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy and dogs requiring conversion to open cholecystectomy. RESULTS Six dogs (30%) required conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy due to inability to ligate the cystic duct (3), evidence of gall bladder rupture (1), leakage from the cystic duct during dissection (1), and cardiac arrest (1). Cystic duct dissection was performed in 19 dogs using an articulating dissector (10), right angle forceps (7), and unrecorded (2). The cystic duct was ligated in 15 dogs using surgical clips (5), suture (6), or a combination (4). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and had resolution of clinical signs, although 1 dog developed pancreatitis and 1 dog required revision surgery for bile peritonitis. There was no significant difference in preoperative blood analysis results, surgical technique, or duration of hospitalization between dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cases converted to open cholecystectomy. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed successfully for uncomplicated gall bladder disease in dogs after careful case selection.

Older participants (n = 102, age = 76.54  7.72 years) were fitted with five wearable sensors and completed a five times sit-to-stand test.

This hyperinflammatory syndrome is reflected by the elevation of several inflammatory molecules, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, IL-6, troponin, and D-dimer. In a subset of patients, early intervention with signal inhibitors may treat the Covid-19 hyperinflammatory syndrome before the development of acute lung injury and organ failure. We present a summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled, multi-arm trial with two novel inflammatory signal inhibitors; Ruxolitinib (RUX) and Fostamatinib (FOS) for the treatment of Covid-19 pneumonia. RUX is an oral Janus Associated Kinase (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitor approved for the treatment of splenomegaly, myelofibrosis and polycythaemia vera. Inhibition of STAT3 downregulates IL-6 and IL-23, which are important for the inflammatory effects of Th17 cells. Further, JAK2 inhibition has been shown to reduce levels of TNFa and CRP, as well as reducing viral cellular entry and assembly. FOS is an oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia. Studies of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) suggest that the pathogenesis relies on a series of SYK events leading to cytokine and chemokine release. FOS acts by inhibiting SYK activity, blocking the production and release of cytokines induced via C-lectin receptors and Fc receptor activation, ameliorating the cytokine storm which precedes ARDS. Primary Objective: The primary objective of MATIS is to determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS compared to standard of care (SOC) to reduce the proportion of hospitalised patients progressing from mild or moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia at 14 days from baseline. Secondary objectives at 7, 14 and 28 days: - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce mortality - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the need for invasive ventilation or ECMO - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the need for non-invasive ventilation - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the proportion of patients suffering significant oxygen desaturation - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the need for renal replacement therapy - Determine the efficacy of RUX and FOS to reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism COVID-19 pneumonia - Determine the efficacy of RUX and FOS to reduce the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia [graded by a modified WHO Ordinal Scale] - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the level of inflammatory biomarkers - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the duration of hospital admission - Evaluate the safety of RUX and FOS for COVID-19 pneumonia Study Design: This is a multi-arm, two-stage, open-label, randomised (1:1:1) controlled trial. Participants will be recruited during hospitalisation for COVID-19 in multiple centres in the UK. Eligible participants (table 1) are randomised to one of the three interventions (RUX, FOS, SOC) by a central web-based randomisation service. This uses randomisation sequences with random block sizes, stratified by age (<65 and 65 years) and site. The treatment duration is 14 days from baseline. Patients receiving RUX will be administered 10mg BD for Day 1-7 and 5mg BD for Day 8-14. FOS will be administered as 150mg BD day 1-7 and 100mg BD day 8-14. Participants receive follow up assessments on days 7, 14 and 28 after the first dose. Outcomes: Primary endpoints will be assessed with a pairwise comparison (FOS vs SOC and RUX vs SOC) of the proportion of participants diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia within 14 days. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia is defined by a modified WHO COVID-19 Ordinal Score 5, comprising the following indicators of disease severity: - Death - Requirement for invasive ventilation - Requirement for non-invasive ventilation including CPAP or high flow oxygen - O2 saturation < 90% on 60% inspired oxygen Samples size: In stage 1 of this multi-arm study, 171 participants will be randomised (57 per arm). Following an interim analysis, if either intervention shows a signal of efficacy, stage 2 will recruit a further 95 participants per arm (Fig 1). Trial Status: Recruitment is ongoing and commenced 2nd October 2020. Currently 127 patients are recruited and stage 1 is projected to be completed by 1st September 2021.

OffLabel Disclosure: Fostamatanib - is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK). In the context of treating COVID-19, Fostamatanib acts by inhibiting SYK activist, blocking the production and release of cytokines induced via C-lectin receptors and Fc receptor activation, ameliorating the cytokine storm which precedes ARDS. Studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome induced by coronavirus, suggest that pathogenesis relies on a series of SYK events. SYK medicates ctuokine and chemokine release, induced by the activation of C-lectin receptors and immunoglobulin Fc receptors, resulting in neutrophil and monocyte lung ingress, sequential activation of neutrophil extracellular traps and activation of lung epithelium and multiple myeloid cell. This is followed by inflammation and tissue destruction that contribute to ARDS. Ruxolitinib - A JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. JAK and STAT molecules are proteins that trance extracellular stimulation into intracellular signalling, leading to expression of host inflammatory cytokines and a variety of immune cells. In the context of MATIS, we use low dose ruxolitinib to treat COVID-19 by targeting key signalling pathways implicated in the hyper-inflammatory response of patients with COVID-19 infection. The mechanisms of Ruxolitinib to act in COVID-19 is through inhibition of STAT3 activation, down regulating IL-6 and IL-23, signalling important for the inflammatory effects of Th17 cells. Furthermore it leads to reductions of TNFa and CRP.","output":"Multi-Arm Trial of Inflammatory Signal Inhibitors (MATIS) for Hospitalised Patients with Mild or Moderate COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Structured Summary of a Study Protocol for a Randomised Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Orientation: This article is about the experience of meaningful work for self-employed individuals.

INTERVENTIONS: Developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and refined from a prototype version that was evaluated during a smaller qualitative study, Whitu: seven ways in seven days is a well-being app that, as its name suggests, contains seven modules to help young people (1) recognise and rate emotions, (2) learn relaxation and mindfulness, (3) practice self-compassion and (4) gratitude, (5) connect with others, (6) care for their physical health and (7) engage in goal-setting. It can be completed within a week or as desired. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were changes in well-being on the WHO 5-item Well-Being Index and Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale. Secondary outcomes were changes in depression on the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, anxiety on the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale, self-compassion on the Self Compassion Scale-Short Form, stress on the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, sleep on the single-item Sleep Quality Scale and user engagement on the end-user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale and via qualitative feedback during an online survey. Outcomes were evaluated at baseline, 4 weeks (primary study endpoint) and 3 months, and analysed using linear mixed models with group, time and a groupCtime interaction. RESULTS: At 4 weeks, participants in the Whitu group experienced significantly higher emotional (Mean difference (md) 13.19 (3.96 to 22.42); p=0.005) and mental (md 2.44 (0.27 to 4.61); p=0.027) well-being, self-compassion (md 0.56 (0.28 to 0.83); p<0.001) and sleep (md 1.13 (0.24 to 2.02); p=0.018), and significantly lower stress (md ?4.69 (?7.61 to C1.76); p=0.002) and depression (md ?5.34 (?10.14 to C0.53); p=0.030), compared with the waitlist controls. Group differences remained statistically significant at 3 months for all outcomes. Symptoms of anxiety were also lower in the intervention group at 4 weeks (p=0.096), with statistically significant differences at 3 months (md ?2.31 (?4.54 to C0.08); p=0.042). Usability of Whitu was high (subjective ratings of 4.45 (0.72) and 4.38 (0.79) out of 5 at 4 weeks and 3 months, respectively) and qualitative feedback indicated individual and cultural acceptability of the app. CONCLUSIONS: Given the evolving psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, Whitu could provide a clinically effective and scalable means of improving the well-being, mental health and resilience of young people.

However, arid Middle Eastern countries with hot climate (elevated outdoor temperature and humidity levels) are experiencing a different situation. Unfortunately, these harsh ambient climatic conditions in Middle Eastern countries make it impossible for most buildings to utilize natural/mechanical ventilation systems. Besides, indoor air temperatures of most buildings are very low due to overconsumption of air conditioning, thereby, it can be a potential factor of virus spread in most residential homes and public buildings. Most importantly, habitual indoor burning of incense which is the major source of coarse (PM10; aerodynamic diameter <10 m) and fine (PM2.5; aerodynamic diameter <2.5 m) particulate matters (PM) could facilitate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus droplets and particles in indoor environments. In fact, it increases the spread of the virus via inhalation in these countries, especially where the wearing of masks is not regulated in public, commercial and residential buildings.

An anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to a sample of 407 Italian first-year medical students. Psychological well-being, perceived stress and quality of life were assessed using standardised questionnaires PGWBI, PSS, SF-12. Data were analysed with multivariate statistical methods. Significant differences in PGWBI, PSS and SF-12 scores were found between males and females (with poorer scores for females), between smokers and non-smokers (with poorer scores for smokers) and between students who reported cannabis use in their lifetime and students who did not (with poorer scores for those who smoked cannabis).

A relevant issue is that TMS is associated with considerable auditory and somatosensory stimulation, causing peripherally evoked potentials (PEPs) in the EEG, which contaminate the direct cortical responses to TMS (TEPs). All previous attempts to control for PEPs suffer from significant limitations. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS To design an optimized sham procedure to control all sensory input generated by subthreshold real TMS targeting the hand area of the primary motor cortex (M1), enabling reliable separation of TEPs from PEPs. METHODS In 23 healthy (16 female) subjects, we recorded EEG activity evoked by an optimized sham TMS condition which masks and matches auditory and somatosensory co-stimulation during the real TMS condition: auditory control was achieved by noise masking and by using a second TMS coil that was placed on top of the real TMS coil and produced a calibrated sound pressure level. Somatosensory control was obtained by electric stimulation (ES) of the scalp with intensities sufficient to saturate somatosensory input. ES was applied in both the sham and real TMS conditions. Perception of auditory and somatosensory inputs in the sham and real TMS conditions were compared by psychophysical testing. Transcranially evoked EEG signal changes were identified by subtraction of EEG activity in the sham condition from EEG activity in the real TMS condition. RESULTS Perception of auditory and somatosensory inputs in the sham vs. real TMS conditions was comparable. Both sham and real TMS evoked a series of similar EEG signal deflections and induced broadband power increase in oscillatory activity. Notably, the present procedure revealed EEG potentials and a transient increase in beta band power at the site of stimulation that were only present in the real TMS condition. DISCUSSION The results validate the effectiveness of our optimized sham approach. Despite the presence of typical responses attributable to sensory input, the procedure provided evidence for direct cortical activation by subthreshold TMS of M1. The findings are relevant for future TMS-EEG experiments that aim at measuring regional brain target engagement controlled by an optimized sham procedure.","output":"Recording brain responses to TMS of primary motor cortex by EEG - utility of an optimized sham procedure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cancer is one of the leading chronic diseases, which causes premature mortality in Korea. Early detection has been reported to be associated with reduced mortality and morbidity. Consistent evidence reports that lower screening rates are associated with socioeconomic-based disparities. This study aimed to examine income-related disparities in cancer screening services and to analyze the association between utilization of cancer screening and individual characteristics, including income levels. Methods: This study utilized the data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), a population-based survey from 2013 to 2019. The study population included individuals aged 40 years or over. The variables were socioeconomic characteristics and perceived health status. Household income was categorized into quartiles from Q1 (the lowest income group) to Q4 (the highest income group). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the association between cancer screening and individual characteristics and household income levels. Results: There were 20,347 individuals included in this study. Among these, 14,741 (72.4%) had undergone cancer screening. There existed a gap in the utilization of cancer screening between the lowest (Q1) and highest (Q4) income quintiles owing to evident income disparities; Q4 thus had a significantly higher likelihood of undergoing cancer screening than other quintiles. Female sex, university and over education, number of chronic diseases, and private insurance coverage were positively associated with cancer screening (p < 0.001).

We use a Monte-Carlo (MC) based algorithm to predict the virus infection rate for different population densities using the most recent epidemic data in our work. We test the spread of the Coronavirus using three different lockdown models, and eight various combinations of constraints, which allow us to examine the efficiency of each model and constraint.

The smart patch consisted of a fully integrated wearable wireless sensor with a multichannel temperature sensor, signal processing integrated circuit, wireless communication feature and a flexible battery. Thirty-five healthy adults were recruited for this test, carried out by wearing the patches on their upper chests for 24 h and checking their body temperature six times a day using infrared forehead thermometers as a gold standard for testing validity.

While previous studies concluded that shared rides can offer substantial benefits, initial evidence suggests low adoption levels. We postulate that previous studies that investigated the potential of ride-pooling failed to account for the trade-off that users are likely to make when considering a shared ride. We address this shortcoming by formulating user net benefit stemming from sharing as a compensatory function where the additional travel time and on-board discomfort need to be compensated by the price discount for a traveller to choose a shared ride over a private ride. The proposed formulation is embedded in a method for matching travel requests and vehicles. We conduct a series of experiments investigating how the potential of ride-pooling services depends on travel demand characteristics, user preferences and the pricing policy adopted by the service provider. In particular, the impact of various behavioural settings in terms of users' willingness to share their ride and delay aversion on service adoption and its operational efficiency is assessed. Our results suggest that the total vehicle mileage savings found by previous studies is only attainable when users are very willing to share their ride (i.e. attach low premium to private rides) and are offered a 50% discount for doing so. We find ride-pooling transportation distance savings as low as 15% in less favourable behavioural scenarios.","output":"Ride-Pooling Matching with a Compensatory Cost Function: Implications for Adoption, Efficiency and Level of Service"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To provide a safer environment for individuals working on-site at the Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil, we performed a large-scale mass testing SARS-CoV-2 program coupled with variant genotyping using two PCR-based approaches.

An important example of this problem is the nowcasting of COVID-19 mortality: given a stream of reported counts of daily deaths, can we correct for the delays in reporting to paint an accurate picture of the present, with uncertainty? Without this correction, raw data will often mislead by suggesting an improving situation. We present a flexible approach using a latent Gaussian process that is capable of describing the changing auto-correlation structure present in the reporting time-delay surface. This approach also yields robust estimates of uncertainty for the estimated nowcasted numbers of deaths. We test assumptions in model specification such as the choice of kernel or hyper priors, and evaluate model performance on a challenging real dataset from Brazil. Our experiments show that Gaussian process nowcasting performs favourably against both comparable methods, and against a small sample of expert human predictions. Our approach has substantial practical utility in disease modelling -- by applying our approach to COVID-19 mortality data from Brazil, where reporting delays are large, we can make informative predictions on important epidemiological quantities such as the current effective reproduction number.","output":"Gaussian Process Nowcasting: Application to COVID-19 Mortality Reporting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease, which is attributed to differences in the genetic characteristics of the leukemic clone. We studied the genomic profile of 52 treatment-na?ve CLL patients.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of anabolic implants varying in hormone type and concentration on growth, carcass characteristics, and trace mineral concentrations in Angus steers. Cattle administered an estradiol only implant did not experience differences in growth compared to non-implanted controls. However, cattle implanted with a trenbolone acetate only implant or a combined (estradiol and trenbolone acetate) implant experienced improvements in growth and changes in plasma and liver trace mineral concentrations. Greatest differences in growth and trace mineral concentrations were observed in steers administered the combination implant compared to non-implanted controls. These data suggest hormone type and concentration influence implant-induced growth and changes in plasma and liver trace mineral concentrations. ABSTRACT: Fifty Angus-sired steers were utilized to evaluate the effects of anabolic implants varying in hormone type and concentration on performance, carcass traits, and plasma and liver trace mineral concentrations over 129 d. Steers were stratified by weight into one of four (n = 12 or 13/treatment) implant treatments: (1) estradiol (E2; 25.7 mg E2; Compudose, Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN, USA), (2) trenbolone acetate (TBA; 200 mg TBA; Finaplix-H, Merck Animal Health, Madison, NJ, USA), (3) combination implant (ETBA; 120 mg TBA + 24 mg E2; Revalor-S, Merck Animal Health), or (4) no implant (CON). Steers were randomly assigned to pens equipped with GrowSafe bunks and fed a corn and barley-based finishing ration. Overall average daily gain and body weight were greater for ETBA and TBA than CON (p  0.04), but not E2 (p  0.12). Feed efficiency and hot carcass weight were only greater than CON for ETBA (p  0.03). Plasma and d 2 liver Zn concentrations were lesser for ETBA than CON (p  0.01) and d 10 liver Mn was lesser (p = 0.0003) for TBA than CON. These data indicate that implants containing TBA influence growth and trace mineral parameters, though more work investigating this relationship is necessary.","output":"Anabolic Implants Varying in Hormone Type and Concentration Influence Performance, Feeding Behavior, Carcass Characteristics, Plasma Trace Mineral Concentrations, and Liver Trace Mineral Concentrations of Angus Sired Steers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report in vivo selection of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike mutation (Q493R) conferring simultaneous resistance to bamlanivimab and etesivimab.

Zoonotic infections with Vaccinia virus (VACV) were first reported in Brazil in 1999, VACV is an emerging zoonotic Orthopoxvirus, which primarily infects dairy cattle and farmers in close contact with infected cows. Prospective studies of emerging pathogens could provide critical data that would inform public health planning and response to outbreaks. By using the location of 87-recorded outbreaks and publicly available bioclimatic data, we demonstrate one such approach. Using an ecological niche model (ENM) algorithm, we identify the environmental conditions under which VACV outbreaks have occurred, and determine additional locations in two affected countries that may be susceptible to transmission. Further, we show how suitability for the virus responds to different levels of various environmental factors and highlight the most important factors in determining its transmission. METHODS: A literature review was performed and the geospatial coordinates of 87 molecularly confirmed VACV outbreaks in Brazil were identified. An ENM was generated using MaxENT software by combining principal component analysis results of 19 bioclim spatial layers, and 25 randomly selected subsets of the original list of 87 outbreaks. RESULTS: The final ENM predicted all areas where Brazilian outbreaks occurred, one out of five of the Colombian outbreak regions and identified new regions within Brazil that are suitable for transmission based on bioclimatic factors. Further, the most important factors in determining transmission suitability are precipitation of the wettest quarter, annual precipitation, mean temperature of the coldest quarter and mean diurnal range. CONCLUSION: The analyses here provide a means by which to study patterns of an emerging infectious disease and identify regions that are potentially suitable for its transmission, in spite of the paucity of high-quality critical data. Policy and methods for the control of infectious diseases often use a reactionary model, addressing diseases only after significant impact on human health has ensued. The methodology used in the present work allows the identification of areas where disease is likely to appear, which could be used for directed intervention.

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A) is overexpressed in malignant tumors, including STS, and can be targeted with bevacizumab-800CW during fluorescence-guided surgery for real-time tumor detection. In this phase 1 clinical trial, we determined the feasibility, safety and optimal dose of bevacizumab-800CW for fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) in STS for in- and ex vivo tumor detection. Methods: Patients with a histopathologically diagnosis of STS were included. In the dose-escalation phase, patients received bevacizumab-800CW intravenously 3 days prior to surgery (10, 25 and 50 mg, n = 8). In the subsequent dose-expansion phase, 7 additional patients received bevacizumab-800CW at the optimal dose. Fluorescence images in- and ex vivo were obtained during all stages of standard of care. The optimal dose was determined by calculating in- and ex vivo Tumor-to-Background ratios (TBR) and correlating these results with histopathology. Results: Fifteen patients with STS completed this study. All tumors could be visualized during in- and ex vivo imaging. The optimal bevacizumab-800CW dose proved to be 10 mg with a median in vivo TBR of 2.0 (0.58) and an ex vivo TBR of 2.67 (1.6). All seven tumor-positive margins could be observed real-time after surgical resection. Conclusion: FGS using 10 mg bevacizumab-800CW is feasible and safe for intra-operative imaging of STS, potentially allowing tumor detection and margin assessment during surgery.

METHODS: We included single or bilateral LT patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab between March 1, 2020, to December 15, 2020 (n = 25; median age: 60, range 20-73 years; M: F 17:8). A group of patients with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection during 2016-18 were included to serve as a comparator group (n = 36). RESULTS: As compared to RSV, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to present with constitutional symptoms, spirometric decline, pulmonary opacities, new or worsening respiratory failure, and need for ventilator support. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were less likely to receive a multimodality treatment strategy, and they experienced worse post-infection lung function loss, functional decline, and three-month survival. A significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 needed readmission for worsening allograft function (36.4%), and chronic kidney disease at initial presentation was associated with this complication. Lower pre-morbid FEV1 appeared to increase the risk of new or worsening respiratory failure, which was associated with worse outcomes. Overall hospital survival was 88% (n = 22).

Methods: : We collected the data of all the MHD patients in this hemodialysis center by February 20, 2020, including those infected with COVID-19. These patients were divided into three groups: the control group (537 cases), confirmed group (66 cases) and suspected group (24 cases). We compared the relevant data of the three groups and analyzed the factors that may affect the possibility of catching COVID-19. Results: : 1. By February 20, 2020, there were 627 MHD patients in the Hemodialysis Center of Wuhan No.1 Hospital. The prevalence rate of the COVID-19 was 14.35% (90/627, including 66 confirmed cases and 24 suspected cases);the fatality rate 13.33% (12/90, including 12 death cases);the mortality rate 1.91% (12/627). 2. The comparison between the three groups revealed the following results: weekly hemodialysis duration (WHD), ultrafiltration volume (UFV) and ultrafiltration rate (UFR) of the confirmed group were obviously lower than those of the control and suspected groups ( P 0.05);the neutrophil ratio (N%), neutrophil (N#), monocyte (M#) and total carbon dioxide (TCO 2 ) were significantly higher than those of the control group while the lymphocyte ratio (L%) was much lower ( P 0.05). 3. The lung CT scans found three common features: bilateral abnormalities (81.54%), multiple abnormalities (84.62%) and patchy opacity (61.54%). 4. The binary logstic regression analysis showed that diabetes ( OR =5.404,95% CI 1.95014.976, P =0.001) and hypertension ( OR =3.099,95% CI 1.3806.963, P =0.006) are independent risk factors for MHD patients to be infected with COVID-19;WHD ( OR =0.846,95% CI 0.7370.970, P =0.017), UFR ( OR =0.012,95% CI 0.0020.058, P 0.001) and serum ferritin (SF, OR =0.823,95% CI 0.7480.906, P 0.001) are independent protective factors.

Ibrutinib, a once-daily Brutons tyrosine kinase inhibitor, may mitigate COVID-19Cinduced lung damage by reducing inflammatory cytokines. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase 2 iNSPIRE study evaluated ibrutinib for prevention of respiratory failure in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Methods Adult patients with severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization and supplemental oxygen but without respiratory failure were randomized 1:1 (stratified by remdesivir prescription) to ibrutinib 420 mg or placebo once daily for up to 28 days plus standard of care (SOC), including remdesivir and/or dexamethasone. Results Forty-six patients were randomized to ibrutinib plus SOC (n=22) or placebo plus SOC (n=24). The primary endpoint (proportion of patients alive and without respiratory failure through day 28) was not met, with no statistically significant difference adjusting for remdesivir prescription (86% with ibrutinib plus SOC vs 79% with placebo plus SOC;adjusted difference, 5.8%;80% CI, C9.2 to 20.4;P=.599). Secondary endpoints also showed no statistically significant improvement with ibrutinib plus SOC. Median treatment duration was 14 days for ibrutinib and placebo. Adverse events were similar with ibrutinib plus SOC versus placebo plus SOC (overall: 55% vs 50%;serious: 18% vs 13%) and were consistent with the known safety profile of ibrutinib.

However, the cost of this adsorbent depends so much on the raw material sources. Therefore, the approach of producing activated carbon from agricultural waste is strongly recommended due to economic advantages and environmental protection. One of the potential feed-stocks for the activated carbon production is cashew nut shell (CNS) waste which could reduce the negative impacts to the environment from the cashew nut processing industry and simultaneously enhance the values of the related products. This study focused on evaluating the influences of variable factors, such as activation temperature and time, on the properties of the activated carbon obtained from CNS. Methylene blue (MB) adsorption was applied to understand the adsorption mechanism of the products. The results show that increasing the activation temperature led to a rise in the adsorption capacity of the activated carbon within the temperature range of 800 to 850 C. Otherwise, the values were reduced when the temperature was greater than 850 C and this was related to the thermal decomposition of carbon. The adsorption capacity also increased when the activation time was changed from 30 min to 50 min. However, in the activation time range from 50 to 70 min, there was a reduction of the adsorption capacity of CNS-based activated carbon. The results also show that the MB adsorption of the activated carbon occurred with one-site-occupancy in the first layer and then layer-by-layer adsorption formation.","output":"Methylene blue adsorption mechanism of activated carbon synthesised from cashew nut shells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, showed various prevalence and case-fatality rates (CFR) among patients with different pre-existing chronic conditions. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with renal replacement therapy (RRT) might have a higher prevalence and CFR due to reduced immune function from uremia and kidney tropism of SARS-CoV-2, but there was a lack of systematic study on the infection and mortality of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in ESRD patients with various RRT. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched five electronic databases and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis up to June 30, 2020, to evaluate the prevalence and case fatality rate (CFR) of the COVID-19 infection among ESRD patients with RRT. The global COVID-19 data were retrieved from the international database on June 30, 2020, for estimating the prevalence and CFR of the general population as referencing points. Of 3,272 potential studies, 34 were eligible studies consisted of 1,944 COVID-19 confirmed cases in 21,873 ESRD patients with RRT from 12 countries in four WHO regions. The overall pooled prevalence in ESRD patients with RRT was 3.10% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25C5.72] which was higher than referencing 0.14% global average prevalence. The overall estimated CFR of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with RRT was 18.06% (95% CI 14.09C22.32) which was higher than the global average at 4.98%.

While some risk factors such as the presence of comorbidities, old age, and ethnicity have been recognized, not a lot is known about who the virus will strike first or impact more. In this hopeless scenario, exploration of time-tested facts about viral infections, in general, seems to be a sound basis to prop further research upon. The fact that immunity and its various determinants (e.g., micronutrients, sleep, and hygiene) have a crucial role to play in the defense against invading organisms, may be a good starting point for commencing research into these as yet undisclosed territories. Herein, the excellent immunomodulatory, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory roles of Vitamin D necessitate thorough investigation, particularly in COVID-19 perspective. This article reviews mechanisms and evidence suggesting the role Vitamin D plays in people infected by the newly identified COVID-19 virus. For this review, we searched the databases of Medline, PubMed, and Embase. We studied several meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials evaluating the role of Vitamin D in influenza and other contagious viral infections. We also reviewed the circumstantial and anecdotal evidence connecting Vitamin D with COVID-19 emerging recently. Consequently, it seems logical to conclude that the immune-enhancing, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and lung-protective role of Vitamin D can be potentially lifesaving. Hence, Vitamin D deserves exhaustive exploration through rigorously designed and controlled scientific trials. Using Vitamin D as prophylaxis and/or chemotherapeutic treatment of COVID-19 infection is an approach worth considering. In this regard, mass assessment and subsequent supplementation can be tried, especially considering the mechanistic evidence in respiratory infections, low potential for toxicity, and widespread prevalence of the deficiency of Vitamin D affecting many people worldwide.","output":"Evidences suggesting a possible role of Vitamin D in COVID 19: The missing link"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus infection which was first discovered in Wuhan City, China was transmitted very quickly to almost all countries in just a few months. This makes some countries implement policies to impose lockdowns to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus.

The previous mathematic modeling about Covid-19 almost exhibits exponential-shaped trends. Therefore, this study aims to formulate a deployment approach function of Covid-19 using the statistical thermodynamics concept. The spread function is developed from the distribution of velocity and rate of molecules by applying several molecular hypotheses. The formulation is done by making several analogies related to the social intervention, medical aspect, and weather conditions. Relating to relative humidity, it is not the main parameter, but it is used as a correction factor to temperature. The results in the exponential curves show that social intervention and medical aspects are more significant in preventing the Covid-19 transmission rather than the weather condition.

To find a valid plan for these services, an optimization problem called the home healthcare routing and scheduling problem is motivated to perform the logistics of the home care services. Although most studies mainly focus on minimizing the total cost of logistics activities, no study, as far as we know, has treated the patients satisfaction as an objective function under uncertainty. To make this problem more practical, this study proposes a bi-objective optimization methodology to model a multi-period and multi-depot home healthcare routing and scheduling problem in a fuzzy environment. With regards to a group of uncertain parameters such as the time of travel and services as well as patients satisfaction, a fuzzy approach named as the Jimenezs method, is also utilized. To address the proposed home healthcare problem, new and well-established metaheuristics are obtained. Although the social engineering optimizer (SEO) has been applied to several optimization problems, it has not yet been applied in the healthcare routing and scheduling area. Another innovation is to develop a new modified multi-objective version of SEO by using an adaptive memory strategy, so-called AMSEO. Finally, a comprehensive discussion is provided by comparing the algorithms based on multi-objective metrics and sensitivity analyses.

The psychological impact on frontline doctors of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is currently unknown. This longitudinal professional survey aims to understand the evolving and cumulative effects of working during the COVID-19 outbreak on the psychological well-being of doctors working in emergency departments (ED), intensive care units (ICU) and anaesthetics during the pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a longitudinal questionnaire-based study with three predefined time points spanning the acceleration, peak and deceleration phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcomes are psychological distress and post-trauma stress as measured by the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R). Data related to personal and professional characteristics will also be collected. Questionnaires will be administered prospectively to all doctors working in ED, ICU and anaesthetics in the UK and Ireland via existing research networks during the sampling period. Data from the questionnaires will be analysed to assess the prevalence and degree of psychological distress and trauma, and the nature of the relationship between personal and professional characteristics and the primary outcomes. Data will be described, analysed and disseminated at each time point; however, the primary endpoint will be psychological distress and trauma at the final time point.

To do so, we investigate large Italian firms discussions on Twitter in the first nine months of the pandemic. Specifically, we ask: How is firms Twitter discussion developing during the Covid-19 pandemic? Which CSR dimensions and topics do firms discuss? To what extent do they resonate with the public? We downloaded Twitter posts by the accounts of large Italian firms, and we built the bipartite network of accounts and hashtags. Using an entropy-based null model as a benchmark, we projected the information contained in the network into the accounts layers, identifying a network of accounts. We find that the network is composed of 13 communities and accounts at the core of the network focus on environmental sustainability, digital innovation, and safety. Firms ownership type does not seem to influence the conversation. While the relevance of CSR hashtags and stakeholder engagement is relatively small, peculiarities arise in some communities.

Despite ample availability of Gram-positive antibiotics, there is a distinct lack of agents against Gram-negative pathogens, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, which remains a real threat in Japan. The AMR Action Plans aim to mitigate the growing public health concern posed by AMR. Objective: This study aims to estimate the clinical and economic outcomes of drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens forecasts for Japan to guide resource allocation defined within the upcoming National AMR Action Plan. Methods: A previously published and validated dynamic health economic model was adapted to the Japanese setting. The model used a 10-year time horizon with a willingness-to-pay threshold of 5 000 000 (US $46 827) and discounting was applied at a rate of 2% to costs and benefits. Clinical and economic outcomes were assessed as a function of varying AMR levels of three Gram-negative pathogens in Japan by up to 100% of the current level. Results: Reducing drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens in Japan has the potential to save 4 249 096 life years, corresponding to 3 602 311 quality-adjusted life years. The associated maximum clinical and economic gains were estimated at up to 4 422 284 bed days saved, up to 3 645 480 defined daily doses of antibiotics avoided, up to 117.6 billion (US $1.1 billion) saved in hospitalization costs, and a net monetary benefit of up to 18.1 trillion (US $169.8 billion). Discussion: Learnings from this study can be used by the Japanese government to help inform decision-making on the strategies that may be included in the upcoming National AMR Action Plan and facilitate allocation of the required budget.

However, using conventional diagnostic techniques, a causative agent is not always found. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) allows analysis of the complete virome, but has not yet been applied in COPD exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: To study the respiratory virome in nasopharyngeal samples during COPD exacerbations using mNGS. STUDY DESIGN: 88 nasopharyngeal swabs from 63 patients from the Bergen COPD Exacerbation Study (2006C2010) were analysed by mNGS and in-house qPCR for respiratory viruses. Both DNA and RNA were sequenced simultaneously using an Illumina library preparation protocol with in-house adaptations. RESULTS: By mNGS, 24/88 samples tested positive. Sensitivity and specificity, as compared with PCR, were 96% and 98% for diagnostic targets (23/24 and 1093/1120, respectively). Additional viral pathogens detected by mNGS were herpes simplex virus type 1 and coronavirus OC43. A positive correlation was found between Cq value and mNGS viral normalized species reads (log value) (p = 0.002). Patients with viral pathogens had lower percentages of bacteriophages (p<0.001). No correlation was found between viral reads and clinical markers. CONCLUSIONS: The mNGS protocol used was highly sensitive and specific for semi-quantitative detection of respiratory viruses. Excellent negative predictive value implicates the power of mNGS to exclude any pathogenic respiratory viral infectious cause in one test, with consequences for clinical decision making. Reduced abundance of bacteriophages in COPD patients with viral pathogens implicates skewing of the virome during infection, with potential consequences for the bacterial populations, during infection.","output":"The respiratory virome and exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In 2009, a new influenza A H1N1 virus emerged causing a global pandemic. A range of monovalent influenza A H1N1pdm09 vaccines with or without adjuvants were developed. After the mass vaccination campaigns safety concerns related to H1N1pdm09 vaccines were reported. More than a decade later, reported AEFIs are still under scrutiny. We performed a systematic review aiming to synthesize the evidence on the safety of the H1N1pdm09 vaccines on reported outcomes from existing systematic reviews. METHODS: Four electronic databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Epistimonikos and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for articles on H1N1pdm09 vaccination published from 2009 to January 2021. Systematic reviews assessing short- or long-term adverse events after H1N1pdm09 vaccination were considered for inclusion. Data was extracted from all selected reviews. Outcomes were grouped and results from each included review were presented narratively and in tables. RESULTS: 16 systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Reported outcomes were short-term events (3 reviews), fetal/pregnancy outcomes (8 reviews), Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) (4 reviews), narcolepsy (2 reviews) demyelinating diseases (1 review based on one study only) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (1 review). Short-term serious adverse events were rare, 3 cases amongst 16725 subjects in 18 randomized controlled trials (0.018%). No deaths were reported. The risks of local events were generally higher for adjuvanted vaccines as compared to unadjuvanted vaccines. Maternal H1N1pdm09 vaccination in any trimester was not associated with an increase in preterm birth, small for gestational age, congenital malformations or fetal death. For GBS, results were conflicting. The main systematic review on narcolepsy found a 5-14-fold increased risk in children, and a 2-7- fold increased risk in adults after vaccination with Pandemrix. The attributable risk of narcolepsy one year after vaccination was 1 case per 18 400 vaccine doses in children/adolescents, and 1 case per 181 000 vaccine doses in adults. CONCLUSION: Adjuvanted vaccines had more local but not serious adverse events compared to unadjuvanted vaccines. Vaccination with Pandemrix was strongly associated with narcolepsy, particularly in children. No increased risks of pregnancy outcomes were seen after pandemic vaccination. The findings on GBS were inconclusive.","output":"Safety of Influenza A H1N1pdm09 Vaccines: An Overview of Systematic Reviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The family of coronaviruses comprises a diverse set of strains and variants which cause diseases from the common cold to COVID-19. Moreover, they infect a wide array of hosts from bats, camels, birds, to humans. Studying coronaviruses through the lens of host specificity provides a unique perspective to understanding the evolution, diversity and dynamics of this family. In particular, this can reveal groups of different hosts infected by similar strains, giving clues on strains which were more likely to have evolved to jump from one host to another. In this work, we frame host specificity as a classification task, in designing a very compact numerical representation of the spike sequences of different coronaviruses. Based on this numerical representation, classification methods are able to detect the target host with high accuracy. Such an approach can used to efficiently scale to large volumes of sequences, in order to unveil trends in the host specificity of different coronavirus strains. ABSTRACT: The study of host specificity has important connections to the question about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in humans which led to the COVID-19 pandemican important open question. There are speculations that bats are a possible origin. Likewise, there are many closely related (corona)viruses, such as SARS, which was found to be transmitted through civets. The study of the different hosts which can be potential carriers and transmitters of deadly viruses to humans is crucial to understanding, mitigating, and preventing current and future pandemics. In coronaviruses, the surface (S) protein, or spike protein, is important in determining host specificity, since it is the point of contact between the virus and the host cell membrane. In this paper, we classify the hosts of over five thousand coronaviruses from their spike protein sequences, segregating them into clusters of distinct hosts among birds, bats, camels, swine, humans, and weasels, to name a few. We propose a feature embedding based on the well-known position weight matrix (PWM), which we call PWM2Vec, and we use it to generate feature vectors from the spike protein sequences of these coronaviruses. While our embedding is inspired by the success of PWMs in biological applications, such as determining protein function and identifying transcription factor binding sites, we are the first (to the best of our knowledge) to use PWMs from viral sequences to generate fixed-length feature vector representations, and use them in the context of host classification. The results on real world data show that when using PWM2Vec, machine learning classifiers are able to perform comparably to the baseline models in terms of predictive performance and runtimein some cases, the performance is better. We also measure the importance of different amino acids using information gain to show the amino acids which are important for predicting the host of a given coronavirus. Finally, we perform some statistical analyses on these results to show that our embedding is more compact than the embeddings of the baseline models.","output":"PWM2Vec: An Efficient Embedding Approach for Viral Host Specification from Coronavirus Spike Sequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Undoubtedly, wellness tourism industry, in pre-COVID-19 era, was well developed around the world.

To understand the differences between antibody responses in mild versus severe cases of COVID-19, we analyzed the B cell responses in patients 1.5 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe and not mild infection correlated with high titers of IgG against Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that were capable of viral inhibition. B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing revealed two VH genes, VH3C38 and VH3C53, that were enriched during severe infection. Of the 22 antibodies cloned from two severe donors, six exhibited potent neutralization against live SARS-CoV-2, and inhibited syncytia formation. Using peptide libraries, competition ELISA and RBD mutagenesis, we mapped the epitopes of the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to three different sites on the Spike.

Factors associated with overuse have been inconsistently reported and vary across populations. Given the burgeoning occurrence of infectious diseases around the world, there remains a great need to identify barriers and solutions to the control of infections. We examined whether knowledge about infections and antibiotic resistance is associated with antibiotic use in a northern European population sample. METHODS: The Health Survey Northern Ireland 2014/15 was completed by a cross-sectional sample of 4135 participants aged > 16 years. Participants were asked whether they had taken an antibiotic in the past 12 months; and six questions were asked concerning knowledge about infections and antibiotic resistance. Correct answers to the six knowledge questions defined a knowledge score (score range 0C6 correct answers). We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds of self-reported antibiotic use during the last 12 months in association with knowledge score (lowest score, 0/6, as referent), and response to each knowledge question. Covariates included sex, age group, smoking, alcohol drinking, deprivation index, self-rated health, and satisfaction with life. Results were outputted as Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). RESULTS: Antibiotic use in the past 12 months was reported by 39.0% (1614/4135); and 84.2% (3482/4135) scored < 6/6 correct on knowledge statements. Compared to the lowest knowledge score (0/6 correct), the highest knowledge score (6/6 correct) was associated with higher odds of antibiotic use (adjusted OR 2.03, 95% CI [1.46, 2.81], p < 0.001), with a P-value < 0.001 for trend with increasing knowledge score. Female sex, age, high deprivation, and poor general health, were independently associated with higher odds of antibiotic use. Stratified analyses showed sex and age group differences. CONCLUSION: Knowledge, and other modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, were positively associated with antibiotic use in the past 12 months. While the causal direction of these associations could not be determined, given the high prevalence of lesser knowledge, as well as independent contributions of other factors including socioeconomic characteristics, health literacy campaigns to raise awareness of antibiotic resistance should take a multi-pronged approach.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe disease severity and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pregnancy across the Washington State, including pregnancy complications and outcomes, hospitalization, and case fatality. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, were identified in a multicenter retrospective cohort study from 35 sites in Washington State. Sites captured 61% of annual state deliveries. Case-fatality rates in pregnancy were compared with coronavirus disease 2019 fatality rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State using rate ratios and rate differences. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared by trimester of infection and disease severity at the time of delivery. RESULTS: The principal study findings were as follows: (1) among 240 pregnant patients in Washington State with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections, 1 in 11 developed severe or critical disease, 1 in 10 were hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019, and 1 in 80 died; (2) the coronavirus disease 2019-associated hospitalization rate was 3.5-fold higher than in similarly aged adults in Washington State (10.0% vs 2.8%; rate ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-5.3); (3) pregnant patients hospitalized for a respiratory concern were more likely to have a comorbidity or underlying conditions including asthma, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disease, and class III obesity; (4) 3 maternal deaths (1.3%) were attributed to coronavirus disease 2019 for a maternal mortality rate of 1250 of 100,000 pregnancies (95% confidence interval, 257-3653); (5) the coronavirus disease 2019 case fatality in pregnancy was a significant 13.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.7-43.6) higher in pregnant patients than in similarly aged individuals in Washington State with an absolute difference in mortality rate of 1.2% (95% confidence interval, -0.3 to 2.6); and (6) preterm birth was significantly higher among women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 at delivery than for women who had recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (45.4% severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 vs 5.2% mild coronavirus disease 2019; P<.001).

Thus, new therapeutic strategies and effective vaccines are urgently needed to cope with this severe pandemic. The development of a broadly neutralizing antibody against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the attractive treatment strategies for COVID-19. Currently, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies when SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells through an interaction between the S protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressed on various human cells. A single monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment is prone to selective pressure due to increased possibility of targeted epitope mutation, leading to viral escape. In addition, the antibody-dependent enhancement effect is a potential risk of enhancing the viral infection. These risks can be reduced using multiple mAbs that target nonoverlapping epitopes. Thus, a cocktail therapy combining two or more antibodies that recognize different regions of the viral surface may be the most effective therapeutic strategy.","output":"Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies present new prospects to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study of the origin and implications of fatigue in exercise has been widely investigated, but not completely understood given the complex multifactorial mechanisms involved.

We found high levels of anxiety and depression, with more than 50% experiencing levels above the clinical cut offs, and females scoring significantly higher than males. The survey also suggested relatively low levels of resilience which we attribute to restrictions and isolation which reduced the opportunities to engage in helpful coping strategies and activities rather than enduring personality characteristics. Higher levels of distress were associated with lower levels of exercising, higher levels of tobacco use, and a number of life events associated with the pandemic and lockdown, such as cancelled events, worsening in personal relationships and financial concerns. We discuss the importance of longer-term monitoring and mental health support for university students.","output":"The mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: An online survey in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health crisis that negatively impacts the health infrastructure by diverting resources to manage this infection. The long-term impact on the health of patients due to a lack of appropriate medical care to avoid COVID-19 infection is already visible in the mortality rates of the general population. The presence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the female genital tract is not clear. Bubbles produced during hysteroscopy tend to cool down to the temperature of the distension medium and then dissolve. Hence, aerosols are not produced during hysteroscopy, which is usually performed in an office setting. If anesthesia is required, conscious sedation or regional anesthesia should preferably be used to reduce aerosol production. Hence, hysteroscopy is not an aerosol-generating procedure and the risk of COVID-19 infection is low; therefore, hysteroscopy should not be ruled out in emergencies.","output":"Hysteroscopy in COVID 19 pandemic: safety concerns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: A large general hospital was suddenly disabled by an in-hospital outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (SARS). Method: The crisis was successfully managed by a Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) that included: (a) containment of SARS patients on a special floor and evacuation of the patients from the infected and near-around floors; (b) sorting of the hospital into areas and floors to avoid cross contact of people; (c) triage of patients into groups according to risks; (d) closure of the emergency room and outpatient clinics; and (e) set up of an outdoor fever screening station and emergency service. Results: The situation was quickly controlled after the implementation of these procedures. The central argument in this case is that crisis managerial behavior is the result of how managers channel and distribute the attention of their crisis sense. Impact on industry: What managers should do depends on what risk issues and actions related to risk independency, efficiency, safety priority, and transparency they take. What risk issues and actions they take depends on the crisis sense and on how management responds to leadership, resource, and execution.","output":"Crisis management of SARS in a hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Policy Points Reflecting on current response deficiencies, we offer a model for a national contingency supply chain cell (NCSCC) construct to manage the medical materials supply chain in support of emergencies, such as COVID-19. We develop the following: a framework for governance and response to enable a globally independent supply chain; a flexible structure to accommodate the requirements of state and county health systems for receiving and distributing materials; and a national material \\"control tower\\" to improve transparency and real-time access to material status and location. CONTEXT Much of the discussion about the failure of the COVID-19 supply chain has centered on personal protective equipment (PPE) and the degree of vulnerability of care. Prior research on supply chain risks have focused on mitigating the risk of disruptions of specific purchased materials within a bounded region or on the shifting status of cross-border export restrictions. But COVID-19 has impacted every purchase category, region, and border. This paper is responsive to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recommendation to study and monitor disasters and to provide governments with course of action to satisfy legislative mandates. METHODS Our analysis draws on our observations of the responses to COVID-19 in regard to acquisition and contracting problem-solving, our review of field discussions and interactions with experts, a critique of existing proposals for managing the strategic national stockpile in the United States a mapping of the responses to national contingency planning phases, and the identification of gaps in current national healthcare response policy frameworks and proposals. FINDINGS Current proposals call for augmenting a system that has failed to deliver the needed response to COVID-19. These proposals do not address the key attributes for pandemic plan renewal: flexibility, traceability and transparency, persistence and responsiveness, global independence, and equitable access. We offer a commons-based framework for achieving the opportunities and risks which are responsive to a constellation of intelligence assets working in and across focal targets of global supply chain risk. CONCLUSIONS The United States needs a \\"commons-based strategy\\" that is not simply a stockpile repository but instead is a network of repositories, fluid inventories, and analytic monitoring governed by the experts. We need a coordinated effort, a \\"commons\\" that will direct both conventional and new suppliers to meet demands and to eliminate hoarding and other behaviors.","output":"A Commons for a Supply Chain in the Post-COVID-19 Era: The Case for a Reformed Strategic National Stockpile."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been postulated that the underlying pathophysiology of COVID-19 is mediated by cytokine storm resulting in a hyperinflammatory state. A similar kind of cytokine-storm has been described in individuals undergoing veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) support. There is therefore concern that initiation of VV ECMO support among COVID19 patients could further exacerbate this dysregulated inflammatory response. In this prospective cohort study, we describe the clinical course and cytokine fluctuations in eight subjects treated with VV ECMO for management of refractory respiratory failure from COVID19. Among all eight patients, cytokine elevations were noted among Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Interleukin 10 (IL-10), and Interleukin 2 Receptor (CD25) soluble (sIL2R).

This is a cohort study assessing adult patients hospitalized due to moderate or severe forms of COVID-19 between March and August 2020. Baseline information includes several clinical and hospitalization data. Further evaluations were made using several different reliable instruments designed to assess taste and smell functions, parosmia, and neuropsychiatric disorders (using standardized psychiatric and cognitive measures).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the complication rates of the gastric stapling alone versus stapling with oversewing invagination of the staple line in the LSG. METHODS This is a single-center randomized study, Patients were randomized to two groups, 200 patients underwent LSG without reinforcement of the staple line and 200 patients underwent LSG with oversewing of the staple line. All patients were followed up for 1 year. The data collected prospectively for statistical analysis included demographics, BMI, preoperative comorbidities, operative time, complications, and hospital stay. RESULTS The overall mean operative age was 33.7  9.4 years and mean BMI was 42.4  4.3 kg/m2. Patient baseline characteristics (age, gender, weight, and BMI) and comorbidities were generally a nonsignificant different between the treatment arms. Surgical time was shorter in patients of the nonreinforced group (44.3  vs 51.3  4.3 min; p < 0.01) with lower %EWL (73  13.8 vs 80.7  13.6%, p < 0.01). One patient in the nonreinforced group was complicated by gastric leak. The staple-line bleeding rate was significantly lower in patients underwent oversewing of the staple line during LSG (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Oversewing of the staple line during LSG is a nonexpansive and easy method to decrease the incidence and severity of the postoperative bleeding. However, it is time-consuming and should be performed by experienced surgeons to avoid the complications which may occur secondary to the seroserotomy suturing.","output":"A Randomized Comparison Between Staple-Line Oversewing Versus No Reinforcement During Laparoscopic Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital communication technologies can be used for team consultation, case management, and information sharing in health and mental health services for children and young people (CYP).

Half of the patients with cGVHD do not respond to first-line therapy with corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Ruxolitinib is effective in steroid-refractory (SR)-cGVHD cases, but the long-term effects of ruxolitinib on the oral mucosa are unknown. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aims to assess the effect of ruxolitinib on the oral mucosa of SR-cGVHD patients with oral involvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational longitudinal patient study was conducted in 53 patients with SR-cGVHD and oral involvement who were treated with ruxolitinib. The baseline condition of the oral mucosa was compared to its condition at 4 and 12 weeks after starting ruxolitinib. RESULTS: The overall response was 81% (43/53), with a complete response in 53% (28/53) and partial response in 28% (15/53) after 12 weeks (p < 0.001). Men and patients concurrently using immunosuppressive therapy responded better than women (p = 0.005) and patients with ruxolitinib monotherapy (p = 0.02), respectively.

In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19Cassociated coagulopathies are unknown. Identifying the molecular basis of how SARS-CoV-2 drives coagulation is essential to mitigating short- and long-term thrombotic risks of sick and recovered patients with COVID-19. We aimed to perform coagulation-focused transcriptome analysis of in vitro infected primary respiratory epithelial cells, patient-derived bronchial alveolar lavage cells, and circulating immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective was to identify transcription-mediated signaling networks driving coagulopathies associated with COVID-19. We analyzed recently published experimentally and clinically derived bulk or single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infection to identify changes in transcriptional regulation of blood coagulation. We also confirmed that the transcriptional expression of a key coagulation regulator was recapitulated at the protein level. We specifically focused our analysis on lung tissueCexpressed genes regulating the extrinsic coagulation cascade and the plasminogen activation system. Analyzing transcriptomic data of in vitro infected normal human bronchial epithelial cells and patient-derived bronchial alveolar lavage samples revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and suppresses the plasminogen activation system. We also performed in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments on primary human lung epithelial cells to confirm that transcriptional upregulation of tissue factor, the extrinsic coagulation cascade master regulator, manifested at the protein level. Furthermore, infection of normal human bronchial epithelial cells with influenza A virus did not drive key regulators of blood coagulation in a similar manner as SARS-CoV-2. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not differentially express genes regulating the extrinsic coagulation cascade or plasminogen activation system during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that they are not directly inducing coagulopathy through these pathways. The hyperactivation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and the suppression of the plasminogen activation system in SARS-CoV-2Cinfected epithelial cells may drive diverse coagulopathies in the lung and distal organ systems. Understanding how hosts drive such transcriptional changes with SARS-CoV-2 infection may enable the design of host-directed therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19 and other coronaviruses inducing hypercoagulation.","output":"Lung Epithelial Cell Transcriptional Regulation as a Factor in COVID-19Cassociated Coagulopathies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study pure exploration in multi-armed bandits with graph side-information.

In Cuba, all confirmed cases of COVID-19 were hospitalized from this point forward. OBJECTIVE Characterize the first patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Cuba. INTRODUCTION METHODS We carried out a descriptive, cross-sectional study of 415 suspected cases of COVID-19 admitted to the Pedro Kour Tropical Medicine Institute in Havana, Cuba, from March 11, 2020 through April 10, 2020. (In Cuba, all patients suspected of being COVID-19-positive were admitted to hospitals or isolation centers for observation and treatment.) Of these 415 individuals, 63 (15.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Information was obtained from the Institute's databases as well as a standardized interview form for cases confirmed or suspected as infected with the novel coronavirus. We considered the following variables: age, sex, occupation at the time of interview, national origin, personal health history, time elapsed between symptom onset and hospital admission, signs and symptoms, diagnosis and status at discharge. We based our analysis on frequency distributions and double-entry contingency tables. RESULTS The mean age was 50 years (range: 16-94 years). The 45-54 age group represented the largest share of cases (25.4%; 16/63); persons aged 65 years were 20.6% (13/63); there were more men than women (55.6% vs. 44.4%). Cubans represented 52.4% (33/63) of patients while 47.6% (30/63) were from 14 countries where COVID-19 had already been identified. All foreigners and Cubans who arrived from abroad were considered imported cases (54.0%; 34/63). Health personnel (10 doctors and 1 nurse) represented 17.5% (11/63) of cases. Cough (50.8%), fever (46.0%), sore throat (22.2%) and headache (19.0%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Asymptomatic patients represented 25.4% (16/63) of cases. Hypertension was the most frequently associated chronic disease (28.6%), followed by asthma (25.0%) and diabetes (17.9%). Patients who were admitted to hospital 3 days after symptom onset represented 66.7% (42/63) of cases. Mean hospital stay was 13.7 days (range: 1-27 days). Factors associated with a higher risk of contracting the disease included occupation as a healthcare worker (OR: 1.85; 95%, CI: 0.88-3.87) and aged 65 years (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 0.85-3.34). Five individuals died, for a fatality rate of 7.9% (three foreigners and two Cubans; four men and one woman). Four of these patients were infected outside of Cuba and one was identified as a contact of a confirmed case. All patients who died had significant comorbidities (diabetes, asthma and hypertension). Age of deceased patients ranged from 54 to 87 years. CONCLUSION The first patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Cuba were admitted to the Pedro Kour Tropical Medicine Institute in Havana. They share characteristics with those reported by other countries: more men than women were affected, and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and asthma were all important risk factors, as was age 65 years. More than half of all cases were imported, and autochthonous patients were all contacts of confirmed cases.","output":"Clinical-Epidemiological Characteristics of the First Patients Diagnosed with COVID-19 in Cuba."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, which is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, is characterized by lung pathology and extrapulmonary complications(1,2). Type I interferons (IFNs) have an essential role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (refs (3C5)). Although rapid induction of type I IFNs limits virus propagation, a sustained increase in the levels of type I IFNs in the late phase of the infection is associated with aberrant inflammation and poor clinical outcome(5C17). Here we show that the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)Cstimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, which controls immunity to cytosolic DNA, is a critical driver of aberrant type I IFN responses in COVID-19 (ref.

Moreover, cGASCSTING activity was detected in lung samples from patients with COVID-19 with prominent tissue destruction, and was associated with type I IFN responses. A lung-on-chip model revealed that, in addition to macrophages, infection with SARS-CoV-2 activates cGASCSTING signalling in endothelial cells through mitochondrial DNA release, which leads to cell death and type I IFN production. In mice, pharmacological inhibition of STING reduces severe lung inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 and improves disease outcome.

However, drug development for 3CLpro has been hindered by a lack of cell-based reporter assays that can be performed in a BSL-2 setting. Current efforts to identify 3CLpro inhibitors largely rely upon in vitro screening, which fails to account for the cell permeability and cytotoxicity of compounds, or assays involving replication-competent virus, which must be performed in a BSL-3 facility and are not amenable to high-throughput screening. Methods: To address these limitations, we explored the use of a cell-based luciferase complementation reporter to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in a BSL-2 setting. We constructed lentiviral vectors that co-express 3CLpro and a split reporter in which two luciferase fragments were linked by a 3CLpro cleavage site. 3CLpro-mediated cleavage of the reporter was expected to result in loss of complementation and low luciferase activity, whereas inhibition of 3CLpro was expected to result in significantly higher levels of luciferase activity. Results: In the absence of inhibitors, we found that most of the luciferase reporter was cleaved by 3CLpro, resulting in low luciferase activity. However, inhibition of 3CLpro, either with the small molecule GC376 or an inactivating mutation (C145A), prevented cleavage and resulted in an 10-fold increase in luciferase reporter activity. We also found that our reporter assay can easily distinguish between cytotoxicity and true inhibition of 3CLpro. With this assay, we screened 31 additional small molecules for activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, including HIV protease inhibitors, HCV protease inhibitors, and various other compounds that have been reported to inhibit 3CLpro. Of these, only four compounds exhibited significant activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in cells: boceprevir, Z-FA-FMK, calpain inhibitor XII, and GRL-0496. Conclusion: We have developed a novel luciferase complementation reporter assay for identification of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors in living cells. The assay is sensitive, rapid, easy to perform, and can readily differentiate cytotoxicity from 3CLpro inhibition, a powerful feature that should reduce false positives during screening. This assay should greatly facilitate efforts to identify more potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.","output":"Luciferase complementation assay for identification of SARS-CoV- 2 3CLPRO inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We introduce a deep learning framework that can detect COVID-19 pneumonia in thoracic radiographs, as well as differentiate it from bacterial pneumonia infection.

The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of inreach, with and without mailed outreach, to increase HCV screening and follow-up in a large, difficult-to-reach patient population. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic randomized clinical trial from August 2018 to May 2019 in a large safety-net health system. Patients born between 1945 and 1965 were randomly assigned (1:1) to inreach with an electronic health record reminder to providers (n = 6,195) or inreach plus mailed HCV screening outreach (n = 6,191) to complete HCV antibody screening. Outreach also included processes to promote HCV RNA testing among those with a positive HCV antibody and linkage to care among those with positive HCV RNA. The primary outcome was completion of HCV antibody testing within 3 months of randomization (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03706742). RESULTS: We included 12,386 eligible patients (median age 60 years; 46.5% Hispanic, 33.0% Black, and 16.0% White). In intent-to-treat analyses, HCV screening completion was significantly higher among inreach-plus-outreach patients than inreach-alone patients at 3 months (14.6% vs 7.4%, P < 0.001) and 6 months (17.4% vs 9.8%, P < 0.001) after randomization. Among those who completed HCV screening within 6 months, a higher proportion of inreach-plus-outreach patients with positive antibody results completed RNA testing within 3 months than inreach-alone patients (81.1% vs 57.1%, respectively, P = 0.02); however, linkage to care within 3 months of HCV infection confirmation did not significantly differ between the 2 groups (48.1% vs 75.0%, respectively, P = 0.24).

The present study aims to evaluate the potential of wedelolactone (WDL), a natural occurring coumestan found in Eclipta alba to mitigate the parkinsonism in Caenorhabditis elegans disease model. In the present studies, supplementation with 37.5 M WDL exhibited a reduction in the level of &#945;-syn in an age-dependent manner (22% at day 5, p < 0.05; and 16% at day 10, p < 0.001, n = 30), along with improvement in neuronal health through basal movement, and elevated the dopamine levels evident through 1-nonanol repulsion results in wild-type and diseased worms. Moreover, WDL augmented the mitochondrial health in wild-type, PD-diseased, and mev-1 mutant worms that establish the inherent activity of WDL in the alleviation of oxidative stress.

The aim of this study was to identify the perceived consequences of this on staff and their work and on students and their studies at universities. METHOD: The study used a variety of methods, which involved an on-line survey on the influences of social isolation using a non-probability sampling. More specifically, two techniques were used, namely a convenience sampling (i.e. involving members of the academic community, which are easy to reach by the study team), supported by a snow ball sampling (recruiting respondents among acquaintances of the participants). A total of 711 questionnaires from 41 countries were received. Descriptive statistics were deployed to analyse trends and to identify socio-demographic differences. Inferential statistics were used to assess significant differences among the geographical regions, work areas and other socio-demographic factors related to impacts of social isolation of university staff and students. RESULTS: The study reveals that 90% of the respondents have been affected by the shutdown and unable to perform normal work or studies at their institution for between 1 week to 2 months.

In this review, we discuss the current diagnostic yield of this generic diagnostic approach by evaluating the studies that have employed next-generation sequencing techniques in cohorts of patients with primary immunodeficiencies. The average diagnostic yield for primary immunodeficiencies is determined to be 29% (range 10C79%) and 38% specifically for whole-exome sequencing (range 15C70%). The significant variation between studies is mainly the result of differences in clinical characteristics of the studied cohorts but is also influenced by varying sequencing approaches and (in silico) gene panel selection. We further discuss other factors contributing to the relatively low yield, including the inherent limitations of whole-exome sequencing, challenges in the interpretation of novel candidate genetic variants, and promises of exploring the non-coding part of the genome. We propose strategies to improve the diagnostic yield leading the way towards expanded personalized treatment in PIDs.","output":"Next-Generation Sequencing in the Field of Primary Immunodeficiencies: Current Yield, Challenges, and Future Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA granules are structures within cells that play major roles in gene expression and homeostasis. Two principle kinds of RNA granules are conserved from yeast to mammals: stress granules (SGs), which contain stalled translation initiation complexes, and processing bodies (P-bodies, PBs), which are enriched with factors involved in RNA turnover. Since RNA granules are associated with silenced transcripts, viruses subvert RNA granule function for replicative advantages. This review, focusing on RNA viruses, discusses mechanisms that manipulate stress granules and P-bodies to promote synthesis of viral proteins. Three main themes have emerged for how viruses manipulate RNA granules; i) cleavage of key host factors, ii) control of PKR activation and iii) redirecting RNA granule components for new or parallel roles in viral reproduction, at the same time disrupting RNA granules. Viruses utilize one or more of these routes to achieve robust and productive infection.","output":"Regulation of Stress Granules and P-Bodies During RNA Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an unexpected pandemic that has caused a state of emergency, as well as generating drastic changes in clinical care protocols Some drugs commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other systemic autoimmune diseases have been described for its treatment Therefore, there is an imminent risk of shortages The aim of this narrative review and expert opinion is to present general recommendations on the clinical and administrative management of outpatients with autoimmune or systemic inflammatory disease, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic Resumen La enfermedad por Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) es una pandemia inesperada que ha provocado un estado de emergencia y que ha generado cambios drsticos en los protocolos de atencin clnica Para su tratamiento se ha descrito el papel de algunos medicamentos usados habitualmente en artritis reumatoide, lupus eritematoso sistmico y otras enfermedades autoinmunitarias sistmicas Debido a ello, existe un inminente riesgo de desabastecimiento, por lo cual el objetivo de esta revisin narrativa y opinin de expertos es formular recomendaciones generales clnicas y administrativas sobre el manejo de pacientes ambulatorios con enfermedad autoinmunitaria o inflamatoria sistmica en el contexto de la pandemia por COVID-19","output":"Recommendations for rheumatologists on pharmacological management during the COVID-19 health emergency: Expert group opinion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Local communities can play a role in helping to restore tropical peatlands by using more sustainable agricultural practices.

However, no study has been conducted on the knowledge, attitudes, acceptance, and determinates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, acceptance, and determinants of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among the adult population in Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 492 study participants from March 1 to March 15, 2021. A multistage sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. Six skilled and qualified data collectors had participated to gather the data using a pretested structured-administered questionnaire. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. P-value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant association. RESULTS: This study revealed that the level of good knowledge, positive attitude and intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were 74%, 44.7%, and 62.6%, respectively. Moreover, having an age 46 years with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.36 [95% CI, 1.09C5.39], attended secondary and above education adjusted odds ratio 2.59 [95% CI, 1.52C4.39], having a chronic disease adjusted odds ratio of 3.14 [95% CI, 1.21C8.14], and having good knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine adjusted odds ratio 2.59 [95% CI, 1.67C4.02] were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSION: In this study, the level of good knowledge, positive attitude, and intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were 74%, 44.7%, and 62.6%, respectively. Thus, health education and communication from government sources are very crucial methods to alleviate the negative attitude of the COVID-19 vaccine.","output":"Understanding of COVID-19 Vaccine Knowledge, Attitude, Acceptance, and Determinates of COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Among Adult Population in Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of high-ranking publications on photobiomodulation is increasing disproportionately worldwide and it is therefore easy to understand that the therapy option should also be methodically expanded and tested in the treatment of COVID-19 as a complementary method for combating pandemics.

By the use of different valves incorporated to the circuit, the device enables the restriction of possible cross contamination and the individualization of tidal volumes, driving pressures, and positive end expiratory pressure PEEP. Possible interactions in the expiratory dynamics of different pairs of patients are evaluated in terms of the characteristic exhalatory times. These characteristic times can not be easily established using simple linear lumped element models. For this purpose, a 1D model using the Hydraulic and Mechanical libraries in Matlab Simulink was developed. In this sense, experiments accompany this study to validate the model and characterize the different valves of the circuit. Our results show that connecting two patients in parallel to a ventilator always resulted in delays of time during the exhalation. The size of this effect depends on different parameters associated with the patients, the circuit and the ventilator. The dynamics of the exhalation of both patients is determined by the ratios between patients exhalatory resistances, compliances, driving pressures and PEEPs. Adverse effects on exhalations became less noticeable when respiratory parameters of both patients were similar, flow resistances of valves added to the circuit were negligible, and when the ventilator exhalatory valve resistance was also negligible. The asymmetries of driving pressures, compliances or resistances exacerbated the possibility of auto-PEEP and the increase in relaxation times became greater in one patient than in the other. In contrast, exhalatory dynamics were less sensitive to the ratio of PEEP imposed to the patients.","output":"Exhalatory dynamic interactions between patients connected to a shared ventilation device"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a newly identified regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. This type I membrane-anchored protein has a catalytically active ectodomain that undergoes shedding. Tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme (TACE) has been shown to be involved in ACE2 shedding. Although pathophysiological significance of ACE2 shedding has been suggested, regulation of this process by TACE is not clearly defined. We characterized TACE-mediated constitutive ectodomain shedding of ACE2 using wild-type Chinese Hamster Ovary (WT-CHO), the TACE-mutant M2 (M2-CHO) cells, and EC-4 and EC-2 cells that are fibroblasts from wild-type and TACE-null mice, respectively. ACE2 was constitutively cleaved to release two distinct major soluble forms. The deglycosylated molecular masses of the larger (LSF) and smaller soluble form (SSF) were approximately 80 and 70 kDa, respectively. These forms had equivalent enzyme activities. Reduced shedding for the LSF from M2-CHO and EC-2 cells when compared with WT-CHO and EC-4 cells, respectively, was noted. TACE reconstitution in EC-2 cells expressing ACE2 resulted in increase in LSF but not SSF release, demonstrating a main role of TACE in LSF release and distinct regulations of release of the two soluble forms. Deletions of the juxtamembrane region of ACE2 reduced LSF release in CHO cell lines, whereas it abolished TACE-induced shedding in EC-2 cells. Analysis of TACE structural domains confirmed that the active site in the catalytic domain is essential for ACE2 shedding but that noncatalytic domains also play additional roles. These results demonstrate selective and specific regulation of constitutive shedding of ACE2 by TACE.","output":"Selective and specific regulation of ectodomain shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 by tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anti-angiogenic approaches have significantly advanced the treatment of vascular-related pathologies.

Yet the need to continue to train physicians to care for patients and communities is greater than ever. Medical educators are responding by adapting curricula in response to requirements for social distancing, changing availability of clinical learning opportunities, and limitations on testing center availability for examinations. These disruptions require a systems approach to ensure that learners achieve competence in preparation for advancement in training toward unsupervised practice. In this article, the authors assert that medical educators, obligated by current conditions to adapt educational experiences, should seize the opportunity presented by the pandemic to make needed changes in 3 areas aligned with competency-based medical education: focusing on outcomes, broadening the assessment toolbox, and improving the undergraduate medical education (UME) to graduate medical education (GME) transition. Defined outcomes, as exemplified by entrustable professional activities, will enable curricular designers to shorten and adapt learning experiences by focusing on students' achievement of prespecified learning outcomes. Broadening the assessment toolbox entails capturing more and different assessment information about learners to provide a well-rounded view of their strengths and areas for growth in both traditional and novel settings, such as telehealth. Limitations on available data, such as licensing examination scores and clerkship grades, heighten the urgency to revise the system for the UME to GME transition by enhancing the quality and usability of information available to residency program directors.

A root-cause analysis through questionnaires and objective data sampling was conducted with support of internal stakeholders to explore the problem. Practical issues in sample handling linked to inadequate communication and training were identified as the main cause for sample rejection.By the third week of March (i.e. one week in the project), an immediate approach was taken.

The aim is to evaluate the relationship between Percentage of Fat Mass (FM%) and immune-inflammatory response, after 10 days in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). METHODS: Prospective observational study of 22 adult patients, affected by COVID-19 pneumonia and admitted to the ICU and classified in two sets: (10) lean and (12) obese, according to FM% and age (De Lorenzo classification). Patients were analyzed at admission in ICU and at 10th day. RESULTS: Obese have steatosis, impaired hepatic function, compromise immune response and higher inflammation.

Among them, 150 neonates had perinatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure and 2 neonates had late postnatal exposure. Stable infant-mother dyads were roomed-in with precautions to support breastfeeding. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptaseCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. There was a high incidence of prematurity (23%), low birth weight (31%), intrauterine fetal distress (16%), perinatal asphyxia (6%), admission to neonatal intensive care unit (24%), and mortality (1.3%) among neonates with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In this sub-group, 20 neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample(s). A recent official publication by the World Health Organization emphasizes that the perinatal SARS-CoV-2-exposed neonates found RT-PCR positive once in upper respiratory (non-sterile) sample must document viral persistence in another non-sterile sample for confirmation of mother-to-child virus transmission. With this approach, only one neonate was confirmed intrapartum transmission. A telephonic follow-up in discharged neonates at 1 month of age or 1 month postexposure recorded them all to be asymptomatic and doing well.

OBJECTIVE: (s): The purpose of this study was to describe occupational fatigue in pharmacists using exploratory factor analysis (EFA)-assessing whether dimensional structures used to describe occupational fatigue in other health professions fit pharmacist perceptions. METHODS: A model was created to conceptualize two \\"fatigue\\" domains found in the literature-physical fatigue (ex. Physical discomfort) and mental fatigue (ex. trouble thinking clearly). These domains were operationalized and used to create a survey that was distributed to licensed pharmacists at a conference. An EFA was conducted to identify the key domains underlying pharmacist perceptions of fatigue. RESULTS: A total of 283 surveys were distributed, and 115 were returned and useable. Respondents were primarily white, female, and worked 9.5 h-per-day on average. The EFA suggested a statistically significant two-factor model (&#935;2 9.73, p = 0.28), which included physical fatigue (&#945; = 0.87) and mental fatigue (&#945; = 0.82) dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: The EFA yielded a structure similar to what was anticipated from the literature. While working, pharmacists may not be aware of fatigue related short-cuts or lapses that pose risks to patient safety. This study is just the first step in promoting systematic interventions to prevent or cope with fatigue and prevent the patient, pharmacist, and institutional outcomes.","output":"Operationalizing occupational fatigue in pharmacists: An exploratory factor analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anorectal malignant melanoma(AMM)is a relatively rare disease with an extremely poor prognosis.

INTRODUCTION: Management of the severe thoracolumbar (TL) spine fracture-dislocation injuries have been further complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The need to optimize resources and minimize the personnel in the operating room (OR) led us to develop a novel technique to reduce TL fracture-dislocations (AO type-C) using an orthopedic distractor device (ODD). METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care spine center with a study duration from March 2020 to May 2020 coinciding with the nationwide lockdown and travel restrictions imposed in view of the COVID-19 crisis. Only patients with AO type C fracture-dislocation managed using the ODD operated by a single surgeon were included in the study. RESULTS: Of 12 cases, the most commonly affected level was D12-L1. Nine patients were American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) A at presentation, two patients were AIS B, and one AIS C. The mean operative time was 125 min and mean blood loss was 454 ml. Eight patients remained AIS A, one patient improved from AIS B to C. Two patients became independent walkers, one remained AIS B. The post-operative VAS score improved to a mean value of 2.33. The improvement in kyphosis was 26.24 immediate postoperatively and maintained at 25.9, percentage height loss reduced to 2.75% immediate postoperatively and maintained at 3.16% at 3 months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Management of TL fracture-dislocations in COVID times of health care resource scarcity can be challenging.

Currently, many types of smart patches have been developed to continuously monitor body temperature, but few trials have been completed to evaluate psychometrics and feasibility for human subjects in real-life scenarios. The aim of this feasibility study was to evaluate the reliability, validity and usability of a smart patch measuring body temperature in healthy adults. The smart patch consisted of a fully integrated wearable wireless sensor with a multichannel temperature sensor, signal processing integrated circuit, wireless communication feature and a flexible battery. Thirty-five healthy adults were recruited for this test, carried out by wearing the patches on their upper chests for 24 h and checking their body temperature six times a day using infrared forehead thermometers as a gold standard for testing validity. Descriptive statistics, one-sampled and independent t-tests, Pearsons correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plot were examined for body temperatures between two measures. In addition, multiple linear regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and qualitative content analysis were conducted. Among the 35 participants, 29 of them wore the patch for over 19 h (dropout rate: 17.14%). Mean body temperature measured by infrared forehead thermometers and smart patch ranged between 32.53 and 38.2 C per person and were moderately correlated (r = 0.23C0.43) overall. Based on a Bland-Altman plot, approximately 94% of the measurements were located within one standard deviation (upper limit = 4.52, lower limit = ?5.82). Most outliers were identified on the first measurement and were located below the lower limit. It is appropriate to use 37.5 C in infrared forehead temperature as a cutoff to define febrile conditions. Users position while checking and ambient temperature and humidity are not affected to the smart patch body temperature. Overall, the participants showed high usability and satisfaction on the survey. Few participants reported discomfort due to limited daily activity, itchy skin or detaching concerns. In conclusion, epidermal electronic sensor technologies provide a promising method for continuously monitoring individuals body temperatures, even in real-life situations.

Previous data from this laboratory had shown that the cytokine tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) enhances IFN--mediated class II antigen expression on astrocytes. We have now investigated the effect of IFN- and TNF- on class II MHC mRNA expression in astrocytes using Northern blot analysis. Astrocytes do not constitutively express mRNA for class II MHC. Kinetic analysis of class II MHC mRNA expression in IFN--treated cells demonstrated an 8 h time lag, which was followed by an increase over the next 16 h. Optimal expression of class II mRNA was detected after a 24 h incubation with IFN-. This level of expression was further enhanced by the simultaneous addition of IFN- and TNF- to the astrocytes, while TNF- alone had no effect on class II mRNA expression. TNF- does not act by increasing the stability of IFN--induced class II mRNA, indicating its action is not at that specific level of post-transcriptional control. Furthermore, astrocyte class II mRNA expression was inhibited when cycloheximide (CHX) was added together with IFN- or IFN-/TNF-, and when CHX was added up to 4 h after treatment with IFN- or IFN-/TNF-. These results indicate that astrocyte class II mRNA expression is mediated by newly synthesized proteins induced by IFN- and/or IFN-/TNF-. The expression of class II antigens on astrocytes, and cytokine modulation of their expression, may be important in the initiation and perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.","output":"Induction and regulation of class II major histocompatibility complex mRNA expression in astrocytes by interferon- and tumor necrosis factor-"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an invasive breast cancer with the characteristics of easy to develop distant metastasis. Immune escape is one of the main reasons for TNBC growth and metastasis. Enhancement of T cell-mediated anti-tumor activity may benefit to inhibit tumor metastasis and improve the efficacy of cancer therapy. As a natural bioactive substance, resveratrol shows potential capability to prevent or suppress the development of a variety of cancers through direct or indirect effects, including immunoregulatory effect. However, whether resveratrol might affect lung metastasis of TNBC, and whether the effect of resveratrol might be associated with resveratrol-regulated immune responses in tumor microenvironment is still unknown. In this study, by using an experimental metastatic mouse 4 T1 tumor model, we identified that resveratrol may suppress TNBC lung metastasis by elevating local anti-tumor immunity. Indeed, an increase in the cytotoxic activity of CD8+T cells as well as the levels of type 1 cytokine IFN- and IL-2 in the lungs of resveratrol-treated tumor bearing mice were observed. The enhanced CD8+T cell activity and Th1 immune responses by resveratrol administration might be related to the down-regulated PD-1 expression on pulmonary CD8+T cells and CD4+T cells. Resveratrol may also convert macrophages to M1 phenotype in the lungs of tumor bearing mice. However, it seems likely resveratrol has no effect on pulmonary myeloid-derived suppressor cell activation. Our results provide an evidence that resveratrol might be a promising candidate agent for adjuvant therapy in the process of TNBC metastasis.","output":"Resveratrol attenuates TNBC lung metastasis by down-regulating PD-1 expression on pulmonary T cells and converting macrophages to M1 phenotype in a murine tumor model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay provides a critical observation of the South Korean government's distinctive management of COVID-19 with particular reference to the state of emergency It reveals that the success of South Korea's handling of the pandemic is largely attributed by a majority of Western media to the efficient deployment of both information and communication technologies and Confucian collectivism, two components that seem contradictory yet not incompatible under the rubric of techno-Orientalism Analyzing the intensification of surveillance and the rapid datafication of society, this essay argues that the current state of emergency is not a breakdown of normality but a continuation of the state of crisis and disaster that rules a developing country like South Korea In doing so, the essay seeks to facilitate a critical discussion about a new mode of democracy in the era of pandemic that increasingly grapples with tensions between individual freedom and public health ?

If sick or healthy, or both, predominantly socially distance, the epidemic curve flattens. Contact reductions may occur for different reasons during a pandemic including health-related mobility loss (severity of symptoms), duty of care for a member of a high-risk group, and forced quarantine. Other decisions to reduce contacts are of a more voluntary nature. In particular, sick people reduce contacts consciously to avoid infecting others, and healthy individuals reduce contacts in order to stay healthy. We use game theory to formalize the interaction of voluntary social distancing in a partially infected population. This improves the behavioral micro-foundations of epidemiological models, and predicts differential social distancing rates dependent on health status. The model's key predictions in terms of comparative statics are derived, which concern changes and interactions between social distancing behaviors of sick and healthy. We fit the relevant parameters for endogenous social distancing to an epidemiological model with evidence from influenza waves to provide a benchmark for an epidemic curve with endogenous social distancing. Our results suggest that spreading similar in peak and case numbers to what partial immobilization of the population produces, yet quicker to pass, could occur endogenously. Going forward, eventual social distancing orders and lockdown policies should be benchmarked against more realistic epidemic models that take endogenous social distancing into account, rather than be driven by static, and therefore unrealistic, estimates for social mixing that intrinsically overestimate spreading.","output":"Endogenous social distancing and its underappreciated impact on the epidemic curve"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background To assess and limit the SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk from symptomless individuals in the hospital setting, molecular and serological screening of staff and patients attending a tertiary hospital in China was conducted. Methods SARS-CoV-2 RNA was tested by quantitative RT-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were screened initially with two lateral flow immunoassays (LFIs) and further confirmed with three chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs). The assay performance was assessed using archived samples from 32 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 80 healthy individuals. Results Between April 24 and May 8, 2020, 16,043 subjects (7,392 medical staff, 4,714 inpatients, 1,209 chaperones, 1,705 outpatients, and 1,023 fever clinic patients) were screened. No subject tested positive for viral RNA. Seventy-three (0.46%) tested positive for IgM or IgG on the initial LFI screening, of whom 63 were investigated with CLIAs: 2 (0.01%) were confirmed as seroreactive and 18 (0.11%) were indeterminate. Unconfirmed seroreactivity was significantly more frequent in fever clinic patients. The CLIAs showed similar (95.0-100%) IgM or IgG specificity but higher IgG sensitivity (93.75-96.88% vs. 31.25-81.25%) than the LFIs. The confirmed seropositive cases included a previously discharged COVID-19 patient and an undiagnosed symptomless patient showing detectable IgM and IgG over 35 days of follow-up. No transmission was evidenced within the corresponding family cluster. Conclusions Low SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and limited exposure risk were observed. Seroprevalence varied between 0.012% and 0.12% according to the testing algorithm and the confirmation criteria used, indicating that quality standards for serological tests are needed.

We analysed the plasma levels of D-dimer, OPN, OPG, GFAP, vWF, and ADAMTS13 in LVO vs non-LVO. Diagnostic performance was estimated by using blood biomarkers alone or in combination with NIHSS-derived stroke severity scales. Results. Our patient cohort comprised 20% stroke mimics, 11% transient ischemic attack, 11% hemorrhagic stroke, 15% LVO ischemic stroke, 28% non-LVO ischemic stroke, and 15% ischemic stroke with unknown LVO status. Multivariable analysis found that the optimal set of blood biomarkers for LVO prediction was D-dimer (OR 15.4, 95% CI 4.9 to 57.6; p-value<0.001) and GFAP (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.99; p-value=0.03).

Combining the outstanding electrical conductivity (200,000 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)) of graphene with the unique avidin and biotin interaction, we demonstrate a novel graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) biosensor for the quantitative detection of bio-macromolecules. The GFET consists of six pairs of interdigital Cr/Au electrodes supported on Si/SiO(2) substrate with an avidin immobilized single layer graphene channel as the sensing platform. By monitoring the real time current change upon the addition of biotin solution in bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the silicone pool preformed onto the GFET, the lowest detectable biotin concentration is estimated to be 90 fg/ml (0.37 pM). The specificity of the GFET is confirmed both by controlled and real sample measurements From the magnitude of current change upon the addition of different concentrations of biotin solutions, the dissociation constant K(d) is estimated to be 1.6  10(-11) M. Since biotin is capable of conjugating with proteins, nucleotides and other bio-macromolecules without altering their properties, the present GFET sensor with its ultra-high sensitivity (0.37 pM) and specificity can be tailored to the rapid point-of-care detection of different types of desired biomolecules at very low concentration level through biotinylation as well as the exogenous biotin in blood serum.","output":"Graphene field-effect transistor biosensor for detection of biotin with ultrahigh sensitivity and specificity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To characterize modified triaxial microwave antennas configured to produce short ablation zones. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty single-antenna and 27 paired-antenna hepatic ablations were performed in domestic swine (N = 11) with 17-gauge gas-cooled modified triaxial antennas powered at 65 W from a 2.45-GHz generator. Single-antenna ablations were performed at 2 (n = 16), 5 (n = 21), and 10 (n = 13) minutes. Paired-antenna ablations were performed at 1-cm and 2-cm spacing for 5 (n = 7 and n = 8, respectively) and 10 minutes (n = 7 and n = 5, respectively). Mean transverse width, length, and aspect ratio of sectioned ablation zones were measured and compared. RESULTS For single antennas, mean ablation zone lengths were 2.9 cm  0.45, 3.5 cm  0.55, and 4.2 cm  0.40 at 2, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. Mean widths were 1.8 cm  0.3, 2.0 cm  0.32, and 2.5 cm  0.25 at 2, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. For paired antennas, mean length at 5 minutes with 1-cm and 2-cm spacing and 10 minutes with 1-cm and 2-cm spacing was 4.2 cm  0.9, 4.9 cm  1.0, 4.8 cm  0.5, and 4.8 cm  1.3, respectively. Mean width was 3.1 cm  1.0, 4.4 cm  0.7, 3.8 cm  0.4, and 4.5 cm  0.7, respectively. Paired-antenna ablations were more spherical (aspect ratios, 0.72-0.79 for 5-10 min) than single-antenna ablations (aspect ratios, 0.57-0.59). For paired-antenna ablations, 1-cm spacing appeared optimal, with improved circularity and decreased clefting compared with 2-cm spacing (circularity, 0.85 at 1 cm, 0.78 at 2 cm). CONCLUSIONS Modified triaxial antennas can generate relatively short, spherical ablation zones. Paired-antenna ablations were rounder and larger in transverse dimension than single antenna ablations, with 1-cm spacing optimal for confluence of the ablation zone.","output":"Creation of short microwave ablation zones: in vivo characterization of single and paired modified triaxial antennas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous anthropogenic contaminants, and their abundance in the entire ecosystem raises the question of how far is the impact of these MPs on the biota, humans, and the environment. Recent research has overemphasized the occurrence, characterization, and direct toxicity of MPs; however, determining and understanding their genotoxic effect is still limited. Thus, the present review addresses the genotoxic potential of these emerging contaminants in aquatic organisms and in human peripheral lymphocytes and identified the research gaps in this area. Several genotoxic endpoints were implicated, including the frequency of micronuclei (MN), nucleoplasmic bridge (NPB), nuclear buds (NBUD), DNA strand breaks, and the percentage of DNA in the tail (%Tail DNA). In addition, the mechanism of MPs-induced genotoxicity seems to be closely associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inflammatory responses, and DNA repair interference. However, the gathered information urges the need for more studies that present environmentally relevant conditions. Taken into consideration, the lifestyle changes within the COVID-19 pandemic, we discussed the impact of the pandemic on enhancing the genotoxic potential of MPs whether through increasing human exposure to MPs via inappropriate disposal and overconsumption of plastic-based products or by disrupting the defense system owing to unhealthy food and sleep deprivation as well as stress.

The anatomic location of a lumbar hernia makes diagnosis and repair challenging. We successfully repaired a lumbar hernia using a single-incision laparoscopic total extraperitoneal approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of this surgical technique in the treatment of a primary Grynfeltt hernia. CASE PRESENTATION A 76-year-old Taiwanese man presented to our hospital with a left lower bulging mass noted for over three months. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a left Grynfeltt hernia. We performed a single-incision laparoscopic total extraperitoneal repair. Our patient was discharged uneventfully on the fourth day after the operation. There was no evidence of recurrence after six months of follow-up. CONCLUSION A laparoscopic total extraperitoneal repair for a lumbar hernia provides an excellent operative view and minimal invasiveness. The single-incision technique also provides better cosmetic outcomes. Our experience suggests that the single-incision laparoscopic total extraperitoneal approach may be a feasible and safe alterative to conventional approaches in lumbar hernia repair.","output":"Single-incision laparoscopic total extraperitoneal repair for a Grynfeltt hernia: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Cicatricial entropion is typically an acquired condition that can affect the upper and lower eyelids.

Patients found to have severe upper and lower eyelid cicatricial entropion were included in the study if they had undergone or were scheduled to undergo simultaneous upper and lower eyelid repair through the use of a shared mucosal graft. Pre-operative exams which included pre-operative photos and description of eyelid position were performed. Shared mucosal graft surgery was performed. At post-operative week 1, the patients had splitting of their shared mucosal grafts. Post-operative photos as well as post-operative description of eyelid position were made at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. RESULTS At 6 months after surgical repair of severe upper and lower eyelid cicatricial entropion by shared mucosal grafts, patients were found to have resolution of entropic eyelid position as well improvement in ocular surface irritation.

The present report revealed the existence of seven CAMTA genes along with their alternate transcripts in five chromosomes of rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Phylogenetic trees classified seven CAMTA genes into three clades indicating the evolutionary conservation in gene structure and their association with other plant species. The in silico study was carried out considering 2 kilobases (kb) promoter regions of seven OsCAMTA genes regarding the distribution of transcription factor binding sites (TFbs) of major and plant-specific transcription factors whereas OsCAMTA7a was identified with highest number of TFbs, while OsCAMTA4 had the lowest. Comparative modelling, i.e., homology modelling, and molecular docking of the CAMTA proteins contributed the thoughtful comprehension of protein 3D structures and protein-protein interaction with probable partners. Gene ontology annotation identified the involvement of the proteins in biological processes, molecular functions, and localization in cellular components.

TIM-1 expression has been implicated in Ebola virus (EBOV) pathogenesis; however, it remains unclear whether this is due to TIM-1 serving as a filovirus receptor in vivo or, as others have suggested, TIM-1 induces a cytokine storm elicited by T cell/virion interactions. Here, we use a BSL2 model virus that expresses EBOV glycoprotein to demonstrate the importance of TIM-1 as a virus receptor late during in vivo infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Infectious, GFP-expressing recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding either full length EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GP/rVSV) or mucin domain deleted EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GPO/rVSV) was used to assess the role of TIM-1 during in vivo infection. GFP-expressing rVSV encoding its native glycoprotein G (G/rVSV) served as a control. TIM-1-sufficient or TIM-1-deficient BALB/c interferon / receptor(-/-) mice were challenged with these viruses. While G/rVSV caused profound morbidity and mortality in both mouse strains, TIM-1-deficient mice had significantly better survival than TIM-1-expressing mice following EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GPO/rVSV challenge. EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GPO/rVSV in spleen of infected animals was high and unaffected by expression of TIM-1. However, infectious virus in serum, liver, kidney and adrenal gland was reduced late in infection in the TIM-1-deficient mice, suggesting that virus entry via this receptor contributes to virus load. Consistent with higher virus loads, proinflammatory chemokines trended higher in organs from infected TIM-1-sufficient mice compared to the TIM-1-deficient mice, but proinflammatory cytokines were more modestly affected. To assess the role of T cells in EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis, T cells were depleted in TIM-1-sufficient and -deficient mice and the mice were challenged with virus. Depletion of T cells did not alter the pathogenic consequences of virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies provide evidence that at late times during EBOV GP/rVSV infection, TIM-1 increased virus load and associated mortality, consistent with an important role of this receptor in virus entry. This work suggests that inhibitors which block TIM-1/virus interaction may serve as effective antivirals, reducing virus load at late times during EBOV infection.","output":"TIM-1 serves as a receptor for Ebola virus in vivo, enhancing viremia and pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study attempted to draw the present and future perspective of the COVID-19 vaccine by identifying the most important scientists and their scientific contexts, trends of research topics, and relationships between different entities.

RESULTS: We discovered remarkable reductions ? in rhinovirus (RV) prevalence by about 25% (95% highest density interval (HDI) [-0.35,-0.15]) in the months after the measures against SARS-CoV-2 were introduced in Germany. In the months after the measures began to ease, RV prevalence increased to low pre-pandemic levels, e.g. in August 2020 ?=-0.14 (95% HDI [-0.28,0.12]). CONCLUSIONS: RV prevalence is negatively correlated with the stringency of anti-SARS-CoV-2 measures with only a short time delay. This result suggests that RV prevalence could possibly be an indicator for the efficiency for these measures. As RV is ubiquitous at higher prevalence than SARS-CoV-2 or other emerging respiratory viruses, it could reflect the efficacy of noninvasive measures better than such emerging viruses themselves with their unevenly spreading clusters.","output":"Rhinovirus prevalence as indicator for efficacy of measures against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread across the world and was characterized as a pandemic. To protect medical laboratory personnel from infection, most laboratories inactivate the virus causing COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in clinical samples before testing. However, the effect of inactivation on the detection results remains unknown. Here, we used a digital PCR assay to determine the absolute SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number in 63 nasopharyngeal swab samples and assess the effect of inactivation methods on viral RNA copy number. Viral inactivation was performed by three different methods: (i) incubation with the TRIzol LS reagent for 10 min at room temperature, (ii) heating in a water bath at 56C for 30 min, and (iii) high-temperature treatment, including autoclaving at 121C for 20 min, boiling at 100C for 20 min, and heating at 80C for 20 min. Compared to the amount of RNA in the original sample, TRIzol treatment destroyed 47.54% of the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene and 39.85% of open reading frame (ORF) 1ab. For samples treated at 56C for 30 min, the copy number of the N gene and ORF 1ab was reduced by 48.55% and 56.40%, respectively. The viral RNA copy number dropped by 50 to 66% after heating at 80C for 20 min. Nearly no viral RNA was detected after autoclaving at 121C or boiling at 100C for 20 min. These results indicate that inactivation reduced the quantity of detectable viral RNA and may cause false-negative results, especially in weakly positive cases. Thus, use of the TRIzol reagent rather than heat inactivation is recommended for sample inactivation, as the TRIzol reagent had the least effect on the RNA copy number among the tested methods.","output":"Influence of Different Inactivation Methods on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 RNA Copy Number"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, there is a strong need for highly potent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are resistant against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VoCs).

However, the outcomes for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure cared for with Anesthesia Machines is currently unknow. We hypothesized that COVID-19 patients receiving care with Anesthesia Machines would have worse outcomes compared to standard practice.MethodsWe designed a retrospective study of patients admitted with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis at a large tertiary urban hospital in northern Italy. Two care units were included: a 27-bed standard ICU and a 15-bed temporary unit emergently opened in an operating room setting. Intubated patients assigned to Anesthesia Machines (AM group) were compared to a control cohort treated with standard mechanical ventilators (ICU-VENT group). Outcomes were assessed at 60-day follow-up. A multivariable Cox regression analysis of risk factors between survivors and non-survivors was conducted to determine the adjusted risk of death for patients assigned to AM group.ResultsComplete daily data from 89 mechanically ventilated patients consecutively admitted to the two units were analyzed. Seventeen patients were included in the AM group, whereas 72 were in the ICU-VENT group. Disease severity and intensity of treatment were comparable between the two groups. The 60-day mortality was significantly higher in the AM group compared to the ICU-vent group (12/17 vs. 27/72, 70.6% vs. 37.5%, respectively, p = 0.016).

Even after lockdown, the pandemic fear created additional barriers to access the health services. The aim of our study is to evaluate the economic impact of the lockdown for COVID-19 on public health in Italy, focusing on its effects on diabetic population. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the impact of the lockdown on excess mortality and morbidity in the Italian diabetic population during 2020. The analysis was divided into several steps: a quantification of specialist visit reduction, the calculation of excess mortality in the diabetic population, the economic evaluation of the slowdown in the use of innovative diabetic therapies. Furthermore, the impact of the lockdown on the reduction of procedures and follow-up visits in diabetic population was evaluated. The overall impact of the pandemic and lockdown effects on costs and quality of life was then calculated. Results: During 2020, a drop of 28% in patient access has been observed. Diabetic patients recorded a twice higher mortality value compared to general population (20.4% vs 10.2%). The analysis of market data revealed a slowdown in consumption of new antidiabetic therapies (-14%, 27% vs 41%). We estimated an expense of 26.6 million for NHS and a loss of 257 utilities in diabetic population due to the missed benefits related to slowdown in innovative antidiabetic drugs use and non-optimal follow-up and control of diabetes complications. In simulation scenarios, we also estimated an overall expenditure ranging from 38.7 to 94.0 million and a loss of 294-836 utilities.

Included patients were divided into the glucocorticoids-used group (GC group) and the non-glucocorticoids-used group (NGC group) according to whether glucocorticoids were used. A total of 818 eligible patients were included in the final analysis. Seventy-six patients were treated with glucocorticoids, and 742 patients were treated without glucocorticoids. Before propensity score matching, the triglyceride levels (38.2  18.5 vs. 20.2  16.8, P < 0.05) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores (7.1  2.5 vs. 4.5  2.1, P < 0.05) at admission were significantly higher in the GC group than in the NGC group. The incidence of multi-organ failure (33.3% vs. 11.9%, P < 0.05) was significantly higher in the GC group than in the NGC group. Patients in the GC group showed a positive balance of fluid intake and output over 72 h. After 1:1 propensity score matching, 59 patients from each group (GC and NGC) were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in age, sex, body mass index, triglycerides, or APACHE II scores between the two groups (P > 0.05), and the patients clinical outcomes were reversed. The proportion of patients with organ failure (40.7% vs. 52.5%, p < 0.05) and multi-organ failure (35.0% vs. 67.7%, P < 0.05) was significantly lower in the GC group than in the NGC group.

We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, with 50% effective concentrations (EC50) for i) reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect of 0.002-0.012 mg/mL in Vero E6 cells, and ii) infectious virus release by plaque assay of 0.019-0.032 mg/mL in Vero E6 cells and 0.030-0.037 mg/mL in Calu-3 cells. The selectivity index (SI) in these assays was as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also virucidal, irreversibly reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by >99.9% (>3 log10) within 1 min of exposure, and up to >99.999% (>5 log10) shown at astodrimer sodium concentrations of 10-30 mg/mL in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cell lines. Astodrimer sodium also inhibited infection in a primary human airway epithelial cell line. The data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral and virucidal activity of astodrimer sodium being due to irreversible inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial attachment of the virus to the host cell.

This review outlines the current evidence of the epidemiology of infection in children, the clinical manifestations of disease, the role of children in transmission of the virus and the recently described hyperinflammatory syndrome observed later during the first phase of the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS International seroprevalence studies have found younger children to have lower prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, indicating they have not been infected as much as adults. This may be due to shielding by school closures, or by a reduced susceptibility to infection, as indicated by a significantly lower attack rate in children than adults in household contact tracing studies. The most well recognized symptoms in adults of cough, fever, anosmia and ageusia are less frequent in children, who may often present with mild and nonspecific symptoms, or with gastrointestinal symptoms alone. Risk factors for severe disease in children include chronic lung, cardiac or neurological disease, and malignancy. However, the absolute risk still appears very low for these cohorts. A new hyperinflammatory syndrome has emerged with an apparent immune cause.

PATIENTS AND METHODS IRARC was performed on 166 patients between June 2011 and March 2016. Prospective data were collected for patient demographics, clinical and pathologic characteristics, perioperative variables, transfusion requirements, and hospital length of stay. Thirty- and 90-day complications were classified according to the modified Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Clavien-Dindo system. RESULTS Preoperative anemia was common (43.4%) and greatest in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (48.6%) (p < 0.001). Patients with preoperative anemia were significantly more likely to have an Ileal conduit (p = 0.033), higher cystectomy stage (pT3) (p = 0.028), and a lower lymph node yield (p = 0.031). Preoperative anemia was not associated with increased perioperative morbidity but was associated with the requirement for blood transfusion (p = 0.001). Blood transfusion required in 20.4% of patients with intraoperative and postoperative blood transfusion rate was 10.2% and 13.9%, respectively. The 30-day all complication rate and 30-day major complication rate were 55.4% and 15.7%, respectively, while 90-day all complication rate and 90-day major complication rate were 65.7% and 19.3%, respectively. Intraoperative blood transfusion was not associated with increased complications, but postoperative blood transfusion requirement was independently associated with perioperative morbidity: all 30-day complications (p = 0.003), all 90-day complications (p = 0.009), and 90-day major complications (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION The presence of preoperative anemia in patients undergoing iRARC is not associated with increased surgical risk, although preoperative anemic patients were significantly more likely to require blood transfusion. Blood transfusion requirement and specifically postoperative blood transfusion are independently associated with perioperative morbidity and are an important factor for the optimization of postoperative outcomes.","output":"Blood Transfusion Requirement and Not Preoperative Anemia Are Associated with Perioperative Complications Following Intracorporeal Robot-Assisted Radical Cystectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 5UTR part of coronavirus genomes plays key roles in the viral replication cycle and translation of viral mRNAs. The first 75C80 nt, also called the leader sequence, are identical for genomic mRNA and subgenomic mRNAs. Recently, it was shown that cooperative actions of a 5UTR segment and the nonstructural protein NSP1 are essential for both the inhibition of host mRNAs and for specific translation of viral mRNAs. Here, sequence analyses of both the 5UTR RNA segment and the NSP1 protein have been done for several coronaviruses, with special attention to the betacoronaviruses. The conclusions are: (i) precise specific molecular signatures can be found in both the RNA and the NSP1 protein; (ii) both types of signatures correlate between each other. Indeed, definite sequence motifs in the RNA correlate with sequence motifs in the protein, indicating a coevolution between the 5UTR and NSP1 in betacoronaviruses. Experimental mutational data on 5UTR and NSP1 from SARS-CoV-2 using cell-free translation extracts support these conclusions and show that some conserved key residues in the amino-terminal half of the NSP1 protein are essential for evasion to the inhibitory effect of NSP1 on translation.","output":"Correlated sequence signatures are present within the genomic 5UTR RNA and NSP1 protein in coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The hot chili pepper industry represents one of the most important staple foods in Mexico and many Asian countries Nowadays, large amounts of waste materials are produced from the pepper supply chain that could be used as a source to obtain nutraceuticals Among the most common and important bioactive compounds contained in pepper residues are the capsaicinoids, which are the responsible of the pungency of the pepper Capsaicinoids, mainly capsaicin, may ameliorate obesity, gastric disorder, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, rhinitis, asthma, immune system diseases, and important viral diseases as the recent COVID-19 The aim of this review is to review the industrial process for the extraction of capsaicinoids ingredients from pepper residues and to examine the relation of the capsaicin and other chili pepper phytochemicals to prevent and treat chronic diseases explained through the key role of the TRPV1 receptor The extraction and incorporation of these compounds into nutraceutical formulations depend mainly on the development of new methods to improve not only the yield of a particular compound but the validation of the bioactivity and phytochemical characterization ?

An audit of patients with a tracheostomy within the Neurosurgery Unit was completed in order to evaluate patient outcomes with baseline staffing levels (time period one) compared to a period with enhanced physiotherapy capacity (time period two). Methods: An audit of all patients undergoing active tracheostomy weaning admitted during two 15-week time periods was undertaken (9 patients in each time period). Exclusion criteria: ? Patients who passed away ? Patients discharged with a tracheostomy in situ Outcome measures: ? Number of physiotherapy rehabilitation sessions per week ? Number of days the tracheostomy was in situ ? Total length of stay (LOS) ? Functional status on discharge from the Neurosurgery Unit Results: A 50% increase in physiotherapy staffing (from 14 to 21 whole time equivalent) resulted in a 153% increase in the number of weekly rehabilitation sessions per patient. An increase in rehabilitation frequency in time period two resulted in a mean reduction of 11 tracheostomy days (from insertion to decannulation) and a mean reduction in the total LOS on the Neurosurgery Unit by 22 days. In time period two, 77% of patients were able to mobilise on discharge from the Neurosurgery Unit with 33% requiring hoist for transfers. This can be compared with 33% of patients mobilising on discharge in time period one, with 77% requiring hoist for transfers. Analysis of costings conducted demonstrated significant cost-savings when considering physiotherapy staffing, tracheostomy bed days and reduction in LOS, resulting in an overall cost-saving of 501,404.41. Conclusion(s): With increased physiotherapy staffing and frequency of rehabilitation, the length of time patients had a tracheostomy in situ and LOS both reduced. This resulted in significant cost-savings for the Trust. With increased rehabilitation, a positive impact on patients functional status on discharge was also found. Impact: The impact of this audit includes the effect on individual patients, the Neurosurgery Unit and the Physiotherapy service within the Trust. A shorter time with tracheostomy in situ will not only allow patients to access specialist rehabilitation services sooner but also help to reduce complications that can appear with a prolonged tube placement (Quinones-Ossa et al., 2020). In addition, earlier tracheostomy decannulation equates to significant improvements in quality of life, including regaining the ability to talk and independence. The results of this audit demonstrate improved patient outcomes with increased physiotherapy staffing and subsequent increased rehabilitation frequency, alongside significant cost-savings. Results will contribute to the evidence base for the development of a hyper-acute rehabilitation unit within the LTHT Neurosurgery Unit. Future work will analyse the long-term impact including patient outcomes following discharge from the hyper-acute setting.

METHODS We used data from the Statewide Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (July 2017 through December 2018) to identify deaths that occurred in hospitals and communities (ie, homes or public spaces). We used census tract-level data for 34 Illinois counties to create bivariate mapping by overdose death rates. We used logistic regression to analyze the association of demographic and overdose characteristics with the likelihood of death in a hospital versus a community. RESULTS During the study period, 2833 opioid-related overdose deaths occurred in 24 Illinois counties, 655 (23.1%) of which occurred in the hospital; of 2178 community deaths, 1888 (86.7%) occurred in the same census tract as the decedent's recorded residence and 1285 (59.0%) occurred in the decedent's home. Non-Hispanic Black people were 1.63 (95% CI, 1.27-2.10) times more likely than non-Hispanic White people to die in a hospital. Decedents from suburban Cook County and other Chicago suburban counties were significantly more likely to die in the hospital than decedents from Chicago or other Illinois counties. Documentation of a previous overdose, history of opioid use, and having bystanders present were significantly associated with hospital deaths. Evidence of a rapid overdose, fentanyl present, or prescription opioids were significantly associated with deaths in a community. CONCLUSIONS The high number of opioid-related overdose deaths in the community illustrates the need to decriminalize illicit drug use and facilitate treatment seeking. Establishing supervised safe consumption sites may have the biggest effect in reducing the number of opioid-related overdose deaths.","output":"Community Versus Hospital Opioid-Related Overdose Deaths in Illinois."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 spread through India, Civil Society Organizations (CSO)s mobilized resources to support the efforts of the Government by playing the role of an active partner in providing social and economic welfare to the affected population This paper aims to provide a concise overview of the response of civil society to the pandemic situation at the grassroots and policy level Further, the authors discuss the paradox in demonstrated efficiency and commitment of civil society, which follows a crackdown on civil society organizations by the state through silencing voices of dissent and regulating the shrinking civic space The strained relationship between the government and civil society organizations in India is also examined against the backdrop of draconian legislation and policies framed during the time of COVID-19, proscribing debate, review or consultations In the context of the pandemic and the subsequent phase of recovery, such actions of the Government will have deleterious effects on the relationship of trust between civil society and the state Through this paper, the authors argue for a more tolerant and co-operative approach to the functions of civil society organizations by the Government, thus effectively reducing mistrust and suspicion in the intentions of the state ? 2020 Rajesh Tandon and Ram Aravind, published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2020","output":"Source of Life or Kiss of Death: Revisiting State-Civil Society Dynamics in India during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical oxygen is an essential medicine as is aptly stated by the World Health Organization.

We estimated how COVID-19-related disruptions could impact HIV transmission and mortality among men who have sex with men (MSM) in four cities in China. METHODS: Regional data from China indicated that the number of MSM undergoing facility-based HIV testing reduced by 59% during the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside reductions in ART initiation (34%), numbers of sexual partners (62%) and consistency of condom use (25%). A deterministic mathematical model of HIV transmission and treatment among MSM in China was used to estimate the impact of these disruptions on the number of new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths. Disruption scenarios were assessed for their individual and combined impact over 1 and 5 years for a 3-, 4- or 6-month disruption period. RESULTS: Our China model predicted that new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths would be increased most by disruptions to viral suppression, with 25% reductions for a 3-month period increasing HIV infections by 5C14% over 1 year and deaths by 7C12%. Observed reductions in condom use increased HIV infections by 5C14% but had minimal impact (<1%) on deaths. Smaller impacts on infections and deaths (<3%) were seen for disruptions to facility testing and ART initiation, but reduced partner numbers resulted in 11C23% fewer infections and 0.4C1.0% fewer deaths. Longer disruption periods of 4 and 6 months amplified the impact of combined disruption scenarios. When all realistic disruptions were modelled simultaneously, an overall decrease in new HIV infections was always predicted over one year (3C17%), but not over 5 years (1% increase-4% decrease), while deaths mostly increased over one year (1C2%) and 5 years (1.2 increase - 0.3 decrease). CONCLUSIONS: The overall impact of COVID-19 on new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths is dependent on the nature, scale and length of the various disruptions. Resources should be directed to ensuring levels of viral suppression and condom use are maintained to mitigate any adverse effects of COVID-19 related disruption on HIV transmission and control among MSM in China.","output":"Estimating the impact of disruptions due to COVID-19 on HIV transmission and control among men who have sex with men in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Nasal congestion is an important symptom in many diseases of the upper airways. Nasal congestion may also affect personal well-being and quality of life. Furthermore, as the nasal mucosa is the first part of the airways in contact with the environment, objective evaluation of nasal congestion or nasal patency is important. Systematic evaluation of nasal patency was described in the last part of the 19th century by Zwaardemaker. Measurement of the pressure drop over the nasal cavity at a passive dow has been described in 1903 by Courtade and is one of first descriptions rhinomanometry. The technique is still in use and computer technology has made the measurements much easier but the method has not yet been accepted for wide clinical use. METHODOLOGY Acoustic methods have also been used for evaluation of nasal patency. A qualitative method was the hum-test by Spiess (1902), where external occlusion of the nonocciuded side of the nasal cavity is experienced as a change in the timbre of the sound during humming. Acoustic reflections have been used in geophysical investigations especially with regard to search for oil. The use of acoustic reflections from the airways gained special interest in 1960-70 for determining the geometry of the vocal tract shape with regard to speech reconstruction. A method described by A. Jackson (1977) was adopted and for the first time applied to the nasal cavity. The method for determining the cross-sectional area as function of distance in the airways by acoustic reflections is impulse or relatively simple. The incident sound pseudorandom noise in the audible frequency range is compared with the response - the reflections from the airways. Intuitively, if the size of the entrance to the airways is known, the size of the reflections may represent changes of the airway size and the time between reflections may give the distance between the changes, dependent on the speed of sound. In this way it is possible to determine the area as function of distance in the airways. The technique has some assumptions and the major effort has been to validate use in the nose and elucidate aspects with regard to sound loss in the airways and resolution. Therefore, the acoustic reflection technique - named acoustic rhinometry - was compared with other methods like MRI, CT, and rhinomanometry. Allergic and nonallergic subjects were also compared. RESULTS Acoustic rhinometry showed reasonable correlation with CT in a cadaver and in 10 subjects in comparison with MRI for the first 6 cm of the nasal cavity. Models based on MRI scannings of subjects also showed good correlation for the first 6 cm of the nasal cavity. Posteriorly in the nasal cavity and the epipharynx, differences were found mainly due to 'sound loss' to the paranasal sinuses. Sound loss due to viscous loss or friction at increasing surface/area ratio (the complex geometry in the nose) and loss due to nonrigidity the nasal mucosa were also examined. Neither these factors affected the area-distance function significantly. Acoustic rhinometry seems to reflect the area-distance function in the nose reasonably accurately. In allergic subjects acoustic rhinometry has been used to evaluate hypersensitivity. More pronounced spontaneous variation in nasal mucosa congestion was found in patients suffering from hay fever compared to nonallergic subjects. Furthermore, a tendency to a more swollen mucosa in the allergic subjects compared to the normal state, and increased sensitivity to histamine was found. This and reduction in swelling of the mucosa in allergic subjects during nasal steroid treatment out of the pollen season indicate an ongoing inflammatory process or hypersensitivity in allergic subjects out ot the pollen season. During allergen challenge the change in nasal cavity dimension as well as inflammation may affect olfaction in hay fever patients. DISCUSSION Acoustic rhinometry has not only been used to examine hay fever patients but in many different aspects of rhinology. Since the introduction of the acoustic reflection technique in the nose more than papers using the technique have been published. Most of the papers find the technique valuable for evaluation of nasal patency. Fortunately, some critical papers have drawn attention to some practical aspects of the technique. Standard operating procedures, and calibration checks as well as training operators will enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of results. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES A decade after its introduction acoustic rhinometry is a well-established method for evaluation of nasal patency, but further improvement can be obtained by continued validation and adjustments of the technique.","output":"Objective measurement of nasal airway dimensions using acoustic rhinometry: methodological and clinical aspects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential for spread of COVID-19 infections in skilled nursing facilities and other long-term care sites poses new challenges for nursing home administrators to protect patients and staff.

METHODS Fifteen patients who had undergone either a reduced port access laparoscopic gastrostomy/jejunostomy (LGJ, n=7) or open gastrostomy/jejunostomy (OGJ, n=8) between July 2011 and December 2015 were retrospectively studied. Variables examined comprised age, sex, body mass index (BMI), operative time, blood loss volume, and American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status (ASA-PS) scores. The degree of postoperative pain was also assessed in both groups during the first seven postoperative days. RESULTS The patients in the two groups were comparable in age, sex, BMI, ASA-PS scores, intraoperative blood loss or postoperative complication rates. Operative time was shorter in the LGJ group than the OGJ group. No patients in the LGJ group required conversion to open laparotomy. Tube feedings were started on postoperative Day 1 in both groups; there were no postoperative complications. The duration of rescue nonopioid analgesic use was significantly shorter in the LGJ than the OGJ group (1.3 versus 3.5 days; P=0.0005).

In this essay, we consider how leadership has been represented during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in articles published in the business and general press. We show that, while images of heroic leadership are prevalent in this popular discourse - reminding us vividly of the romance of leadership - other elements, such as references to plural and decentred forms of leadership can be seen as also coexisting in this discourse, while not necessarily being explicitly acknowledged. Opting for a plural, relational and processual conception of leadership allows us to reveal these under-recognized elements. This leads us to propose that these elements are not specific to leadership in times of crises, but are always constitutive of leading in practice. We conclude by arguing that renewing understandings of leadership may require that we acknowledge simultaneously the inevitable presence of romance(s) in how we approach this phenomenon as well as its collective and relational accomplishment. Referring, in turn, to the central phenomenon as leading rather than as leadership may help us reach beyond the seductiveness of the romance(s) of leadership to capture its inherent relationality. MAD statement Our exploration of business press articles published early on during the COVID-19 crisis reveals that the traditional heroic model of leadership is still dominant. Yet, we also see signs of plural and decentred conceptions of leadership emerging between the lines. We suggest that changing the way we think and talk about leadership to refer more to the activity of leading may help counterbalance the romance(s) of the heroic leader. Without dismissing the need for figureheads who can help us make sense of difficult situations, we also need to acknowledge that what is done, in leadership, is always collectively done.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 1.5-year-old female guinea pig was found acutely deceased with no premonitory illness. On gross post-mortem examination, multifocal to coalescing, raised, firm, pale tan nodules with discrete, irregular margins were noted over the surfaces of all lung lobes. Histopathology revealed nodules composed of clustered foamy macrophages and multinucleated giant cells containing numerous bacterial rods. Similar bacteria-laden macrophages were noted within sections of the liver, heart, palpebral conjunctiva, duodenum, and cecum. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on tissues collected during post-mortem examination. The 16S rRNA gene product was sequenced and was identical to the Mycobacterium genavense type strain. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the author's knowledge, this report details the first documented case of Mycobacterium genvaense infection in a guinea pig and a follow up investigation of close-contact animals.

Only studies with 100 study eyes were included. An expert panel reviewed the results and key factors potentially influencing the use of T&E regimens in nAMD and PCV, and subsequently formed consensus recommendations for their application in the Asia-Pacific region. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were included. Studies demonstrated that T&E regimens with aflibercept, ranibizumab, or bevacizumab in nAMD, and with aflibercept in PCV, were efficacious and safe. The recommendation for T&E is, after 3 consecutive monthly loading doses, treatment intervals can be extended by 2 to 4 weeks up to 12 to 16 weeks. When disease activity recurs, the recommendation is to reinject and shorten intervals by 2 to 4 weeks until fluid resolution, after which treatment intervals can again be extended. Intraretinal fluid should be treated until resolved; however, persistent minimal subretinal fluid after consecutive treatments may be tolerated with treatment intervals maintained or extended if the clinical condition is stable.

As an unintentional consequence of greater prescription opioid utilization, there has been the parallel increase in misuse, abuse, and overdose, which are serious risks associated with all opioid analgesics. In response to these concerns, the Food and Drug Administration announced the requirement for a class-wide Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for long-acting and extended-release (ER) opioid analgesics in April 2011. An understanding of the details of this REMS will be of particular importance to primary care providers. The class-wide REMS is focused on educating health care providers and patients on appropriate prescribing and safe use of ER opioids. Support from primary care will be necessary for the success of this REMS, as these clinicians are the predominant providers of care and the main prescribers of opioid analgesics for patients with chronic pain.

The current gold standard to detect SARS CoV2 is RT-PCR. However, it has a high false negative rate and long turnaround time. PURPOSE: In view of the high sensitivity of CT in detection of lower respiratory tract pathologies, a study of 2581 patients comparing RT-PCR status with CT findings was undertaken to see if it augments the diagnostic performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multi centre prospective study of consecutive cases was conducted. All CT studies suggestive of COVID 19 pneumonia were collated and evaluated independently by three Radiologists to confirm the imaging diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The RT-PCR values were retrospectively obtained, based on the RT-PCR values, CT studies were categorised into three subgroups, positive, negative and unknown. CT features from all three groups were compared to evaluate any communality or discordance. RESULTS: Out of the 2581 patients with positive CT findings for COVID pneumonia, 825 were females and 1,756 were males in a wide age group of 28-90 years. Predominant CT features observed in all the subgroups were Ground glass densities 94.8%, in mixed distribution (peripheral and central) (59.12%), posterior segments in 92% and multilobar involvement in 70.9%. The CT features across the three subgroups were statistically significant with a P value <0.001. CONCLUSION: There was a communality of CT findings regardless of RT-PCR status.

METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We synthesized a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 7.4%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2% (95% CI, 1%C3%) and 9% (95% CI, 4%C14%) respectively.

Gender equivalence proved to devour an instructive advantage over students (Aragons-Gonzlez, Rosser-Limi?ana, & Gil-Gonzlez, 2020), in addition to the idea that gender competence is a key element in the educational field (Palmn et al., 2020). The hypothesized paradigm is tested through multiple regression and univariate tests based on the responses of 321 Jordanian university students who finished entrepreneurship courses to pursue nexuses between the endogenous and exogenous variables. Results indicated that both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations affect students aspirations to become entrepreneurial managers in the future in favor of their role models. Additionally, both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations are affected by female instructors. However, male instructors only inspired the intrinsic motivation of the students. As female academic instructors face challenges attributed to gender bias, especially in the Arab and Middle Eastern countries, the results of the study hope to help change the discerning negative perceptions of female instructors in Jordanian and Arab universities. Such problems in gender inspiration affect the prospect of the outcomes required and may have an indirect effect on the educational field in general.

METHODS: Nationally representative longitudinal data on U.S. older adults from the 2006-2020 Health and Retirement Study were analyzed using logistic and mixed-effects logistic regression models. RESULTS: Based on logistic regression, number of household members (OR=1.26, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.52), depressive symptoms score (OR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.42) and number of cardiometabolic risk factors or chronic conditions (1-2 versus 0) (OR=0.27, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.67) were significant predictors of self-reported Covid-19 history. Based on mixed-effects logistic regression, several statistically significant predictors of Covid-19 history were identified, including female sex (OR=3.06, 95% CI: 1.57, 5.96), other race (OR=5.85, 95% CI: 2.37, 14.43), Hispanic ethnicity (OR=2.66, 95% CI: 1.15, 6.17), number of household members (OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.42), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (1-4 times per month vs. never) (OR=0.38, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.78) and number of cardiometabolic risk factors or chronic conditions (1-2 versus 0) (OR=0.34, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.60).

It is remarkable that all members of the BJ Group share a common haplotype, consisting of seven loci that differentiate the group from other isolates published to date. Among 42 substitutions uniquely identified from the BJ group, 32 are non-synonymous changes at the amino acid level. Rooted phylogenetic trees, proposed on the basis of haplotypes and other sequence variations of SARS-CoV isolates from Canada, USA, Singapore, and China, gave rise to different paradigms but positioned the BJ Group, together with the newly discovered GD01 (GD-Ins29) in the same clade, followed by the H-U Group (from Hong Kong to USA) and the H-T Group (from Hong Kong to Toronto), leaving the SP Group (Singapore) more distant.

We explored the association of SARS-CoV-2 genomic load as a risk factor for adverse patient outcomes. METHODS: We included adult patients admitted to the hospital with clinical and radiographic findings of pneumonia and a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of SARS-CoV-2 within 24 hours of admission. We segregated patients into 3 genomic load status groups: low (Cycle threshold (Ct) 35) intermediate (25< Ct< 35) and high (Ct 25) using real-time PCR. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of death, intubation and/or use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Secondary outcomes included severity of pneumonia on admission, as measured by the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). Sensitivity analyses were performed to include Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in the composite outcome and varying Ct classification breakpoints. RESULTS: Of 457 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 assay from March 31(st) to April 10(th) 2020, 316 met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Included patients were followed for a median of 25 days (IQR 21C28). High genomic load at presentation was associated with higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (p=0.005), transplant recipient status (p< 0.001) and duration of illness less than 7 days (p=0.005). Importantly, patients with high genomic load were more likely to reach the primary endpoint (p=0.001), and had higher PSI scores on admission (p=0.03). In multivariate analysis, high genomic load remained an independent predictor of primary outcome. Results remained significant in sensitivity analyses.

Guanfacine is also widely used off-label in additional mental disorders that involve impaired functioning of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), including stress-related disorders such as substance abuse, schizotypic cognitive deficits, and traumatic brain injury. The PFC subserves high order cognitive and executive functions including working memory, abstract reasoning, insight and judgment, and top-down control of attention, action and emotion. These abilities arise from PFC microcircuits with extensive recurrent excitation through NMDAR synapses. There is powerful modulation of these synapses, where cAMP-PKA opening of nearby potassium (K(+)) channels can rapidly and dynamically alter synaptic strength to coordinate arousal state with cognitive state, e.g. to take PFC offline during uncontrollable stress. A variety of evidence shows that guanfacine acts within the PFC via post-synaptic 2A-AR on dendritic spines to inhibit cAMP-PKA-K(+) channel signaling, thus strengthening network connectivity, enhancing PFC neuronal firing, and improving PFC cognitive functions. Although guanfacines beneficial effects are present in rodent, they are especially evident in primates, where the PFC greatly expands and differentiates. In addition to therapeutic actions in PFC, stress-related disorders may also benefit from additional 2-AR actions, such as weakening plasticity in the amygdala, reducing NE release, and anti-inflammatory actions by deactivating microglia. Altogether, these NE 2-AR actions optimize top-down control by PFC networks, which may explain guanfacines benefits in a variety of mental disorders.","output":"Guanfacines Mechanism of Action in Treating Prefrontal Cortical Disorders: Successful Translation Across Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are among the important causes of mortality and morbidity in childhood. Early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying primary disease may prevent most of CKD patients from progressing to ESRD. There is no study examining chronic kidney diseases and dialysis modalities in Syrian immigrant children. We aimed to retrospectively research the etiologic, sociodemographic, and clinical factors in CKD among Syrian refugee children, and at the same time, to compare the clinical characteristics of patients with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. METHODS: Our study included a total of 79 pediatric Syrian patients aged from 2-16 years monitored at Hatay State Hospital pediatric nephrology clinic with diagnosis of various stages of CKD and with ESRD. Physical-demographic features and clinical-laboratory information were retrospectively screened. RESULTS: The most common cause of CKD was congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tracts (CAKUT) (37.9%). Other causes were urolitiasis (15.1%), nephrotic syndrome (10.1%), spina bifida (8.8%), hemolytic uremic syndrome (7.5%), and glomerulonephritis (7.5%). Twenty-five patients used hemodialysis due to bad living conditions. Only 2 of the patients with peritoneal dialysis were using automatic peritoneal dialysis (APD), with 5 using continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Long-term complications like left ventricle hypertrophy and retinopathy were significantly higher among hemodialysis patients. There was no difference identified between the groups in terms of hypertension and sex. CONCLUSION: Progression to ESRD due to preventable reasons is very frequent among CKD patients.

Thus, to further enhance the exploitation phase of SMA, this paper introduces a novel chaotic algorithm in which sinusoidal chaotic function has been combined with the basic SMA. The resultant chaotic slime mold algorithm (CSMA) is applied to 23 extensively used standard test functions and 10 multidisciplinary design problems. To check the validity of the proposed algorithm, results of CSMA has been compared with other recently developed and well-known classical optimizers such as PSO, DE, SSA, MVO, GWO, DE, MFO, SCA, CS, TSA, PSO-DE, GA, HS, Ray and Sain, MBA, ACO, and MMA. Statistical results suggest that chaotic strategy facilitates SMA to provide better performance in terms of solution accuracy.

The importance of tetrastarch dose, however, is unknown. METHODS A retrospective observational study was performed in two trauma centres using data on type and amount of fluids (balanced crystalloids or tetrastarch) used for pre- and acute in-hospital shock management. We evaluate independent associations between the relative and absolute volumes of tetrastarch and 90-day survival time or the frequency of severe acute kidney failure (AKF). RESULTS We studied 271 patients who had sustained a severe blunt trauma injury (average predicted mortality according to the Revised Injury Severity Classification Score (RISC) 15.1  1.4% [mean, standard deviation]), and who had required more than 2 days of intensive care therapy. In all, 75.3% of patients had received tetrastarch with a crystalloid/colloid ratio of 2.93  2.60. The 90-day mortality was 11.1%, and 7.8% of the patients developed severe AKF. After adjusting for confounders, we found a U-shaped, nonlinear association between absolute or relative volumes of tetrastarch and survival time (p = 0.003 and 0.025, respectively). Optimal relative volumes of tetrastarch approximately ranged from 20 to 30% of total fluids. Giving less than about 1000 ml, or more than about 2000 ml tetrastarch was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing severe AKF (p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS There was a complex U?shaped association between the tetrastarch dose and morbidity/mortality of patients after a severe trauma injury. The optimal crystalloid/tetrastarch ratio for acute shock management appears to range from about 2.5 to 4.0.","output":"Fluid resuscitation after severe trauma injury : U-shaped associations between tetrastarch dose and survival time or frequency of acute kidney failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), rapidly spread across the world in late 2019, leading to a pandemic. While SARS-CoV-2 infections predominately affect the respiratory system, severe infections can lead to renal and cardiac injury and even death. Due to its highly transmissible nature and severe health implications, animal models of SARS-CoV-2 are critical to developing novel therapeutics and preventatives. Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) are an ideal animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infections because they recapitulate many aspects of human infections. After inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, hamsters become moribund, lose weight, and show varying degrees of respiratory disease, lethargy, and ruffled fur. Histopathologically, their pulmonary lesions are consistent with human infections including interstitial to broncho-interstitial pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage and edema, and granulocyte infiltration. Similar to humans, the duration of clinical signs and pulmonary pathology are short lived with rapid recovery by 14 d after infection. Immunocompromised hamsters develop more severe infections and mortality. Preclinical studies in hamsters have shown efficacy of therapeutics, including convalescent serum treatment, and preventatives, including vaccination, in limiting or preventing clinical disease. Although hamster studies have contributed greatly to our understanding of the pathogenesis and progression of disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection, additional studies are required to better characterize the effects of age, sex, and virus variants on clinical outcomes in hamsters.

RESULTS: More than 60% of all respondents felt their government had communicated adequately during the pandemic. National variances ranged from 83.4% in China down to 37.2% in Brazil, but overall, males and those with a higher income were more likely to rate government communications highly. Almost half (48.8%) of the respondents felt their government had ensured adequate access to physical health services (ranging from 89.3% for Singapore to 27.2% for Poland), with higher ratings reported by younger and higher-income respondents. Ratings of mental health support were lower overall (32.9%, ranging from 74.8% in China to around 15% in Brazil and Sweden), but highest among younger respondents. Providing support for basic necessities of food and housing was rated highest overall in China (79%) and lowest in Ecuador (14.6%), with higher ratings reported by younger, higher-income and better-educated respondents across all countries. The same three demographic groups tended to rate their country's support to vulnerable groups more highly than other respondents, with national scores ranging from around 75% (Singapore and China) to 19.5% (Sweden).

DESIGN: We estimated the prevalence of palliative care need by analysing the proportion of deaths from defined chronic progressive illnesses. We described linear projections up to 2040 using national death registry data and official mortality forecasts. An expert consultation and subsequent online consensus survey generated recommendations on meeting future palliative care need. SETTING: Scotland, population of 5.4 million. PARTICIPANTS: All decedents in Scotland over 11 years (2007 to 2017). The consultation had 34 participants; 24 completed the consensus survey. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Estimates of past and future palliative care need in Scotland from 2007 up to 2040. Multimorbidity was operationalised as two or more registered causes of death from different disease groups (cancer, organ failure, dementia, other). Consultation and survey data were analysed descriptively. RESULTS: We project that by 2040, the number of people requiring palliative care will increase by at least 14%; and by 20% if we factor in multimorbidity. The number of people dying from multiple diseases associated with different disease groups is projected to increase from 27% of all deaths in 2017 to 43% by 2040. To address increased need and complexity, experts prioritised sustained investment in a national digital platform, roll-out of integrated electronic health and social care records; and approaches that remain person-centred. CONCLUSIONS: By 2040 more people in Scotland are projected to die with palliative care needs, and the complexity of need will increase markedly.

Pour assurer la comparabilit des deux groupes nous avons utilis le score de propension. Notre critre de jugement principal tait le dlai de sevrage en oxygne. Les critres de jugement secondaire taient : le transfert en soins intensifs, le besoin de ventilation mcanique, le dcs toutes causes confondues, le dcs au dixie jour, la dure d'hospitalisation ainsi que les scores composites intubation ou dcs et transfert en soins intensifs ou dcs. Cinquante patients ont t inclus dans le groupe Tocilizumab et 52 patients dans le groupe soins courants. L'age moyen tait de 68,9  2 ans et 71 % des patients taient des hommes. Les patients du groupe Tocilizumab taient plus frquemment diabtique (34 % vs 13 % ;p = 0,02), et avaient un niveau d'oxygne moyen plus lev (9,1 L/min vs 6,8 L/min ;p = 0,0002). Les patients du groupe Tocilizumab avaient re?u plus de cortico?des que les patients du groupe soins courants (53 % vs 6 % ;p &lt; 0,0001).

Il n'y avait pas non plus de diffrence concernant les critres de jugement secondaires. Dans cet essai, nous rapportons une absence de bnfice du Tocilizumab dans les formes modres  svres de la COVID-19. L'injection de Tocilizumab  la posologie de 8 mg/kg n'amliorait pas le dlai de sevrage en oxygne, et ne rduisait pas la ncessit d'intubation, de transfert en soins intensifs ou la mortalit. Cette absence de diffrence peut tre explique, en partie, par le fait que les patients du groupe Tocilizumab taient plus graves (oxygno-requerance plus leve) et comorbides (plus frquemment diabtiques). En revanche, ces patients avaient re?u plus de corticoides qui est aujourd'hui un traitement recommand dans la prise en charge des patients sous oxygne, atteints de la COVID-19.

In the upheaval period, compared with medical college students, nonmedical students' psychological state deserves additional concern due to their lack of medical knowledge. Although the epidemic in China has been largely controlled for several months, the mental health problems resulting from the COVID-19 epidemic persist to this day. In this study, we assessed the mental health problems and associated risk factors experienced by nonmedical vs. medical college students in universities of Shandong Province during the COVID-19 epidemic recovery period. Methods: An online survey was conducted over the period from 17 to 19 December 2020. A total of 954 Chinese college students (486 nonmedical and 468 medical students) from three universities of Shandong Province participated in the survey. Mental health variables were assessed with use of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Results: Compared with medical students, nonmedical college students had higher prevalence rates of depression (53.9 vs. 46.4%; p = 0.020) and insomnia (28.0 vs. 22.4%, p = 0.049), as well as higher total scores on the PHQ-9 (p = 0.03) and ISI (p < 0.01). Among nonmedical college students, being female and native of non-Shandong were risk factors for anxiety and depression (p < 0.01), while only native of non-Shandong for insomnia (p < 0.01). Among medical students, age (p < 0.01) and living in rural areas (p = 0.04) were risk factors for depression, while only age (p < 0.05) was a risk factor for anxiety and insomnia. Conclusion: Nonmedical college students in the universities of Shandong Province had more mental health problems and more risk factors for developing them during the COVID-19 epidemic recovery period than medical students. These nonmedical students require additional attention and recovery programs to alleviate the increased incidence of psychological problems related to COVID-19.","output":"A Cross-Sectional Study on Mental Health Problems of Medical and Nonmedical Students in Shandong During the COVID-19 Epidemic Recovery Period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical, laboratory, and computed tomography (CT) findings of 5 cases of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia from patients outside of Wuhan were reviewed.

Methods: We performed a population-pharmacokinetic analysis from 104 consecutive COVID-19 hospitalized patients (31 in intensive care units, 73 in medical wards, n = 149 samples). Plasma HCQ concentration were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection. Modelling used Monolix-2019R2. Results.- HCQ doses ranged from 200 to 800 mg/day administered for 1 to 11 days and median HCQ plasma concentration was 151 ng/mL. Among the tested covariates, only bodyweight influenced elimination oral clearance (CL) and apparent volume of distribution (Vd). CL/F (F for unknown bioavailability) and Vd/F (relative standard-error, %) estimates were 45.9L/h (21.2) and 6690L (16.1). The derived elimination half-life (t1/2) was 102 h. These parameters in COVID-19 differed from those reported in patients with lupus, where CL/F, Vd/F and t1/2 are reported to be 68 L/h, 2440 L and 19.5 h, respectively. Within 72h of HCQ initiation, only 16/104 (15.4%) COVID-19 patients had HCQ plasma levels above the in-vitro half maximal effective concentration of HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 (240 ng/mL). HCQ did not influence inflammation status (assessed by C-reactive protein) or SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance (assessed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs). Conclusion: The inter-individual variability of HCQ pharmacokinetic parameters in severe COVID-19 patients was important and differed from that previously reported in non-COVID-19 patients.

In December 2019, a new betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was reported, and it is responsible for one of the biggest pandemics of the last 2 centuries. Available evidence suggests that similar to the case with the HCoV-OC43 strain, SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion is associated with potential neurological disorders. Coronavirus infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is largely controlled by a viral factor, the spike glycoprotein (S), and a host factor, innate immunity. However, the interaction between these two factors remains elusive. Proteolytic cleavage of the S protein can occur at the interface between receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains (S1/S2), as well as in a position adjacent to a fusion peptide within S2 (S2). In this study, using HCoV-OC43 as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, we determined that both S protein sites are involved in neurovirulence and are required for optimal CNS infection. Whereas efficient cleavage at S1/S2 is associated with decreased virulence, the potentially cleavable putative S2 site is essential for efficient viral infection. Furthermore, type 1 interferon (IFN-1)-related innate immunity also plays an important role in the control of viral spread toward the spinal cord, by preventing infection of ependymal cells. Our results underline the link between the differential S cleavage and IFN-1 in the prevention of viral spread, to control the severity of infection and pathology in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. Taken together, these results point toward two potential therapeutic antiviral targets: cleavage of the S protein in conjunction with efficient IFN-1-related innate immunity to prevent or at least reduce neuroinvasion, neural spread, and potential associated neurovirulence of human coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are recognized respiratory pathogens. The emergence of the novel pathogenic member of this family in December 2019 (SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19) poses a global health emergency. As with other coronaviruses reported previously, invasion of the human central nervous system (CNS), associated with diverse neurological disorders, was suggested for SARS-CoV-2. Herein, using the related HCoV-OC43 strain, we show that the viral spike protein constitutes a major neurovirulence factor and that type 1 interferon (IFN-1), in conjunction with cleavage of S protein by host proteases, represents an important host factor that participates in the control of CNS infection. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a direct link between cleavage of the S protein, innate immunity, and neurovirulence. Understanding mechanisms of viral infection and spread in neuronal cells is essential to better design therapeutic strategies, and to prevent infection by human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in the human CNS, especially in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and immunocompromised individuals.","output":"Potential Differences in Cleavage of the S Protein and Type 1 Interferon Together Control Human Coronavirus Infection, Propagation, and Neuropathology within the Central Nervous System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The rapid onset of a systemic pro-inflammatory state followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19. We performed a retrospective observational study to explore the capacity of different complete blood cell count (CBC)-derived inflammation indexes to predict in-hospital mortality in this group. METHODS: The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR (dNLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), mean platelet volume to platelet ratio (MPR), neutrophil to lymphocyte  platelet ratio (NLPR), monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), systemic inflammation index (SII), and the aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI) were calculated on hospital admission in 119 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Non-survivors had significantly higher AISI, dNLR, NLPR, NLR, SII, and SIRI values when compared to survivors. Similarly, Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed significantly lower survival in patients with higher AISI, dNLR, MLR, NLPR, NLR, SII, and SIRI. However, after adjusting for confounders, only the SII remained significantly associated with survival (HR = 1.0001; 95% CI, 1.0000-1.0001, p = 0.029) in multivariate Cox regression analysis.

METHODS: Randomly sampled cohort of 1705 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 38 Michigan hospitals between 3/13/2020-6/18/2020. Data were collected on early (prescribed within 2 days of hospitalization) empiric antibacterial therapy and community-onset bacterial co-infections (positive culture or diagnostic test within 3 days). Poisson generalized estimating equation models were used to assess predictors of empiric antibacterial use. RESULTS: Of 1705 patients with COVID-19, 56.6% were prescribed early empiric antibacterial therapy; 3.5% (59/1705) had a confirmed community-onset bacterial infection. Across hospitals, early empiric antibacterial use varied from 27%-84%. Patients were more likely to receive early empiric antibacterial therapy if they were older (adjusted rate ratio [ARR]: 1.04 [1.00-1.08] per 10 years), had a lower body mass index (ARR: 0.99 [0.99-1.00] per kg/m 2), had more severe illness (e.g., severe sepsis, ARR: 1.16 [1.07-1.27]), had a lobar infiltrate (ARR: 1.21 [1.04-1.42]), or were admitted to a for-profit hospital (ARR: 1.30 [1.15-1.47]).

The mortality rate of patients who suffer OHCA remains high despite extensive utilization of resources. OBJECTIVES: We aim to describe the current landscape of OHCA during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide an overview of the logistical challenges and resuscitation protocols amongst emergency medical service (EMS) personnel. DISCUSSION: Recent studies in Italy, New York City, and France characterized a significant increase in OHCA incidence in conjunction with the arrival of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The presence of the pandemic challenged existing protocols for field resuscitation of cardiac arrest patients as the pandemic necessitated prioritization of EMS personnel and other healthcare providers' safety through stringent personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements. Studies also characterized difficulties encountered by the first responder system during COVID-19, such as dispatcher overload, increased response times, and adherence to PPE requirements, superimposed on PPE shortages. The lack of guidance by governmental agencies and specialty organizations to provide unified safety protocols for resuscitation led to the development of different resuscitative protocols globally. CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic modified the approach of first responders to OHCA. With the rise in OCHA during the pandemic in several geographic regions and the risks of disease transmission with superimposed equipment shortages, novel noninvasive, adjunct tools, such as point of care ultrasound, warrant consideration. Further prehospital studies should be considered to optimize OHCA and resource management while minimizing risk to personnel.","output":"An international perspective of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The present study aim to comprehensively report the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients and to develop a multi-feature fusion model for predicting the critical ill probability.

A sense of belonging in childhood and adolescence contributes to a number of adult behavioural and psychological outcomes. A high sense of belonging has been associated with better health, longevity, psychological well-being, and disease recovery. METHODS In this study, the Persian version of the Sense of Belonging Instrument (SOBI) for older adults in Iran was evaluated psychometrically to develop an accurate measure for belonging. Participants in the study were 302 older adults, 60 years old and above, living independently in Iran and chosen through convenience sampling. RESULTS An exploratory factor analysis indicated that the four-factor structure, which included 16 items, accounted for 54.12% of the total variance, and was characterized by strong factor loadings, with values ranging from .50 to .87. Thereafter, a confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the four-factor latent structure of the SOBI, providing adequate data-model fit statistics. All latent structures were characterized by adequate-to-strong latent construct (H) internal reliability () coefficients. CONCLUSIONS The Persian version of the SOBI is a useful tool in understanding older adult patients' sense of belonging when living independently within the community.

The primary end point of the study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the following lockdown measures on our hub-and-spoke network; the secondary end point was to evaluate if the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak was different in hub-and-spoke centers. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter observational study conducted at the Stroke Units of Policlinico Gemelli, Ospedale San Filippo Neri, Ospedale di Belcolle, and Ospedale San Camillo de Lellis. We collected clinical reports of all consecutive patients admitted with diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) during the phase 1 of the lockdown period (11 March 2020-4 May 2020). As controls, we used all consecutive patients admitted for acute ischemic stroke or TIA in the same period of the previous year. RESULTS: A total of 156 and 142 clinical reports were collected in 2019 and 2020, respectively. During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed a reduction of number of thrombolysis, a reduction of the length of hospitalization, and an increase of pneumonia. Regarding performance indicators, we observed an increase in onset-to-door time and in door-to-groin time. We did not observe any statistically significant interaction between year (2019 vs 2020) and facility of admission (hub vs spoke) on all variables analyzed.

Supplementary percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may be useful in these patients. Aim To assess the safety of the stenting procedure in the proximal oesophagus in patients with unresectable upper oesophageal cancer, performed simultaneously with PEG insertion. Material and methods Patients with obstructing upper oesophageal tumours were scheduled for an oesophageal stenting procedure and simultaneous PEG insertion. Degree of dysphagia, body weight loss, daily energy requirement, body mass index and performance status before and after the stenting procedure as well as complications were assessed. Results Forty-five patients aged 19-88 years were included in the study. Six of them had a fistula to the trachea and underwent stenting of the oesophagus or both the oesophagus and the airway. The technical success rate was 100%. Following the procedure all patients were able to swallow fluids and semi-liquids, and PEG was used as the primary feeding route. Body mass index increased from 20.4 to 21.1 (p = 0.0001), body weight gain improved from -10.1 to +2.0 kg and metabolic requirements improved (p = 0.0001).

We used anonymized smartphone mobility measures to quantify the mobility level needed to control SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., mobility threshold), and the difference relative to the observed mobility level (i.e., mobility gap). METHODS: We conducted a time-series study of the weekly incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada from Mar. 15, 2020, to Mar. 6, 2021. The outcome was weekly growth rate, defined as the ratio of cases in a given week versus the previous week. We evaluated the effects of average time spent outside the home in the previous 3 weeks using a log-normal regression model, accounting for province, week and mean temperature. We calculated the SARS-CoV-2 mobility threshold and gap. RESULTS: Across the 51-week study period, a total of 888 751 people were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Each 10% increase in the mobility gap was associated with a 25% increase in the SARS-CoV-2 weekly case growth rate (ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.20-1.29). Compared to the prepandemic baseline mobility of 100%, the mobility threshold was highest in the summer (69%; interquartile range [IQR] 67%-70%), and dropped to 54% in winter 2021 (IQR 52%-55%); a mobility gap was present in Canada from July 2020 until the last week of December 2020.

Their black-box nature has sparked many recent works to explain the prediction via input feature attribution methods (aka saliency methods).

In this work, we first identify the semantics associated with internal units (feature maps) of the network. We proceed to investigate the following questions;Does a regression model that is only trained with COVID-19 severity scores implicitly learn visual patterns associated with thoracic pathologies? Does a network that is trained on weakly labeled data (e.g. healthy, unhealthy) implicitly learn pathologies? Moreover, we investigate the effect of pretraining and data imbalance on the interpretability of learned features. In addition to the analysis, we propose semantic attribution to semantically explain each prediction.

Patients with malignant tumors have experienced treatment interruptions and difficulties in seeking medical attention, and these have affected their mental health. The objective of this review is to evaluate the current evidence on the prevalence of depression and anxiety in cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : We searched the EMBASE, PubMed, WHO COVID-19 database, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CBM, CNKI, Wanfangdata, CQVIP, and CBM electronic databases for relevant studies published from the first available day to June 30, 2020. Two researchers independently screened the literature based on predetermined criteria and assessed the risk of bias in each study. Random-effects meta-analyses was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression among patients with malignant tumors. The review protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020196421). Results: : Nine eligible studies on 2,335 patients with malignant tumors were included, all of which were cross-sectional studies. The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 52.94% (95% CI: 36.98%-68.91%, I 2 =98.6%) in 9 studies, and the pooled prevalence of depression was 43.25% (95% CI: 25.85%-60.85%, I 2 =98.8%) in 6 studies.

Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic analysis were performed to explore the influencing factors of self-reported depression symptoms. Results: The proportion of self-reported depression symptoms, mild self-reported depression symptoms, and moderate to severe (M/S) self-reported depression symptoms was 65.2, 53.7, and 11.5%, respectively. The mean score of self-reported depression was 54.8  9.0. Female, personality type of partial introversion, junior college educational level, moderate or high self-perceived risk of infection, moderately or highly impacted by the outbreak, and being eager to go back to school were risk factors for M/S self-reported depression symptoms (p < 0.05). While, moderate or high concern about the outbreak, moderate or high satisfaction with pandemic prevention and control measures, and having health literacy on communicable diseases were protective factors for M/S self-reported depression symptoms (p < 0.05).

To support pediatric clinical studies for investigational treatments of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), pediatric-specific dosing is required. Objective: To define pediatric-specific dosing regimens for hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation were used to extrapolate investigated adult dosages toward children (March 2020-April 2020). Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling was used to inform pediatric dosing for hydroxychloroquine. For remdesivir, pediatric dosages were derived using allometric-scaling with age-dependent exponents. Dosing simulations were conducted using simulated pediatric and adult participants based on the demographics of a white US population. Interventions: Simulated drug exposures following a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg every 12 hours  2 doses followed by 200 mg every 12 hours  8 doses) and a single 200-mg intravenous dose of remdesivir were computed for simulated adult participants. A simulation-based dose-ranging study was conducted in simulated children exploring different absolute and weight-normalized dosing strategies. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome for hydroxychloroquine was average unbound plasma concentrations for 5 treatment days. Additionally, unbound interstitial lung concentrations were simulated. For remdesivir, the primary outcome was plasma exposure (area under the curve, 0 to infinity) following single-dose administration. Results: For hydroxychloroquine, the physiologically based pharmacokinetic model analysis included 500 and 600 simulated white adult and pediatric participants, respectively, and supported weight-normalized dosing for children weighing less than 50 kg. Geometric mean-simulated average unbound plasma concentration values among children within different developmental age groups (32-35 ng/mL) were congruent to adults (32 ng/mL). Simulated unbound hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung interstitial fluid mirrored those in unbound plasma and were notably lower than in vitro concentrations needed to mediate antiviral activity. For remdesivir, the analysis included 1000 and 6000 simulated adult and pediatric participants, respectively. The proposed pediatric dosing strategy supported weight-normalized dosing for participants weighing less than 60 kg. Geometric mean-simulated plasma area under the time curve 0 to infinity values among children within different developmental age-groups (4315-5027 ng  h/mL) were similar to adults (4398 ng  h/mL). Conclusions and Relevance: This analysis provides pediatric-specific dosing suggestions for hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir and raises concerns regarding hydroxychloroquine use for COVID-19 treatment because concentrations were less than those needed to mediate an antiviral effect.","output":"Simulated Assessment of Pharmacokinetically Guided Dosing for Investigational Treatments of Pediatric Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae is extensively utilized for commercial fermentation, and is also an important biological model; however, its ecology has only recently begun to be understood.

Here, the whole-genome sequences of 104 New Zealand (NZ) S. cerevisiae strains, including 52 novel genomes, are analyzed alongside 450 published sequences derived from various global locations. The impact of S. cerevisiae novel range expansion into NZ was investigated and these analyses reveal the positioning of NZ strains as a subgroup to the predominantly European/wine clade. A number of genomic differences with the European group correlate with range expansion into NZ, including 18 highly enriched single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and novel Ty1/2 insertions. While it is not possible to categorically determine if any genetic differences are due to stochastic process or the operations of natural selection, we suggest that the observation of NZ-specific copy number increases of four sugar transporter genes in the HXT family may reasonably represent an adaptation in the NZ S. cerevisiae subpopulation, and this correlates with the observations of copy number changes during adaptation in small-scale experimental evolution studies.","output":"Whole-genome sequencing from the New Zealand Saccharomyces cerevisiae population reveals the genomic impacts of novel microbial range expansion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis paper quantifies the effects of recent Federal Reserve interest rate changes, specifically recent hikes and cuts in the federal funds rate since 2015, on Midwest farmland values.Design/methodology/approachThe authors apply three autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models to a panel data of state-level farmland values from 1963 to 2018 to estimate the dynamic effects of interest rate changes on the US farmland market.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Public hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 362 doctors and 1702 nurses in major departments of five hospitals of three Chinese provinces. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted from October to November 2020, facilitated by hospital administrators through online WeChat/QQ working groups. Data on outcome expectations, self-efficacy, norms, and COVID-19-related work experiences were collected. Multivariate logistic regression models were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The logistic regression analysis showed that physical (e.g., protective effect of vaccination) and self-evaluative outcome expectations (e.g., anticipated regret), self-efficacy, norms (e.g., descriptive norm, subjective norm, professional norm, and moral norm), and job satisfaction were significantly and positively associated with the free and self-paid COVID-19 vaccination intention outcomes among doctors and nurses, adjusted for background variables.

Among many prognostic parameters, three hemodynamic indices: right atrial pressure, cardiac index, and mixed venous saturation are considered critically important for correct risk classification. All of them are measured invasively and require right heart catheterization (RHC). The study was aimed to verify assumption that a model based on non-invasive parameters is able to predict hemodynamic profile described by the mentioned invasive indices.

We performed a comprehensive literature search of major databases (from inception to June 2020) to identify prospective studies comparing wet-suction EUS-FNA and dry-suction EUS-FNA. Specimen adequacy, sample contamination, and histologic accuracy were assessed by pooling data using a random-effects model expressed in terms of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Six studies including a total of 418 patients (365 wet suction vs. 377 dry suction) were included in our final analysis. The study included a total of 535 lesions (332 pancreatic lesions and 203 nonpancreatic lesions). The pooled odds of sample adequacy was 3.18 (CI: 1.82-5.54, P = 0.001) comparing wet- and dry-suction cohorts. The pooled odds of blood contamination was 1.18 (CI: 0.75-1.86, P = 0.1).

This study aimed to assess the commercial whey products (CWP) whey protein isolate (WPI), galacto-oligosaccharide-whey protein concentrate (GOS-W) and glycomacropeptide (GMP) for their potential to improve intestinal health in vitro using HT29-MTX intestinal goblet and Caco-2 epithelial cells. Results from HT29-MTX culture showed that WPI mitigated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production at a higher extent compared to GOS-W or GMP. However, GMP downregulated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TLR-4 inflammatory pathway with the highest potency compared to the other CWP. Biomarkers of epithelial integrity assessed on both cell lines showed tight junction proteins claudin-1, claudin-3, occludin (OCC), and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) upregulation by GMP in HT29-MTX (1.33-1.93-fold of control) and in Caco-2 cells (1.56-2.09-fold of control). All CWP increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in TNF- challenged Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-culture monolayer (p < 0.05), but only GMP was similar to the positive control TGF-1, known for its role in promoting epithelial barrier function. The TNF--induced co-culture monolayer permeability was prevented at similar levels by all CWP (p < 0.05). In conclusion, CWP may be used as functional food ingredients to protect against intestinal disorders with emphasis on the GMP enhanced anti-inflammatory and intestinal barrier function properties. Further in vivo studies are guaranteed to validate these findings.","output":"Commercial whey products promote intestinal barrier function with glycomacropeptide enhanced activity in downregulating bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced inflammation in vitro."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Five Bulldog pups, 4 weeks of age or younger, were presented over a 2-day period for postmortem examination and diagnostic evaluation.

Necropsy examination revealed locally extensive to diffusely red, firm, consolidated lungs in all pups. Histopathologically, the lungs were variably effaced by multifocal areas of necrosis. The alveolar lumens contained fibrin, edema fluid, macrophages, and neutrophils. Many of the bronchioles contained cellular debris and neutrophils admixed with sloughed bronchiolar epithelium, which often contained large intranuclear amphophilic inclusion bodies that peripherally displaced chromatin. Fluorescent antibody testing was positive for Canine adenovirus. An adenovirus isolated via cell culture was positive on direct fluorescent antibody test and was identified as Canine adenovirus serotype 2 via polymerase chain reaction.

METHODS: This paper presents analyses of data from a cross-sectional study. Adults aged 18 years and over, residing in the UK and self-isolating from others outside their own household were eligible to participate. Participants reported increase or no increase in their level of alcohol consumption from before to during lockdown, as well as symptoms of anxiety, depression and mental wellbeing. Socio-demographic characteristics were compared between adults with and without reported increased alcohol consumption. The associations between reported increased alcohol consumption and mental health outcomes were investigated using logistic and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: 691 adults (61.1 % women; 48.8 % aged 35-64 years) were included in the analysis. Of these, 17 % reported increased alcohol consumption after lockdown. A higher proportion of 18-34-year olds reported increased alcohol consumption compared to older groups. The prevalence of poor overall mental health was significantly higher in individuals with increased alcohol consumption (vs. no increase) (45.4 % versus 32.7 %; p-value = 0.01). There was a significant association between increased alcohol consumption and poor overall mental health (OR = 1.64; 95 % CI = 1.01, 2.66), depressive symptoms (unstandardized beta = 2.93; 95 % CI = 0.91, 4.95) and mental wellbeing (unstandardized beta=-1.38; 95 % CI=-2.38, -0.39). CONCLUSIONS: More than one in six UK adults increased their alcohol consumption during lockdown and a higher proportion of these were younger adults. Increased alcohol consumption was independently associated with poor overall mental health, increased depressive symptoms and lower mental wellbeing. These findings highlight the importance of planning targeted support as we emerge from lockdown and plan for potential second and subsequent waves.","output":"Alcohol use and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown: A cross-sectional study in a sample of UK adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted teaching in almost all higher education institutions globally and online learning quickly become the core method of delivery Despite the flexibilities that online learning can offer, there might be challenges in fulfilling the needs of the students' learning especially those among the disciplines of design, architecture, and engineering where hands-on classes are essential This study aims to examine the students' perception of online learning and the university's engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic After one semester of fully online learning, a cross-sectional survey was conducted through online questionnaire among 716 design, architecture, and engineering students from Taylor's University to further examine the perception of online learning and its institution engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic Study shows that the pandemic has minor effect on their university plan where 84% are keen to re-enrol for the term and only 6% prefer to wait out the pandemic Findings further show that the amount of time spent on completing assignments has increased compared to previous term (52%), yet students raised the concern about keeping up with the coursework in online learning environment (56%) Despite the majority of students associate their feelings of online learning with worried (49 6%), distracting (31 6%), and nervous (24 3%), results revealed 49% of students appreciate the university's effort in their academic initiative followed by 31% feeling thankful for the timely updates and hardship fund set up by the management and 20% are pleased with the university engagement related to well-being Policymakers and higher education institutions worldwide may benefit from these findings when formulating contingency plans and tactics on how to support students during the pandemic ? 2021 School of Engineering","output":"Students' perception of online learning and institution's engagement during the Covid-19 pandemic: A survey study of Taylor's design, architecture, and engineering students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Ireland, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a total of 230,599 cases of infection as on 20 March 2021, and 4323 deaths.

Analyzing the cases of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile, this article shows that where a weak legacy, characterized by low coverage and savings rates, a weakly organized pension industry, and strong societal groups that oppose the private system, combines with a strong institutional setting, characterized by a government with large support in Congress and where the president concentrates decisionmaking, re-reform outcomes may lead to the outright elimination of the private pillar.

Spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed intramedullary lesions with gadolinium enhancement on the Th1/2 and Th5/6 vertebral levels. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing showed a mildly increased level of total protein and positive oligoclonal bands (OCB). DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with acute transverse myelitis. INTERVENTION: The patient received 5 days of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse (1000 mg/day) followed by oral prednisolone (30 mg/day with gradual tapering). OUTCOMES: The patient fully recovered from muscle weakness of the lower limbs. He was discharged from our hospital and able to independently walk without unsteadiness.

Malaria surveillance is crucial for tracking regional and temporal patterns in disease incidence, assisting in recorded details, timely reporting, and frequency of analysis. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to develop an integrated surveillance graphical app called FeverTracker, which has been designed to assist the community and health care workers in digital surveillance and thereby contribute toward malaria control and elimination. METHODS: FeverTracker uses a geographic information system and is linked to a web app with automated data digitization, SMS text messaging, and advisory instructions, thereby allowing immediate notification of individual cases to district and state health authorities in real time. RESULTS: The use of FeverTracker for malaria surveillance is evident, given the archaic paper-based surveillance tools used currently. The use of the app in 19 tribal villages of the Dhalai district in Tripura, India, assisted in the surveillance of 1880 suspected malaria patients and confirmed malaria infection in 93.4% (114/122; Plasmodium falciparum), 4.9% (6/122; P vivax), and 1.6% (2/122; P falciparum/P vivax mixed infection) of cases. Digital tools such as FeverTracker will be critical in integrating disease surveillance, and they offer instant data digitization for downstream processing. CONCLUSIONS: The use of this technology in health care and research will strengthen the ongoing efforts to eliminate malaria.

METHODS: A multicenter, hospital-based, retrospective comparative analysis of patients presenting with posterior segment trauma was done during the COVID-19 (Group A) (March 25, 2020 - September 30, 2020) period and the pre-COVID-19 (Group B) (March 25, 2019 - September 30, 2019) period. RESULTS: A total of 405 patients were diagnosed with posterior segment trauma (Group A: 206, Group B: 199). The time interval between onset of trauma and presentation was higher in Group A (16.59  29.87 days) as compared to Group B (9.41  19.19 days) (P = 0.004). A majority of patients in Group A had a history of prior consultation before presentation (P = 0.049). In Group A, 120 (58.2%) patients sustained ocular trauma at home as compared to 80 (40.2%) patients in Group B (P < 0.0001). Patients presenting with light perception were significantly more in Group A (43.7%) as compared to Group B (30.2%) (P = 0.004). In Group B, 37.6% patients had presenting visual acuity of counting finger or better as compared to 27.6% patients in Group A (P = 0.07). Patients in Group A had a significantly higher proportion of post-traumatic endophthalmitis with delayed presentation (P = 0.011) and retinal detachment (P = 0.041).

These complications suggest that neural activity in the central nervous system may be altered in those patients, leading to unexpected conditions, such as neurodegeneration in elderly patients. Recently, some studies linked the presence of CRS and cognitive impairments that could further develop into Alzheimers disease (AD). AD is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and is characterised by progressive memory loss, cognitive behavioural deficits, and significant personality changes. The microbiome, especially those in the gut, has been recognised as a human organ and plays an important role in the development of various conditions, including AD. However, less attention has been paid to the microbiome in the nasal cavity. Increased nasal inflammatory responses due to CRS may be an initial event that changes local microbiome homeostasis, which may further affect neuronal integrity in the central nervous system resulting in AD. Evidence suggests a potential of -amyloid deposition starting in olfactory neurons, which is then expanded from the nasal cavity to the central nervous system.

Most of patients did not change their IBD therapy during the pandemic (86,8%), and majority (62,3%) felt there was no impact of pandemic on the availability to their therapy. Almost half of patients (49,7%) feel that the quality of healthcare system is worse since the beginning of the pandemic. More than half of patients (57,5%) do not want to be vaccinated against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic had a moderate to large impact on mental health in majority of patients. It is particularly important that patients receive correct information about COVID-19 from medical professionals, and patients association groups are very useful channel for patient education that should be used more. More than half of patients do not want to be vaccinated, showing the importance of patient education even more.","output":"P578 Adriatic-Balkan regional survey on COVID-19 in Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most governments around the world implemented some kind of social distancing policy in an attempt to block the spreading of the virus within a territory. In Brazil, this mitigation strategy was first implemented in March 2020 and mainly monitored by social isolation indicators built from mobile geolocation data. While it is well known that social isolation has been playing a crucial role in epidemic control, the precise connections between mobility data indicators and epidemic dynamic parameters have a complex interdependence. In this work, we investigate this dependence for several Brazilian cities, looking also at socioeconomic and demographic factors that influence it. As expected, the increase in the social isolation indicator was shown to be related to the decrease in the speed of transmission of the disease, but the relation was shown to depend on the urban hierarchy level of the city, the human development index and also the epidemic curve stage. Moreover, a high social isolation at the beginning of the epidemic relates to a strong positive impact on flattening the epidemic curve, while less efficacy of this mitigation strategy was observed when it has been implemented later. Mobility data plays an important role in epidemiological modeling and decision-making, however, we discuss in this work how a direct relationship between social isolation data and COVID-19 data is hard to be established. Understanding this interplay is a key factor to better modeling, for which we hope this study contributes.","output":"A snapshot of a pandemic : the interplay between social isolation and COVID-19 dynamics in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For almost three decades following the discovery of the human Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) the early events of virus infection (attachment to hepatocytes, specific binding to a receptor on hepatocytes) remained enigmatic. The gradual improvement of tissue culture systems for HBV has enabled the identification of viral determinants for viral infectivity and facilitated the discovery of the human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (hNTCP) as a liver specific receptor of HBV and its satellite, the human Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV). These findings are currently leading basic and clinical research activities in new directions. (1) Stable hNTCP-expressing cell lines have become a valuable platform to study the full HBV replication cycle from its native template, the cccDNA. (2) The suitability of NTCP complemented cell culture systems for high throughput screening approaches will facilitate identification of novel host factors involved in HBV replication (including those that determine the peculiar host specificity of HBV infection) and will enable identification and development of novel drug candidates for improved therapeutics. (3) Since NTCP is a major host-specific restriction factor for HBV and HDV, hNTCP-expressing animals provide the basis for future susceptible in vivo models. (4) The concept obtained with the entry inhibitor Myrcludex B demonstrates that NTCP is a suitable target for clinical interference with viral entry. This will foster further clinical approaches aiming at curative combination therapies.","output":"Entry of hepatitis B and hepatitis D virus into hepatocytes: Basic insights and clinical implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unique strengths of qualitative research, through in-depth inquiry and identification of unexpected themes and linkages, is essential to our growing understanding of COVID-19's impacts on the social world and its intersection with sustainability science.

METHODS PBC RNA samples from baseline and 12-month visits, corresponding to the active treatment period of both arms in Scleroderma Lung Study II, were investigated by global RNA sequencing. Joint models were created to examine the predictive significance of baseline composite modular scores for the course of forced vital capacity (FVC) per cent predicted measurements from 3 to 12 months. RESULTS 134 patients with SSc-ILD (CYC=69 and MMF=65) were investigated. CYC led to an upregulation of erythropoiesis, inflammation and myeloid lineage-related modules and a downregulation of lymphoid lineage-related modules. The modular changes resulting from MMF treatment were more modest and included a downregulation of plasmablast module. In the longitudinal analysis, none of the baseline transcript module scores showed predictive significance for FVC% course in the CYC arm. In contrast, in the MMF arm, higher baseline lymphoid lineage modules predicted better subsequent FVC% course, while higher baseline myeloid lineage and inflammation modules predicted worse subsequent FVC% course. CONCLUSION Consistent with the primary mechanism of action of MMF on lymphocytes, patients with SSc-ILD with higher baseline lymphoid module scores had better FVC% course, while those with higher myeloid cell lineage activation score had poorer FVC% course on MMF.","output":"Peripheral blood gene expression profiling shows predictive significance for response to mycophenolate in systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seasonal influenza vaccines confer protection against specific viral strains but have restricted breadth that limits their protective efficacy. The H1 and H3 subtypes of influenza A virus cause most of the seasonal epidemics observed in humans and are the major drivers of influenza A virus-associated mortality. The consequences of pandemic spread of COVID-19 underscore the public health importance of prospective vaccine development. Here, we show that headless hemagglutinin (HA) stabilized-stem immunogens presented on ferritin nanoparticles elicit broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) responses to diverse H1 and H3 viruses in nonhuman primates (NHPs) when delivered with a squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, AF03. The neutralization potency and breadth of antibodies isolated from NHPs were comparable to human bnAbs and extended to mismatched heterosubtypic influenza viruses. Although NHPs lack the immunoglobulin germline VH1-69 residues associated with the most prevalent human stem-directed bnAbs, other gene families compensated to generate bnAbs. Isolation and structural analyses of vaccine-induced bnAbs revealed extensive interaction with the fusion peptide on the HA stem, which is essential for viral entry. Antibodies elicited by these headless HA stabilized-stem vaccines neutralized diverse H1 and H3 influenza viruses and shared a mode of recognition analogous to human bnAbs, suggesting that these vaccines have the potential to confer broadly protective immunity against diverse viruses responsible for seasonal and pandemic influenza infections in humans.","output":"Broad neutralization of H1 and H3 viruses by adjuvanted influenza HA stem vaccines in nonhuman primates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background New York City was among the earliest and hardest hit areas during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A rehabilitation center was converted into a satellite hospital with a capacity of up to 425 patient beds in 10 days. Design-build Approach Our institution worked in coordination with larger hospital systems and state and local governments, which allowed for a rapid lease of an underutilized structure, influx of supplies, and personnel. Hospital staff was voluntarily redeployed from their assigned services based on reduced need. Outcomes A total of 204 COVID-19 patients were accepted for transfer to the facility between April 6, 2020 and May 11, 2020. There were no major adverse outcomes and no deaths at the facility. Lessons Learned When a surge of patients is projected to outnumber the available beds in a hospital, such as during a pandemic, it may become necessary to establish a satellite facility. Creativity with existing spaces, health care infrastructure, and reallocation of available resources, as well as having all stakeholders on board, is imperative. Providing mandatory emergency planning and response trainings to hospital staff and leadership can improve preparedness. By leaning on revised protocols established at the satellite facility during the initial surge, the hospital was able to lease and convert another nursing facility and make it patient-ready in less than one week during the second surge of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Conversion of a Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Facility into a Satellite Hospital in Response to a COVID-19 Surge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telehealth programs have long held promise for addressing rural health disparities perpetuated by inadequate healthcare access.

For all hantavirus species tested, results indicate that the IC(50) of chloroquine (mean 10.2  1.43 M) is significantly lower than the CC(50) (mean 260  2.52 M) yielding an overall selectivity index of 25.5. We also investigated the potential of chloroquine to prevent death in newborn mice after Hantaan virus infection and its antiviral effect in the hantavirus Syrian hamster model. For this purpose, C57Bl/6 mother mice were treated subcutaneously with daily doses of chloroquine. Subsequently, 1-day-old suckling mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 5 x 10(2) Hantaan virus particles. In litters of untreated mothers, none of the pups survived challenge. The highest survival rate (72.7% of pups) was found when mother mice were administered a concentration of 10 mg/kg chloroquine. Survival rates declined in a dose-dependent manner, with 47.6% survival when treated with 5 mg/kg chloroquine, and 4.2% when treated with 1 mg/kg chloroquine. Assessing the antiviral therapeutic and prophylactic effect of chloroquine in the Syrian hamster model was done using two different administration routes (intraperitoneally and subcutaneously using an osmotic pump system). Evaluating the prophylactic effect, a delay in onset of disease was noted and for the osmotic pump, 60% survival was observed.

The ongoing debate highlights the challenges of the adoption of data-driven innovation. We reflect on how to ensure an appropriate level of protection of individual data and maximize public health benefits derivable from the collected data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze available COVID-19 contact tracing applications and verify to what extent public health interests and data privacy standards can be fulfilled simultaneously in the process of the adoption of digital health technologies. METHODS: A systematic review of Pubmed, Medbase, and grey literature was performed to identify available contact tracing applications. Two checklists were developed to evaluate (1) the applications' compliance with data privacy standards and (2) their fulfillment of public health interests. Based on both checklists, a scorecard with a selected set of minimum requirements was created with the goal to estimate whether the balance between the objective of data privacy and public health interests can be achieved to ensure the broad adoption of digital technologies. RESULTS: Overall, 21 contact tracing applications were reviewed. In total, 11 criteria were defined to assess the usefulness of each digital technology for public health interests. The most frequently installed features related to contact alerting and governmental accountability. The least frequent feature was the availability of a system of medical or organizational support. Only one app provided a threshold for population coverage needed for the digital solution to be effective. In total, 12 criteria were used to assess the compliance of contact tracing applications with data privacy regulations. Explicit user consent, voluntary use, and anonymization techniques were among the most frequently fulfilled criteria. What mostly lacked were information about personal data breach and data gathered from children. The balance between standards of data protection and public health benefits was achieved best by COVIDSafe and worst by Alipay Health Code. CONCLUSIONS: Contact tracing applications with high levels of compliance with standards of data privacy tend to fulfill public health interests to a limited extent. Simultaneously, digital technologies with a lower level of data privacy protection allow for more data collection. Overall, the review shows that a consistent number of applications appears to comply with standards of data privacy, while their usefulness from the public health perspective can still be maximized.","output":"An Overview of Contact Tracing Applications Between Privacy Protection and Public Health: State-of-the-Art and Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pediocin PA-1 is a class IIa bacteriocin that is particularly effective against the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.

In front of the immunological idea of a peptide epitope being an a priori selected amino acid sequence, immunoproteomics introduced the peptide epitope concept as mathematically defined by its frequency and physico-chemically characterized by hydrophobicity. I.e., before proteomics, molecular mimicry - the sharing of peptide sequences between two biological entities - was considered as intrinsically endowed with immunologic properties and was related to cross-reactivity. Proteomics allowed to redefine such an assumption using physico-chemical parameters according to which frequency and hydrophobicity preferentially confer an immunologic potential to shared peptide sequences.Expert opinionProteomics is outlining peptide platforms to be used for the diagnostics and management of human diseases.

Thus, the main goal of this study was to evaluate the agreement between self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and weight measured during the first trimester of pregnancy among Brazilian women so as to assess whether self-reported pre-pregnancy weight is reliable and can be used for calculation of BMI and GWG. METHODS: Data from the Brazilian Maternal and Child Nutrition Consortium (BMCNC, n = 5563) and the National Food and Nutritional Surveillance System (SISVAN, n = 393,095) were used to evaluate the agreement between self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and weights measured in three overlapping intervals (30-94, 30-60 and 30-45 days of pregnancy) and their impact in BMI classification. We calculated intraclass correlation and Lin's concordance coefficients, constructed Bland and Altman plots, and determined Kappa coefficient for the categories of BMI. RESULTS: The mean of the differences between self-reported and measured weights was < 2 kg during the three intervals examined for BMCNC (1.42, 1.39 and 1.56 kg) and about 1 kg for SISVAN (1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 kg). Intraclass correlation and Lin's coefficient were > 0.90 for both datasets in all time intervals. Bland and Altman plots showed that the majority of the difference laid in the 2 kg interval and that the differences did not vary according to measured first-trimester BMI.

In 2018, Chinas national medical security systems were integrated, while MIISs were facing reconstruction. We summarized Chinas experience in medical insurance informatization over the past 20 years, aiming to provide a reference for the building of a new basic MIS for China and for developing countries. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to sort out medical insurance informatization policies throughout the years, use questionnaires to determine the status quo of provincial MIIS-building in China and the relevant policies, provide references and suggestions for the top-level design and implementation of the information systems in the transitional period of Chinas MIS reform, and provide a reference for the building of MIISs in developing countries. METHODS: We conducted policy analysis by collecting the laws, regulations, and policy documentsissued from 1998 to 2020on China's medical insurance and its informatization; we also analyzed the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and other relevant policies. We conducted a questionnaire survey by sending out questionnaires to 31 Chinese, provincial, medical security bureaus to collect information about network links, system functions, data exchange, standards and specifications, and building modes, among other items. We conducted a literature review by searching for documents about relevant laws and policies, building methods, application results, and other documents related to MIISs; we conducted searches using PubMed, Elsevier, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and other major literature databases. We conducted telephone interviews to verify the results of questionnaires and to understand the focus issues concerning the building of Chinas national MIISs during the period of integration and transition of China's MIS. RESULTS: In 74% (23/31) of the regions in China, MIISs were networked through dedicated fiber optic lines. In 65% (20/31) of the regions in China, MIISs supported identity recognition based on both ID cards and social security cards. In 55% (17/31) of the regions in China, MIISs at provincial and municipal levels were networked and have gathered basic medical insurance data, whereas MIISs were connected to health insurance companies in 35% (11/31) of the regions in China. Chinas MIISs are comprised of 11 basic functional modules, among which the modules of business operation, transregional referral, reimbursement, and monitoring systems are widely applied. MIISs in 83% (20/24) of Chinese provinces have stored data on coverage, payment, and settlement compensation of medical insurance. However, in terms of data security and privacy protection, pertinent policies are absent and data utilization is not in-depth enough. Respondents to telephone interviews universally reflected on the following issues and suggestions: in the period of integration and transition of MISs, close attention should be paid to the top-level design, and repeated investment should be avoided for the building of MIISs; MIISs should be adapted to the health care reform, and efforts should be made to strengthen the informatization support for the reform of payment methods; and MIISs should be adapted for the widespread application of mobile phones and should provide insured persons with more self-service functions. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, the building of Chinas basic MIISs should be deployed at the national, provincial, prefectural, and municipal levels on a unified basis. Efforts should be made to strengthen the development of standard codes, data exchange, and data utilization. Work should be done to formulate the rules and regulations for security and privacy protection and to balance the right to be informed with the mining and utilization of big data. Efforts should be made to intensify the interconnectivity between MISs and other health systems and to strengthen the application of medical insurance information in public health monitoring and early warning systems; this would ultimately improve the degree of trust from stakeholders, including individuals, medical service providers, and public health institutions, in the basic MIISs.","output":"Medical Insurance Information Systems in China: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of accommodation facilities is currently (especially in the COVID-19 pandemic) accompanied by a growth in guests emphasis on the quality and structure of additional services. Guest satisfaction with services in tourism is thus one of the important factors affecting the level of profitability, prosperity, and competitiveness. The quality of accommodation facilities is related to the satisfaction of guests. The proper attitude and professionalism are the key success factors along with the quality of the services provided by any accommodation facility. The guests perception of quality is influenced by the professionalism, helpfulness, and willingness of the staff. The goal of this paper was to evaluate guest satisfaction with accommodation, catering, and additional services at a selected hotel in Dv?r Krlov nad Labem. Guest satisfaction was determined using a questionnaire survey conducted from July 2018 to January 2019. The results were evaluated by means of a cluster analysis in the Statistica 13 EN software application. The greatest dissatisfaction was expressed in summer with air-conditioning in rooms. Furthermore, the worst rating concerned the quality of food and beverages with respect to their price, which did not meet guests' expectations. The lowest satisfaction expressed by guests was with the value for money in terms of the quality of additional services, which they perceived as part of the value for money ratio with respect to room rates. ? 2021, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

Areas covered: Numerous organizations have released genomic data, amongst other tools, for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this has led to the development of growing datasets of knowledge for continued collaboration amongst different scientific communities. A different technique employs a more closed, market-driven method in order to stay ahead financially in the race for developing a suitable antiviral or vaccine. The latter allows sustained motivation for company ambitions and progress has been made toward clinical trials for potential drugs.

METHODS: Retrospective review identified patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and underwent pancreatoduodenectomy from 2013 to 2018. Preoperative computed tomography scans were evaluated for the development of hepatic steatosis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Hypoattenuation included liver attenuation greater than or equal to 10 Hounsfield units less than tissue density of spleen on noncontrast computed tomography and greater than or equal to 20 Hounsfield units less on contrast-enhanced computed tomography. RESULTS: One hundred forty-nine patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for a median of 5 cycles (interquartile range (IQR), 4C6). FOLFIRINOX was the regimen in 78% of patients. Hepatic steatosis developed in 36 (24%) patients. The median time from neoadjuvant chemotherapy completion to pancreatoduodenectomy was 40 days (IQR, 29C51). Preoperative biliary stenting was performed in 126 (86%) patients. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy was delivered to 23 (15%) patients. Female gender, obesity, and prolonged exposure to chemotherapy were identified as risk factors for chemotherapy-associated hepatic steatosis. Compared with control patients without neoadjuvant chemotherapy-associated hepatic steatosis, patients developing steatosis had similar rates of postoperative pancreatic fistula (8% (control) vs. 4%, p = 0.3), delayed gastric emptying (8% vs. 14%, p = 0.4), and major morbidity (11% vs. 15%, p = 0.6).

Thus, a reliable method of measurement is mandatory to assess adherence. AIM: To examine the test-retest reliability on adherence with inhaled corticosteroids in adults with asthma using, a self-reported adherence score (Foster score). METHODS: Patients with asthma and >1 routine follow-up appointment at a university hospital outpatient clinic reported Foster scores. The objective Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) was calculated based on pharmacy redemption data and physician-prescribed doses of inhaled corticosteroids. The difference between Foster score and MPR at the first and second visit was assessed using a BlandCAltman plot, outcomes reported as limits of agreements and bias. Foster scores from both visits were used to calculate an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: Self-reported adherence with asthma controller medication measured by Foster score was significantly higher than the objective MPR (p < 0.0001). The BlandCAltman plot for MPR and Foster score at the first and second visit showed upper and lower limits of agreement of 83.5 C (?1.6) and 80.9 C (?6.9) and bias was 41.0 and 37.0, respectively. Of the included patients, 93.1% reported identical Foster scores between visits, resulting in an excellent ICC of 0.92. Absolute median difference between Foster scores and MPR at first and second visit was 8.7 percentage points (p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Foster score shows an excellent ICC; however, its poor agreement with objective measures of adherence suggests that clinicians should not rely on Foster scores alone to assess adherence with inhaled corticosteroids in patients with asthma.","output":"Determining Persistence with an Inhaled Corticosteroid in Asthma: Assessment Using an Objective Measurement vs the Self-Reported Foster Score"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging infectious diseases are increasingly originating from wildlife.

Specifically, the retrieval becomes more challenging over the land surface due to appreciable reflectance from the target. This paper presents a simplistic physics-based approach to retrieve Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) (at a spatial resolution of 0.01) over the land surface from the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) signals measured from an Indian space-borne sensor, Ocean Color Monitor-2 (onboard OCEANSAT-2 satellite). The estimated AOD from OCM-2 has been compared with that from Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard AQUA satellite (Collection 6.1 Deep Blue/Dark Target product). The comparison is illustrated for two different conditions prevalent over the Indian region, i.e., smoke-dominated (post-monsoonal) and dust-laden (pre-monsoonal) periods. A case study is also illustrated for the pre- and post-COVID-19 lockdown time period for two different zones of the Indian region. The validation (comparison) of OCM-2 AOD is performed with respect to the data from AERONET stations (MODIS), and we found a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.84 (0.83) with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.14 (0.20).

DATA EXTRACTION Study characteristics, contract prevalence, contract requirements and incentives, and the influence of contracts on the retail environment were extracted from each study. DATA SYNTHESIS We created an evidence table and conducted a narrative review of included studies. CONCLUSIONS Contracts are prevalent around the world and handsomely incentivise tobacco retailers in exchange for substantial manufacturer control of tobacco product availability, placement, pricing and promotion in the retail setting. Contracts allow tobacco companies to promote their products and undermine tobacco control efforts in the retail setting through discounted prices, promotions and highly visible placement of marketing materials and products. Policy recommendations include banning tobacco manufacturer contracts and retailer incentives along with more transparent reporting of contract incentives given to retailers.","output":"Tobacco company agreements with tobacco retailers for price discounts and prime placement of products and advertising: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has posed serious threats to global health and economy, thus calling for the development of safe and effective vaccines. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for its binding to ACE2 receptor. It contains multiple dominant neutralizing epitopes and serves as an important antigen for the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we showed that immunization of mice with a candidate subunit vaccine consisting of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and Fc fragment of human IgG, as an immunopotentiator, elicited high titer of RBD-specific antibodies with robust neutralizing activity against both pseudotyped and live SARS-CoV-2 infections. The mouse antisera could also effectively neutralize infection by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 with several natural mutations in RBD and the IgG extracted from the mouse antisera could also show neutralization against pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). Vaccination of human ACE2 transgenic mice with RBD-Fc could effectively protect mice from the SARS-CoV-2 challenge. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc has good potential to be further developed as an effective and broad-spectrum vaccine to prevent infection of the current SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants, as well as future emerging SARSr-CoVs and re-emerging SARS-CoV.","output":"The recombinant subunit vaccine RBD-Fc, consisting of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human IgG Fc as an immunopotentiator, elicits robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic, and government measures aimed at preventing the spread of the disease, have had a major impact on many areas, including tourism, aviation, hotels, restaurants, and factories, which have had an impact on work contracts in effect when the epidemic occurred This paper exposes the most important effects of measures that countries have decided on to reduce the spread of COVID-19 Some of these measures led to the availability of the conditions of force majeure, in cases that lead to the impossibility of implementing labor contracts, whether it was a permanent or temporary impossibility, in whole or in part On the other hand, other measures have created conditions for applying the theory of unpredictability that led to rebalancing the obligations and rights of employers and workers so that workers alone do not bear the all of the negative consequences of these measures, thus it is important to highlight the role of the state in compensating employers for their losses that were paid in workers salaries This paper also includes the adequacy of the current labor and social security laws to address the effects of epidemics on workers and employers, and concludes with a number of recommendations related to amending labor and social insurance laws to fill the legislative deficiency related to labor relations and protect workers in times of epidemics ? 2020, Goce Delchev University of Shtip All rights reserved","output":"Labor relationships in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Across the United States, attention has focused on the differential impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on caregivers, women, and people of color in organizations, especially in higher education institutions.

However, the implication of this protein complex in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) disease has not been fully studied. Herein, we report that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a detrimental role during HMPV infection because NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition protected mice from mortality and reduced weight loss and inflammation without impacting viral replication. We also demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome exerts its deleterious effect via IL-1 production since we observed reduced mortality, weight loss and inflammation in IL-1-deficient (IL-1(-/-)) mice, as compared to wild-type animals during HMPV infection. Moreover, the effect on these evaluated parameters was not different in IL-1(-/-) and wild-type mice treated with an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor. The production of IL-1 was also abrogated in bone marrow derived macrophages deficient for NLRP3. Finally, we show that small hydrophobic protein-deleted recombinant HMPV (HMPV SH) failed to activate caspase-1, which is responsible for IL-1 cleavage and maturation. Furthermore, HMPV SH-infected mice had less weight loss, showed no mortality and reduced inflammation, as compared to wild-type HMPV-infected mice. Thus, NLRP3 inflammasome activation seems to be triggered by HMPV SH protein in HMPV disease. In summary, once activated by the HMPV SH protein, NLRP3 inflammasome promotes the maturation of IL-1, which exacerbates HMPV-induced inflammation. Therefore, the blockade of IL-1 production by using NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors might be a novel potential strategy for the therapy and prevention of HMPV infection.","output":"Human metapneumovirus activates NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome via its small hydrophobic protein which plays a detrimental role during infection in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sustainable development, sustainable consumption and short supply chains are nowadays acquiring increasing relevance on the literature.

Understanding the factors associated with social disconnection by living arrangement could help identify vulnerable older adults in the community. We examined the sociodemographic and health factors associated with social disconnection among two groups of older adults: those living alone and those living with others. METHODS We used data from 16,943 community-dwelling older adults from the third follow-up of the Singapore Chinese Health Study (mean age: 73 years, range: 61-96 years). We defined social disconnection as having no social participation and scoring in the lowest decile on the Duke Social Support Scale of perceived social support. We ran logistic regression models to study the sociodemographic (age, gender, and education) and health (self-rated health, instrumental limitations, cognitive function, and depression) factors associated with social disconnection, stratified by living arrangement. RESULTS About 6% of our participants were socially disconnected. Although living alone was significantly associated with social disconnection (OR 1.93, 95% CI: 1.58-2.35), 85.6% of socially disconnected older adults lived with others, most of them (92%) with family. Lower education level, cognitive impairment, fair/poor self-rated health, instrumental limitations, and depression were independently associated with social disconnection. Among those living alone, men were more likely to experience social disconnection than women (OR 2.18, 95% CI: 1.43-3.32).

OBJECTIVES: To assess the superiority of PEGylated G-CSF for CIN in breast cancer in terms of effectiveness and safety via a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was performed for eligible studies published from database inception to December 2019. All studies comparing PEGylated G-CSF and G-CSF for CIN of breast cancer were reviewed. After literature selection, data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two reviewers independently. Meta-analysis was conducted using Revman, version 5.2. RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials were finally identified. The publication bias of these studies was acceptable. For the endpoint of effectiveness, analysis of the incidence/duration of grade  3 neutropenia, the duration of grade 4 neutropenia, the incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN), and the time to absolute neutrophil count recovery showed no advantage of PEGylated G-CSF over G-CSF for CIN of breast cancer (P > 0.05), with the premise of a sufficient dose of G-CSF according to the guidelines.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the ideal postpandemic balance between alternative and traditional care modalities among patients with chronic illness and to qualify the circumstances in which patients consider it appropriate to replace traditional care with alternative care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study invited 5999 adults with chronic illness in ComPaRe, a French nationwide e-cohort of adults with chronic conditions who volunteer their time to participate in research projects, to participate in this study, which was performed from January 27 to February 23, 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants rated the ideal proportion at which they would use 3 alternative care modalities instead of the traditional care equivalent on a 0% to 100% scale (with 0% indicating using alternative care modalities for none of one's future care and 100% indicating using alternative care modalities for all of one's future care) of their overall future care: (1) teleconsultations, (2) online symptom-checkers to react to new symptoms, and (3) remote monitoring to adapt treatment outside consultations. The median ideal proportion of alternative care use was calculated. Perceived appropriate circumstances in which each alternative modality could replace traditional care were collected with open-ended questions. Analyses were performed on a weighted data set representative of patients with chronic illness in France. RESULTS: Of the 5999 invited individuals, 1529 (mean [SD] age, 50.3 [14.7] years; 1072 [70.1%] female) agreed to participate (participation rate, 25.5%). Participants would choose teleconsultations for 50.0% of their future consultations (IQR, 11.0%-52.0%), online symptom-checkers over contacting their physician for 22.0% of new symptoms (IQR, 2.0%-50.0%), and remote monitoring instead of consultations for 52.3% of their treatment adaptations (IQR, 25.4%-85.4%). Participants reported 67 circumstances for which replacing traditional with alternative care modalities was considered appropriate, including 31 care activities (eg, prescription renewal and addressing acute or minor complaints), 25 patient characteristics (eg, stable chronic condition and established patient-physician relationship), and 11 required characteristics of the alternative care modalities (eg, quality assurance). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this survey study suggest that after the pandemic, patients would choose alternative over traditional care for 22% to 52% of the time across different care needs.

This strategy opens up the possibility of a shorter path towards the end of the pandemic. ObjectiveTo compare the homologous prime-boost vaccination scheme of Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V, SpV) to its heterologous combination with mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Mod) vaccine. MethodsSARS-CoV-2 anti-spike (S)-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG concentration was assessed three to seven weeks after complete vaccination. Reactogenicity was evaluated by declared side events and medical assistance required until day 7 post-boost. ResultsOf 190 participants enrolled, 105 received homologous SpV/SpV and the remaining heterologous SpV/Mod vaccination scheme, respectively. Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 54 (37-63) years, 132 (69.5%) were female and 46 (24.2%) individuals had a prior confirmed COVID-19. Anti-S-RBD IgG median (IQR) titers were significantly higher for SpV/Mod [2511 (1476-3992) BAU/mL] than for SpV/SpV [582 (209-1609) BAU/mL, p<0.001] vaccination scheme. In a linear model adjusted for age, gender, time to the serological assay and time between doses, SpV/Mod [4.154 (6.585-615.554), p<0.001] and prior COVID [3.732 (8.641-202.010), p<0.001] were independently associated with higher anti-S-RBD IgG values. A higher frequency of mild-moderate adverse effects was associated with the heterologous scheme, although it was well tolerated by all individuals and no medical assistance was required. ConclusionThe heterologous SpV/Mod combination against SARS-CoV-2 is well tolerated and significantly increases humoral immune response as compared to the homologous SpV/SpV immunization.","output":"Heterologous Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) / mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccination induces a stronger humoral response than homologous Sputnik V in a real-world data analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microblogs have become a customary news media source in recent times. But as synthetic text or readfakes scale up the online disinformation operation, unsubstantiated pieces of information on social media platforms can cause significant havoc by misleading people.

Undeniably, quick rumour detection during the initial propagation phase is desirable for subsequent veracity and stance assessment. Linguistic features are easily available and act as important attributes during the initial propagation phase. At the same time, the choice of features is crucial for both interpretability and performance of the classifier. Motivated by the need to build a model for automatic rumour detection, this research proffers a hybrid model for rumour classification using deep learning (Convolution neural network) and a filter-wrapper (Information gainAnt colony) optimized Naive Bayes classifier, trained and tested on the PHEME rumour dataset. The textual features are learnt using the CNN which are combined with the optimized feature vector generated using the filter-wrapper technique, IG-ACO. The resultant optimized vector is then used to train the Na?ve Bayes classifier for rumour classification at the output layer of CNN.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Only patients aged between 3 and 16 years, who had started treatment before the lockdown and had spent this periodwith both parents were included in the study. The interviews were carried out using an anonymous questionnaire that assessed school and play activities, the type of diet, the time dedicated to home oral hygiene and the activities carried out with parents. Parents' work situation during lockdown was included to correlate it with time spent at home. The Frankl Behavior Rating Scale was used to determine the degree of cooperation during dental sessions pre- and post-lockdown. Chi-square test and Fisher's Exact tests were used to identify statistical associations of improvement with each categorical variable. Student's t-test was used to highlight the differences in mean values of continuous variables between subjects considered more cooperative and unimproved subjects. Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model. Assumption of linearity of independent variables and log-odds were assessed by Box-Tidwell transformation. Final selection was carried out using the Akaike criterion and all statistical analyses were carried out using the STATA statistical software package. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 212 patients (103F; 109M). The age ranged between 3 and 16 years with an average age of 9.03 years; 82.08% (95% CI 76.24-86.99) of the subjects showed an improvement in collaboration compared to pre-lockdown.

Severe COVID-19 is associated with multiple organ failure, particularly of lung and kidney, but also grave neuropsychiatric manifestations. Overall mortality reaches > 2%. Vaccine development has thrived in thus far unreached dimensions and will be one prerequisite to terminate the pandemic. Despite intensive research, however, few treatment options for modifying COVID-19 course/outcome have emerged since the pandemic outbreak. Additionally, the substantial threat of serious downstream sequelae, called long COVID and neuroCOVID, becomes increasingly evident. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: Among candidates that were suggested but did not yet receive appropriate funding for clinical trials is recombinant human erythropoietin. Based on accumulating experimental and clinical evidence, erythropoietin is expected to (1) improve respiration/organ function, (2) counteract overshooting inflammation, (3) act sustainably neuroprotective/neuroregenerative. Recent counterintuitive findings of decreased serum erythropoietin levels in severe COVID-19 not only support a relative deficiency of erythropoietin in this condition, which can be therapeutically addressed, but also made us coin the term hypoxia paradox. As we review here, this paradox is likely due to uncoupling of physiological hypoxia signaling circuits, mediated by detrimental gene products of SARS-CoV-2 or unfavorable host responses, including microRNAs or dysfunctional mitochondria. Substitution of erythropoietin might overcome this hypoxia paradox caused by deranged signaling and improve survival/functional status of COVID-19 patients and their long-term outcome. As supporting hints, embedded in this review, we present 4 male patients with severe COVID-19 and unfavorable prognosis, including predicted high lethality, who all profoundly improved upon treatment which included erythropoietin analogues. SHORT CONCLUSION: Substitution of EPO mayamong other beneficial EPO effects in severe COVID-19circumvent downstream consequences of the hypoxia paradox. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial for proof-of-concept is warranted.","output":"Addressing the hypoxia paradox in severe COVID-19: literature review and report of four cases treated with erythropoietin analogues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the first geographic study that uses space-time statistics to monitor COVID-19 in Brazil. The first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, caused by the contamination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and quickly turned into a pandemic. In Brazil, the first case occurred on January 23rd, 2020 but was officially reported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health on February 25th. Since then, the number of deaths and people infected by COVID-19 in Brazil have been steadily increasing. Despite the underreporting of coronavirus cases by government agencies across the country, the State of Sao Paulo has the highest rate among all Brazilian States. Thus, it is essential to detect which areas contain the highest concentration of COVID-19 to implement public policies, to mitigate the spread of the epidemic. To identify these critical areas, we utilized daily confirmed case data from the Brasil.IO website between February 25th, 2020 to May 5th, 2020; which were aggregated to the municipality level.

Of these, 944 from naive and 2,299 from convalescents produced monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein and 411 of them neutralized the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus. More than 75% of the monoclonal antibodies from naive people lost their neutralization activity against the B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) variants while this happened only for 61% of those from convalescents. The overall loss of neutralization was lower for the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants, however it was always significantly higher in those of naive people. In part this was due to the IGHV2-5;IGHJ4-1 germline, which was found only in convalescents and generated potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies. Overall, vaccination of seropositive people increases the frequency of B cells encoding antibodies with high potency and that are not susceptible to escape by any of the four variants of concern.

While it is widely accepted that specific humoral immune responses are critical in controlling the infection, the relationship between the humoral immune response and disease severity is currently unclear.MethodsUsing a flow cytometry-based assay to detect specific antibodies against full length S protein, we compared the antibody levels between patients from different severity groups. We also analysed the cytokine profiles of patients from different severity groups by multiplex microbead-based immunoassay . ResultsWe found an association between specific IgM, IgA and IgG against the spike protein and disease severity. By comparing the ratio of Th1 IgG1 and IgG3 to Th2 IgG2 and IgG4, we observed that all severity groups exhibited a ratio that was skewed towards a stronger Th1 response over Th2 response. In addition to the strong Th1 response, patients with severe disease also developed a Th2 response, as exemplified by the smaller ratio of IgG1 and IgG3 over IgG2 and IgG4 and the smaller Th1/Th2 cytokine ratios, compared to patients with mild disease severity. ConclusionThe results suggest that acute severity or disease resolution is associated with a specific immunological phenotype. A smaller skew towards a Th1 response over Th2 response, during infection, may contribute to disease progression, while a greater skew towards a Th1 response over Th2 response may contribute to a better disease outcome. This may suggest potential therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 disease management.","output":"Dynamic Alterations of Anti-S-Protein Igg Subclasses and of Th1/Th2 Responses are Hallmarks of Acute Severe COVID-19 Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SETTING: The State of Qatar has had one of the highest COVID-19 infection rates globally and has used state-managed quarantine and isolation centres to limit the spread of infection. Quarantine and isolation have been shown to negatively affect the mental health of individuals. Qatar has a unique population, with around 90% of the population being economic migrants and a majority being blue-collar workers and labourers. OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out to evaluate the psychological impact of institutional isolation and quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Qatar. The study also explored the sociodemographic correlates of this psychological impact. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: A cross-sectional study involving 748 consenting individuals in institutional quarantine and isolation in Qatar during the months of June and July 2020 was carried out. Relevant sociodemographic data along with depressive and anxiety symptomatology scores were collected from consenting adults at these facilities. RESULTS: 37.4% (n=270) of respondents reported depressive symptoms and 25.9% (n=189) reported anxiety symptoms. The scores were higher for individuals in isolation facilities and higher for migrants from poor socioeconomic group (p<0.001 for both). Within this group, although worries about infection were widely reported, lack of contact with the family was cited as one of the most important sources of distress. Respondents reported that contact with the family and reliable information were important factors that helped during the duration of isolation and quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reported significantly elevated scores for depression and anxiety during institutional quarantine, which is in keeping with emerging evidence. However, in contrast to other studies reporting mostly from native populations, this study of a population with an overwhelming majority of immigrants highlights the special mental health needs of this specific group and can inform future healthcare policies.","output":"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic within institutional quarantine and isolation centres and its sociodemographic correlates in Qatar: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted both that frontline workers face a new set of personal hazards in health care settings and that there are not well-established recommendations to address the broader risks to these workers and their families. Particularly vulnerable households include dual health care professional households, single-parent health care professional households, and households with health care professionals responsible for a high-risk family member (i.e., an older adult or immunocompromised person). While the demographics of these households are heterogeneous, it is expected that the professional and personal concerns specific to COVID-19 will be similar. These concerns include family safety, balancing full-time work with home-based schooling for children, the looming threat of illness to 1 or both partners, the potential of infecting high-risk family members, and the challenges of planning for the future during uncertain times. To elucidate these concerns in their department, the authors sought input from colleagues in dual health care professional households through an open-ended email communication. Respondents expressed a range of concerns centered on balancing professional and family responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this commentary, the authors propose several recommendations in the areas of support networks, leadership and culture, and operations and logistics that health care institutions can adopt to minimize the burden on these vulnerable households during states of emergency. The successful implementation of these recommendations hinges on creating a work environment in which all health care providers feel comfortable voicing their concerns.","output":"A Broader View of Risk to Health Care Workers: Perspectives on Supporting Vulnerable Health Care Professional Households During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We assessed healthcare workers (HCWs) COVID\\\\19 vaccine acceptability in Ethiopia.

A total of 1,314 HCWs participated in the study. RESULTS: We found that 25.5% (n = 332) of the HCWs would not accept a COVID\\\\19 vaccine and 20.2% (n = 264) were not willing to recommend COVID\\\\19 vaccination to others. Factors associated with vaccine non\\\\acceptance were female sex (AOR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3C2.5), the perception that vaccines are unsafe (AOR = 15.0; 95% CI: 8.7C25.9), not considering COVID\\\\19 as health risk (AOR = 4.4; 95% CI: 2.0C9.5) and being unconcerned about contracting COVID\\\\19 at work (AOR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.5C8.4).

Objective To evaluate the chemical constituents and effects of QMY on ASO rabbit model. Materials and methods Forty-eight New Zealand rabbits were divided into six groups (n = 8): normal (normal rabbits treated with 0.5% CMC-Na), vehicle (ASO rabbits treated with 0.5% CMC-Na), positive (simvastatin, 1.53 mg/kg), and QMY treatment (300, 600, and 1200 mg/kg). ASO rabbit model was prepared by high fatty feeding, roundly shortening artery, and bovine serum albumin immune injury. QMY (300, 600 and 1200 mg/kg) was orally administered for 8 weeks. The effects and possible mechanisms of QMY on ASO rabbits were evaluated by pathological examination, biochemical assays, and immunohistochemical assays. The compositions of QMY were analysed using HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis. Results Compared to the vehicle rabbit, QMY treatment suppressed plaque formation and intima thickness in aorta, and decreased intima thickness, whereas increased lumen area of femoral artery. Additionally, QMY treatment decreased TC, TG and LDL, decreased CRP and ET, and increased NO and 6-K-PGF1 in serum. Furthermore, the potential mechanisms studied revealed that QMY treatment could suppress expression of TNF-, IL-6, ICAM-1 and NF-B in endothelial tissues, and increase IB. In addition, HPLC analysis showed QMY had abundant anthraquinones, stilbenes, and flavonoids. Conclusion QMY has ameliorative effects on ASO rabbit, and the potential mechanisms are correlated to reducing inflammation and down-regulating NF-B.

RNA aptamers are of significant therapeutic and clinical interest because their activity can be easily reversed in vivo-a useful feature that is difficult to achieve using other therapeutic modalities. Despite their therapeutic promise, RNA aptamers are limited by their poor blood circulation. The attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to RNA aptamers addresses this limitation. However, an RNA aptamer-PEG conjugate that is a reversible anticoagulant failed in a clinical trial due to the reactivity of the conjugate with pre-existing PEG antibodies, leading to anaphylactoid responses, and has cast a pall over PEGylation of aptamers and other biologics, despite its long history of utility in drug delivery. Here, we eliminated PEG antibody-reactivity of this RNA aptamer by conjugating it to a next generation PEG-like brush polymer-poly[(oligoethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate)] (POEGMA). The conjugate retained the drug's therapeutic action and the ability to be easily reversed. Importantly, this conjugate does not bind pre-existing PEG antibodies that are prevalent in humans as measured in vitro and does not induce a humoral immune response against the polymer itself in mice. These findings suggest a path to rescuing the PEGylation of RNA therapeutics and vaccines from the deleterious side-effects of PEG. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS: Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan and Xishui Hospital, Hubei Province, China, up to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data were collected. The clinical course of survivors and non-survivors were compared. Risk factors for death were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 107 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical course of COVID-19 presented as a tri-phasic pattern. Week 1 after illness onset was characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and radiological multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates. In severe cases, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, and adult respiratory distress syndrome were observed. During week 2, in mild cases, fever, cough, and systemic symptoms began to resolve and platelet count rose to normal range, but lymphopenia persisted. In severe cases, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction were dominant. By week 3, mild cases had clinically resolved except for lymphopenia. However, severe cases showed persistent lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and death. Older age and male sex were independent risk factors for poor outcome of the illness. CONCLUSIONS: A period of 7C13 days after illness onset is the critical stage in the COVID-19 course.

The pharmacological activities of their major compounds were predicted using PASS (prediction of activity spectra for substances) and drug-likening properties by ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) through web-based online tools. Isocnidilide (40.1%) was identified as the major constituent of AGO along with -Selinene, Senkyunolide A, Phytyl acetate, and 3-Butylphthalide. AGO exhibited a superior antibacterial activity, and the strongest activity was detected against Gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans. Additionally, it exhibited a weaker antioxidant potential and stronger anti-inflammatory effects. PASS prediction supported the pharmacological finding, whereas ADMET revealed the safety of AGO. The molecular docking of isocnidilide was carried out for antibacterial (DNA gyrase), antioxidant (tyrosinase), and anti-inflammatory (cyclooxygenase-2) activities. The docking simulation results were involved hydrophilic interactions and demonstrated high binding affinity of isocnidilide for anti-inflammatory protein (cycloxygenase-2).

As of June 2021, nearly 174 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide have been reported to the World Health Organization. Rigorous data on the efficacy of corticosteroids have now established its role as standard of care (SOC). Less recognition has been given to corticosteroid therapy and its association with risk of infection especially in those who are critically ill and prone to nosocomial pathogens. Methods This is a retrospective study of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID - 19 from March 2020 to September 2020 at a single center. The primary endpoint for this study was description of microbiology and epidemiology of secondary infections and co -infections, defined as any infection following treatment for COVID - 19. Secondary endpoints included the duration of corticosteroid use, length of hospital stay, ICU length of stay, and mortality. Results Of the 104 patients, 73% had co-infections or secondary infections. Pre-SOC patients were more likely to receive >10 days of corticosteroids (71% vs 30%). Co-infections were present in 12% of patients (13% in pre-SOC vs 11% in post-SOC), secondary infections occurred in 61% of patients (74% in pre-SOC vs 53% in post-SOC). The most common causative organism of co-infections and secondary infections were Staphylococcus aureus in the pre-SOC group and Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the post-SOC group. The mean hospital length of stay was 43 days pre-SOC vs 33 days post-SOC with a mean ICU length of stay of 33 vs 29 days, respectively. Mortality rate was similar between the two groups (55% vs 58%). Conclusion Differences in epidemiology and microbiology was seen pre and post implementation of dexamethasone in June, 2020. Higher rates of co-infections were seen with this prolonged use of corticosteroids pre-SOC but it is unclear whether patients developed more co-infections as result of extended corticosteroid use, a longer hospital stay, or other factors. Further studies are needed to assess the optimal duration of corticosteroid use in this patient population with consideration to weigh benefit vs risk.

The molecular mechanism leading to melanoma metastasis is currently unclear. METHODS: With the goal of revealing the underlying mechanism, three data sets with accession numbers GSE8401, GSE46517 and GSE7956 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After identifying the differentially expressed gene (DEG) of primary melanoma and metastatic melanoma, three kinds of analyses were performed, namely functional annotation, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module construction, and co-expression and drug-gene interaction prediction analysis. RESULTS: A total of 41 up-regulated genes and 79 down-regulated genes was selected for subsequent analyses. Results of pathway enrichment analysis showed that extracellular matrix organization and proteoglycans in cancer are closely related to melanoma metastasis. In addition, seven pivotal genes were identified from PPI network, including CXCL8, THBS1, COL3A1, TIMP3, KIT, DCN, and IGFBP5, which have all been verified in the TCGA database and clinical specimens, but only CXCL8, THBS1 and KIT had significant differences in expression.

It is not enough to rely only on entrepreneurs to make enterprises stronger. In order to increase the creativity and environmental adaptability of enterprises, there need to be sufficient and excellent employees who are willing to work in the regions where enterprises are located. Therefore, enterprises need college students with innovation and creativity in their regions. In this study, graduates from a university in Zhejiang Province were selected as the subjects. Based on the Theory of Reasoned Action, literature analysis and interview method were combined to systematically construct a research model affecting college Students choice of entrepreneurship and employment. The questionnaire survey method and structural equation model (PLS-SEM) were used to test the hypothesis. A total of 798 valid questionnaires were collected. The results show that local attraction and family factors are the two most important factors affecting the entrepreneurship and employment of college students. Family factors have a significant positive impact on the attitude toward entrepreneurship and employment, subjective norms and intention to entrepreneurship and employment; local attraction also has a significant positive impact on the subjective norms, intention to entrepreneurship and employment, and attitude toward entrepreneurship and employment.

Representatives were selected based on theirparticipation in the Association of Faculties of Pharmacy of Canada Self-Care Therapeutics and Minor Ailments special interest group. Results Responses were received from all 10 pharmacy schools in Canada. Self-care education varies across Canadian pharmacy curricula, reflecting differences in scopes of practice across provinces, topics of interest and availability of space within curricula by the various faculties. Specifically, there was considerable variability in the number of hours devoted to self-care education, course content and methods for integration and teaching. Conclusions Results of this study may help inform and evolve self-care curricula across the country. We argue that strategies for enhancing current programs may include establishing a minimum number of core hours and topics, expanding natural health product content and curricular content oversight by a lead faculty member.

A control antigen of normal erythrocytes from the same donor horse was prepared in an identical manner. The ELISA and Western blot were validated by testing of sera from horses experimentally infected with B. caballi or B. equi or not infected with Babesia spp. ELISA and Western blot results were compared with those obtained by the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and complement fixation test (CFT). The sensitivity of the ELISA of 98.3% obtained for sera from day 14 after infection was superior to the Western blot (94.9%), the IFAT (96.6%) and the CFT (28.8%). No positive results were obtained in the ELISA and Western blot with 106 sera from horses not infected with Babesia spp. resulting in a calculated specificity of 100% for both tests. Cross reactions of B. equi-positive sera did occur to a larger extent in the ELISA (20%) than in the IFAT (4%). No cross reactions were observed with the Western blot and the CFT. The higher sensitivity of the ELISA was also demonstrated by testing of 132 field sera: more positive results were obtained by ELISA (112) as compared to IFAT (92) or CFT (41). The validity of these results was confirmed by testing of sera by Western blot. The ELISA as the most sensitive test provides the best method for the identification of carrier horses to prevent the introduction into non-endemic areas (export testing).

Suboptimal feeding practices lead to poorer health outcomes, such as obesity, that persist into adulthood. Although the importance of early life nutrition is well-established, there are no Australia-wide surveys of dietary intakes of children under two years of age. The 2021 Australian Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (OzFITS) aims to fill this gap. This paper describes the methods and study sample of OzFITS 2021. (2) Methods: OzFITS 2021 is a cross-sectional study of children aged 0 to 23.9 months of age and their caregiver across Australia. Data were collected between April 2020 and April 2021. A telephone-based survey was completed with a caregiver to obtain information on child and caregiver characteristics and feeding practices. For exclusively breastfed infants, the number of breastfeeds in a 24 h period was reported. Dietary intakes for mixed fed children were estimated using a one-day food record, with 30% of caregivers completing a second food record on a non-consecutive day. (3) Results: We enrolled 1140 caregiver and child dyads. Of those eligible to complete a food record, 853 (87%) completed the food record. Compared to the Australian population, caregivers were more likely to be university-educated (>75%), married or in a de facto relationship (94%), and have a household income >$100,000/y (60%). (4) Conclusions: OzFITS 2021 is the first national study to examine food and nutrient intake in Australian children aged under 2 years. The study will provide information on breastfeeding rates and duration, use of breast milk substitutes, and timing of solid food introduction. Dietary intake data will allow the comparison of core food groups and discretionary food intake to Australian guidelines and estimate the prevalence of inadequate intake of key nutrients, like iron. Healthcare practitioners and policymakers can use the study findings as a source of evidence to inform the next iteration of infant feeding guidelines.","output":"The Australian Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (OzFITS) 2021: Study Design, Methods and Sample Description"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECT Neuroophthalmological morbidity is commonly associated with large and giant cavernous and supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms. The authors sought to evaluate the neuroophthalmological outcomes after treatment of these aneurysms with the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED). METHODS The Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed Aneurysms (PUFS) trial was an international, multicenter prospective trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the PED. All patients underwent complete neuroophthalmological examinations both before the PED procedure and at a 6-month follow-up. All examinations were performed for the purpose of this study and according to study criteria. RESULTS In total, 108 patients were treated in the PUFS trial, 98 of whom had complete neuroophthalmological follow-up. Of the patients with complete follow-up, 39 (40%) presented with a neuroophthalmological baseline deficit that was presumed to be attributable to the aneurysm, and patients with these baseline deficits had significantly larger aneurysms. In 25 of these patients (64%), the baseline deficit showed at least some improvement 6 months after PED treatment, whereas in 1 patient (2.6%), the deficits only worsened. In 5 patients (5%), new deficits had developed at the 6-month follow-up, while in another 6 patients (6%), deficits that were not originally assumed to be related to the aneurysm had improved by that time. A history of diabetes was associated with failure of the baseline deficits to improve after the treatment. The aneurysm maximum diameter was significantly larger in patients with a new deficit or a worse baseline deficit at 6 months postprocedure. CONCLUSIONS Patients treated with the PED for large and giant ICA aneurysms had excellent neuroophthalmological outcomes 6 months after the procedure, with deficits improving in most of the patients, very few deficits worsening, and few new deficits developing.","output":"Neuroophthalmological outcomes associated with use of the Pipeline Embolization Device: analysis of the PUFS trial results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New influenza A viruses that emerge frequently elicit composite inflammatory responses to both infection and structural damage of alveolar-capillary barrier cells that hinders regeneration of respiratory function.

We aimed to identify factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks among staff and residents in LTCFs. Methods: We did a national cross-sectional survey of all LTCFs providing dementia care or care to adults aged 65 years or older in England between May 26 and June 19, 2020. The survey collected data from managers of eligible LTCFs on LTCF characteristics, staffing factors, the use of disease control measures, and the number of confirmed cases of infection among staff and residents in each LTCF. Survey responses were linked to individual-level SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results obtained through the national testing programme in England between April 30 and June 13, 2020. The primary outcome was the weighted period prevalence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents and staff reported via the survey. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with infection in staff and residents, an outbreak (defined as at least one case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a resident or staff member), and a large outbreak (defined as LTCFs with more than a third of the total number of residents and staff combined testing positive, or with >20 residents and staff combined testing positive) using data from the survey and from the linked survey-test dataset. Findings: 9081 eligible wLTCFs were identified, of which 5126 (564%) participated in the survey, providing data on 160a033 residents and 248a594 staff members. The weighted period prevalence of infection was 105% (95% CI 99-111) in residents and 38% (34-42) in staff members. 2724 (531%) LTCFs reported outbreaks, and 469 (91%) LTCFs reported large outbreaks. The odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 080 [95% CI 075-086], p<00001) and staff (070 [065-077], p<00001), and of large outbreaks (059 [038-093], p=0024) were significantly lower in LTCFs that paid staff statutory sick pay compared with those that did not. Each one unit increase in the staff-to-bed ratio was associated with a reduced odds of infection in residents (082 [078-087], p<00001) and staff (063 [059-068], p<00001. The odds of infection in residents (130 [123-137], p<00001) and staff (120 [113-129], p<00001), and of outbreaks (256 [194-349], p<00001) were significantly higher in LTCFs in which staff often or always cared for both infected or uninfected residents compared with those that cohorted staff with either infected or uninfected residents. Significantly increased odds of infection in residents (101 [101-101], p<00001) and staff (100 [100-101], p=00005), and of outbreaks (108 [105-110], p<00001) were associated with each one unit increase in the number of new admissions to the LTCF relative to baseline (March 1, 2020). The odds of infection in residents (119 [112-126], p<00001) and staff (119 [110-129], p<00001), and of large outbreaks (165 [107-254], p=0024) were significantly higher in LTCFs that were for profit versus those that were not for profit. Frequent employment of agency nurses or carers was associated with a significantly increased odds of infection in residents (aOR 165 [156-174], p<00001) and staff (185 [172-198], p<00001), and of outbreaks (233 [172-316], p<00001) and large outbreaks (242 [167-351], p<00001) compared with no employment of agency nurses or carers. Compared with LTCFs that did not report difficulties in isolating residents, those that did had significantly higher odds of infection in residents (133 [128-138], p<00001) and staff (148 [141-156], p<00001), and of outbreaks (184 [148-230], p<00001) and large outbreaks (162 [124-211], p=00004). Interpretation: Half of LTCFs had no cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first wave of the pandemic. Reduced transmission from staff is associated with adequate sick pay, minimal use of agency staff, an increased staff-to-bed ratio, and staff cohorting with either infected or uninfected residents. Increased transmission from residents is associated with an increased number of new admissions to the facility and poor compliance with isolation procedures.

The Downtown Eastside (DTES) neighborhood of Vancouver has high prevalence of mental illness, substance use, infectious disease and homelessness. While studies have described clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in other centres worldwide, data is lacking on marginalized groups. We describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients seen at two urban hospitals who care for the vulnerable population in the DTES of Vancouver, British Columbia (BC), Canada. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on all COVID-19 patients 19 years seen at either centre from January 1 to June 10, 2020. Descriptive statistics assessed demographics, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, laboratory values and outcomes, and were compared between subjects managed as inpatients (died vs. discharged) and outpatients. RESULTS: Of 71 COVID-19 subjects, mean age was 57y (SD 20); 36 (51%) were male. Time to presentation, symptoms and laboratory values were similar to other reports. 58 (82%) presented from the community, 3 (4%) from long-term care/rehabilitation centres, and 8 (11%) had no fixed address (NFA) or lived in the DTES. 45 (64%) had a known exposure, 20 (28%) were healthcare workers, 85% involved in direct patient care; 0/20 were admitted to hospital. Of the 8 NFA/DTES subjects, mean age was 46y (SD 13), 50% were male, 5 (63%) were admitted to hospital and all survived. Admitted subjects (n=34) were older (mean age 69 vs 46y, p< 0.001), 62% were male, and had more comorbidities (mean [SD] 3 [3] vs. 1 [2], p< 0.001). Eight (24%) died, 26 (76%) were discharged, 29% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 21% secondary infection, 18% renal failure, and 15% cardiac dysfunction.

Those wishing to assess 'life impact' face several challenges: First, various measurement instruments are available, including of global functioning, health-related quality of life and well-being. Existing reviews have tended to focus on one of these domains; consequently, a comprehensive overview is lacking. Second, the extent to which such instruments truly capture distinct concepts is unclear. Third, many available scales conflate symptoms and their impact, thus undermining much needed analyses of associations between the two. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A scoping umbrella review will examine existing reviews of life impact measures for use with children and youth aged 6-24 years in the context of mental health and well-being research. We will systematically search six bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the COSMIN database of systematic reviews of outcome measurement instruments), and conduct systematic record screening, data extraction and charting based on methodological guidance by the Joanna Briggs Institute.

This paper proposes a data processing method that divides the flow data into data flow segments so that the model can improve the throughput per unit time to meet its detection efficiency. For this kind of data, a malicious traffic detection model with a hierarchical attention mechanism is also proposed and named HAGRU (Hierarchical Attention Gated Recurrent Unit). By fusing the feature information of the three hierarchies, the detection ability of the model is improved. An attention mechanism is introduced to focus on malicious flows in the data flow segment, which can reasonably utilize limited computing resources. Finally, compare the proposed model with the current state of the method on the datasets. The experimental results show that: the novel model performs well in different evaluation indicators (detection rate, false-positive rate, F-score), and it can improve the performance of category recognition with fewer samples when the data is unbalanced. At the same time, the training of the novel model on larger datasets will enhance the generalization ability and reduce the false alarm rate. The proposed model not only improves the performance of malicious traffic detection but also provides a new research method for improving the efficiency of model detection.","output":"Malicious traffic detection combined deep neural network with hierarchical attention mechanism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: In the present study, the relationship between D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio (DFR) and in-hospital outcomes was evaluated in patients with COVID-19 and a diagnosis of heart failure (HF).

This study assessed the functionality and performance of an accessorized pre-filled syringe (APFS) and an autoinjector (AI) for administration of tezepelumab in the clinic and at home. METHODS: This phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study (PATH-HOME, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03968978) was conducted in patients aged 12C80 years with asthma that was uncontrolled despite treatment with medium- to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus at least one additional controller medication. Patients received six subcutaneous doses of tezepelumab 210 mg via APFS or AI. The first dose was administered by a healthcare professional, and patients or caregivers administered subsequent doses. First, second, third and final doses were administered in the clinic; fourth and fifth doses were administered at home. The primary endpoint was the proportion of successful administrations of tezepelumab. Secondary endpoints included the functionality and performance of the devices, Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-6 score, pharmacokinetics and safety. RESULTS: Overall, 216 patients were randomized (APFS, n=111; AI, n=105). Tezepelumab was successfully administered via APFS by 91.7% of the participants (100/109) and via AI by 92.4% (97/105). Overall, 95.4C97.1% of at-home administrations were successful across device groups. Malfunction occurred in 6 of 655 dispensed APFSs and 5 of 624 dispensed AIs.

Preventing the spread of such diseases prioritizes the development of sensing devices that can rapidly, selectively, and reliably detect pathogens at minimal cost. Paper-based analytical devices (PADs) are promising tools that satisfy those criteria. Numerous paper-based biosensors have been established that rival conventional pathogen detection methods. Among them, colorimetric strategies are promising since results can be interpreted by eye, and are simple to operate, which is advantageous for point-of-care testing (POCT). Particularly, the application of nanomaterials on paper-based biosensors has become important as these materials are capable of converting signals from pathogens through unique mechanisms to yield an amplified colorimetric readout. To highlight the research progress on using nanomaterials in colorimetric paper-based biosensor for pathogen detection, we discuss the sensing mechanisms of how they work, structural and analytical characteristics of the devices, and representative recent applications.

In this review of methods, we aimed to: (i) classify and describe different complex systems methods in evaluation applied to public health; and (ii) examine the kinds of evaluative evidence generated by these different methods. METHODS We adapted critical review methods to identify evaluations of public health interventions that used systems methods. We conducted expert consultation, searched electronic databases (Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science), and followed citations of relevant systematic reviews. Evaluations were included if they self-identified as using systems- or complexity-informed methods and if they evaluated existing or hypothetical public health interventions. Case studies were selected to illustrate different types of complex systems evaluation. FINDINGS Seventy-four unique studies met our inclusion criteria. A framework was developed to map the included studies onto different stages of the evaluation process, which parallels the planning, delivery, assessment, and further delivery phases of the interventions they seek to inform; these stages include: 1) theorising; 2) prediction (simulation); 3) process evaluation; 4) impact evaluation; and 5) further prediction (simulation). Within this framework, we broadly categorised methodological approaches as mapping, modelling, network analysis and 'system framing' (the application of a complex systems perspective to a range of study designs). Studies frequently applied more than one type of systems method. CONCLUSIONS A range of complex systems methods can be utilised, adapted, or combined to produce different types of evaluative evidence. Further methodological innovation in systems evaluation may generate stronger evidence to improve health and reduce health inequalities in our complex world.","output":"Evaluation of public health interventions from a complex systems perspective: A research methods review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE As video chatting has emerged as a leading form of communication for work, education, and socialization during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to investigate the association between video chatting and appearance satisfaction.

RESULTS The total time spent on video chatting services was not associated with appearance satisfaction; however, self-objectification moderated the relationship between total hours of video chatting and appearance satisfaction. In addition, participants who engaged in more video chatting appearance comparisons reported lower face and body satisfaction. Furthermore, video chatting appearance comparison was associated with more frequent usage of certain Zoom features, such as the \\"touch up my appearance\\" feature, and more time spent looking at oneself on video calls. Finally, those who spent more time engaged with their families over video chatting services reported greater face and body satisfaction.

To achieve steep emission reductions, the world would have to either decouple global GHG emissions from gross domestic product (GDP) at an unprecedented pace or face deep cuts to GDP. The so-called green growth literature is optimistic that suitable policies and technology can enable such fast decoupling, while degrowth proponents dismiss this and argue that the global economy must be scaled down, and that systemic change and redistribution is necessary to accomplish this. We use the so-called Kaya identity to offer a simple quantitative assessment of the gap between the historic performance in reducing the emission intensity of GDP and what is required for green growth, i.e., the basis of ongoing disagreement.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe and assess the impact of a rapidly scaled virtual urgent care platform during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients who presented to a virtual urgent care platform over 1 month during the COVID-19 pandemic surge. We described scaling our telemedicine urgent care capacity, described patient clinical characteristics, assessed for emergency department (ED) referrals, and analyzed postvisit surveys. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 17,730 patients were seen via virtual urgent care; 454 (2.56%) were referred to an ED. The most frequent diagnoses were COVID-19 related or upper respiratory symptoms. Geospatial analysis indicated a wide catchment area. There were 251 providers onboarded to the platform; at peak, 62 providers supplied 364 h of coverage in 1 day. The average patient satisfaction score was 4.4/5. There were 2668 patients (15.05%) who responded to the postvisit survey; 1236 (49.35%) would have sought care in an ED (11.86%) or in-person urgent care (37.49%). CONCLUSIONS: A virtual urgent care platform was scaled to manage a volume of more than 800 patients a day across a large catchment area during the pandemic surge.

This paper analyses the impact of Covid-19 on various cyber-security related aspects and sketches out the timeline of Covid-19 themed cyber-attacks launched globally to identify the modus operandi of the attackers and the impact of attacks. It also offers a thoroughly researched set of mitigation strategies which can be employed to prevent the attacks in the first place. Moreover, this manuscript proposes a fuzzy logic and data mining-based intelligence system for detecting Covid-19 themed malicious URL/phishing attacks. The performance of the system has been evaluated against various malicious/phishing URLs, and it was observed that the proposed system is a viable solution to this problem.","output":"Detecting Covid-19 Chaos Driven Phishing/Malicious URL Attacks by a Fuzzy Logic and Data Mining based Intelligence System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing high-performance electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for sustainable hydrogen production, yet still challenging.

Standard point of care capillary glucose testing (POCT) is commonly used in hospitalized patients to monitor their glucose levels. The goal of this study was to examine the relationships between the glucose readings obtained by a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) (Freestyle Libre) and the capillary blood glucose results obtained by the inpatient glucose POCT meter (Accuchek Inform II) as well as between CGMS readings and the serum glucose values obtained by the hospital laboratory. Study participants had either primary or secondary diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and were admitted to non-critical units. We hypothesized that there exists an acceptable agreement between the capillary blood glucose results obtained by the inpatient glucose POCT meter (Accuchek Inform II) and the readings obtained by the CGMS (Freestyle Libre); and that there exists an acceptable agreement between the serum glucose levels and the glucose values obtained by the CGMS. METHODS: This was an Institutional Review Board approved prospective cohort study for the nonC critical inpatient setting. Fifty-two hospitalized patients with diabetes were recruited. After informed consent was obtained, patients were instructed on the application and use of the CGMS. The data were assessed using a standard regression analysis and modified Bland Altman analysis. All analyses were conducted using SAS, release 3.8 Enterprise Edition (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). RESULTS: Fifty-two subjects recruited into the study represented a sample of convenience. There were a total of 467 AccuChek-Libre pairs, The regression analysis showed a negative bias between. Libre and AccuChek, R(2) = 0.83, with Libre glucose readings on average being lower than those of AccuChek. Using Bland-Altman analysis, 42% of the 467 Libre-AccuChek pairs had a difference in glucose reading more than 15%. Mean absolute relative difference (MARD) between Libre and AccuChek was 15.6%; mean relative difference (MRD) between Libre and AccuChek was ?11.4%. The regression analysis showed a negative bias between Libre and serum glucose, R(2) = 0.89. Using Bland Altman analysis, 36% of the 44 Libre-serum pairs had a difference in glucose reading more than 15%. Mean absolute relative difference (MARD) between Libre and serum glucose was 13.2%; mean relative difference (MRD) between Libre and serum glucose was ?12.5%. A review of the data pairs showed that 71/467 Accuchek-Libre pairs had one result that was either below 70 mg/dl or above 200 mg/dl (combined American Diabetes Association-ADA-, American College of Physicians-ACP- and American College of Endocrinology-AACE- goals). Thus 85%, of these pairs would have yielded results that engendered the same intervention (e.g. treatment for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia). Likewise 5/45 Serum-Libre pairs had one result that was either below 70 mg/dl or above 200 mg/dl; thus 89% of these pairs would have yielded results requiring the same intervention. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: These findings confirm the existent literature and indicate acceptable agreement between the standard POCT and the CGMS as well as between serum glucose and the CGMS values. Because of the advantages of the CGMS over capillary blood glucose testing (reduced patient discomfort and reduced staff exposure to patients in isolation) CGMS use may be preferable to the current bedside capillary blood glucose testing in hospitalized patients with diabetes mellitus. As with other laboratory measures, clinical judgement needs to be exercised when the laboratory values are used to guide patient care.","output":"Reliability of continuous glucose monitoring system in the inpatient setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world's fragmented response to the COVID-19 pandemic created fertile ground for mixed messages and inconsistency.

Scientific approaches like LCA presents obstacles and opportunities to non-specialists, including designers. The self-preservation instinct is typically hardwired into each individual. This genetic predisposition to avoid certain risks that loom large in our consciousness both safeguards the continuation of our species and blinds us to less visible and possibly much greater threats. Media outlets play to the natural human reliance on heuristics and implicit biases. The confusion a post-fact world creates serves to maintain the status quo by perpetually calling into question well-established facts and stalling fruitful debate. Spectacular headlines provoke irrational fears that distract from other, more statistically likely threats. Rhetorical techniques frame facts. Denialism is intended to create paralysis. More information is not necessarily better, if it is derived from sources that only confirm sociopolitical biases rather than challenging them. It is important to acknowledge contextual headwinds operating at the largest scales in society before blithely applying a targeted set of analytical techniques to measure environmental impacts in a design project. Before presenting the how-to of integrating a data-driven approach to sustainable design decisions, however, it is important to recognize that facts in one domain are not always enough to persuade a decision-maker.

Since abnormalities in Pi metabolism are risk factors for various diseases, serum Pi levels are strictly controlled. Type-III sodium-dependent Pi transporters, PiT-1 (encoded by SLC20A1) and PiT-2 (encoded by SLC20A2), are distributed throughout the tissues of the body, including the central nervous system, and are known to be responsible for extracellular to intracellular Pi transport. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a major growth factor of mesenchymal cells. PDGF-BB, a homodimer of PDGF-B, regulates intracellular Pi by increasing PiT-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the effects of PDGF-BB on Pi transporters in neurons have yet to be reported. Here, we investigated the effect of PDGF-BB on Pi transporters in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. PDGF-BB did not induce SLC20A1 mRNA expression, but it increased the intracellular uptake of Pi via PiT-1 in SH-SY5Y cells. Among the signaling pathways associated with PDGF-BB, AKT signaling was shown to be involved in the increase in Pi transport. In addition, the PDGF-BB-induced increase in Pi mediated neuroprotective effects in SLC20A2-suppressed cells, in an in vitro model of the pathological condition found in idiopathic basal ganglia calcification. Moreover, the increase in Pi uptake was found to occur through promotion of intracellular PiT-1 translocation to the plasma membrane. Overall, these results indicate that PDGF-BB exerts neuroprotective effects via Pi transport, and they demonstrate the potential utility of PDGF-BB against abnormal Pi metabolism in neurons.","output":"PDGF-BB is involved in phosphate regulation via the phosphate transporters in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) In Wuhan, China, the disease was first identified in December 2019 and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic Several countries across the world are facing a shortage in frontline providers, while pharmacists are asked to cut working hours during this pandemic fight Pharmacists as healthcare professionals could contribute in many aspects as responders to this pandemic worldwide if they had expanded education, training, and scope of practice","output":"The Pharmacist's Missing Role in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) national plan aims to reduce annual HIV incidence in the United States from 38,000 in 2015 to 9,300 by 2025 and 3,300 by 2030. Diagnosis and treatment are two most effective interventions, and thus, identifying corresponding optimal combinations of testing and retention-in-care rates would help inform implementation of relevant programs. Considering the dynamic and stochastic complexity of the disease and the time dynamics of decision-making, solving for optimal combinations using commonly used methods of parametric optimization or exhaustive evaluation of pre-selected options are infeasible. Reinforcement learning (RL), an artificial intelligence method, is ideal; however, training RL algorithms and ensuring convergence to optimality are computationally challenging for large-scale stochastic problems. We evaluate its feasibility in the context of the EHE goal. We trained an RL algorithm to identify a sequence of combinations of HIV-testing and retention-in-care rates at 5-year intervals over 2015C2070 that optimally leads towards HIV elimination. We defined optimality as a sequence that maximizes quality-adjusted-life-years lived and minimizes HIV-testing and care-and-treatment costs. We show that solving for testing and retention-in-care rates through appropriate reformulation using proxy decision-metrics overcomes the computational challenges of RL. We used a stochastic agent-based simulation to train the RL algorithm. As there is variability in support-programs needed to address barriers to care-access, we evaluated the sensitivity of optimal decisions to three cost-functions. The model suggests to scale-up retention-in-care programs to achieve and maintain high annual retention-rates while initiating with a high testing-frequency but relaxing it over a 10-year period as incidence decreases. Results were mainly robust to the uncertainty in costs. However, testing and retention-in-care alone did not achieve the 2030 EHE targets, suggesting the need for additional interventions. The results from the model demonstrated convergence.

Here, we describe clinical, laboratory, and histological findings of two pediatric cases with almost exclusive kidney involvement by SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A 10-year-old girl with IgA vasculitis nephritis underwent kidney biopsy, showing diffuse and segmental mesangial-proliferative glomerulonephritis, and steroid therapy was initiated. After the worsening of the clinical picture, including an atypical skin rash, she was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. The re-evaluation of initial biopsy showed cytoplasmatic blebs and virus-like particles in tubular cells at electron microscopy. Despite SARS-CoV-2 clearance and the intensification of immunosuppression, no improvement was observed. A second kidney biopsy showed a crescentic glomerulonephritis with sclerosis, while virus-like particles were no longer evident. The second patient was a 12-year-old girl with a 3-week history of weakness and weight loss. Rhinitis was reported the month before. No medications were being taken. Blood and urine analysis revealed elevated serum creatinine, hypouricemia, low molecular weight proteinuria, and glycosuria. A high SARS-CoV-2-IgG titre was detected. Kidney biopsy showed acute tubular-interstitial nephritis. Steroid therapy was started with a complete resolution of kidney involvement. CONCLUSION: We can speculate that in both cases SARS-CoV-2 played a major role as inflammatory trigger of the kidney damage. Therefore, we suggest investigating the potential kidney damage by SARS-CoV-2 in children.

METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective review of data from consecutive patients with fusiform vertebrobasilar artery aneurysms treated with the PED. RESULTS This review resulted in the identification of 12 such patients (mean [ SD] age 55.1  14.1 years). Eleven patients had symptoms; 1 had a dissecting aneurysm identified on imaging for neck pain. The average aneurysm size was 13.25  4.5 mm. None of the aneurysms were ruptured or previously treated. The average clinical follow-up duration was 22.1  10.7 months and radiological follow-up was 14.5  11.1 months from the index PED treatment. One patient suffered a perforator stroke and had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 4 at last follow-up. Another patient had a retained stent pusher requiring retrieval via surgical cut-down but recovered to an mRS score of 0 at last follow-up. Eleven (91.7%) of 12 patients recovered to an mRS score of 0 or 1. Two patients had aneurysmal remnants at 7 and 10 months, respectively, after the index PED, which were retreated with PEDs.

The degree of hypercoagulability appears to correlate with outcomes; however, optimal criteria to assess for the highest-risk patients for thrombotic events remain unclear; we hypothesized that deranged thromboelastography measurements of coagulation would correlate with thromboembolic events. STUDY DESIGN: Patients admitted to an ICU with COVID-19 diagnoses who had thromboelastography analyses performed were studied. Conventional coagulation assays, d-dimer levels, and viscoelastic measurements were analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic curve to predict thromboembolic outcomes and new-onset renal failure. RESULTS: Forty-four patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Derangements in coagulation laboratory values, including elevated d-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time, were confirmed; viscoelastic measurements showed an elevated maximum amplitude and low lysis of clot at 30 minutes. A complete lack of lysis of clot at 30 minutes was seen in 57% of patients and predicted venous thromboembolic events with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.742 (p = 0.021). A d-dimer cutoff of 2,600 ng/mL predicted need for dialysis with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.779 (p = 0.005). Overall, patients with no lysis of clot at 30 minutes and a d-dimer > 2,600 ng/mL had a venous thromboembolic event rate of 50% compared with 0% for patients with neither risk factor (p = 0.008), and had a hemodialysis rate of 80% compared with 14% (p = 0.004).

Although enveloped viruses of different major groups vary in size and shape, as well as in the molecular weight of their structural polypeptides, there are general similarities in the types of polypeptide components present in virions. The types of structural components found in viral membranes are summarized briefly in the chapter. All the enveloped viruses studied to date possess one or more glycoprotein species and lipid as a major structural component. The presence of carbohydrate covalently linked to proteins is demonstrated by the incorporation of a radioactive precursor, such as glucosamine or fucose, into viral polypeptides, which is resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Enveloped viruses share many common features in the organization of their structural components, as indicated by several approaches, including electron microscopy, surface-labeling, and proteolytic digestion experiments, and the isolation of subviral components. The chapter summarizes the detailed structure of the glycoproteins of four virus groups: (1) influenza virus glycoproteins, (2) rhabdovirus G protein, (3) togavirus glycoprotein, and (4) paramyxovirus glycoproteins The information obtained includes the size and shape of viral glycoproteins, the number of polypeptide chains in the complete glycoprotein structure, and compositional data on the polypeptide and oligosaccharide portions of the molecules.","output":"Membrane Glycoproteins of Enveloped Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the announcement by the World Health Organization (WHO) of an outbreak of a contagious respiratory viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (later named as COVID-19), several research works have been carried out to unstitch the therapeutic options and combat the disease using various aproaches and modalities. These works are currently at different clinical trial stages, and their results may be determined by the outcome of the ongoing trial process. There is the need for a collection of information regarding the availlable therapeutic options related to COVID-19. this article therefore reviewed emerging and re-emerging therapeutic compounds/drugs used in COVID-19 management and reports of clinical trials, with the view to summarize and highlight their prospect and possible adverse effects to allow more extensive choice by clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. The approach used involved retrieval of related collections found in selected repositories including, Medline, Scopus, PubMed, and Google scholar. Only experimental or clinical studies were included. Out of the 39 materials retrieved, 26 (66.67%) studies were based on clinical trials, 12 (30.77%) were classified as in vitro studies, and only one (2.56%) involved experimental animal study. Of the agents evaluated for COVID-19 therapeutics, 15 (38.46%) were anti-viral, four (10.26%) antimalarial, four studies were immunotherapeutics (10.26%), two studies (5.13%) were antibacterial, while, one (2.56%) study wasfor antiparasitic , anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral/antimalarial, and anti-viral/herbal combination for each. Also, eight studies (20.51%) were antibiotic/antimalarial.. This review indicates that there is both a race and quest in the test of antiviral agents against COVID-19 and that arbidol seems to have dominated in the studies analyzed. The use of anticoagulants and antibiotics, such as teicoplanin and azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine were reported to also play a leading role in the management of the disease. Likewise, dexamethasone has been recently claimed to be effective in patients in need of respiratory assistance. Based on unresolved controversies and inconclusive findings, it could be said that generally, a single and specific therapeutics to COVID-19 is still a mirage. There is, thus, an urgent need to test more potent compounds and agents to establish much safer and highly efficacious drugs/agents for the disease, even as we continue to learn more about the disease as well as the characteristic of the virus.","output":"Therapeutic options for COVID-19: a quick review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We provide here an updated analysis on efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses in older people (i.e., aged  80 years) based on ongoing Italian nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign.

Methods: Retrospective electronic health record (EHR) review of all COVID-19 surveillance data among children aged 0C19 years seeking healthcare at one pediatric healthcare system that serves predominantly Medicaid-dependent families from 1 March 2020 to 31 March 2021. COVID-19 infection status (Y/N), hospital admission (Y/N), and ICU admission (Y/N) are the main outcomes. Results: Of 22,377 children aged  19 years tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 2020CMarch 2021, 3126 were positive (14.0%), and out of those positive, 53.7% were hospitalized and 2.9% were admitted to the ICU.

The COVID-19 pandemic has extended its impact to Saudi Arabia. By mid-February 2021, The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has reported more than 373,000 COVID-19 cases impacting different population categories (i.e., male, female, different age groups, comorbidities status). The objective of this nationwide study was to describe and explore the characteristics of hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Methods This study was an observational epidemiological study based on collected clinical data from ten health institutions across all regions in Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted during the period from March 2nd, 2020, to January 31st, 2021. The data were collected included demographics, medical information, medications, and laboratory and diagnostic. More detailed information on usually missing factors such as smoking status, comorbidities, length of hospital stay were also collected. Both descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted using the statistical analysis software SAS? version 9.4. Results During the study period, 5286 patients were included in this study. Of these, (79.15%) were male. Of all 5286 patients, quite a high number of the studied population 2010 (38.02%) were smokers. The majority of the patients 3436 (65%) were reported to have comorbidities, with hypertension being the most common disease 1725 (32.6%),followed by diabetes 1641(31.04%). A high proportion of the patients, 2220 patients (41.99%), were admitted to the intensive care unit;of these, (33.52%) were on mechanical ventilation. Most patients received anticoagulant prophylaxis medications (n=4414, 83.5%). All patients were given more than one antibiotic prophylaxis. Overall, the median hospital stay was 5.5 days, and the median length in the intensive care unit was 4.26 days. Around (89.14%) of patients were discharged from the hospital, and (10.8%) died. Conclusion In this real-world study utilizing a large sample size, this study provides confirmatory results on the COVID-19 patients characteristics that are similar to other populations.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine dietary adherence among diabetes type 2 patients aimed at coronavirus pandemic and its associated factors. METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among type 2 diabetes patients on follow-up. Systematic random sampling was employed to get representative study participants. Dietary adherence was dichotomized and with logistic regression analysis to assess the association between dependent and explanatory variables. The degree of association was interpreted by using both crude odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In this study, 576 participants took part with a 99.3% response rate. The dietary adherence was found to be 48.3% with [95% CI (44.1C52.4)].

We then analyze how system congestion increases mortality in municipalities that are far from the ICU through a differences-in-differences regression model.Findings: We find that COVID-19 mortality is up to 60% higher in the average municipality - which is 15 minutes driving away from the closest ICU - than in a municipality with an ICU in town. This difference is larger in areas and in days characterized by an abnormal number of calls to the emergency line.Interpretation: We interpret these results as suggesting that a sudden surge of critical patients may have congested the healthcare system, forcing emergency medical services to prioritize patients in the most proximate communities in order to maximize the number of lives saved. Through some back-of-the-envelope calculations, we estimate that Lombardy's death toll from the first COVID-19 outbreak could have been 25% lower had all municipalities had ready access to the ICU.

To analyze a comprehensive set of articles published in peer-reviewed journals assessing funding sources and support for or opposition to substitution of tobacco or nicotine products as harm reduction. Search Methods. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO with a comprehensive search string including all articles, comments, and editorials published between January 1, 1992, and July 26, 2016. Selection Criteria. We included English-language publications published in peer-reviewed journals addressing THR in humans and excluded studies on modified cigarettes, on South Asian smokeless tobacco variants, on pregnant women, on animals, not mentioning a tobacco or nicotine product, on US Food and Drug Administration-approved nicotine replacement therapies, and on nicotine vaccines. Data Collection and Analysis. We double-coded all articles for article type; primary product type (e.g., snus, e-cigarettes); themes for and against THR; stance on THR; THR concepts; funding or affiliation with tobacco, e-cigarette, pharmaceutical industry, or multiple industries; and each author's country. We fit exact logistic regression models with stance on THR as the outcome (pro- vs anti-THR) and source of funding or industry affiliation as the predictor taking into account sparse data. Additional models included article type as the outcome (nonempirical or empirical) and industry funding or affiliation as predictor, and stratified analyses for empirical and nonempirical studies with stance on THR as outcome and funding source as predictor. Main Results. Searches retrieved 826 articles, including nonempirical articles (21%), letters or commentaries (34%), editorials (5%), cross-sectional studies (15%), systematic reviews and meta-analyses (3%), and randomized controlled trials (2%). Overall, 23.9% disclosed support by industry; 49% of articles endorsed THR, 42% opposed it, and 9% took neutral or mixed positions. Support from the e-cigarette industry (odds ratio [OR] = 20.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.3, 180.7), tobacco industry (OR = 59.4; 95% CI = 10.1, +infinity), or pharmaceutical industry (OR = 2.18; 95% CI = 1.3, 3.7) was significantly associated with supportive stance on THR in analyses accounting for sparse data. Authors' Conclusions. Non-industry-funded articles were evenly divided in stance, while industry-funded articles favored THR. Because of their quantity, letters and comments may influence perceptions of THR when empirical studies lack consensus. Public Health Implications. Public health practitioners and researchers need to account for industry funding when interpreting the evidence in THR debates.","output":"Financial Conflicts of Interest and Stance on Tobacco Harm Reduction: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging pandemic challenge.

Consequently, different challenges arise regarding the prediction of hospital needs, optimization of resources, diagnostic triage tools and patient evolution, as well as tools that allow us to analyze which are the factors that determine the severity of patients. Currently, it is widely accepted that one of the problems since the pandemic appeared was to detect (i) who patients were about to need Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and (ii) who ones were about not overcome the disease. These critical patients collapsed Hospitals to the point that many surgeries around the world had to be cancelled. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a Machine Learning (ML) model that helps us to prevent when a patient is about to be critical. Although we are in the era of data, regarding the SARS-COV-2 patients, there are currently few tools and solutions that help medical professionals to predict the evolution of patients in order to improve their treatment and the needs of critical resources at hospitals. Moreover, most of these tools have been created from small populations and/or Chinese populations, which carries a high risk of bias. In this paper, we present a model, based on ML techniques, based on 5378 Spanish patients data from which a quality cohort of 1201 was extracted to train the model. Our model is capable of predicting the probability of death of patients with SARS-COV-2 based on age, sex and comorbidities of the patient. It also allows what-if analysis, with the inclusion of comorbidities that the patient may develop during the SARS-COV-2 infection. For the training of the model, we have followed an agnostic approach. We explored all the active comorbidities during the SARS-COV-2 infection of the patients with the objective that the model weights the effect of each comorbidity on the patients evolution according to the data available. The model has been validated by using stratified cross-validation with k = 5 to prevent class imbalance. We obtained robust results, presenting a high hit rate, with 84.16% accuracy, 83.33% sensitivity, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.871. The main advantage of our model, in addition to its high success rate, is that it can be used with medical records in order to predict their diagnosis, allowing the critical population to be identified in advance. Furthermore, it uses the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD 9-CM) standard. In this sense, we should also emphasize that those hospitals using other encodings can add an intermediate layer business to business (B2B) with the aim of making transformations to the same international format.","output":"Machine learning model from a Spanish cohort for prediction of SARS-COV-2 mortality risk and critical patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organotypic skin tissue models have decades of use for basic research applications, the treatment of burns, and for efficacy/safety evaluation studies. The complex and heterogeneous nature of native human skin however creates difficulties for the construction of physiologically comparable organotypic models. Within the present study, we utilized bioprinting technology for the controlled deposition of separate keratinocyte subpopulations to create a reconstructed epidermis with two distinct halves in a single insert, each comprised of a different keratinocyte sub-population, in order to better model heterogonous skin and reduce inter-sample variability. As an initial proof-of-concept, we created a patterned epidermal skin model using GPF positive and negative keratinocyte subpopulations, both printed into 2 halves of a reconstructed skin insert, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. We then demonstrated the physiological relevance of this bioprinting technique by generating a heterogeneous model comprised of dual keratinocyte population with either normal or low filaggrin expression. The resultant model exhibited a well-organized epidermal structure with each half possessing the phenotypic characteristics of its constituent cells, indicative of a successful and stable tissue reconstruction. This patterned skin model aims to mimic the edge of lesions as seen in atopic dermatitis or ichthyosis vulgaris, while the use of two populations within a single insert allows for paired statistics in evaluation studies, likely increasing study statistical power and reducing the number of models required per study. This is the first report of human patterned epidermal model using a predefined bioprinted designs, and demonstrates the relevance of bioprinting to faithfully reproduce human skin microanatomy.","output":"Utilization of patterned bioprinting for heterogeneous and physiologically representative reconstructed epidermal skin models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A growing number of studies indicate that mRNAs and long ncRNAs can affect protein populations by assembling dynamic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules. These phase-separated molecular sponges, stabilized by quinary (transient and weak) interactions, control proteins involved in numerous biological functions. Retroviruses such as HIV-1 form by self-assembly when their genomic RNA (gRNA) traps Gag and GagPol polyprotein precursors. Infectivity requires extracellular budding of the particle followed by maturation, an ordered processing of 2400 Gag and 120 GagPol by the viral protease (PR). This leads to a condensed gRNA-NCp7 nucleocapsid and a CAp24-self-assembled capsid surrounding the RNP. The choreography by which all of these components dynamically interact during virus maturation is one of the missing milestones to fully depict the HIV life cycle. Here, we describe how HIV-1 has evolved a dynamic RNP granule with successive weakCstrongCmoderate quinary NC-gRNA networks during the sequential processing of the GagNC domain. We also reveal two palindromic RNA-binding triads on NC, KxxFxxQ and QxxFxxK, that provide quinary NC-gRNA interactions. Consequently, the nucleocapsid complex appears properly aggregated for capsid reassembly and reverse transcription, mandatory processes for viral infectivity. We show that PR is sequestered within this RNP and drives its maturation/condensation within minutes, this process being most effective at the end of budding. We anticipate such findings will stimulate further investigations of quinary interactions and emergent mechanisms in crowded environments throughout the wide and growing array of RNP granules.","output":"The HIV-1 Nucleocapsid Regulates Its Own Condensation by Phase-Separated Activity-Enhancing Sequestration of the Viral Protease during Maturation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Confirmation of COVID-19 infection is still challenging in Cameroon due to lack of sufficient RT-PCR tests and screening capacity International organizations as well as philanthropic donators initially provided these tests Due to limited kits availability, mass screening is currently a luxury that the country cannot afford This impacts on estimates of disease prevalence, on the understanding of its burden and delays the implementation of targeted preventive measures Besides RT-PCR, chest CT-scan could be a useful tool for screening purposes However, its sensitivity and cost make its integration in management algorithms difficult We discuss below the challenges and potential solutions that could ease the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in Cameroon","output":"The challenge of COVID-19 case identification and ascertainment in sub-Saharan Africa: the case of Cameroon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 has transformed medical education worldwide.

However, little is known about their roles in the bovine lactation process. RESULTS To identify and characterize the roles of lncRNAs in bovine lactation, high throughput RNA sequencing data from Jersey (high milk yield producer), and Kashmiri cattle (low milk yield producer) were utilized. Transcriptome data from three Kashmiri and three Jersey cattle throughout their lactation stages were utilized for differential expression analysis. At each stage (early, mid and late) three samples were taken from each breed. A total of 45 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified between the three stages of lactation. The differentially expressed lncRNAs were found co-expressed with genes involved in the milk synthesis processes such as GPAM, LPL, and ABCG2 indicating their potential regulatory effects on milk quality genes. KEGG pathways analysis of potential cis and trans target genes of differentially expressed lncRNAs indicated that 27 and 48 pathways were significantly enriched between the three stages of lactation in Kashmiri and Jersey respectively, including mTOR signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, and RAP1 signaling pathways. These pathways are known to play key roles in lactation biology and mammary gland development.

The financial costs associated with data breaches are also growing. The costs associated with a data breach may divert resources away from patient care, thus negatively affecting hospital productivity. OBJECTIVE: After a data breach, the resulting regulatory enforcement and remediation are a shock to a hospitals patient care delivery. Exploiting this shock, this study aimed to investigate the association between hospital data breaches and productivity by using a generalized difference-in-differences model with multiple prebreach and postbreach periods. METHODS: The study analyzed the hospital financial data of the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development from 2012 to 2016. The study sample was an unbalanced panel of hospitals with 2610 unique hospital-year observations, including general acute care hospitals. California hospital data were merged with breach data published by the US Department of Health and Human Services. The dependent variable was hospital productivity measured as value added. The difference-in-differences model was estimated using fixed effects regression. RESULTS: Hospital productivity did not significantly differ from the baseline for 3 years after a breach. Data breaches were not significantly associated with a reduction in hospital productivity. Before a breach, the productivity of hospitals that experienced a data breach maintained a parallel trend with control hospitals.

The following key words were searched in several databases: Berberine combined with photodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy (SDT), ultraviolet, reactive oxygen and singlet oxygen. The results demonstrated that both type I and type II reactions participated in the photodynamic progression of BBR derivatives. In addition, the photochemical characteristics of BBR derivatives were affected by the polarity, pH and O(2) content of solvents. DNA binding increases the lifespan of the photoexcited BBR state and generation of singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)). The chemical properties of substituents in different positions of the BBR skeleton are pivotal for its photochemical properties, particularly the methylenedioxy group at the C-2 and C-3 positions. BBR is a promising agent for mediating both PDT- and SDT-treated diseases, particularly in tumors. However, further studies are required to validate their biological effects. In addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects of BBR-PDT remain unclear and warrant further investigation.

To reveal further the characteristics of the virus and to provide insight about the molecular mechanism of SARS etiology, a proteomic strategy was utilized to identify the structural proteins of SARS coronavirus (SARS\\\\CoV) isolated from Vero E6 cells infected with the BJ\\\\01 strain of the virus. At first, Western blotting with the convalescent sera from SARS patients demonstrated that there were various structural proteins of SARS\\\\CoV in the cultured supernatant of virus infected\\\\Vero E6 cells and that nucleocaspid (N) protein had a prominent immunogenicity to the convalescent sera from the patients with SARS, while the immune response of spike (S) protein probably binding with membrane (M) glycoprotein was much weaker. Then, sodium dodecyl sulfate\\\\polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\\\\PAGE) was used to separate the complex protein constituents, and the strategy of continuous slicing from loading well to the bottom of the gels was utilized to search thoroughly the structural proteins of the virus. The proteins in sliced slots were trypsinized in\\\\gel and identified by mass spectrometry. Three structural proteins named S, N and M proteins of SARS\\\\CoV were uncovered with the sequence coverage of 38.9, 93.1 and 28.1% respectively. Glycosylation modification in S protein was also analyzed and four glycosylation sites were discovered by comparing the mass spectra before and after deglycosylation of the peptides with PNGase F digestion. Matrix\\\\assisted laser desorption/ionization\\\\mass spectrometry determination showed that relative molecular weight of intact N protein is 45 929 Da, which is very close to its theoretically calculated molecular weight 45 935 Da based on the amino acid sequence deduced from the genome with the first amino acid methionine at the N\\\\terminus depleted and second, serine, acetylated, indicating that phosphorylation does not happen at all in the predicted phosphorylation sites within infected cells nor in virus particles. Intriguingly, a series of shorter isoforms of N protein was observed by SDS\\\\PAGE and identified by mass spectrometry characterization. For further confirmation of this phenomenon and its related mechanism, recombinant N protein of SARS\\\\CoV was cleaved in vitro by caspase\\\\3 and \\\\6 respectively.

To overcome such barriers and enable greater access to basic and specialist care, developments in information and communication technologies are being applied. The focus of this scoping review is on web-based therapeutic interventions (WBTI) that aim to provide guidance, support and treatment for health problems. OBJECTIVES This review identifies and describes international scientific evidence on WBTI used by Indigenous peoples in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and USA for managing and treating a broad range of health conditions. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Studies assessing WBTI designed for Indigenous peoples in Australia, Canada, USA and New Zealand, that were published in English, in peer-reviewed literature, from 2006 to 2018 (inclusive), were considered for inclusion in the review. Studies were considered if more than 50% of participants were Indigenous, or if results were reported separately for Indigenous participants. SOURCES OF EVIDENCE Following a four-step search strategy in consultation with a research librarian, 12 databases were searched with a view to finding both published and unpublished studies. CHARTING METHODS Data was extracted, synthesised and reported under four main conceptual categories: (1) types of WBTI used, (2) community uptake of WBTI, (3) factors that impact on uptake and (4) conclusions and recommendations for practice. RESULTS A total of 31 studies met the inclusion criteria. The WBTI used were interactive websites, screening and assessment tools, management and monitoring tools, gamified avatar-based psychological therapy and decision support tools. Other sources reported the use of mobile apps, multimedia messaging or a mixture of intervention tools. Most sources reported moderate uptake and improved health outcomes for Indigenous people. Suggestions to improve uptake included as follows: tailoring content and presentation formats to be culturally relevant and appropriate, customisable and easy to use. CONCLUSIONS Culturally appropriate, evidence-based WBTI have the potential to improve health, overcome treatment barriers and reduce inequalities for Indigenous communities. Access to WBTI, alongside appropriate training, allows health care workers to better support their Indigenous clients.

Of particular interest are press cakes of the seeds, cheap residuals from sunflower oil manufacturing that offer attractive sustainability and economic benefits. Admittedly, sunflower seed milk, derived therefrom, suffers from limited nutritional value, undesired flavor, and the presence of indigestible sugars. Of specific relevance is the absence of vitamin B(12). This vitamin is required for development and function of the central nervous system, healthy red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis, and displays the most important micronutrient for vegans to be aware of. Here we evaluated the power of microbes to enrich sunflower seed milk nutritionally as well as in flavor. RESULTS: Propionibacterium freudenreichii NCC 1177 showed highest vitamin B(12) production in sunflower seed milk out of a range of food-grade propionibacteria. Its growth and B(12) production capacity, however, were limited by a lack of accessible carbon sources and stimulants of B(12) biosynthesis in the plant milk. This was overcome by co-cultivation with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens NCC 156, which supplied lactate, amino acids, and vitamin B(7) for growth of NCC 1177 plus vitamins B(2) and B(3), potentially supporting vitamin B(12) production by the Propionibacterium. After several rounds of optimization, co-fermentation of ultra-high-temperature pre-treated sunflower seed milk by the two microbes, enabled the production of 17 g (100 g)(?1) vitamin B(12) within four days without any further supplementation. The fermented milk further revealed significantly enriched levels of l-lysine, the most limiting essential amino acid, vitamin B(3), vitamin B(6), improved protein quality and flavor, and largely eliminated indigestible sugars. CONCLUSION: The fermented sunflower seed milk, obtained by using two food-grade microbes without further supplementation, displays an attractive, clean-label product with a high level of vitamin B(12) and multiple co-benefits. The secret of the successfully upgraded plant milk lies in the multifunctional cooperation of the two microbes, which were combined, based on their genetic potential and metabolic signatures found in mono-culture fermentations. This design by knowledge approach appears valuable for future development of plant-based milk products.

METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent interventions for lower extremity CTOs in the OBL setting by a single vascular surgeon were evaluated (January 2013-November 2017). If antegrade crossing was not possible, then a retrograde distal approach was used. Patient characteristics, CTO location, procedural time, contrast, anticoagulation and radiation doses and costs were recorded. Post-procedural complications were documented on post-procedure day 1 and 10-14 days post procedure. Three groups were compared: group 1-antegrade approach for femoropopliteal CTOs; group 2-antegrade approach for tibial CTOs, and; group 3-retrograde approach for femoropopliteal and tibial CTOs. RESULTS Two hundred and thirty-seven patients were studied. In 39 (16.5%), the lesions could not be crossed. A successful antegrade approach was used in 185 of them, of which 69% (group 1, n = 128) patients had femoropopliteal CTOs and 31% (group 2, n = 57) had tibial CTOs. Fourteen patients (5.9%, group 3) were treated by retrograde distal approach. Group 3 patients received higher contrast doses than groups 1 and 2 (p = 0.01). However, patients in groups 1 and 2 received similar contrast doses. Group 3 patients had the highest operative time and treatment costs followed by group 1 and then group 2 (p = 0.01).

The aim of this review is to describe how the Danish national microbiology database, MiBa, served as a cornerstone for providing data to the real-time survelliance system by linkage to other nationwide health registries. The surveillance system was established on an existing IT health infrastructure and a close network between clinical microbiologists, information technology experts and public health officials. In 2020, testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 was ramped up from none to over 10,000 weekly PCR tests per 100,000 population. The crude incidence data mirrored this increase in testing. Real-time access to denominator data and patient registries enabled adjustments for fluctuations testing activity, providing robust data on crude SARS-CoV-2 incidence during the changing diagnostic and management strategies. The use of the same data for different purposes, e.g. final laboratory reports, information to the public, contact tracing, public health and science, has been a critical asset for the pandemic response.It has also raised issues concerning data protection and critical capacity of the underlying technical systems and key ressources. However, even with these limitations, the set-up has enabled decision makers to adopt timely interventions. The experiences from COVID-19 may motivate a transformation from traditional indicator based public health surveillance to an all-encompassing information system based on access to a comprehensive set of data sources, including diagnostic and reference microbiology.","output":"Electronic reporting of diagnostic laboratory test results from all health care sectors is a cornerstone of national preparedness and control of COVID-19 in Denmark"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging swine enteric coronavirus that causes diarrhea in piglets.

However, ultrafiltration failure after peritoneal injury is an important reason for patients to withdraw from PD treatment. Peritonitis is a major complication of peritoneal dialysis, which results in an accelerated process of peritoneal injury due to direct damage from acute inflammation and local release of cytokine TGF-. In this paper, the application of ultrasound to examine the peritoneum revealed a positive correlation between peritoneal thickness and the development of peritonitis. The results of this study also further confirmed the effect of peritonitis on peritoneal thickening. A multifactorial regression analysis also revealed that peritonitis and its severity were independent risk factors for peritoneal thickening and omental structural abnormalities. This paper reported a correlation between mural peritoneal thickness and peritoneal transit function. In this study, patients with high peritoneal transit and high mean transit were found to be more prone to omental structural abnormalities than patients with low mean and low transit and a higher proportion of patients with mural peritoneal thickening, but this did not reach statistical significance, which may be related to the still small number of cases.","output":"CT Imaging Characteristics and Influence Factors of Renal Dialysis-Associated Peritoneal Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contact tracing is a well-known tool for public health professionals to trace and isolate contacts of known infectious persons.

This COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) exhibits some of the features associated with thrombotic microangiopathy, particularly complement-mediated hemolytic-uremic syndrome. In some cases, due to the anti-phospholipid antibodies, CAC resembles catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome. In other patients, it exhibits features of hemophagocytic syndrome. CAC is mainly identified by: increases in fibrinogen, D-dimers, and von Willebrand factor (released from activated endothelial cells), consumption of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13 (ADAMTS13), over activated and dysregulated complement, and elevated plasma cytokine levels. CAC manifests as both major cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events and dysfunctional microcirculation, which leads to multiple organ damage. It is not clear whether the mainstay of COVID-19 is complement overactivation, cytokine/chemokine activation, or a combination of these activities. Available data have suggested that non-critically ill hospitalized patients should be administered full-dose heparin. In critically ill, full dose heparin treatment is discouraged due to higher mortality rate. In addition to anti-coagulation, four different host-directed therapeutic pathways have recently emerged that influence CAC: (1) Anti-von Willebrand factor monoclonal antibodies; (2) activated complement C5a inhibitors; (3) recombinant ADAMTS13; and (4) Interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 antibodies. Moreover, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the virus surface protein have been tested.

However, interferometric-based sensors are susceptible to environmental disturbances, including temperature and non-specific binding of target molecules, which reduces their detection robustness. To address this shortcoming, this paper proposes a self-referencing interference sensor based on coherence multiplexing to resist environmental disturbances. The proposed sensor can address temperature and non-specific binding, but it is not limited only to these types of disturbances. In the proposed sensor design, each sensor signal is encoded using a specific optical path difference determined by the optical thickness of a sensor chip. In addition, two sensor signals for disturbances tracking and biomolecule detection are detected simultaneously without additional cost to the second spectrometer and then differenced to achieve real-time self-reference. The temperature fluctuations experiments and specific binding experiments of protein A to IgG are performed to verify the performance of the proposed sensor. The results demonstrate that the proposed sensor can eliminate non-specific binding and temperature disturbances in real-time during biomolecule detection, achieving higher detection robustness. The proposed sensor is suitable for applications that require large-scale testing of biomolecular interactions, such as drug screening.","output":"A Self-Reference Interference Sensor Based on Coherence Multiplexing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Although menopause is a common condition, trainees still express high levels of discomfort with managing climacteric symptoms. Trainees also receive little preparation for conducting telemedicine visits, which have become increasingly important in clinical care. We present a formative standardized patient (SP) encounter to introduce medical students to the diagnosis and treatment of menopausal symptoms and the process of conducting a telemedicine visit. METHODS: We designed a virtual telemedicine encounter with an SP for medical students. Students received feedback via a post-encounter note on history taking, differential diagnosis, and diagnostics/management and an SP debrief. We collected student input on the experience at the midpoint and end of clerkship and analyzed it for recurring themes. We calculated summary statistics from student post-encounter notes. RESULTS: Thirty-two OB/GYN students completed the menopause telemedicine SP encounter between April and June 2020. Students scored a median of 20 out of 45 (interquartile range: 18, 22) on the post-encounter note. All students correctly provided a diagnosis of perimenopause/menopause; however, 50% did not offer any strategy for counseling or managing menopausal symptoms. Students expressed discomfort with using a telehealth format (78%) but found it a useful skill to practice (47%). A majority (66%) found the educational encounter to be of excellent or above-average educational value. DISCUSSION: While medical students demonstrated discomfort with both managing menopause and utilizing a telemedicine format, this SP case provided an opportunity for them to practice both skills in a safe learning environment.

Coronaviruses have zoonotic potential due to the adaptability of their S protein to bind receptors of other species, most notably demonstrated by SARS-CoV. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to TLR (Toll-like receptor) causes the release of pro-IL-1, which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by the formation and activation of the inflammasome, which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever, and fibrosis. The NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome is implicated in a variety of human diseases including Alzheimers disease (AD), prion diseases, type 2 diabetes, and numerous infectious diseases. By examining the use of 4,4-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS) in the treatment of patients with Hansens disease, also diagnosed as Alzheimers disease, this study demonstrates the diverse mechanisms involved in the activation of inflammasomes. TLRs, due to genetic polymorphisms, can alter the immune response to a wide variety of microbial ligands, including viruses. In particular, TLR2Arg(677)Trp was reported to be exclusively present in Korean patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL). Previously, mutation of the intracellular domain of TLR2 has demonstrated its role in determining the susceptibility to LL, though LL was successfully treated using a combination of DDS with rifampicin and clofazimine. Of the three tested antibiotics, DDS was effective in the molecular regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activators that are important in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Parkinsons disease (PD), and AD. The specific targeting of NLRP3 itself or up-/downstream factors of the NLRP3 inflammasome by DDS may be responsible for its observed preventive effects, functioning as a competitor.","output":"4,4-Diaminodiphenyl Sulfone (DDS) as an Inflammasome Competitor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To highlight the efficacy of various psychological interventions (PI) when used in combination with, or in place of, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5i), as compared to the traditional treatment of men with erectile dysfunction (ED) with PDE-5i alone. Methods: A comprehensive literature review for the years 2005C2020 via MEDLINE and PubMed. We included randomised controlled trials that compared the use of either PDE-5i alone, PI alone or a combination of PDE-5i and PI in the treatment of psychogenic ED. All studies included were performed in adults aged 19C55 years and were written in English. Results: A total of 13 articles, with an overall sample of 597 men, were included in this systematic review. The results show that the combination of PI and PDE-5i was more effective than either PI or PDE-5i alone, on erectile function and long-term sexual satisfaction in men with psychogenic ED. Combined interventions were found to be significantly superior to medical treatment in seven studies and to PI alone in one study. In comparing PI to PDE-5i, two studies found PI to be significantly superior to PDE-5i use. In three other studies, PI was found significantly superior to no treatment at all, although some participants in the control group had taken PDE-5i. Conclusions: The combination of PDE-5i with PI shows real promise for the treatment of psychogenic ED. However, no conclusions could be made about what PI is more promising than the other and larger studies are needed to confirm these initial findings.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of amino acids (AAs) on expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in human myotubes and skeletal muscle and supposed that AAs administration increases IGF1 levels in blood and expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in trained skeletal muscle, thereby reducing training-induced muscle damage. DESIGN Human myotubes were incubated with Arg and Leu for 24 h. Then, the effects of long-term branched chain AAs administration (10 weeks, 0.1 g/kg body mass/day) to volunteers (six subjects per AAs and placebo groups) performing large training volumes regularly (cross country skiers, training twice a day) were examined. RESULTS Incubating the myotubes with AAs increases expression of IGF1 mRNA isoforms and IGF1 secretion by 2-3 times. In athletes, long-term AAs administration increased basal blood levels of IGF1 (~50%) and expression of IGF1Ea mRNA slightly in skeletal muscle. There is no marked increase in expression of COL1A1, COL3A1, COL5A1, and LOX genes in skeletal muscle after AAs administration. However, expression of these genes in the combined group (placebo + AAs; n = 12) significantly correlated with the expression of IGF1Ea mRNA in muscle and did not correlate with IGF1 levels in the blood. CONCLUSIONS AAs administration increases IGF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. To obtain more pronounced changes in expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in skeletal muscle, it may be necessary to increase the dose and/or duration of AAs administration.","output":"Effect of amino acids on IGF1 gene expression in human myotubes and skeletal muscle."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aggressive behaviors can serve different functions, which might be understood by distinguishing between reactive (RA) and proactive (PA) aggression.

Limited data exist to guide the intensity of antithrombotic prophylaxis. Objective: To evaluate the effects of intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter randomized trial with a 2  2 factorial design performed in 10 academic centers in Iran comparing intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (first hypothesis) and statin therapy vs matching placebo (second hypothesis; not reported in this article) among adult patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Patients were recruited between July 29, 2020, and November 19, 2020. The final follow-up date for the 30-day primary outcome was December 19, 2020. Interventions: Intermediate-dose (enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg daily) (n = 276) vs standard prophylactic anticoagulation (enoxaparin, 40 mg daily) (n = 286), with modification according to body weight and creatinine clearance. The assigned treatments were planned to be continued until completion of 30-day follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days, assessed in randomized patients who met the eligibility criteria and received at least 1 dose of the assigned treatment. Prespecified safety outcomes included major bleeding according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (type 3 or 5 definition), powered for noninferiority (a noninferiority margin of 1.8 based on odds ratio), and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 103/L). All outcomes were blindly adjudicated. Results: Among 600 randomized patients, 562 (93.7%) were included in the primary analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 62 [50-71] years; 237 [42.2%] women). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 126 patients (45.7%) in the intermediate-dose group and 126 patients (44.1%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (absolute risk difference, 1.5% [95% CI, -6.6% to 9.8%]; odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.76-1.48]; P = .70). Major bleeding occurred in 7 patients (2.5%) in the intermediate-dose group and 4 patients (1.4%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (risk difference, 1.1% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -&#8734; to 3.4%]; odds ratio, 1.83 [1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.00-5.93]), not meeting the noninferiority criteria (P for noninferiority >.99). Severe thrombocytopenia occurred only in patients assigned to the intermediate-dose group (6 vs 0 patients; risk difference, 2.2% [95% CI, 0.4%-3.8%]; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19, intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, compared with standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, did not result in a significant difference in the primary outcome of a composite of adjudicated venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days. These results do not support the routine empirical use of intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation in unselected patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19.

Since the exact number of infected cases is unknown, the number of documented cases was used by many disease transmission models to infer epidemiological parameters. This means that it was possible to produce biased estimates of epidemiological parameters and hence of the effects of intervention measures, because the percentage of all cases that were documented changed during the first 2 months of the epidemic, as a consequence of a gradually improving diagnostic capability. METHODS: To overcome these limitations, we constructed a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) model, accounting for intervention measures and temporal changes in the proportion of new documented infections out of total new infections, to characterize the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan across different stages of the outbreak. Pre-symptomatic transmission was taken into account in our model, and all epidemiological parameters were estimated using the Particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method. RESULTS: Our model captured the local Wuhan epidemic pattern as two-peak transmission dynamics, with one peak on February 4 and the other on February 12, 2020. The impact of intervention measures determined the timing of the first peak, leading to an 86% drop in the R(e) from 3.23 (95% CI, 2.22 to 4.20) to 0.45 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.69). The improved diagnostic capability led to the second peak and a higher proportion of documented infections. Our estimated proportion of new documented infections out of the total new infections increased from 11% (95% CI 1C43%) to 28% (95% CI 4C62%) after January 26 when more detection kits were released. After the introduction of a new diagnostic criterion (case definition) on February 12, a higher proportion of daily infected cases were documented (49% (95% CI 7C79%)). CONCLUSIONS: Transportation restrictions and quarantine measures together in Wuhan were able to contain local epidemic growth.

In the animal nervous system, a systematic shift toward distal sites of transcription termination produces transcript signatures that are crucial for neuron development and function. Here, we report that, in Drosophila, the highly conserved protein ELAV globally regulates all sites of neuronal 3' end processing and directly binds to proximal polyadenylation sites of target mRNAs in vivo. We uncover an endogenous strategy of functional gene rescue that safeguards neuronal RNA signatures in an ELAV loss-of-function context. When not directly repressed by ELAV, the transcript encoding the ELAV paralog FNE acquires a mini-exon, generating a new protein able to translocate to the nucleus and rescue ELAV-mediated alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing. We propose that exon-activated functional rescue is a more widespread mechanism that ensures robustness of processes regulated by a hierarchy, rather than redundancy, of effectors.","output":"ELAV and FNE Determine Neuronal Transcript Signatures through EXon-Activated Rescue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To examine service delivery in clinics that provided abortions in 2017, including differences by abortion policy climate. STUDY DESIGN: Using data from the Guttmacher Institute's 2017 Abortion Provider Census, we examine amount charged for abortion care, pregnancy gestation at which abortions were offered, number of days per week that clinics provided abortions, and types of non-abortion services offered. Our analysis focuses on the 808 clinic facilities that provided 95% of abortions that year. Measures were calculated nationally and according to whether the clinic was in a state we categorized as hostile, middle-ground or supportive of abortion rights. RESULTS: In 2017, 64% of clinics offered abortion at 11 weeks pregnancy gestation, and 22% did so at 20 weeks gestation. Supportive states had a higher density of clinics that provide abortion for every measured gestation than hostile states. Clinics charged an average of $549 for a surgical abortion at 10 weeks and $551 for medication abortion. Some 46% of clinics in supportive states offered abortion care five or more days per week, compared to 29% in hostile states. Most clinics offered stand-alone contraception and family planning (87%) and gynecological care (85%), but the proportion of clinics that provided these services was higher in supportive states (93% and 90%) than in hostile states (75% and 73%). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of abortion facilities provide a range of other health care services. Aspects of service delivery, such as number of days abortions are provided, may vary according to abortion policy climate. Implications statement. Onerous policies in states hostile to abortion rights may inhibit some facilities from providing abortion more days per week, and if so, could further burden patients obtaining abortion care in these states.","output":"Abortion service delivery in clinics by state policy climate in 2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both COVID\\\\19 pandemic\\\\related restrictions and recessionary employment loss severely impacted US food sales during 2020.

The susceptibility for PRRSV varies between the different breeds of swine. In cell culture, PRRSV virus can be propagated in primary porcine alveolar macrophages and some African green monkey kidney cell lines, such as MARC-145 cells. Previous studies have shown that 3' untranslated region (UTR) RNAs of the arteriviruses play an important role in the replication of the virus through interactions with cellular proteins. To better understand the differences in the replication capability of PRRSV in different cell lines, we sought to identify the host cellular proteins interacting with PRRSV 3' UTR RNA. We constructed a cDNA library of MARC-145 cell line in lambda ZAP Express vector and screened the library with the positive sense 3' UTR RNA of PRRSV. RESULTS: We found that CD151, a host cellular protein, interacting with PRRSV 3' UTR RNA. The specificity of the interaction between CD151 and PRRSV 3' UTR RNA was examined by gel shift assay as well as North-Western hybridization. The transfection of CD151 expression clone into BHK-21 rendered these cells susceptible to PRRSV infection, and the transfection of siRNA against CD151 into MARC-145 significantly reduced the level of PRRSV infection. Also, anti-CD151 antibody treatment to MARC-145 completely blocked PRRSV infection.

Data on demographic characteristics, COVID-19 vaccination-related concerns, knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding COVID-19, and knowledge, attitudes, and acceptance regarding the COVID-19 vaccine were collected using a self-administered survey. A binomial logistic regression was performed with 70% efficacy to determine the association between acceptance of the vaccine and study variables. RESULTS: Valid and complete responses were collected from 15,087 participants. Of these, 6227 (41.3%) were male and 8860 (58.7%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 30.6  9.8 years. Moreover, 485 (3.2%) participants were infected with COVID-19 at the time of the study, while 2000 (13.3%) had been previously infected. Overall, 2452 (16.3%) participants agreed, and 3127 (20.7%) strongly agreed, with \\"having concerns about serious vaccine-related complications.\\" Mask-wearing adherence was reported by 10,268 (68.1%) of the participants.

Absence of specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection has encouraged exploration of phytochemicals as potential antivirals. AIM: This study aimed at in silico exploration, along with in vitro and in vivo validation of antiviral efficacy of the phytochemical withanone. METHODS: Through molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and electrostatic energy calculation the plausible biochemical interactions between withanone and the ACE2-RBD complex were investigated. These in silico observations were biochemically validated by ELISA-based assays. Withanone-enriched extract from W. somnifera was tested for its ability to ameliorate clinically relevant pathological features, modelled in humanized zebrafish through SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein induction. RESULTS: Withanone bound efficiently at the interacting interface of the ACE2-RBD complex and destabilized it energetically. The electrostatic component of binding free energies of the complex was significantly decreased. The two intrachain salt bridge interactions (K31-E35) and the interchain long-range ion-pair (K31-E484), at the ACE2-RBD interface were completely abolished by withanone, in the 50 ns simulation. In vitro binding assay experimentally validated that withanone efficiently inhibited (IC(50)=0.33 ng/mL) the interaction between ACE2 and RBD, in a dose-dependent manner. A withanone-enriched extract, without any co-extracted withaferin A, was prepared from W. somnifera leaves. This enriched extract was found to be efficient in ameliorating human-like pathological responses induced in humanized zebrafish by SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein.

To this end, we compared serum proteome profiles at different stages of fibrosis in HIV/HCV co- and HCV mono-infected patients using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS). METHODS: Sera from 83 HIV/HCV co- and 68 HCV mono-infected subjects in 4 stages of fibrosis were tested. Sera were fractionated, randomly applied to protein chip arrays (IMAC, CM10 and H50) and spectra were generated at low and high laser intensities. RESULTS: Sixteen biomarkers achieved a p value < 0.01 (ROC values > 0.75 or < 0.25) predictive of fibrosis status in co-infected individuals and 14 in mono infected subjects. Five of these candidate biomarkers contributed to both mono- and co-infected subjects. Candidate diagnostic algorithms were created to distinguish between non-fibrotic and fibrotic individuals using a panel of 4 biomarker peaks. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that SELDI MS profiling can identify diagnostic serum biomarkers for fibrosis that are both common and distinct in HIV/HCV co-infected and HCV mono-infected individuals.","output":"Proteomic fingerprinting in HIV/HCV co-infection reveals serum biomarkers for the diagnosis of fibrosis staging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the initial emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, a high incidence rate has been observed in Saudi Arabia. This suggests that the country is at continuous risk. The epidemic level of MERS-CoV infection was examined in Saudi Arabia by the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model using a Bayesian approach for estimation of time dependent reproduction number (R) across a two-year interval (May, 2013-May, 2015) in five defined clusters, followed by sensitivity analysis of the most significant clusters. Significant MERS-CoV peaks were detected in the period between March and May of each year. Moreover, MERS-CoV infection was highlighted in western (40.8%) and central (31.9%) regions, followed by eastern region (20%). The temporal-based Bayesian approach indicated a sub-critical epidemic in all regions in the baseline scenario (R: 0.85C0.97). However, R potential limit was exceeded in the sensitivity analysis scenario in only central and western regions (R: 1.08C1.12) that denoted epidemic level in those regions. The impact of sporadic cases was found relatively insignificant and pinpointed to the lack of zoonotic influence on MERS-CoV transmission dynamics. The results of current study would be helpful for evaluation of future progression of MERS-CoV infections, better understanding and control interventions.","output":"A pandemic risk assessment of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The universal phenomenon of blood clotting is well known to be protective in external cellular/ tissue injury. However, the emergence of unusual thrombotic presentations in COVID-19 patients is the real concern. Interaction of the spike glycoprotein with ACE2 receptor present in the host cell surface mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 infection. New clinical findings of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are coming out every day, and one such mystery is the formation of mysterious blood clots in the various tissues and organs of COVID-19 patients, which needs critical attention. To address this issue, we hypothesis that, high ACE2 expression in the endothelium of blood vessels facilitates the high-affinity binding of SARS-CoV-2 using spike protein, causing infection and internal injury inside the vascular wall of blood vessels. This viral associated injury may directly/indirectly initiate activation of coagulation and clotting cascades forming internal blood clots. However, the presence of these clots is undesirable as they are responsible for thrombosis and need to be treated with anti-thrombotic intervention.","output":"Blood clots in COVID-19 patients: Simplifying the curious mystery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To understand the relationship between sense of place and creativity and the mechanisms that affect this relationship, the researchers constructed a mediation model to examine the effect of sense of place on creativity and the mediating role of psychological resilience in elementary school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 1,711 students in an elementary school in Beijing, China, were surveyed using Chinese-language versions of the Sense of Place Scale, the Psychological Resilience Scale-Short Version, and the Innovative Behavior Inventory. SPSS (version 23) and PROCESS plug-in (version 3.3) were used for correlation and mediation analyses. RESULTS: (1) Correlation analysis revealed that sense of place was positively related to psychological resilience (r = 0.445, p < 0.01) and creativity (r = 0.590, p < 0.01). (2) Psychological resilience was also positively correlated with creativity (r = 0.625, p < 0.01). (3) Further, after controlling for gender and grade level, it was found that sense of place directly predicted creativity and that sense of place also indirectly predicted creativity through psychological resilience. The direct effect (0.45) and the mediating effect (0.23) accounted for 65.95 and 34.05% of the total effect, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that sense of place is a positive predictor of creativity and can play a facilitating role to some extent. Moreover, psychological resilience is a mediating factor, acting as a buffer between sense of place and creativity. These results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms influencing creativity.","output":"The Influence of Sense of Place on Elementary School Students Creativity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating and Buffering Effects of Psychological Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although pediatric myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated disease is increasingly well-recognized, its full clinical spectrum is still being defined.

A crucial point for any government is to understand, on the basis of the epidemic curve, the right temporal instant to set up a lockdown and then to remove it. Different strategies are being adopted with distinct shades of intensity. USA and Europe tend to introduce restrictions of considerable temporal length. They vary in time: a severe lockdown may be reached and then gradually relaxed. An interesting alternative is the Australian model where short and sharp responses have repeatedly tackled the virus and allowed people a return to near normalcy. After a few positive cases are detected, a lockdown is immediately set. In this paper we show that the Australian model can be generalized and given a rigorous mathematical analysis, casting strategies of the type short-term pain for collective gain in the context of sliding-mode control, an important branch of nonlinear control theory. This allows us to gain important insights regarding how to implement short-term lockdowns, obtaining a better understanding of their merits and possible limitations. Our model predicts the duration of the severe lockdown to be set to maintain e.g. the number of people in intensive care under a certain threshold. After tuning our strategy exploiting data collected in Italy, it turns out that COVID-19 epidemic could be e.g. controlled by alternating one or two weeks of complete lockdown with one or two months of freedom, respectively. Control strategies of this kind, where the lockdown's duration is well circumscribed, could be important also to alleviate coronavirus impact on economy.","output":"COVID-19 epidemic control using short-term lockdowns for collective gain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of therapeutic approaches based on direct cardiac reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced-cardiomyocytes (iCM) has emerged as an attractive strategy to repair the injured myocardium. The identification of the mechanisms driving lineage conversion represents a crucial step toward the development of new and more efficient regenerative strategies. To this aim, here we show that pre-treatment with the Bmi1 inhibitor PTC-209 is sufficient to increase the efficiency of Chemical-induced Direct Cardiac Reprogramming both in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and adult cardiac fibroblasts. PTC-209 induces an overall increase of spontaneously beating iCM at end-stage of reprogramming, expressing high levels of late cardiac markers Troponin T and myosin muscle light chain-2v. The inhibition of Bmi1 expression occurring upon PTC-209 pre-treatment was maintained throughout the reprogramming protocol, contributing to a significant gene expression de-regulation. RNA profiling revealed that, upon Bmi1 inhibition a significant down-regulation of genes associated with immune and inflammatory signalling pathways occurred, with repression of different genes involved in interleukin, cytokine and chemokine pathways. Accordingly, we observed the down-regulation of both JAK/STAT3 and MAPK/ERK1-2 pathway activation, highlighting the crucial role of these pathways as a barrier for cardiac reprogramming. These findings have significant implications for the development of new cardiac regenerative therapies.","output":"Bmi1 inhibitor PTC-209 promotes Chemically-induced Direct Cardiac Reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapidly spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) Omicron variant contains more than 30 mutations that mediate escape from antibody responses elicited by prior infection or current vaccines.

Here, we showed that the T\\\\cell responses of individuals who underwent booster vaccination with CoronaVac were largely protective against the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 Omicron spike protein. To specifically estimate the impact of Omicron mutations on vaccinated participants, 16 peptides derived from the spike protein of the ancestral virus or Omicron strain with mutations were used to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the volunteers. Compared with the administration of two doses of vaccine, booster vaccination substantially enhanced T\\\\cell activation in response to both the ancestral and Omicron epitopes, although the enhancement was slightly weakened by the Omicron mutations. Then, the peptides derived from these spike proteins were used separately to stimulate PBMCs.

We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operational and financial aspects of plastic surgery in Miami. METHODS: A multiple-choice and short-answer survey regarding practice changes and financial impact was sent to all 67 members of the Miami Society of Plastic Surgeons. RESULTS: A 41.8% (n = 28) response rate was obtained, five responses did not meet the inclusion criteria, and statistical analysis was performed on 34.3% (n = 23) of responses. Of the plastic surgeons who responded, 21.74% operate in an academic setting, 60.87% are in a single practitioner private practice, and 17.39% are in a multi-practitioner private practice. An estimated 60% of academic plastic surgeons had 75% or more of their previously scheduled cases canceled, compared with 57.14% in single practitioner private practice and 100% in multi-practitioner private practice. In total, 64.29% of single practitioner private practices and 50% of multi-practitioner private practices have had to obtain a small business loan. Single practitioner private practice plastic surgeons reported having an average of 6.5 months until having to file for bankruptcy or permanently close their practices, and multi-practitioner private practice plastic surgeons reported an average of 6 months.

Considering the lack of appropriate therapy for COVID-19, it is crucial to develop effective treatments instead of supportive approaches. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as multipotent stromal cells have been shown to possess treating potency through inhibiting or modulating the pathological events in COVID-19. MSCs and their exosomes participate in immunomodulation by controlling cell-mediated immunity and cytokine release. Furthermore, they repair the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) malfunction, increase alveolar fluid clearance, and reduce the chance of hypercoagulation. Besides the lung, which is the primary target of SARS-CoV-2, the heart, kidney, nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract are also affected by COVID-19. Thus, the efficacy of targeting these organs via different delivery routes of MSCs and their exosomes should be evaluated to ensure safe and effective MSCs administration in COVID-19. This review focuses on the proposed therapeutic mechanisms and delivery routes of MSCs and their exosomes to the damaged organs. It also discusses the possible application of primed and genetically modified MSCs as a promising drug delivery system in COVID-19.

Drug repurposing is currently one of the most tangible options for rapidly developing drugs for emerging and reemerging viruses. In general, drug repurposing starts with virtual screening of approved drugs employing various computational methods. However, the actual hit rate of virtual screening is very low, and most of the predicted compounds are false positives. Here, we developed a strategy for virtual screening with much reduced false positives through incorporating predocking filtering based on shape similarity and postdocking filtering based on interaction similarity. We applied this advanced virtual screening approach to repurpose 6,218 approved and clinical trial drugs for COVID-19. All 6,218 compounds were screened against main protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in 15 and 23 potential repurposed drugs, respectively. Among them, seven compounds can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells. Three of these drugs, emodin, omipalisib, and tipifarnib, show anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in human lung cells, Calu-3. Notably, the activity of omipalisib is 200-fold higher than that of remdesivir in Calu-3. Furthermore, three drug combinations, omipalisib/remdesivir, tipifarnib/omipalisib, and tipifarnib/remdesivir, show strong synergistic effects in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. Such drug combination therapy improves antiviral efficacy in SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduces the risk of each drugs toxicity.

METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included consecutive patients referred to colonoscopy from primary care centres from November 2017 to May 2018. The intervention group (IG) received a telephone intervention, while the control group (CG) did not. Patients assigned to the IG received an educational telephone call 7 d before the colonoscopy appointment. The intervention was carried out by two nurses with deep endoscopic knowledge who were previously trained for a telephone educational intervention for colonoscopy. The impact on patient compliance with preparedness protocols related to bowel cleansing, anti-thrombotic management, and sedation scheduling was also evaluated. A second call was conducted to assess patient satisfaction. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 738 and 746 patients were finally included in the IG and CG respectively. Six hundred thirteen (83%) patients were contacted in the IG. The non-attendance rate was lower in the IG, both in the ITT analysis (IG 8.4% vs CG 14.3%, P < 0.001) and in the PP analysis (4.4% vs 14.3%, P < 0.001).

Health care workers are the most at-risk population to contract and transmit the infection, especially to already vulnerable patients who do not have COVID-19. In low-income countries, routine testing is not feasible due to the high cost of testing; therefore, presenting the risk of uncontrolled transmission within nonCCOVID-19 treatment wards. This challenge necessitated the development of an affordable intermediary screening tool that would enable early identification of potentially infected health care workers and for early real time DNACpolymerase chain reaction testing prioritization. This would limit the contact time of potentially infected health care workers with the patients but also enable efficient use of the limited testing kits. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to describe an early warning in-hospital mobile risk analysis app for screening COVID-19 and to determine the feasibility and user-friendliness of the app among health care workers. METHODS: The primary result of this research project was the development of a mobile-based daily early warning system for in-hospital transmission of COVID-19. Overall, the Early Warning System for In-Hospital Transmission of COVID-19 (EWAS) mobile app was found to be feasible, with over 69% of the health care workers having logged more than 67% of the required times. Over 93% of the participants reported that the tool was easy to use. RESULTS: The primary result of this research project was the development of a mobile-based daily early warning system for in-hospital transmission of COVID-19. Overall, the Early Warning System for In-Hospital Transmission of COVID-19 (EWAS) mobile app was found to be feasible, with 69% of the health care workers (69/100) having logged more than 67% of the required times. Of the 100 participants, 93 reported that the tool was easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: The EWAS mobile app is a feasible and user-friendly daily risk scoring tool for preventing in-hospital transmission of COVID-19. Although it was not designed to be a diagnostic tool but rather a screening tool, there is a need to evaluate its sensitivity in predicting persons likely to have contracted COVID-19.","output":"An Early Warning Mobile Health Screening and Risk Scoring App for Preventing In-Hospital Transmission of COVID-19 by Health Care Workers: Development and Feasibility Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today, the Photogrammetric Week enjoys international recognition as an upgrading seminar and a platform for the exchange of experience.

To eradicate it, it is crucial to acquire a strong and long-lasting anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, by either natural infection or vaccination. We collected blood samples 12C305 days after positive polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) from 35 recovered individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2-derived peptide pools, such as the Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), and Membrane (M) proteins, and we quantified anti-S immunoglobulins in plasma. After 10 months post-infection, we observed a sustained SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T-cell response directed against M-protein, but responses against S- or N-proteins were lost over time. Besides, we demonstrated that A-group individuals presented significantly higher frequencies of specific CD4+ T-cell responses against Pep-M than O-group individuals. The A-group subjects also needed longer to clear the virus and they lost cellular immune responses over time, compared to the O-group individuals, who showed a persistent specific immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the S-specific immune response was lost over time, and individual factors determine the sustainability of the bodys defences, which must be considered in the future design of vaccines to achieve continuous anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Summary This work describes that cellular responses against SARS-CoV-2 M-protein can be detected after 10 months but were lost against S- and N-proteins. Moreover, the individual factors; ABO-group and age influence the sustainability of the specific humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"ABO blood group is involved in the quality of the specific immune response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The U.S. government has taken significant steps toward developing and acquiring vaccines, drugs, and other medical countermeasures (MCMs) to protect and treat the population after a biological attack.

Social media data, which can be easily collected from the social world, has become a valuable resource for research in many different disciplines, e.g. crisis/disaster assessment, social event detection, or the recent COVID-19 analysis. Useful information, or knowledge derived from social data, could better serve the public if it could be processed and analyzed in more efficient and reliable ways. Advances in deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance of many social media analysis tasks. However, deep learning models typically require a large amount of labeled data for model training, while most CPSS data is not labeled, making it impractical to build effective learning models using traditional approaches. In addition, the current state-of-the-art, pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) models do not make use of existing knowledge graphs, thus often leading to unsatisfactory performance in real-world applications. To address the issues, we propose a new zero-shot learning method which makes effective use of existing knowledge graphs for the classification of very large amounts of social text data.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the characteristics of and outcomes in patients with thymic carcinomas and thymic neuroendocrine carcinomas undergoing LND. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed using our multi-institutional database to identify patients who underwent resection and LND for thymic carcinoma or thymic neuroendocrine carcinoma between 1991 and 2018. An enlarged mediastinal LN was defined as having a short-axis diameter >1 cm. We assessed survival outcomes using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS N1-level LND was performed in 41 patients (54.6%), N2-level LND in 14 patients (18.7%) and both-level LND in 16 patients (21.3%). Pathological LN metastasis was detected in 20 patients (26.7%) among the 75 patients undergoing LND. There was a significant difference in the number of LN stations (P = 0.015) and metastasis factor (P = 0.0042) between pathologically LN-positive and pathologically LN-negative patients. The sensitivity of enlarged LNs on preoperative computed tomography was 18.2%. There was a tendency towards worse overall survival of pathologically N2-positive patients, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative CT appears to play a limited role in detecting pathological LN metastases. Our findings suggest that the significance of N1- and N2-level LND should be evaluated in prospective studies to optimize the postoperative management of patients with thymic carcinomas and neuroendocrine carcinomas.","output":"Lymph node dissection in thymic carcinomas and neuroendocrine carcinomas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a small DNA virus with oncogenic potential.

In this review, we aim to describe and discuss the latest insights into HPTMs, DNA methylation, and miRNA regulation, as well as their regulative factors in the context of MCPyV-driven MCC, to provide an overview of current findings on how MCPyV is involved in the dysregulation of these epigenetic processes. The current state of the art is also described as far as potentially using epigenetic dysregulations and related factors as diagnostic and prognostic tools is concerned, in addition to targets for MCPyV-driven MCC therapy. Growing evidence suggests that the dysregulation of HPTMs, DNA methylation, and miRNA pathways plays a role in MCPyV-driven MCC etiopathogenesis, which, therefore, may potentially be clinically significant for this deadly tumor.

Primary objective was to describe the number of paediatric patients receiving cancer therapies who experienced taste changes, its impact on food intake and enjoyment of eating, and coping strategies. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study that included English-speaking paediatric patients aged 4-18 years with a diagnosis of cancer or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients receiving active treatment. Using a structured interview, we asked participants about their experience with taste changes, impacts and coping strategies. The respondent was the paediatric patient. RESULTS We enrolled 108 patients; median age was 11 years (IQR 8-15). The taste changes reported yesterday or today were food tasting bland (34%), bad (31%), different (27%), bitter (25%), extreme (19%), metallic (15%) or sour (12%). Taste changes were associated with decreased food intake (31%) and decreased enjoyment in eating (25%) yesterday or today. The most common coping strategies were eating food they liked (42%), eating strong-tasting food (39%), drinking liquids (35%), brushing teeth (31%) and sucking on candy (25%). Factors significantly associated with food tasting bad were as follows: older age (p=0.003), shorter time since cancer diagnosis (p=0.027), nausea and vomiting (p=0.008) and mucositis (p=0.009).

However, severe acute respiratory disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is common and associated with mortality in patients who require hospitalization. The etiology of susceptibility to severe lung injury remains unclear. Angiotensin II, converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) from angiotensin I and metabolized by ACE 2 (ACE2), plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of lung injury. ACE2 is identified as an essential receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cell. The binding of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 leads to the exhaustion and down-regulation of ACE2. The interaction and imbalance between ACE and ACE2 result in an unopposed angiotensin II. Considering that the ACE insertion (I)/deletion (D) gene polymorphism contributes to the ACE level variability in general population, in which mean ACE level in  carriers is approximately twice that in II carriers, we propose a hypothesis of genetic predisposition to severe lung injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. It is plausible that the ACE inhibitors and ACE receptor blockers may have the potential to prevent and to treat the acute lung injury after SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially for those with the ACE genotype associated with high ACE level.","output":"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Gene Polymorphism and Severe Lung Injury in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) is a rare cutaneous eruption of erythematous macules and papules distributed over the flexural surfaces and the trunk.

The current study evaluated the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV) compared to high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV-HD), against influenza-related hospitalizations/emergency room (ER) visits, all-cause hospitalizations and hospitalizations/ER visits for cardio-respiratory disease (CRD) among adults 65 years for the 2019-20 influenza season. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of older adults ( 65 years) was conducted using IQVIAs professional fee, prescription claims and hospital charge master data in the U.S. Baseline characteristics included age, gender, payer type, geographic region, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), comorbidities, indicators of frail health status, and pre-index hospitalization rates. To avoid any influenza outcome misclassification with COVID-19 infection, the study period ended March 7, 2020. Adjusted analyses were conducted through inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to control for selection bias. Poisson regression was used to estimate the adjusted pairwise rVE against influenza-related hospitalizations/ER visits, all-cause hospitalizations and any hospitalization/ER visit for CRD. An unrelated negative control outcome, urinary tract infection (UTI) hospitalization was included. RESULTS: During the 2019-20 influenza season, following IPTW, 798,987 recipients of aTIV and 1,655,979 recipients of TIV-HD were identified. After IPTW adjustment and Poisson regression, aTIV was statistically comparable to TIV-HD for prevention of influenza-related hospitalizations/ER visits (3.1%; 95% CI: -2.8%-8.6%) and all-cause hospitalizations (-0.7%; 95% CI: -1.6%-0.3%). Similar comparable outcomes were found for reduction of any hospitalization/ER visit for CRD (0.9%; 95% CI: 0.0%-1.7%). No treatment effect was identified for the negative control outcome.

Off-target emetic effects associated with non-selective PDE4 inhibitors has prompted the development of selective PDE4 isozyme inhibitors for treating neuropsychiatric conditions. Herein, we examined the effect of a selective PDE4B inhibitor A33 (0C1.0 mg/kg) on alcohol drinking in both female and male mice from two genetically distinct C57BL/6 substrains. Under two different binge-drinking procedures, A33 pretreatment reduced alcohol intake in male and female mice of both substrains. In both drinking studies, there was no evidence for carry-over effects the next day; however, we did observe some sign of tolerance to A33s effect on alcohol intake upon repeated, intermittent, treatment (5 injections of 1.0 mg/kg, every other day). Pretreatment with 1.0 mg/kg of A33 augmented sucrose intake by C57BL/6NJ, but not C57BL/6J, mice. In mice with a prior history of A33 pretreatment during alcohol-drinking, A33 (1.0 mg/kg) did not alter spontaneous locomotor activity or basal motor coordination, nor did it alter alcohols effects on motor activity, coordination or sedation. In a distinct cohort of alcohol-na?ve mice, acute pretreatment with 1.0 mg/kg of A33 did not alter motor performance on a rotarod and reduced sensitivity to the acute intoxicating effects of alcohol. These data provide the first evidence that selective PDE4B inhibition is an effective strategy for reducing excessive alcohol intake in murine models of binge drinking, with minimal off-target effects. Despite reducing sensitivity to acute alcohol intoxication, PDE4B inhibition reduces binge alcohol drinking, without influencing behavioral sensitivity to alcohol in alcohol-experienced mice. Furthermore, A33 is equally effective in males and females and exerts a quantitatively similar reduction in alcohol intake in mice with a genetic predisposition for high versus moderate alcohol preference.

N95 masks are considered one of the essential protective equipment in the management of patients with COVID-19. The shortage of N95 masks implies potential health risks for health personnel and significant economic losses for the health institution. The objective of this work was to investigate the disinfection of N95 masks artificially contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 and ESKAPE bacteria by using hydrogen peroxide plasma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined the disinfection capacity of hydrogen peroxide plasma against the SARS-CoV-2 and 2 members of the ESKAPE bacteria (Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus) through a study of artificial contamination in situ of N95 masks. Amplification of specific genes by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of SARS-CoV-2 and microbiological culture of ESKAPE bacteria was performed before and after the disinfection process. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in all assays using 5 different concentrations of the virus, and A baumannii and S aureus were not cultivable with inoculums of 102 to 106 CFU after disinfection tests of N95 masks with hydrogen peroxide plasma. CONCLUSION: Disinfection of N95 masks by using the hydrogen peroxide plasma technology can be an alternative for their reuse in a shortage situation. Implications for the use of disinfection technologies of N95 masks and the safety of health personnel are discussed.","output":"Disinfection of N95 masks artificially contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 and ESKAPE bacteria using hydrogen peroxide plasma: Impact on the reutilization of disposable devices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The chapter reviews the education sectors COVID-19 policy implementation for managing the impact of the coronavirus on school plans in South Africa. Complex and problematic policy issues emanate from the effects of the coronavirus and the quick-fix strategies used to implement policy without consideration of the contextual factors in underprivileged schools. Closure of schools as a short-term measure was not sustainable and had unintended consequences. On paper, the COVID-19 policy looks good, but it is devoid of the contextual realities of the places where it needs to be implemented. Gaps identified in the policy gave rise to protracted resistance by stakeholders due to lack of ownership. These challenges led to shifting of goals regarding the early reopening of schools. Systems thinking offers tools to improve on the implementation challenges faced by policy makers, while a systems dynamics approach seeks to bring understanding of the interconnection among stakeholders and the views they hold. The Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) provides a perspective for modelling the underlying problematic issues in structured manner. It shows the complex relationship that exists starting from the conception of the policy to its implementation. The SSM model addresses the challenges faced by policy makers in communicating the policy and engaging the stakeholders, and conceives the root cause of problematic issues in the implementation of the policy by proposing an ideal conceptual model. ?

Although most transplanted patients mounted spike-specific T helper cell responses, frequencies were significantly reduced compared with those in controls and dialysis patients and this was accompanied by a broad impairment in effector cytokine production, memory differentiation, and activation-related signatures. Spike-specific CD8+ T cell responses were less abundant than their CD4+ counterparts in healthy controls and hemodialysis patients and almost undetectable in transplant patients.

Point-of-care lung ultrasound is increasingly used in clinical care but proof that ultrasound reflects histological disease is lacking. Bovine calves are a good model for RSV bronchiolitis. We answered the following two questions: (1) does point-of-care lung ultrasound reflect lung pathology at the histological level in a bovine calf model of bronchiolitis? and (2) are point-of-care lung ultrasound images in human infants similar to those obtained in calves? METHODS: We experimentally infected 24 five to six-week-old bovine calves with RSV and compared six window lung ultrasound with lung histology10 days after inoculation. The calves were treated with antivirals and antipyretics leading to variable severity of illness. We used canonical discriminant analysis to determine if abnormal lung ultrasound findings reflected different histological findings. We compared the ultrasounds obtained from the calves with ultrasounds obtained from 10 human infants who were diagnosed clinically with bronchiolitis. RESULTS: Canonical discriminant analysis generally demonstrated good class separation based on the maximal severity of ultrasound finding in each acoustic window. Lung ultrasound performed poorly at detecting bronchopneumonia. Bovine ultrasounds looked similar to human infant lung ultrasounds.

This first-in-human trial aimed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of almonertinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that had progressed after prior EGFR-TKI therapy. METHODS: This phase I, open-label, multicenter clinical trial (NCT0298110) included dose-escalation (55, 110, 220 and 260 mg) and dose-expansion cohorts (55, 110 and 220 mg) with once-daily oral administration of almonertinib. In each expansion cohort, tumor biopsies were obtained for determination of EGFR T790M status. The safety, tolerability, anti-tumor activity and pharmacokinetics of almonertinib were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients (26 patients in the dose-escalation cohort and 94 patients in the dose-expansion cohort) were enrolled. The maximum tolerated dose was not defined in the dose-escalation phase; the 260 mgregimen was not further evaluated in the dose-expansion phase due to safety concerns and saturation of exposure. The most common treatment-related grade &#8805;3 adverse events were increased blood creatine phosphokinase (10%) and increased alanine aminotransferase (3%). Among 94 patients with the EGFR T790M mutation in the dose-expansion cohort, the investigator-assessed objective response rate and disease control rate were 52% (95%CI: 42-63) and 92% (95%CI: 84a96), respectively.

With the rapid implementation of virtual consultations throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, developing and maintaining TA through clinician consistency has been a new challenge for clinicians. Purpose: While face to face assessment and treatment of MSK patients was limited due to Covid-19 social restrictions, this provided the opportunity to complete a Quality Improvement (QI) project with the purpose of exploring the impact of virtual consultations on clinician consistency and hence TA, develop clinical and operational pathways to support clinician consistency and engrain some lessons learnt when returning to a Back to Better model of MSK working post Covid-19. Methods: To establish a baseline perception of clinician consistency with the use of virtual patient consultations, a survey was sent to all clinical and administrative staff. The Model of Improvement methodology was utilised and two cycles completed whereby the survey was repeated six-weekly to inform iteration of the next cycle. The key interventions within these two cycles to enhance clinician consistency, were to devise and implement clinical and operational pathways. This included a standardised process of clinician documentation for the administrative staff to identify a specific timeframe for patient follow up, stipulating the appropriate clinician to ensure Making Every Contact Count (MECC) principles and enhancing patient choice on the consultation type i.e. virtual or face to face. Results: After 2 cycles (12 weeks) of using enhanced clinical and operational pathways to support clinician consistency, the clinician surveys demonstrated that 23% of clinical staff perceived an improvement in clinician consistency. Additionally, there was a 29% reduction in negative impact of cross reviews on personal workload, with a 33% increase in appropriate use of cross reviews as clinically indicated. This resulted in a 20% reduction in negative impact on quality of patient care. Conclusion(s): This Quality Improvement project has highlighted that utilising virtual consultations can negatively impact clinicians perception of clinician consistency. However, through installing clinical and operational pathways to enhance clinician consistency, while maintaining MECC principles, positive impact on clinician perception can be demonstrated within 12 weeks. Impact: This Quality Improvement project on clinician consistency has impacted clinical and operational pathways to ensure appropriate use of clinician consistency. This has a positive impact not only on clinician perception but also on creating a therapeutic alliance between therapist and patient. With these clinical and operational pathways now embedded in our clinical practice, the Croydon MSK department is moving towards blended clinics where all patients have the choice of consultation type whether that is telephone, video or face to face. This encourages patient choice and engagement throughout their MSK pathway.

Translaryngeal ultrasound (TLUS) to assess the vocal cords has been proposed as a safe, non-invasive and sensitive alternative. The aim of this review was to verify TLUS as a viable tool for perioperative laryngeal assessment. METHOD A literature review was performed using Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Scopus with the following search strategy: (vocal cord OR vocal fold OR glottic OR glottis OR vocal ligaments OR rima glottidis) AND (ultras* OR sonograph* OR echography OR echotomography). RESULTS Fifteen studies were included in this review. All studies compared TLUS to IDL in visualizing the vocal cords in adults. Ten studies compared pre-operative TLUS to IDL where 50.6-100% of vocal cords were successfully visualized. Nine studies compared post-operative TLUS to IDL and reported visualization between 39.6% and 100%. Pre- and post-operative negative predictive values ranged from 60% to 100%. CONCLUSION Whilst promising, successful visualization of the cords is limited by inter-user variability, older age and male gender. Thus, we see the role of TLUS as an alternative to IDL in the post-operative setting in the young patient following uncomplicated surgery with a normal voice on clinical examination, to confirm recurrent laryngeal nerve integrity while minimizing the risk of aerosolization.","output":"Translaryngeal ultrasound in thyroid surgery: state of the art review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we exploit multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DCCA) to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the cross-correlations between oil and US equity market (as represented by the S&P 500 index).

Consequently, although the current literature has shown the sensitivity of rapid antigen tests (RATs) to be inferior to RT-PCR, RATs have been implemented on a large scale without solid data on performance. OBJECTIVE: This study will compare analytical and clinical sensitivities and specificities of 50 lateral flowC or laboratory-based RATs and 3 strand invasionCbased amplification (SIBA)-RT-PCR tests from 30 manufacturers to RT-PCR testing of samples obtained from the deep oropharynx. In addition, the study will compare sensitivities and specificities of the included RATs as well as RT-PCR on clinical samples obtained from the deep oropharynx, the anterior nasal cavity, saliva, the deep nasopharynx, and expired air to RT-PCR on deep oropharyngeal samples. METHODS: In the prospective part of the study, 200 individuals found SARS-CoV-2 positive and 200 individuals found SARS-CoV-2 negative by routine RT-PCR testing will be retested with each RAT, applying RT-PCR as the reference method. In the retrospective part of the study, 304 deep oropharyngeal cavity swabs divided into 4 groups based on RT-PCR quantification cycle (Cq) levels will be tested with each RAT. RESULTS: The results will be reported in several papers with different aims. The first paper will report retrospective (analytical sensitivity, overall and stratified into different Cq range groups) and prospective (clinical sensitivity) data for RATs, with RT-PCR as the reference method. The second paper will report results for RAT based on anatomical sampling location. The third paper will compare different anatomical sampling locations by RT-PCR testing. The fourth paper will focus on RATs that rely on central laboratory testing. Tests from 4 different manufacturers will be compared for analytical performance data on retrospective deep oropharyngeal swab samples. The fifth paper will report the results of 4 RATs applied both as professional use and as self-tests. The last paper will report the results from 2 breath tests in the study. A comparison of sensitivity and specificity between RATs will be conducted using the McNemar test for paired samples and the chi-squared test for unpaired samples. Comparison of the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) between RATs will be performed by the bootstrap test, and 95% CIs for sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV will be calculated as bootstrap CIs. CONCLUSIONS: The study will compare the sensitivities of a large number of RATs for SARS-CoV-2 to with those of RT-PCR and will address whether lateral flowCbased RATs differ significantly from laboratory-based RATs.

Healthcare systems introduced strict infection control measures to ensure optimal care, especially in frail groups such as cancer patients (pts). This study investigated the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 pre-procedure screening and whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) influenced timely diagnosis and therapy. Methods: Data of oncological procedures of pts with confirmed or suspected cancer diagnosis, treated at Oncology Department or coming from Emergency Department of San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital between June 2020 and March 2021 were retrospectively collected. A nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was performed in outpatients 24/48 h before procedures. Inpatients were tested by NPS before and after hospitalization. Results: Two hundred and twenty-one pts were included in this analysis. Median age was 73 years, males were 58%. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status was 0 or 1 in 88% of pts. The most frequent cancer type was lung cancer (57%). Stages IV were 77%. Two hundred and forty-three scheduled procedures were performed with diagnostic (n: 142;58%), therapeutic (n: 55;23%), and palliative (n: 46;19%) intent. One hundred and four and 139 procedures were performed in out- and in-pts, respectively. Of the 234 NPS performed, 10 (4%) were positive. Two pts were infected during hospitalization, 8 in community. Most of them were asymptomatic, while only 2 had mild symptoms. Eight procedures (3%) were postponed, 1 cancelled, while 2 were performed in positive pts. Median time to resolution of the infection was 17 days (11-36). Median delay in the procedures was 25 days (14-55). Five pts started systemic treatment, after a median time of 37.5 days (13-57). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection led to the postponement of a small, but not negligible percentage of oncological procedures.

A descriptive analysis and narrative synthesis were performed. RESULTS Of 761 records found, 14 satisfied the pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three themes emerged from the studies: Physical health problems, mental health problems; and healthcare services utilisation. Of the 14 included studies, nine studied and reported physical health problems such as sexually transmitted infections, injuries and disabilities, respiratory and cardiac diseases. Five studies explored mental health problems such as psychotic disorders, mood disorders, self-harm and suicidal behaviour. Only five studies investigated utilisation of different types of health care services among homeless people. CONCLUSIONS Evidence shows that homeless adults suffered from a range of physical and mental health problems, and underutilisation of health care services. However, there is lack of information on the complex interrelationship between homelessness and health, as well as differences in prevalence of health problems among the various sub-groups of homeless. There is also lack of information regarding utilisation other important healthcare services such as mental health services, alcohol and drugs services, and accident and emergency service, and future researches should address that. Also, attention should be given to intervention models for complex and effective physical and psychiatric care as well as social support to address the homeless people's health vulnerabilities.","output":"Health problems and healthcare service utilisation amongst homeless adults in Africa- a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with cardiac arrhythmias. Several electrocardiographic markers have been used to predict the risk of arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19. We aim to investigate the electrocardiographic (ECG) ventricular repolarization indices in patients with COVID-19. METHODOLOGY We performed a comprehensive systematic literature search from PubMed, EuropePMC, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Database, and Google Scholar Preprint Servers. The primary endpoints of this search were: Tp-e (T-peak-to-T-end) interval, QTd (QT dispersion), and Tp-e/QTc ratio in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 from inception up until August 2020. RESULTS There were a total of 241 patients from 2 studies. Meta-analysis showed that Tp-e/QTc ratio was higher in COVID-19 group (mean difference 0.02 [0.01, 0.02], p < 0.001; I2: 18%,). Tp-e interval was more prolonged in COVID-19 group (mean difference 7.76 [3.11, 12.41], p < 0.001; I2: 80%) compared to control group. QT dispersion (QTd) also was increased in COVID-19 group (mean difference 1.22 [0.61, 1.83], p < 0.001 ; I2:30%).

However, in up to 20% of the cases, mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers results in poor angiographic outcomes, with Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scores 2a. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether thrombus attenuation on the initial CT scan can predict the angiographic outcome of the recanalization procedure in MCA occlusions. MATERIALS AND METHODS The data of 70 patients with acute MCA occlusions who underwent endovascular treatment with stent retrievers in our department were included. We analyzed thrombus attenuations, angiographic outcome, and periprocedural thrombus fragmentation. RESULTS The mean thrombus attenuation was 49.8  7.8 HU and the mean difference from the attenuation of the contralateral MCA was 9.9  8.0 HU. There were no significant differences in the thrombus attenuations of occlusions that were successfully recanalized (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b) and those that were not. Neither were there significant correlations of thrombus attenuations and periprocedural thrombus fragmentations that occurred in 64.3%. We found a nonsignificantly higher rate of recanalizations with modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b when the difference from the attenuation of the contralateral MCA was between 1-20 HU. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to results of other revascularization procedures as published in a recent study, the angiographic result of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers is not predicted by thrombus attenuation.","output":"Thrombus attenuation does not predict angiographic results of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Omicron, the latest SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC), first appeared in Africa in November 2021. At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers ([Formula: see text]) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: ?0.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high [Formula: see text].

New serologic markers have proven accurate in diagnosing enteric fever, but whether they could be used to reliably estimate population-level incidence is unknown. We collected longitudinal blood samples from blood culture-confirmed enteric fever cases enrolled from surveillance studies in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Ghana and conducted cross-sectional sero-surveys in the catchment areas of each surveillance site. We used ELISAs to measure quantitative IgA and IgG antibody responses to Hemolysin E (HlyE) and S. Typhi lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We used Bayesian hierarchical models to fit two-phase power-function decay models to the longitudinal sero-responses among enteric fever cases and used the joint distributions of the peak antibody titers and decay rate to estimate population-level incidence rates from cross-sectional serosurveys. The longitudinal antibody kinetics for all antigen-isotypes were similar across countries and did not vary by clinical severity. The incidence of typhoidal Salmonella infection ranged between 41.2 per 100 person years (95% CI: 34.0-50.1) in Dhaka, Bangladesh to 5.8 (95% CI: 4.8-7.1) in Kavrepalanchok, Nepal and followed the same rank order as clinical incidence estimates.

Most often performed in a semi-supervised manner, such post-processors accept the peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) and corresponding feature vectors resulting from a database search, train a machine learning classifier, and recalibrate PSM scores based on the resulting trained parameters, often leading to significantly more identified peptides across q-value thresholds. However, current state-of-the-art post-processors rely on shallow machine learning methods, such as SVMs, gradient boosted decision trees, and linear discriminant analysis. In contrast, the powerful learning capabilities of deep models have displayed superior performance to shallow models in an ever-growing number of other fields. In this work, we show that deep neural networks (DNNs) significantly improve the recalibration of shotgun proteomics data compared to the most accurate and widely used post-processors, such as Percolator and PeptideProphet. Furthermore, we show that DNNs are able to adaptively analyze complex datasets and features for more accurate universal post-processing, leading to both improved Prosit analysis and markedly better recalibration of recently developed p-value scoring functions.","output":"Deep Semi-Supervised Learning Improves Universal Peptide Identification of Shotgun Proteomics Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tremendous changes have been witnessed in the post-COVID-19 world.

BCV-Ab and SVANOVIR(?) BRSV-Ab, respectively. We analyzed bulk tank milk samples from 360 herds in a low- and 360 herds in a high-prevalence area.

Epidemiological measures, social distancing, and limited access to medical care impair glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Also, type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for more severe form of coronavirus disease. A large proportion of diabetic patients are placed in foster families who also adapt to the new situation. The purpose of this study was to examine the manner and frequency of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are placed in foster families in the region of Brod-Posavina County. We established contact with patients suffering from type 2 diabetes situated in foster families and their caregivers. Measurement of glycemia was performed several times a day with regular notes and the data were supple-mented by an insight into the medical documentation of patients in the hospital information system. The study included 33 patients with type 2 diabetes. The relationship between HbA1C with fasting and postprandial glycemia was linear. There were no statistically significant differences in HbA1C regulation by type of therapy. There was a significant differ-ence in the number of complications according to the level of HbA1C (Hi square test = 25.982, p <.001). The number of complications generally increased as HbA1C regulation was poorer. During current COVID-19 pandemic, care for patients with type 2 diabetes is significantly limited.

There is also great heterogeneity in outcomes across states, necessitating assessments of the effects of COVID-19 on OD deaths on a state-by-state level. This report aims to analyze overall trends in OD deaths in Massachusetts during COVID-19. Design: Using individual-level death records in Massachusetts, we identified and analyzed OD mortality trends during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to 2018 and 2019. We analyzed the period between March 24 (stay-at-home order in 2020) and August 11 (latest reliable data). We also estimated the correlation between OD deaths and COVID-19 case fatality rates at the county level. Setting: Massachusetts. Participants: A total of 2,342 OD deaths were analyzed. Measurements: The outcomes studied were OD deaths and COVID-19 case fatality rates. Findings: OD deaths involving cocaine and amphetamines increased from 2019 to 2020, by 20% (276 vs. 330; P<0.01) and 79% (33 vs. 59; P<0.01), respectively, but were steady from 2018 to 2019. Heroin's presence continued to decrease (238 in 2018, 161 in 2019, 102 in 2020; P<0.001); however, fentanyl was present in more than 90% of OD deaths, reflecting its continued domination of the illicit opioid supply in Massachusetts.

We describe the epidemiological and laboratory data from one of the first such outbreaks in Ontario to assess factors associated with its severity, and the impact of progressive interventions for infection control over the course of the outbreak. METHODS: We obtained line list and outbreak data from the public health unit to describe resident and staff cases, severity and distribution of cases over time and within the outbreak facility. Where available, we obtained data on laboratory specimens from the Public Health Ontario Laboratory and performed whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of viral specimens from the outbreak. RESULTS: Among 65 residents of the long-term care home, 61 (94%) contracted SARS-CoV-2, with a case fatality rate of 45% (28/61). Among 67 initial staff, 34 (51%) contracted the virus and none died. When the outbreak was declared, 12 staff, 2 visitors and 9 residents had symptoms. Resident cases were located in 3 of 4 areas of the home. Phylogenetic analysis showed tight clustering of cases, with only 1 additional strain of genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 identified from a staff case in the third week of the outbreak. No cases were identified among 26 new staff brought into the home after full outbreak measures were implemented. INTERPRETATION: Rapid and undetected viral spread in a long-term care home led to high rates of infection among residents and staff. Progressive implementation of outbreak measures after the peak of cases prevented subsequent staff cases and are now part of long-term care outbreak policy in Ontario.","output":"Investigation of a severe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a long-term care home early in the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As soon as the scale of the coronavirus shock to the economy became clear, the UK government introduced three policies to protect directly household incomes: a Job Retention Scheme, to pay the wages of employees who were temporarily furloughed; a Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, to give grants to established self-employed people whose businesses had been affected; and a package of increases to entitlements to social security benefits, with Universal Credit at the core, that bolstered the UKs means-tested safety net.

The nsp14 protein of SARS-CoV-2 houses a 3 to 5 exoribonuclease activity responsible for removing mismatches that arise during genome duplication. A homology model of nsp10-nsp14 complex was used to carry out in silico screening to identify molecules among natural products, or FDA approved drugs that can potentially inhibit the activity of nsp14. This exercise showed that ritonavir might bind to the exoribonuclease active site of the nsp14 protein. A model of the SARS-CoV-2-nsp10-nsp14 complex bound to substrate RNA showed that the ritonavir binding site overlaps with that of the 3 nucleotide of substrate RNA. A comparison of the calculated energies of binding for RNA and ritonavir suggested that the drug may bind to the active site of nsp14 with significant affinity. It is, therefore, possible that ritonavir may prevent association with substrate RNA and thus inhibit the exoribonuclease activity of nsp14. Overall, our computational studies suggest that ritonavir may serve as an effective inhibitor of the nsp14 protein. nsp14 is known to attenuate the inhibitory effect of drugs that function through premature termination of viral genome replication.

Remdesivir has got FDA approval as the first COVID-19 anti-viral agent in adult and paediatric patients (aged 12 years and weighing at least 40 kg) requiring hospitalization. Objective: The present prospective, observational, cross sectional study was planned to evaluate the impact of early initiation of Remdesivir on clinical outcomes in moderate to severe COVID 19 patients requiring ICU care. Materials and Methods: In this study, 100 consecutive symptomatic RT-PCR positive COVID 19 patients requiring admission to Intensive care unit based on predefined criteria were included for evaluation. All such moderate to severely ill patients were given Remdesivir intravenously as a 200-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by a 100-mg maintenance dose for the next four days along with other standard care. The main outcome measure analysed was the impact of early initiation of Remdesivir on recovery assessed by number of days in hospital, recovery, biochemical improvements and death. Results: Out of total 100 patients, 84 patients recovered with Remdesivir along with supportive treatment and were discharged from the hospital. Mean age of patients at presentation 53.5 14.8 years with 5:1 male preponderance. Mean duration of hospital stay was 11.6  5.9 days. D-dimer, CRP, Ferritin, IL-6 decreased significantly post treatment with P values <0.05, <0.001, <0.001, <0.01 respectively when compared to values at admission. No significant side effects were seen with remdesivir infusion. Conclusion: This real-world experience suggests that in the subset of hospitalized patients with moderate to severe pneumonia, early use of Remdesivir can lead to better clinical outcomes and help in reduction of associated mortality and morbidity of COVID-19. ? 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

PURPOSE Esmolol, dual sequential defibrillation, vector change defibrillation, and left stellate ganglion block are presented and reviewed for the treatment of refractory ventricular fibrillation. SUMMARY Although no formal definition has been established for refractory ventricular fibrillation, the literature describes it as a pulseless ventricular arrhythmia that persists despite 3 standard defibrillation attempts, administration of amiodarone 300 mg intravenously, and provision of three 1-mg intravenous doses of epinephrine. Evolving literature surrounding resuscitation in this particular subset of cardiac arrest challenges the efficacy of traditional therapies, such as epinephrine, and suggests that other treatment modalities may improve outcomes. Case reports, case series, and small retrospective studies have pointed to benefit when utilizing a variety of therapies, namely, esmolol, dual sequential defibrillation, vector change defibrillation, or left stellate ganglion block, in patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation arrest. CONCLUSION A mounting, although limited, body of evidence suggests that esmolol, dual sequential defibrillation, vector change defibrillation, or left stellate ganglion block may be effective at terminating refractory ventricular fibrillation and improving patient outcomes. Further evidence is required before these therapies can be adopted as standard practice; however, as key members of the code response team, it is imperative for pharmacists to be familiar with the supporting evidence, safety considerations, and logistical challenges of utilizing these treatments during arrest.","output":"Current and investigational therapies for the treatment of refractory ventricular fibrillation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To identify the relationship between pathologic electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns, clinical and neuroradiological abnormalities, and outcome in hospitalized patients with acute encephalopathy. This 5-year cohort study was performed at an academic tertiary care center.

Clinical characteristics, blood tests and neuroimaging were compared among groups. Associations between EEG patterns and structural and non-structural abnormalities were calculated. Glasgow Outcome Score >3 at discharge was defined as favorable and 1C3 as unfavorable outcome. In multivariable analyses, theta was associated with brain atrophy (OR 2.6, p = 0.020), theta/delta with intracerebral hemorrhages (OR 6.8, p = 0.005), FIRDA with past cerebrovascular accidents (OR 2.7, p = 0.004), TWs with liver or multi-organ failure (OR 6, p = 0.004; OR 4, p = 0.039), and delta activity with alcohol/drug abuse with or without intoxication, and HIV infection (OR 3.8, p = 0.003; OR 9, p = 0.004).

Osteoblast ablation triggers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, which are needed for successful macrophage recruitment. Excess glucocorticoid signaling as it occurs during the stress response inhibits macrophage recruitment, maximum speed and changes the macrophage phenotype. Although osteoblast loss is compensated for within a day by contribution of committed osteoblasts, macrophages continue to populate the region.

In general, viruses tend to be restricted to the natural host species which they infect. From time to time viruses cross the host\\\\range barrier expanding their host range. However, in very rare cases cross\\\\species transfer is followed by the establishment and persistence of a virus in the new host species, which may result in disease. Recent examples of viruses that have crossed the species barrier from animal reservoirs to humans are hantavirus, haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses, Nipah and Hendra viruses, avian influenza virus (AI), monkeypox virus, and the SARS\\\\associated coronavirus (SARS\\\\CoV). The opportunities for cross\\\\species transfer of mammalian viruses have increased in recent years due to increased contact between humans and animal reservoirs. However, it is difficult to predict when such events will take place since the viral adaptation that is needed to accomplish this is multifactorial and stochastic.

Iran has used a stringent package of preventive health measures to mitigate the spread of infection, which however has negatively affected individuals' physical and psychological health. This study aimed at examining whether physical-activity (PA) behavior, anxiety, well-being, and sleep-quality changed in response to the COVID-19-related public health restrictions enforced in Iran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was disseminated to adults residing in Iran from November 17, 2020, to February 13, 2021 (~88 days), during Iran's strictest public health restrictions. Main outcome measures included Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, General Anxiety Disorder-7, Mental Health Continuum-Short Form, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. RESULTS: A total of 3,323 adults (mean age 3011 years, 54.3% female) participated in the survey. Firstly, the restrictions generally reduced PA behavior: (a) among inactive participants (IPs), 60.6% became less active vs. 5.1% who became more active; and (b) among active participants (APs), 49.9% became less active vs. 22.8% who became more active. Secondly, PA behavior was associated with higher well-being and sleep quality during the restrictions: (a) APs reported higher (or lower) levels of well-being and sleep quality (or anxiety) than did IPs; and (b) among IPs as well as among APs, the more active the participants, the greater (or lower) the levels of well-being and sleep quality (or anxiety).

However, there are also some problems caused by EHRs, such as the growing use of copy-and-paste and templates, resulting in EHRs of low quality in content. In order to minimize data redundancy in different documents, Harvard Medical School and Mayo Clinic organized a national natural language processing (NLP) clinical challenge (n2c2) on clinical semantic textual similarity (ClinicalSTS) in 2019. The task of this challenge is to compute the semantic similarity among clinical text snippets. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to investigate novel methods to model ClinicalSTS and analyze the results. METHODS: We propose a semantically enhanced text matching model for the 2019 n2c2/Open Health NLP (OHNLP) challenge on ClinicalSTS. The model includes 3 representation modules to encode clinical text snippet pairs at different levels: (1) character-level representation module based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to tackle the out-of-vocabulary problem in NLP; (2) sentence-level representation module that adopts a pretrained language model bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) to encode clinical text snippet pairs; and (3) entity-level representation module to model clinical entity information in clinical text snippets. In the case of entity-level representation, we compare 2 methods. One encodes entities by the entity-type label sequence corresponding to text snippet (called entity I), whereas the other encodes entities by their representation in MeSH, a knowledge graph in the medical domain (called entity II). RESULTS: We conduct experiments on the ClinicalSTS corpus of the 2019 n2c2/OHNLP challenge for model performance evaluation. The model only using BERT for text snippet pair encoding achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.848. When character-level representation and entity-level representation are individually added into our model, the PCC increased to 0.857 and 0.854 (entity I)/0.859 (entity II), respectively. When both character-level representation and entity-level representation are added into our model, the PCC further increased to 0.861 (entity I) and 0.868 (entity II).

Patients were included in the study if they had a COICA with ischemic symptoms refractory to medical therapy. Carotid artery occlusion was defined as 100% cross-sectional occlusion of the vessel lumen as documented on CTA or MRA and confirmed by digital subtraction angiography.RESULTSFour types (A-D) of radiographic COICA were identified. Types A and B were more amenable to safe revascularization than types C and D. Recanalization was successful at a rate of 68.75% (22/32 COICAs; type A: 8/8; type B: 8/8; type C: 4/8; type D: 2/8). The perioperative complication rate was 18.75% (6/32; type A: 0/8 [0%]; type B: 1/8 [12.50%]; type C: 3/8 [37.50%], type D: 2/8 [25.00%]). None of these complications led to permanent morbidity or death. Twenty (64.52%) of 31 subjects had improvement in their symptoms at the 2-6 months' follow-up. A statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was noted in 17/21 (80.95%) patients who had successful revascularization, which persisted on follow-up (p = 0.0001). The remaining 10 subjects in whom revascularization failed had no significant changes in SBP (p = 0.73).CONCLUSIONSThe pilot study suggested that our proposed classification of COICA may be useful as an adjunctive guide to determine the technical feasibility and safety of revascularization for symptomatic COICA using endovascular techniques. Additionally, successful revascularization may lead to a significant decrease in SBP postprocedure. A Phase 2b trial in larger cohorts to assess the efficacy of endovascular revascularization using our COICA classification is warranted.","output":"Feasibility, safety, and changes in systolic blood pressure associated with endovascular revascularization of symptomatic and chronically occluded cervical internal carotid artery using a newly suggested radiographic classification of chronically occluded cervical internal carotid artery: pilot stud"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific therapeutic agents and substantial mortality. It is critical to find new treatments. Objective: To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of 5 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao2/Fio2 <300; and mechanical ventilation. All 5 were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion. The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020; final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020. Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Exposures: Patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody (IgG) binding titer greater than 1:1000 (end point dilution titer, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and a neutralization titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that had been obtained from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19. Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes of body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), Pao2/Fio2, viral load, serum antibody titer, routine blood biochemical index, ARDS, and ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) supports before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Results: All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion. Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.","output":"Treatment of 5 Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 With Convalescent Plasma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"P2, an RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP), is encoded on the largest of the three segments of the double-stranded RNA genome of cystoviruses. P2 performs the dual tasks of replication and transcription de novo on single-stranded RNA templates, and plays a critical role in the viral life-cycle. Work over the last few decades has yielded a wealth of biochemical and structural information on the functional regulation of P2, on its role in the spatiotemporal regulation of RNA synthesis and its variability across the Cystoviridae family. These range from atomic resolution snapshots of P2 trapped in functionally significant states, in complex with catalytic/structural metal ions, polynucleotide templates and substrate nucleoside triphosphates, to P2 in the context of viral capsids providing structural insight into the assembly of supramolecular complexes and regulatory interactions therein. They include in vitro biochemical studies using P2 purified to homogeneity and in vivo studies utilizing infectious core particles. Recent advances in experimental techniques have also allowed access to the temporal dimension and enabled the characterization of dynamics of P2 on the sub-nanosecond to millisecond timescale through measurements of nuclear spin relaxation in solution and single molecule studies of transcription from seconds to minutes.

This has been coined \\"trained immunity\\" and diverges with the perception that the innate immune system is primitive, non-specific, and reacts to novel and recurrent antigen exposures similarly. The \\"exposome\\" is the cumulative exposures (diet, exercise, environmental exposure, vaccination, genetics, etc.) an individual has experienced and provides a mechanism for the establishment of immune training or immunotolerance. It is becoming increasingly clear that trained immunity constitutes a delicate balance between the dose, duration, and order of exposures. Upon innate stimuli, trained immunity or tolerance is shaped by epigenetic and metabolic changes that alter hematopoietic stem cell lineage commitment and responses to infection. Due to the immunomodulatory role of the exposome, understanding innate immune training is critical for understanding why some individuals exhibit protective phenotypes while closely related individuals may experience immunotolerant effects (e.g., the order of exposure can result in completely divergent immune responses). Research on the exposome and trained immunity may be leveraged to identify key factors for improving vaccination development, altering inflammatory disease development, and introducing potential new prophylactic treatments, especially for diseases such as COVID-19, which is currently a major health issue for the world.

RECENT FINDINGS: Approximately 60-70% of metastatic pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas express the noradrenaline transporter in their cell membranes. High specific activity iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine has been recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas that express the noradrenaline transporter, in patients aged  12 years.

However, there is limited information regarding patients' satisfaction with TeleNP. This report presents satisfaction survey data from a diverse, clinical sample who received TeleNP during the coronavirus disease pandemic. METHOD: A total of 43 adult patients (30.2% Hispanic/Latinx, 32.6% Black), aged 24-75, who received TeleNP as part of routine clinical care participated in a postassessment satisfaction survey. Responses were analyzed qualitatively and via nonparametric comparisons based on demographic factors. RESULTS: Given options of \\"Not Satisfied,\\" \\"Somewhat Satisfied,\\" \\"Satisfied,\\" or \\"Very Satisfied,\\" 97.7% of patients reported satisfaction with their visit as well as the visit length, and 80% felt the visit met their needs (\\"Good\\" + \\"Very Good\\"). There were no significant differences in responses based on age, race/ethnicity, sex, or education.

The current study was conducted to evaluate contamination amount, duration, the distance of aerosol, and splatter produced after cavity preparation using a two-hole and four-hole handpiece. The study was performed on a dental manikin in a dental simulation laboratory at the College of Dentistry, King Faisal University Al Ahsa. The dental manikin was set to a reclined position to simulate the clinical operatory position of the patient for dental restorative procedures. Aerosol and splatter were collected on Grade 1 qualitative cotton cellulose filter paper. These were placed on adhesive tape extending from the headrest of the dental manikin in six different directions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 oclock) for up to 60 inches and on certain positions of the operator and assistant such as the chest, head, forearms, upper leg, and inside facemask. Class V cavity preparation was done by the principal investigator at a specific time of 3 min on tooth #11 using a two-hole high-speed handpiece, then on the next day, Class V cavity preparation was performed on tooth #21 by a four-hole handpiece. High volume suction was used throughout the cavity preparation. Immediately after cavity preparation, the first filter paper disc was replaced with new ones in all positions. The second set of filter papers was removed after 30 min. Transparent grids were used to count the contamination area on the filter paper disc. No statistically significant difference was found in the mean amount of aerosol and splatter produced by both handpieces, however, a statistically significant difference was found in an amount of aerosol and splatter produced at a 12, 24, and 36 inches distance immediately after cavity preparation and 30 min after cavity preparation, regardless of the type of handpiece used.

Because of limited resources and infrastructure in some communities, implementation of interventions to promote a healthy diet is challengingwhich may exacerbate health disparities by region (urban/rural) and ethnicity (AIs/other populations). It is critical to adapt existing evidence-based healthy food budgeting, purchasing, and cooking programs to be relevant to underserved populations with a high burden of diabetes and related complications. The Cooking for Health Study will work in partnership with an AI community in South Dakota to develop a culturally-adapted 12-month distance-learning-based healthy food budgeting, purchasing, and cooking intervention to improve diet among AI adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The study will enroll 165 AIs with physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes who reside on the reservation. Participants will be randomized to an intervention or control arm. The intervention arm will receive a 12-month distance-learning curriculum adapted from Cooking Matters? that focuses on healthy food budgeting, purchasing, and cooking skills. In-person assessments at baseline, month 6 and month 12 will include completion of the Nutrition Assessment Shared Resources Food Frequency Questionnaire and a survey to assess frequency of healthy and unhealthy food purchases. Primary outcomes of interest are: (1) change in self-reported intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs); and (2) change in the frequency of healthy and unhealthy food purchases. Secondary outcomes include: (1) change in self-reported food budgeting skills; (2) change in self-reported cooking skills; and (3) a mixed-methods process evaluation to assess intervention reach, fidelity, satisfaction, and dose delivered/received. DISCUSSION: Targeted and sustainable interventions are needed to promote optimal health in rural AI communities. If effective, this intervention will reduce intake of SSBs and the purchase of unhealthy foods; increase the purchase of healthy foods; and improve healthy food budgeting and cooking skills among AIs with type 2 diabetes C a population at high risk of poor health outcomes.

The infection rate constant is derived using collision rate theory and shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime. In the second part, we have emulated the respiratory droplets responsible for disease transmission as salt solution droplets and computed their evaporation time, accounting for droplet cooling, heat and mass transfer, and finally, crystallization of the dissolved salt. The model output favourably compares with the experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of pure water and salt solution, respectively, ensuring fidelity of the model. The droplet evaporation/desiccation time is, indeed, dependent on ambient temperature and is also a strong function of relative humidity.

During the first wave, healthcare in children was strongly reduced due to safety regulations and reduced hospital capacity for non-COVID care. This, and fear of COVID-19 could have led to delayed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) healthcare, and delayed or even missed diagnoses. This has already been demonstrated in adult IBD patients in the Netherlands1, but not yet in the paediatric population. This is of importance, as in children, diagnostic delay is associated with higher rates of strictures, fistulising complications, and growth delay2. Therefore, this study aims to determine the impact of COVID-19 on IBD-related procedures and new IBD diagnoses in children in the Netherlands. Methods: In this nationwide retrospective cohort study, a search was conducted in the nationwide pseudonymized pathology registry of the Netherlands (PALGA), with complete national coverage. Using retrieval terms for ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, IBD unclassified and corresponding synonyms, all IBD related pathology reports (resection specimens or intestinal biopsies) from January 2018 to December 2020 in children age 1-18 were selected. Patients with a recognized diagnosis of IBD were eligible for inclusion, which was scored independently by two authors based on all reports. All IBD-related procedures (endoscopies and intestinal resections) were identified. Monthly frequencies of procedures and new IBD diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands (March 11, 2020 - December 31, 2020) were compared to the average monthly frequencies of 2018-2019. Results: After exclusion of non-IBD related reports, 2161 IBD-related procedures were identified between January 2018 and December 2020. The average number of monthly IBD procedures in 2018-2019 was 59.8, whereas in 2020 this was 60.6 procedures per month, reflecting a 0.8% increase (Figure 1). In 2020, the number of new IBD diagnoses was 456, similar to the 458 new IBD diagnoses in 2018-2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic the weekly number of new diagnoses was 8.8, while between January 2018 and March 2020 this was 8.5 (Figure 2). A slight reduction in monthly IBD-related resections was observed (2.7 vs. 3.5). Conclusion: Despite the reduction in regular healthcare in children in the Netherlands due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no reduction was observed in IBD-related endoscopies and surgeries during the pandemic in the Netherlands. This reassuring evidence demonstrates that pediatric IBD healthcare remained unchanged, thus not delaying diagnosis of new IBD patients or treatment of severe disease flares.","output":"No decrease in number of new Inflammatory Bowel Disease diagnoses in children in the Netherlands during the Covid-19 pandemic: A nationwide retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If all physicians are detectives, using their skills to track down what ails body and mind, then epidemiologists are medicine's social detectives, using their training to understand the great calamities of population health.

Among the possible mechanisms of AgNPs are their ability to generate reactive oxygen species, which was further evaluated in vitro and correlates well with cellular accumulation and overall activity of AgNPs. Furthermore, we confirmed the anticancer efficacy of the most potent Ag@TSC2 in hiPSC-derived colonic organoids and demonstrated that the NPs are biocompatible and applicable in vivo. A pilot study in BALB/c mice evidenced that the treatment with Ag@TSC2 resulted in temporary (>60 days) remission of CT26 tumors.","output":"Synthesis and Characterization of Size- and Charge-Tunable Silver Nanoparticles for Selective Anticancer and Antibacterial Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Document: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased attention to several issues regarding the provision of public water services These include long-standing water-rate affordability concerns, the importance of clean water to public health, and the financial sustainability of some public water systems (whether publicly or privately owned) The spread of COVID-19 has raised specific concerns regarding the continuity of residential water services needed to support hand-washing and other public health measures--particularly as more customers may become unable to pay water bills because of job losses or reduced income At the same time, water service providers are projecting substantial revenue losses related to COVID-19 Policy options being discussed to alleviate such impacts and help ensure the continuity of water service include providing temporary assistance to households and/or water systems COVID-19 (Disease);Water-supply;Infrastructure (Economics)","output":"COVID-19 and Public Water Service Continuity [Updated May 13, 2020]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has changed todays routines in a variety of fields such as society, economics, health, etc. It is surely known that the most powerful weapon to fight against the disease is the social distancing.

With such a large amount, the fluctuation in tight oil production can substantially influence the balance of the world oil market. However, due to the short history of large-scale tight oil development, the influence of oil prices on tight oil supply is not well studied. This paper analyzes the price responsiveness of tight oil supply in the United States using an econometric method and well-level play-specific panel data. The result is further used to estimate the influence of COVID-19 on tight oil production. The regression results show that the oil price elasticity was 2.0 for tight oil drilling and 0.5 for tight oil production in 2010C2016. The gas price elasticity is insignificant in both cases. Forecasts using the estimated econometric model show that tight oil production will decrease by 1.3C2.3 million barrels per day (16C28%) under different price scenarios. However, tight oil is not likely to be a swing producer and OPEC will continue to lead production cuts under low prices.

The genes katG, inhA, fabG1, and the intergenic region oxyR'-ahpC were considered in this review. Fifty-two articles were included describing 9,306 clinical isolates (5,804 INHR, 3,502 INHS) from 31 countries. The three most frequently mutated loci continue to be katG315 (4,271), inhA-15 (787), and inhA-8 (106). However, the diagnostic value of inhA-8 is far lower than previously thought, only appearing in 25 (0.4%) INHR isolates lacking the first two mutations. We catalogued 45 new loci (29 katG, nine inhA, seven ahpC) associated with INH resistance and identified 59 loci (common to this and previous reviews) as a reliable basis for molecular diagnostics. Including all observed mutations provides a cumulative sensitivity of 85.6%. In 14.4% of resistant isolates no mechanism of resistance was detected, making them likely to escape molecular detection, and in case of mono INH resistance likely to convert to MDR-TB. Integrating the information cataloged in this study into current diagnostic tools is essential for combating the emergence of MDR-TB, and its exclusion can lead to an unintended selection against common mechanisms and to diversifying evolution. Observation of many low-frequency resistance-conferring mutations points to an advantage of WGS for diagnostics.

However, the number of such switches is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest2. The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)3, we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibodies against the membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. The former, which incorporates a de novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder4, has a limit of detection of 15 pM and a luminescence signal 50-fold higher than the background level. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes, and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.","output":"De novo design of modular and tunable protein biosensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To analyze the antibody levels and dynamic changes in patients infected with 2019-novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV).

Epitope spreading, molecular mimicry, cryptic antigen, and bystander activation have been implicated as mechanisms responsible for activating self-reactive (SR) immune cells, ultimately leading to organ-specific autoimmune disease. Taking advantage of coronavirus JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV)-induced demyelination, this study demonstrates that the host also mounts counteractive measures to specifically limit expansion of endogenous SR T cells. In this model, immune-mediated demyelination is associated with induction of SR T cells after viral control. However, their decline during persisting infection, despite ongoing demyelination, suggests an active control mechanism. Antigen-specific IL-10-secreting CD4(+) T cells (Tr1) and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), both known to control autoimmunity and induced following JHMV infection, were assessed for their relative in vivo suppressive function of SR T cells. Ablation of Foxp3(+) Tregs in chronically infected DEREG mice significantly increased SR CD4(+) T cells within cervical lymph nodes (CLN), albeit without affecting their numbers or activation within the CNS compared to controls. In contrast, infected IL-27 receptor deficient (IL-27R(?/?)) mice, characterized by a drastic reduction of Tr1 cells, revealed that SR CD4(+) T cells in CLN remained unchanged but were specifically increased within the CNS. These results suggest that distinct Treg subsets limit SR T cells in the draining lymph nodes and CNS to maximize suppression of SR T-cell-mediated autoimmune pathology.

Compared to group 1, group 2 had larger values for all volume-dependent parameters (p < 0.001). The percentage of lesions had the strongest correlation with disease severity with a correlation coefficient of 0.495. In comparison, the correlation coefficient of semiquantitative score was 0.349. To classify the severity of COVID-19, area under the curve of the percentage of lesions was the highest (0.807; 95% confidence interval, 0.744-0.861: p < 0.001) and that of the quantitative CT parameters was significantly higher than that of the semiquantitative visual score (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The classification accuracy of quantitative CT parameters was significantly superior to that of semiquantitative visual score in terms of evaluating the severity of COVID-19.","output":"Assessment of the Severity of Coronavirus Disease: Quantitative Computed Tomography Parameters versus Semiquantitative Visual Score"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What is already known about this topic?

Dexamethasone (Dex) is a widely used anti-inflammatory corticosteroid medication that is structurally similar to cholesterol, a key component of LNPs. Here, we developed LNP formulations with anti-inflammatory properties by partially substituting cholesterol with Dex as a means to reduce inflammation. We demonstrated that Dex-incorporated LNPs effectively abrogated the induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) in vitro and significantly reduced its expression in vivo. Reduction of inflammation using this strategy improved in vivo mRNA expression in mice by 1.5-fold.

Apart from China, there are currently three other severely affected areas, namely Italy, South Korea, and Iran. This poses a huge threat to China's and even global public health security, challenges scientific research work such as disease surveillance and tracking, clinical treatment, and vaccine development, and it also brings huge uncertainty to the global economy. As of March 11, 2020, the epidemic situation in China is nearing its end, but the epidemic situation abroad is in the outbreak period. Italy has even taken measures to close the city nationwide, with a total of 118,020 cases of infection worldwide. 1.2 Method This article selects the data of newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 at home and abroad as the data sample. Among them: the data of newly confirmed cases abroad is represented by Italy, and the span is from February 13 to March 10. The data of newly confirmed cases at home are divided into two parts: Hubei Province and other provinces except Hubei Province, spanning from January 23 to March 3, and with February 12 as the cutting point, it is divided into two periods, the growth period and the recession period. The rescaled range (R / S) analysis method and the dimensionless fractal Hurst exponent are used to measure the correlation of time series to determine whether the time series conforms to the fractal Brownian motion, that is, a biased random process. Contrast analysis of the meaning of H value in different stages and different overall H values in the same stage. 1.3 Results Based on R / S analysis and calculated Hurst value of newly confirmed cases in Hubei and non-Hubei provinces, it was found that the H value of Hubei Province in the first stage was 0.574, which is greater than 0.5, indicating that the future time series has a positive correlation and Fractal characteristics; The H value in the second stage is 1.368, which is greater than 1, which indicates that the future epidemic situation is completely preventable and controllable, and the second stage has a downward trend characteristic, which indicates that there is a high probability that the future time series will decline. The H values of the first and second stages of non-Hubei Province are 0.223 and 0.387, respectively, which are both less than 0.5, indicating that the time series of confirmed cases in the future is likely to return to historical points, and the H value in the second stage is greater than that in the first stage, indicating that the time series of confirmed cases in the second stage is more long-term memory than the time series of confirmed cases in the first stage. The daily absolute number of newly confirmed cases in Italy was converted to the daily growth rate of confirmed cases to eliminate the volatility of the data. The H value was 1.853, which was greater than 1, indicating that the time series of future confirmed cases is similar to the trend of historical changes. The daily rate of change in cases will continue to rise. 1.4 Conclusion According to the different interpretation of the H value obtained by the R / S analysis method, hierarchical isolation measures are adopted accordingly. When the H value is greater than 0.5, it indicates that the development of the epidemic situation in the area has more long-term memory, that is, when the number of confirmed cases in the past increases rapidly, the probability of the time series of confirmed cases in the future will continue the historical trend. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate strict anti-epidemic measures in accordance with the actual conditions of various countries, to detect, isolate, and treat early to reduce the base of infectious agents.","output":"Analysis of Epidemic Situation of New Coronavirus Infection at Home and Abroad Based on Rescaled Range (R/S) Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivos A ativao da hemostasia  um elemento crtico da patognese da Covid-19.

Methods: A total of 64 cases of KOA diagnosed and treated from January 2020 to January 2021 were randomly divided into research group and control group, with 32 cases in each group. The control group was treated with PRP, and the research group took the prescription of the Bushen Huoxue method on the basis of the control group. The clinical efficacy was assessed according to the criteria in \\"the diagnosis and Treatment of osteoarthritis,\\" osteoarthritis index score and pain visual analogue score (VAS). Serum and articular fluid VAS, IL-1, IL-6, VEGF, and PGE-2 levels were detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The clinical effective rate of the research group was 93.8%, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (90.6%). There was no significant difference in the scores of osteoarthritis index between the two groups before treatment, but the scores of both groups decreased after treatment and was lower in the research group than those in the control group.

This study assesses SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence over the first epidemic wave in Canton Geneva, Switzerland, as well as biological and socio-economic risk factors for infection and symptoms associated with IgG seropositivity. Methods and findings: Between April 6 and June 30, 2020, former participants of a yearly representative cross-sectional survey of the 20-75-year-old population of the canton of Geneva were invited to participate in a seroprevalence study, along with household members five years and older. We collected blood and tested it for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins G (IgG). Questionnaires were self-administered. We estimated seroprevalence with a Bayesian model accounting for test performance and sampling design. We included 8344 participants (53.5% women, mean age 46.9 years). The population-level seroprevalence over the 12-week study period was 7.8 % (95% Credible Interval (CrI) 6.8-8.9), accounting for sex, age and household random effects. Seroprevalence was highest among 18-49 year olds (9.5%, 95%CrI 8.1-10.9), with young children (5-9 years) and those >65 years having significantly lower seroprevalence (4.3% and 4.7-5.4% respectively). Men were more likely to be seropositive than women (relative risk 1.2, 95%CrI 1.1-1.4). Odds of seropositivity were reduced for female retirees (0.46, 95%CI 0.23-0.93) and unemployed men (0.35, 95%CI 0.13-1.0) compared to employed individuals, and for current smokers (0.36, 95%CI 0.23-0.55) compared to never-smokers. We found no significant association between occupation, level of education, neighborhood income and the risk of being seropositive. Symptoms most strongly associated with seropositivity were anosmia/dysgeusia, loss of appetite, fever, fatigue and myalgia and/or arthralgia. Thirteen percent of seropositive participants reported no symptoms. Conclusions: Our results confirm a low population seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after the first wave in Geneva, a region hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Socioeconomic factors were not associated with seropositivity in this sample. The elderly and young children were less frequently seropositive, though it is not clear how biology and behaviors shape these differences.

These patients are vulnerable and susceptible to the environment surrounding them, yet there is little information available on indoor air quality and factors affecting it within a PICU. To address this gap in knowledge we conducted continuous indoor and outdoor airborne particle concentration measurements over a two-week period at the Royal Children's Hospital PICU in Brisbane, Australia, and we also collected 82 bioaerosol samples to test for the presence of bacterial and viral pathogens. Our results showed that both 24-hour average indoor particle mass (PM10) (0.6C2.2gm?3, median: 0.9gm?3) and submicrometer particle number (PN) (0.1C2.8103 pcm?3, median: 0.67103 pcm?3) concentrations were significantly lower (p<0.01) than the outdoor concentrations (6.7C10.2gm?3, median: 8.0gm?3 for PM10 and 12.1C22.2103 pcm?3, median: 16.4103 pcm?3 for PN). In general, we found that indoor particle concentrations in the PICU were mainly affected by indoor particle sources, with outdoor particles providing a negligible background. We identified strong indoor particle sources in the PICU, which occasionally increased indoor PN and PM10 concentrations from 0.1103 to 100103 pcm?3, and from 2gm?3 to 70gm?3, respectively. The most substantial indoor particle sources were nebulization therapy, tracheal suction and cleaning activities. The average PM10 and PN emission rates of nebulization therapy ranged from 1.29 to 7.41mgmin?1 and from 1.20 to 3.96pmin?1 1011, respectively. Based on multipoint measurement data, it was found that particles generated at each location could be quickly transported to other locations, even when originating from isolated single-bed rooms. The most commonly isolated bacterial genera from both primary and broth cultures were skin commensals while viruses were rarely identified.

To achieve this, it is necessary to stamp the surface to be measured with a regular pattern of points, then a digital image processing is done to obtain the labels of the circles of the pattern. After this, a semi-automatic search is made in the labels of both images to correlate all of them and perform the triangulation. DIC is used to corroborate the correspondence between points and verify the accuracy and efficiency of the developed method. This allows the 3D reconstruction of the sheet with a minimum of information and provides more efficiency and a great benefit in computational cost.

Using gas-soluble PDMS as a centrifugal microfluidic device material, the sample can be dragged in any arbitrary direction using vacuum-driven force, as opposed to in a single direction, without adding further actuation components. The vacuum-driven force allows the device to avoid the formation of air bubbles and exhibit high tolerance in the surface condition. The device was then used for sample metering and sample transferring. In addition, centrifugal force was used for sample loading and sample mixing. In this study, a series of ten-fold serial dilutions ranging from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] with about 8 L in each chamber was achieved, while the serial dilution ratio and chamber volume could easily be altered by changing the geometrical designs of the device. As a proof of concept of our hybrid approach with the centrifugal and vacuum-driven forces, ten-fold serial dilutions of a cDNA (complementary DNA) sample were prepared using the device. Then, the diluted samples were collected by fine needles and subject to a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and the results were found to be in good agreement with those for samples prepared by manual pipetting.","output":"An Integrated Centrifugal Degassed PDMS-Based Microfluidic Device for Serial Dilution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For many Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks audio features as spectrograms show better results than Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), but in practice they are hard to use due to a complex dimensionality of a feature space.

Once available, vaccine is gradually produced, evoking the question on how to distribute it best. While official vaccination guidelines largely focus on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first (e.g. to risk groups), here we propose a generic strategy for their distribution in time and space, which sequentially prioritizes regions with a high local infection growth rate. To demonstrate this strategy, we develop an agent-based model describing the time-evolution of infection patterns and their response to vaccination. For heterogeneous infection patterns, the proposed strategy at least halves the number of deaths in our simulations compared to the standard practice of distributing vaccines proportionally to the population density. This applies for a wide range of reproduction numbers and vaccine production rates and might stimulate discussions on the importance of the spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines for official guidelines.","output":"Strategic Spatiotemporal Vaccine Distribution Halves Deaths due to an Infectious Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While public green spaces (PGS) are opined to be central in the pandemic recovery, higher accessibility to PGS also mean a higher risk of infection spread from the raised possibility of people encountering each other This study explores the distributive effects of accessibility of PGS on the COVID-19 cases distribution using a geo-spatially varying network-based risk model at the borough level in London The coupled effect of social deprivation with accessibility of the PGS was used as an adjustment factor to identify vulnerability Results indicate that highly connected green spaces with high choice measure were associated with high risk of infection transmission Socially deprived areas demonstrated higher possibility of infection spread even with moderate connectivity of the PGS The study demonstrated that only applying a uniform social distancing measure without characterising the infrastructure and social conditions may lead to higher infection transmission","output":"Spatial distributive effects of public green space and COVID-19 infection in London"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Several outpatient COVID-19 therapies have reduced hospitalization in randomized controlled trials. The choice of therapy may depend on drug efficacy, toxicity, pricing, availability, and access to administration infrastructure. To facilitate comparative decision making, we evaluated the efficacy of each treatment in clinical trials and then estimated the associated cost per hospitalization prevented. Methods: Wherever possible, we obtained relative risk for hospitalization from published randomized controlled trials. Otherwise, we extracted data from press releases, conference abstracts, government submissions, or preprints. If more than one study was published, the results were meta-analyzed. Using relative risk, we estimated the number needed to treat (NNT), assuming a baseline hospitalization risk of 5%. Drug pricing was based on Canadian formularies, government purchases, or manufacturer estimates. Administrative and societal costs were not included. Results will be updated online as new studies emerge or final publication numbers become available. Results: At a 5% risk of hospitalization the estimated NNTs were: 87 for colchicine, 80 for fluvoxamine, 72 for inhaled corticosteroids, 24 for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, 25 for sotrovimab, 24 for remdesivir, 29 for casirivimab/imdevimab, 29 for bamlanivimab/etesevimab and 52 for molnupiravir. Colchicine, fluvoxamine, inhaled corticosteroids, and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir had cost per hospitalization prevented point estimates below the CIHI estimated cost of hospitalization ($23000).

Our hospital-based registry for the year 2017 to 2018 showed that esophageal cancer constituted 22.7% of annual caseload. Most of our patients present in advanced stages. The aim of this article was to study the role of hormonal receptors in patients with esophageal cancer. Methods This is a single-institution, prospective, observational study in patients with esophageal carcinoma. Hormonal receptors (estrogen receptor [ER]- and progesterone receptors) were studied in tumor tissue. Of 160 patients, receptor status was analyzed in 133 patients. Chi-square test was used for the correlation of categorical variables. The value of p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results A total of 133 patients was taken into the study of which 96 were males and 37 were females. The mean age of patients was 52 years. Carcinoma esophagus was predominantly seen in males. Estrogen and progesterone receptors were positive in 9.02 and 4.51% of the study population, respectively. Patients with hormonal receptor positivity presented with poor functional status, higher grades of dysphagia, higher stage, and most of the tumors were poorly differentiated with statistically significant p -values. Conclusion Despite recent advances in various fields of oncology, outcomes of esophageal carcinoma have not improved significantly. Hence, a study of new pathways of pathogenesis in carcinogenesis of esophageal carcinoma is essential. Few recent evidences including our study shows that the hormonal milieu is responsible in the pathogenesis of carcinoma esophagus.

Research QuestionThe objective of the study is to delineate the clinical profile, predictors of disease progression, and 30-day mortality from ARDS using the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse. Study Design and MethodsAnalysis of a historical cohort of 7,816 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection between January 1, 2020, and August 1, 2020. Main outcomes were progression to ARDS and 30-day mortality from ARDS, respectively. ResultsThe cohort was comprised predominantly of men (94.5%) with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range [IQR] 60-74 years). 2,184 (28%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and 643 (29.4%) were diagnosed with ARDS. The median Charlson Index was 3 (IQR 1-5). Independent predictors of progression to ARDS were body mass index (BMI)[a?] 40 kg/m2, diabetes, lymphocyte counts<700x109/L, LDH>450 U/L, ferritin >862 ng/ml, C-reactive protein >11 mg/dL, and D-dimer >1.5 ug/ml. In contrast, the use of an anticoagulant lowered the risk of developing ARDS (OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.49-0.89]. Crude 30-day mortality rate from ARDS was 41% (95% CI 38%-45%). Risk of death from ARDS was significantly higher in those who developed acute renal failure and septic shock. Use of an anticoagulant was associated with two-fold reduction in mortality. Survival benefit was observed in patients who received corticosteroids and/or remdesivir but there was no advantage of combination therapy over either agent alone. ConclusionsAmong those hospitalized for COVID-19, nearly one in ten progressed to ARDS. Septic shock, and acute renal failure are the leading causes of death in these patients. Treatment with either remdesivir and corticosteroids reduced the risk of mortality from ARDS. All hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should be placed at a minimum on prophylactic doses of anticoagulation.","output":"Clinical Course and Outcome of Covid-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Data from a National Repository"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La velocidad de diseminacin del COVID-19 en el mundo llev a que los pases afectados cerraran sus fronteras y tomaran medidas de aislamiento social.

More decisively, mice that genetically lack the third component of complement or complement receptor 1 (CR1) and CR2 developed increased CNS virus burdens and were vulnerable to lethal infection at a low dose of WNV. Both C3-deficient and CR1- and CR2-deficient mice also had significant deficits in their humoral responses after infection with markedly reduced levels of specific anti-WNV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG.

Prior studies have described an association of increased self-reported colds and influenza-like symptoms with low ventilation but have not combined rigorous characterization of ventilation with assessment of laboratory confirmed infections. We report a study designed to fill this gap. We followed laboratory confirmed ARI rates and measured CO(2) concentrations for four months during the winter-spring of 2018 in two campus residence halls: (1) a high ventilation building (HVB) with a dedicated outdoor air system that supplies 100% of outside air to each dormitory room, and (2) a low ventilation building (LVB) that relies on infiltration as ventilation. We enrolled 11 volunteers for a total of 522 person-days in the HVB and 109 volunteers for 6069 person-days in the LVB, and tested upper-respiratory swabs from symptomatic cases and their close contacts for the presence of 44 pathogens using a molecular assay. We observed one ARI case in the HVB (0.70/person-year) and 47 in the LVB (2.83/person-year). Simultaneously, 154 CO(2) sensors distributed primarily in the dormitory rooms collected 668,390 useful data points from over 1 million recorded data points. Average and standard deviation of CO(2) concentrations were 1230 ppm and 408 ppm in the HVB, and 1492 ppm and 837 ppm in the LVB, respectively. Importantly, this study developed and calibrated multi-zone models for the HVB with 229 zones and 983 airflow paths, and for the LVB with 529 zones and 1836 airflow paths by using a subset of CO(2) data for model calibration. The models were used to calculate ventilation rates in the two buildings and potential for viral aerosol migration between rooms in the LVB. With doors and windows closed, the average ventilation rate was 12 L/s in the HVB dormitory rooms and 4 L/s in the LVB dormitory rooms. As a result, residents had on average 6.6 L/(s person) of outside air in the HVB and 2.3 L/(s person) in the LVB. LVB rooms located at the leeward side of the building had smaller average ventilation rates, as well as a somewhat higher ARI incidence rate and average CO(2) concentrations when compared to those values in the rooms located at the windward side of the building. Average ventilation rates in twenty LVB dormitory rooms increased from 2.3 L/s to 7.5 L/s by opening windows, 3.6 L/s by opening doors, and 8.8 L/s by opening both windows and doors. Therefore, opening both windows and doors in the LVB dormitory rooms can increase ventilation rates to the levels comparable to those in the HVB. But it can also have a negative effect on thermal comfort due to low outdoor temperatures.

Emerging meta-analyses suggest that the impact on anxiety/depression may have been transient, but much of the included literature has major methodological limitations. Addressing this topic rigorously requires longitudinal data of sufficient scope and scale, controlling for contextual variables, with baseline data immediately pre-pandemic. AIMS: To analyse self-report of symptom frequency from two largely UK-based longitudinal cohorts: Cohort 1 (N = 10,475, two time-points: winter pre-pandemic to UK first winter resurgence), and Cohort 2 (N = 10,391, two time-points, peak first wave to UK first winter resurgence). METHOD: Multinomial logistic regression applied at the item level identified sub-populations with greater probability of change in mental health symptoms. Permutation analyses characterised changes in symptom frequency distributions. Cross group differences in symptom stability were evaluated via entropy of response transitions. RESULTS: Anxiety was the most affected aspect of mental health. The profiles of change in mood symptoms was less favourable for females and older adults. Those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses showed substantially higher probability of very frequent symptoms pre-pandemic and elevated risk of transitioning to the highest levels of symptoms during the pandemic. Elevated mental health symptoms were evident across intra-COVID timepoints in Cohort 2. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that mental health has been negatively affected by the pandemic, including in a sustained fashion beyond the first UK lockdown into the first winter resurgence. Women, and older adults, were more affected relative to their own baselines. Those with diagnoses of psychiatric conditions were more likely to experience transition to the highest levels of symptom frequency.","output":"Item-level analysis of mental health symptom trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: Associations with age, sex and pre-existing psychiatric conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus has a capping modification at the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) to prevent its degradation by host nucleases.

Case fatality ratio is higher in men than women, with a ratio men/women equal to 1.7 in Italy, Spain, and Sweden and 1,4 in Germany. The ratio increases in the lower age groups. The analysis of the mortality data observed/expected in Italy in the same period with respect to 2015-2019 shows a comparable excess with SMR equal to 132 for men and 127 for women. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 affects both genders with some differences in the incidence, higher in women, and lethality, higher in men. These differences highlight the need to better understand the sex/gender and age interaction both for epidemiological surveillance and for a better gender-appropriateness of the ongoing prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. This would be possible if all health indicators (symptoms, past illnesses, primary and hospital-level health care, hospitalization, etc.) were provided by age and gender. Analysis of the causes of death could help to better understand the increase in mortality for both genders, in particular for women, for whom a lower lethality for COVID-19 appears from data.","output":"[Sex/gender differences in COVID-19 lethality: what the data say, and do not say]./ Differenze sesso/genere nella letalit COVID-19: cosa dicono e non dicono i dati"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Despite substantial geographic variation in Medicare per beneficiary spending in the US, little is known about the extent to which social determinants of health (SDoH) are associated with this variation. OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations between SDoH and county-level price-adjusted Medicare per beneficiary spending. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used county-level data on 2017 Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) spending, patient demographic characteristics (eg, age and gender) and clinical risk score, supply of health care resources (eg, number of hospital beds), and SDoH measures (eg, median income and unemployment rate) from multiple sources. Multivariable regressions were used to estimate the association of the variation in spending across quintiles with SDoH. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 2017 county-level price-adjusted Medicare Parts A and B spending per beneficiary. SDoH measures included socioeconomic position, race/ethnicity, social relationships, and residential and community context. RESULTS: Among 3038 counties with 33 495 776 Medicare FFS beneficiaries (18 352 336 [54.8%] women; mean [SD] age, 72 [1.5] years), mean Medicare price-adjusted per beneficiary spending for counties in the highest spending quintile was $3785 (95% CI, $3706-$3862) higher, or 49% higher, than spending for bottom-quintile counties (mean [SD] spending per beneficiary, $11 464 [735] vs $7679 [522]; P < .001). The total contribution (including through both direct and indirect pathways) of SDoH was 37.7% ($1428 of $3785) of this variation, compared with 59.8% ($2265 of $3785) by patient clinical risk, 14.5% ($549 of $3785) by supply of health care resources, and 19.8% ($751 of $3785) by patient demographic characteristics. When all factors were included within the same model, the direct contribution of SDoH was associated with 5.8% of the variation, compared with 4.6% by supply, 4.7% by patient demographic characteristics, and 62.0% by patient clinical risk. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest social determinants of health are associated with considerable proportions of geographic variation in Medicare spending. Policies addressing SDoH for disadvantaged patients in certain regions have the potential to contain health care spending and improve the value of health care; patient SDoH may need to be accounted for in publicly reported physician performance, and in value-based purchasing incentive programs for health care professionals.","output":"Social Determinants of Health and Geographic Variation in Medicare per Beneficiary Spending"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The innate immune response is nonspecific and constitutes the first line of defense against infections by pathogens, mainly by enabling their elimination by phagocytosis or apoptosis In immune cells, this response is characterized, amongst others, by the synthesis of restriction factors, a class of proteins whose role is to inhibit viral replication Among them, the proteins of the APOBEC3 (Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing Enzyme Catalytic polypeptide-like 3 or A3) family are major antiviral factors that target a wide range of viruses One of their targets is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1): the deaminase activity of some A3 proteins converts a fraction of cytidines of the viral genome into uridines, impairing its expression Nevertheless, HIV-1 counteracts A3 proteins thanks to its Vif protein, which inhibits them by hijacking several cellular mechanisms Besides, APOBEC3 proteins help maintaining the genome integrity by inhibiting retroelements but they also contribute to carcinogenesis, as it is the case for A3A and A3B, two major factors in this process The large range of A3 activities, combined with recent studies showing their implication in the regulation of emerging viruses (Zika, SARS-CoV-2), allow A3 and their viral partners to be considered as therapeutic areas","output":"[APOBEC3s: history of an antiviral and mutagenic protein family]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: This report presents the findings of the 2019 Spanish Catheter Ablation Registry.

Here, we undertook a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, and investigated for the first time the possible causal impact of PD on host susceptibility to COVID-19 and its severity.Methods: Summary statistics of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity was retrieved from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative and used as outcomes in this study. As for exposures, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) with genome-wide significant variants from genome wide association study (GWAS) of PD were included in the MR analysis. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was employed as the main approach to analyzing the causal relationships between PD and COVID-19. Three additional methods were adopted, allowing the existence of horizontal pleiotropy including MR-Egger regression, weighted median and weighted mode methods. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were also conducted for estimating the robustness of the identified associations.Findings: The MR estimates showed that PD was markedly associated with a higher susceptibility to COVID-19 using IVW (OR = 1.024, P = 0.017) and weighted median method (OR = 1.029, P = 0.024). Furthermore, it revealed that PD was significantly linked to COVID-19 severity based on the comparison of hospitalization versus population controls (IVW: OR = 1.025, P = 0.039;weighted median, OR = 1.030, P = 0.027).

Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) found in the bone marrow ensure hematopoietic homeostasis in an organism. Failure of this complex process, which involves a fine balance of self-renewal and differentiation fates, often result in severe hematological conditions such as leukemia and lymphoma. Several molecular and metabolic programs, internal or in close interaction with the bone marrow niche, have been identified as important regulators of HSPC function. More recently, nutrient sensing pathways have emerged as important modulators of HSC homing, dormancy, and function in the bone marrow. Here we describe a method for reliable measurement of various amino acids and minerals in different rare bone marrow (BM) populations, namely HSPCs. We found that the amino acid profile of the most primitive hematopoietic compartments (KLS) did not differ significantly from the one of their direct progenies (common myeloid progenitor CMP), while granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), on the opposite of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), have higher content of the majority of amino acids analyzed. Additionally, we identified intermediates of the urea cycle to be differentially expressed in the KLS population and were found to lower mitochondrial membrane potential, an established readout on self-renewal capability. Moreover, we were able to profile for the first time 12 different minerals and detect differences in elemental contents between different HSPC compartments. Importantly, essential dietary trace elements, such as iron and molybdenum, were found to be enriched in granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs). We envision this amino acid and mineral profiling will allow identification of novel metabolic and nutrient sensing pathways important in HSPC fate regulation.","output":"Mineral and Amino Acid Profiling of Different Hematopoietic Populations from the Mouse Bone Marrow"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJETIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of vagino-rectal swab autotomy for prenatal screening for GBS infection and to identify the barriers and facilitators encountered by the pregnant woman for this intervention.

This study determined feasibility of implementing Breastfeed4Ghana and evaluated its impact on breastfeeding knowledge in Ghana. Key performance indicators of the campaign were monitored on social media platforms, Facebook and Twitter. An online cross-sectional survey conducted across three time points (n = 451) assessed breastfeeding knowledge, campaign exposure, and understanding and acceptability of Breastfeed4Ghana among Ghanaian adults. Modified Poisson models were used to assess the relationship between campaign exposure and breastfeeding knowledge, adjusting for survey time point, sex, and parenthood status. The campaign acquired 4,832 followers. Based on follower demographics collected from Facebook and Twitter analytics, the target population was successfully reached. Campaign exposure among survey participants was 42.3% and 48.7% at midline and endline, respectively. Campaign acceptability was high (>90%), and >44% of those exposed to the campaign also shared the campaign with others.

Predictions of mortality and hospitalization help governments meet planning and resource allocation challenges. In this paper, we consider the weekly forecasting of the cumulative mortality due to COVID-19 at the national and state level in the U.S. Optimal decision-making requires a forecast of a probability distribution, rather than just a single point forecast. Interval forecasts are also important, as they can support decision making and provide situational awareness. We consider the case where probabilistic forecasts have been provided by multiple forecasting teams, and we aggregate the forecasts to extract the wisdom of the crowd. With only limited information available regarding the historical accuracy of the forecasting teams, we consider aggregation (i.e. combining) methods that do not rely on a record of past accuracy. In this empirical paper, we evaluate the accuracy of aggregation methods that have been previously proposed for interval forecasts and predictions of probability distributions. These include the use of the simple average, the median, and trimming methods, which enable robust estimation and allow the aggregate forecast to reduce the impact of a tendency for the forecasting teams to be under- or overconfident. We use data that has been made publicly available from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. While the simple average performed well for the high mortality series, we obtained greater accuracy using the median and certain trimming methods for the low and medium mortality series.

METHODS: Nine hundred and twenty Chinese children and adolescents (8 to 16 years) underwent graded cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill until volitional exhaustion. Peak VO(2) was corrected for the effects of body mass by ratio or allometric scaling. Z score equations for predicting peak VO(2) were developed. Correlations between scaled peak VO(2), z scores, body size and age were tested to examine the effectiveness of the approach. RESULTS: Eight hundred and fifty-two participants (48% male) were included in the analyses. Absolute peak VO(2) significantly increased with age in both sexes (both P<0.05), while ratio-scaled peak VO(2) increased only in males (P<0.05). Allometrically scaled peak VO(2) increased from 11 years in both sexes, plateauing by 12 years in girls and continuing to rise until 15 years in boys. Allometically scaled peak VO(2) was not correlated with body mass, but remained correlated with height and age in all but the older girls.

As health care workers across the globe have been overwhelmed by the crisis, oversight entities and training programs have sought to loosen regulations to support ongoing care. Notably, however, workforce challenges preceded the current crisis. Now may be the time to address these underlying workforce challenges and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic with a stronger health care workforce. Building upon historical exemplars in the context of the current crisis, the authors of this Perspective provide a roadmap to rapidly and safely increase the workforce for COVID-19 and beyond. The authors recommend the following: (1) a comprehensive approach to guide health care workforce development, (2) streamlining transitions to the next level of practice, (3) reciprocity among state licensing boards or national licensure, (4) payment reform to support a strengthened health care workforce, and (5) efforts by employers to ensure the ongoing safety and competence of the bolstered workforce. These steps require urgent collaboration among stakeholders commensurate with the acuity of the pandemic. Implemented together, these actions could address not only the novel challenges presented by COVID but also the underlying inadequacies of the health care workforce that must be remedied to create a healthier society.","output":"Emerging From the COVID Crisis With a Stronger Health Care Workforce"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fetuses are able to process olfactory stimuli present in the womb and continue to show a preference for these odors for months after birth. Despite the accumulated knowledge about their early ability to perceive odors, there is a lack of validated scales for odor response in newborns. The evaluation of reactions of the olfactory system to environmental stimuli in infants has been defined by methodological theoretical approaches of experimental and clinical assessment tools. These approaches are mainly based on psychophysical approaches and predominantly use behavioral and physiological measures. Examples can be found in studies describing early abilities of newborn babies for behaviors or heart rate variability showing memory of maternal food preferences or mother's breast milk. This systematic review aimed to determine whether validated odor assessment tools can be feasibly used in studies. Particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic and evidence of associated olfactory impairment resulting from SARS-COV-2 infection, the study is also motivated by the need for tools to assess olfactory function in neonates.","output":"Olfactory sensory and perceptual evaluation in newborn infants: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Nidovirales order of the Coronaviridae family, where the coronavirus (crown\\\\like spikes on the surface of the virus) causing severe infections like acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

SOC is a generalized orientation which allows one to perceive the world as comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful. In an attempt to understand how does the SOC work we employed the salutogenic assumption that a strong SOC allows one to reach out in any given situation and find those resources appropriate to the specific stressor. Thus, we hypothesized that the positive impact of SOC on mental health outcomes would be mediated through coping resources that are particularly salient in times of crisis. One resource is related to the micro level (perceived family support) and the other concerns the macro level (trust in leaders and social-political institutions). Data collection was conducted in different countries during MayCJune 2020 via online platforms. The data included 7 samples of adult participants (age 18C90) from Israel (n ?= ?669), Italy (n ?= ?899), Spain (n ?= ?476), Germany (n ?= ?708), Austria (n ?= ?1026), Switzerland (n ?= ?147), and the U.S. (n ?= ?506). The questionnaires included standard tools (MHC-SF, SOC-13) as well as questionnaires of perceived family support and trust that were adapted to the pandemic context. As expected, SOC was associated with mental health in all the samples. Perceived family support and trust in leaders and social-political institutions mediated the relationships between SOC and mental health, controlling for age, gender, and level of financial risk. It appears that SOC has a universal meaning, not limited by cultural and situational characteristics. The discussion focuses on the theoretical, social, and political applications of the salutogenic model C and its core concept of SOC C in the context of coping with a global pandemic across different cultural contexts and countries.","output":"Order out of chaos: Sense of coherence and the mediating role of coping resources in explaining mental health during COVID-19 in 7 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study was conducted using a pre/posttest, randomized-controlled, single-blind trial method.

Despite opportunities posed by telemedicine, most hypertension services in Europe have suspended ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Methods: : We examined the process and performance of remotely delivered ABPM using two methodologies: firstly, a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and secondly, a quantitative analysis comparing ABPM data from a subgroup of 65 participants of the Screening for Hypertension in the INpatient Environment (SHINE) diagnostic accuracy study. The FMEA was performed over seven sessions from February to March 2021, with a multidisciplinary team comprising a patient representative, a research coordinator with technical expertise and four research clinicians. Results: : The FMEA identified a single high-risk step in the remote ABPM process. This was cleaning of monitoring equipment in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, unrelated to the remote setting. A total of 14 participants were scheduled for face-to-face ABPM appointments, before the UK March 2020 COVID-19 lockdown;62 were scheduled for remote ABPM appointments since emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic between November 2020 and August 2021. A total of 65 (88%) participants completed ABPMs;all obtained sufficient successful measurements for interpretation. For the 10 participants who completed face-to-face ABPM, there were 402 attempted ABPM measurements and 361 (89%) were successful. For the 55 participants who completed remote ABPM, there were 2516 attempted measurements and 2214 (88%) were successful. There was no significant difference in the mean per-participant error rate between face-to-face (0.100, SD 0.009) and remote (0.143, SD 0.132) cohorts (95% CI for the difference -0.125 to 0.045 and two-tailed P-value 0.353).

Access to targeted delivery of nucleic acids is expected to expand the field of nanomedicine beyond most expectations. Both viral and synthetic vectors have advantages and disadvantages. The major advantage of the synthetic vectors is their unlimited synthetic capability. The four-component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral vector for mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna in Covid-19 vaccines. Their synthetic capacity inspired us to develop a one-component multifunctional sequence-defined ionizable amphiphilic Janus dendrimer (IAJD) delivery system for mRNA. The first experiments on IAJDs provided, through a rational-library design combined with orthogonal-modular accelerated synthesis and sequence control in their hydrophilic part, some of the most active synthetic vectors for the delivery of mRNA to lung. The second experiments employed a similar strategy, generating, by a less complex hydrophilic structure, a library of IAJDs targeting spleen, liver, and lung. Here, we report preliminary studies designing the hydrophobic region of IAJDs by using dissimilar alkyl lengths and demonstrate the unexpectedly important role of the primary structure of the hydrophobic part of IAJDs by increasing up to 90.2-fold the activity of targeted delivery of mRNA to spleen, lymph nodes, liver, and lung.

Despite indirect reciprocity being claimed to extend direct reciprocity in larger populations where direct experiences cannot be accumulated, the success of social norms have been analysed in models with global information and evolution. This study is the first to analyse the leading eight norms with local information and evolution. We find that the leading eight are robust against selfish players within most scenarios and can maintain a high level of cooperation also with local information and evolution. In fact, local evolution sustains cooperation under a wider set of conditions than global evolution, while local reputation does not hinder cooperation compared to global reputation. Four of the leading eight norms that do not reward justified defection offer better chances for cooperation with quick evolution, reputation with noise, larger networks, and when unconditional defectors enter the population.","output":"Local reputation, local selection, and the leading eight norms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) can develop into post COVID-19 with one of its main attentions being secondary infection.

Further understanding of the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the risk perception of the community may better inform targeted interventions to reduce the impact and spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to examine the association between chronic diseases and serious outcomes following COVID-19 infection, and to explore its influence on people's self-perception of risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: This study draws data from two databases: (1) the nationwide database of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Portugal, extracted on April 28, 2020 (n=20,293); and (2) the community-based COVID-19 Barometer survey, which contains data on health status, perceptions, and behaviors during the first wave of COVID-19 (n=171,087). We assessed the association between relevant chronic diseases (ie, respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases; diabetes; and cancer) and death and intensive care unit (ICU) admission following COVID-19 infection. We identified determinants of self-perception of risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases were associated with mortality and ICU admission among patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.98; OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.80-6.40; and OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.66-3.06, respectively). Diabetes and cancer were associated with serious outcomes only when considering the full sample of COVID-19-infected cases in the country (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03-1.64; and OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.03-1.89, respectively). Older age and male sex were both associated with mortality and ICU admission. The perception of risk for severe COVID-19 disease in the study population was 23.9% (n=40,890). This was markedly higher for older adults (n=5235, 46.4%), those with at least one chronic disease (n=17,647, 51.6%), or those in both of these categories (n=3212, 67.7%). All included diseases were associated with self-perceptions of high risk in this population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the association between some prevalent chronic diseases and increased risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes. It also brings forth a greater understanding of the community's risk perceptions of serious COVID-19 disease. Hence, this study may aid health authorities to better adapt measures to the real needs of the population and to identify vulnerable individuals requiring further education and awareness of preventive measures.","output":"The Association Between Chronic Disease and Serious COVID-19 Outcomes and Its Influence on Risk Perception: Survey Study and Database Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of obesity, diabetes, arterial hypertension and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases is increasing worldwide.

METHODS This was a 54-week prospective, observational cohort study conducted at 43 European outpatient clinics in adults with moderate-to-severe UC who were biologic na?ve or had received a maximum of one other biological therapy. Patients were treated according to European GLM UC label/local practice. Clinical response (based on partial or full Mayo score) was assessed at week 6, 10, or 14 of induction, depending on local practice. Investigators remotely monitored scores every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of induction responders in patient-reported continuous clinical response (pCCR) at week 54, defined as absence of UC flare based on combined patient-reported Mayo stool frequency and rectal bleeding scores every 4 weeks and full or partial Mayo score. A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of induction responders in clinical remission at week 54. RESULTS Among 109 patients, 37 (34.0%) received at least two GLM induction doses and completed induction in clinical response (induction responders). At week 54, 15/37 (40.5%) induction responders were in pCCR, and 21/37 (56.8%) were in clinical remission.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We used National Heart Failure Audit data to identify 36 974 adults who had a hospital admission with a primary diagnosis of heart failure between February and May in either 2018, 2019, or 2020. Hospital admissions for heart failure in 2018/19 averaged 160/day but were much lower in 2020, reaching a nadir of 64/day on 27 March 2020 [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38-0.42]. The proportion discharged on guideline-recommended pharmacotherapies was similar in 2018/19 compared to the same period in 2020. Between 1 February-2020 and 31 May 2020, there was a 29% decrease in hospital deaths related to heart failure (IRR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.67-0.75; estimated decline of 448 deaths), a 31% increase in heart failure deaths at home (IRR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.24-1.39; estimated excess 539), and a 28% increase in heart failure deaths in care homes and hospices (IRR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.18-1.40; estimated excess 189). All-cause, inpatient death was similar in the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 periods [odds ratio (OR): 1.02, 95% CI: 0.94-1.10].

The study aims to investigate the mechanism of how RR influences the development of renal fibrosis by regulating the miR-122-5p/PKM axis. METHODS: Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) was applied to induce renal fibrosis in mice in vivo, and human tubular epithelial HK2 cells treated by transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?1) were used to induce renal fibrosis in vitro. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) in mouse serum were detected by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); fibronectin (FN) and type I collagen (Col-I) in renal tissue were detected by Western blotting; serum creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were analyzed by kits. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and Masson staining were utilized to assess the degree of pathological damage and fibrosis. Cell viability and apoptosis in the in vitro model were detected by MTT and Flow cytometry. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine intermolecular targeting relationships. RESULTS: RR could inhibit IL-6 and TNF- levels, decrease the levels of FN and Col-I and improve the renal function indexes (serum Cr and BUN) in UUO mice (all P<0.05). In addition, RR was able to promote the up-regulation of miR-122-5p expression in UUO mice in vivo (P<0.05). MiR-122-5p expression was down-regulated and PKM expression was up-regulated in HK2 cells treated with TGF-?1 (all P<0.05). RR inhibited renal fibrosis progression by regulating the miR-122-5p/PKM axis. Inhibition of miR-122-5p or overexpression of PKM could promote apoptosis of TGF-?1-treated HK2 cells, inhibit their viability, aggravate fibrosis, and attenuate the protective effect of RR on the cells. The protective effect of RR promoted by overexpression of miR-122-5p was partially counteracted by PKM.

Front line health-care workers (HCWs), particularly emergency physicians and acute care providers, are vulnerable to being exposed while treating their sick patients. Despite appropriate personal protective equipment use, HCW gets infected, suggesting the need for multiple layers of protection such as barrier devices. METHODS: We aimed to determine the effectiveness of our novel Resuscitation Cover All(RCA) in reducing the exposure of HCW to simulated respiratory particles and its feasibility during cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This was a pilot simulation-based study. Five CPR simulation sessions were performed in Standard and RCA protocols, individually. Exposures through contact, droplets, and aerosols were simulated using a standardized volume of liquid detergent. Under Wood's lamp illumination, exposures of participants were compared between the protocols. Rate and depth of chest compressions, time taken to intubate, interruptions in CPR, and first-pass success were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall mean exposure in standard protocol was 4950.4  1461.6 (95%confidence interval [CI]:3135.7C6765.2) sq.pixels and RCA protocol was 2203.6  1499.0 (95%CI: 342.4C4064.9) sq.pixels (P = 0.019).

Chest compressor of RCA had reduced exposure compared to that of standard (P < 0.001). Hands were the most frequently exposed body part. Airway manager of RCA had no exposure over head and neck in any session. No significant difference in CPR performance metrics was observed. CONCLUSION: This pilot simulation-based study shows that the novel RCA device could minimize the exposure of HCW to simulated respiratory particles during CPR.

A modified assessment of frailty using Frieds classification was generated from baseline data. COVID-19 test results (England) were available 16/03/2020-01/06/2020, mostly taken in hospital settings. Logistic regression was used to discern associations between frailty, multimorbidity and COVID-19 diagnoses, adjusting for sex, age, BMI, ethnicity, education, smoking and number of comorbidity groupings, comparing COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. 4,510 participants were tested for COVID-19 (positive=1,326, negative=3,184). 497,996 participants were not tested. Compared to the non-tested group, after adjustment, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely to be frail (OR=1.4 [95%CI=1.1, 1.8]), report slow walking speed (OR=1.3 [1.1, 1.6]), report two or more falls in the past year (OR=1.3 [1.0, 1.5]) and be multimorbid (4 comorbidity groupings vs 0-1: OR=1.9 [1.5, 2.3]).

Here, we utilize a rhesus macaque (RM) model of SARS-CoV-2 infection to delineate perturbations in the innate immune system during acute infection using an integrated systems analysis. We found that SARS-CoV-2 initiated a rapid infiltration (two days post infection) of plasmacytoid dendritic cells into the lower airway, commensurate with IFNA production, natural killer cell activation, and induction of interferon-stimulated genes. At this early interval, we also observed a significant increase of blood CD14-CD16+ monocytes. To dissect the contribution of lung myeloid subsets to airway inflammation, we generated a novel compendium of RM-specific lung macrophage gene expression using a combination of sc-RNA-Seq data and bulk RNA-Seq of purified populations under steady state conditions. Using these tools, we generated a longitudinal sc-RNA-seq dataset of airway cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected RMs. We identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited a rapid recruitment of two subsets of macrophages into the airway: a C206+MRC1-population resembling murine interstitial macrophages, and a TREM2+ population consistent with CCR2+ infiltrating monocytes, into the alveolar space. These subsets were the predominant source of inflammatory cytokines, accounting for ~75% of IL6 and TNF production, and >90% of IL10 production, whereas the contribution of CD206+MRC+ alveolar macrophages was significantly lower. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected RMs with baricitinib (Olumiant(R)), a novel JAK1/2 inhibitor that recently received Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, was remarkably effective in eliminating the influx of infiltrating, non-alveolar macrophages in the alveolar space, with a concomitant reduction of inflammatory cytokines.

HRV events were contiguous with different genotypes identified in 23 cases but symptoms were not preferentially associated with any particular species. Nine (9.7%) HRV events persisted over multiple successive samples for a median of 36 days (range 18 - 408 days). Three persistent HRV were symptomatic. When we serially measured forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in 23 subjects with events, we did not observe significant decreases in lung function over 12 months post-HRV. CONCLUSION In conjunction with our previous reports, our prospectively collected data indicate that molecularly heterogeneous HRV infections occur commonly following pediatric lung transplantation, but these infections do not negatively impact clinical outcomes.","output":"Epidemiology and Persistence of Rhinovirus in Pediatric Lung Transplantation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Amantadine is a well-known medication with indications in neurology and infectious diseases It is currently FDA approved for Parkinsons disease, drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms, and influenza Methods: The article is the authors original research hypothesis Results: Because more people are going to be vaccinated and additional similar vaccines are going to be introduced, we should take into consideration the potential of amantadine to interfere with LNP-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine delivery into the target cells Conclusions: A more cautious approach to the patients taking amantadine as far as vaccination utilizing LNP-mRNA platform should be considered [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Archives of Medical Science is the property of Termedia Publishing House and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Could amantadine interfere with COVID-19 vaccines based on the LNP-mRNA platform?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic is of an international scale with the number of people working on frontlines in healthcare positions has been of a scale never witnessed before.

We used a retrospective observational database to examine and quantify the effects of the topical skin adhesive 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, used as the final layer of site closure in patients undergoing CABG surgery, on the incidence of post-operative SSI. METHODS All patients in the Premier Perspective? Comparative Database of inpatient hospitalizations who underwent CABG surgery in 2005 and 2006 were identified. Qualifying patients were classified into four groups according to the method of surgical site closure on the basis of detailed hospital billing charges: Sutures only; sutures and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate; sutures and staples; and sutures, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, and staples. Site infections were identified by a combination of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes, patterns of post-operative use of antibiotics, and All Patient Refined Diagnostic Related Group (APR-DRG) and Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) codes indicating post-operative infections at hospital re-admission. RESULTS A total of 59,006 patients qualified for the study: 38,799 who had sutures only; 10,262 having sutures and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate; 8,180 having sutures and staples; and 1,765 having sutures, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, and staples. The lowest unadjusted rate of post-CABG SSI was found in the sutures and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate group (4.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9-4.7), followed by sutures only (5.3%; 95% CI 5.1-5.5); sutures and staples (6.2%; 95% CI 5.7-6.8); and sutures, staples, and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (7.1%; 95% CI 6.0%-8.4%).

To this aim, we set up the Mimico-19 network of seven Italian regions (62% of the Italian population) representing different socio-demographic areas of the country with also a different burden of the epidemic. We retrospectively analysed regional hospital discharges data, computing twelve indicators of volumes and performance in three clinical areas: cardiology, oncology and orthopaedics, including time-dependent pathways and elective surgery. Weekly indicators for the period January-July 2020 were compared with the average of the corresponding indicators in 2018 and 2019;comparisons were performed within 3 sub-periods: pre-lockdown, lockdown and post-lockdown. The weekly trend of hospitalizations for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) showed a 40% reduction, but the proportion of STEMI patients with a primary PTCA did not significantly change from previous years. Volumes of malignant neoplasms surgeries differed substantially by site, with a limited reduction for lung cancer (<20%) and greater declines (30-40%) for breast and prostate cancers. Hospitalizations for femoral neck fracture in the elderly decreased by 20%, but the percentage of timely interventions remained constantly higher than the previous years. General trends did not show important differences across regions, regardless of the different Covid-19 burden. Hospitalizations have generally decreased, but the capacity of a timely and effective response in time-dependent pathways of care was not jeopardized throughout the period.

Thus, the pandemics impact might have particularly affected mental health in these groups. This paper analysed data from a large\\\\scale Welsh population study (N = 12,989) from June to July 2020. Levels of psychological distress were compared across various occupations, including police, fire and rescue, and NHS health care workers. Resilience was also indexed, and its role considered as a protective factor for psychological distress. Surprisingly, health care workers reported lower distress levels than the general population. Further, fire and rescue and police groups had lower distress than most groups and significantly higher resilience. Within police officers, higher resilience levels were protective for distress. Fire and rescue workers were half as likely as others to report distress, even accounting for demographic factors and resilience. The findings offer an optimistic view of psychological resilience in these critical occupations. They illustrate potential benefits to ones mental health of playing a crucial societal role during crises and reiterate the importance of enhancing resilience within groups who encounter high\\\\risk situations daily. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Our findings provide evidence that health care workers and first responders showed lower levels of psychological distress than the general population during the first period of lockdown due to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. This may indicate that playing a critical role in society during an episode of crisis, and acting to help others, may be protective of ones own mental health.

First investigations indicate that the main contributing factor is a lack of visibility into the supply chain's lower tiers. Simultaneously, the willingness to share data in the supply chain is low as companies mainly consider their data as proprietary. However, large amounts of data are available on the internet. The amount of this data is steadily increasing;however, the problem remains, that this data is hardly structured. Therefore, this paper investigates current approaches to use this data for supply chain transparency and derives further research directions. Methodology: The paper uses a systematic review of the literature followed by content analysis. The research process further follows established frameworks in the literature and is subdivided into distinct stages. Findings: Descriptive and clustering results show a fragmented research field, where current approaches disconnect from prior research. We classify the methods using a simple taxonomy and show developments from rule-based to supervised techniques and horizontal to vertical mining approaches. The techniques with rule-based-matching procedures mainly suffer from low recall. The current approaches do not satisfy yet essential requirements on supply chain mapping based on natural language.

The multimeric size and function of VWF are normally regulated through A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThrombSpondin Motif type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS-13)--mediated proteolysis. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the hypothesis that ADAMTS-13 regulation of VWF multimer distribution may be impaired in severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection contributing to the observed microvascular thrombosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 (n = 23) were recruited from the Beaumont Hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Dublin. Plasma VWF antigen, multimer distribution, ADAMTS-13 activity, and known inhibitors thereof were assessed. RESULTS: We observed markedly increased VWF collagen-binding activity in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to controls (median 509.1 versus 94.3 IU/dl). Conversely, plasma ADAMTS-13 activity was significantly reduced (median 68.2 IU/dl). In keeping with an increase in VWF:ADAMTS-13 ratio, abnormalities in VWF multimer distribution were common in patients with COVID-19, with reductions in high molecular weight VWF multimers. Terminal sialylation regulates VWF susceptibility to proteolysis by ADAMTS-13 and other proteases. We observed that both N- and O-linked sialylation were altered in severe COVID-19. Furthermore, plasma levels of the ADAMTS-13 inhibitors interleukin-6, thrombospondin-1, and platelet factor 4 were significantly elevated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with profound quantitative and qualitative increases in plasma VWF levels, and a multifactorial down-regulation in ADAMTS-13 function. Further studies will be required to determine whether therapeutic interventions to correct ADAMTS-13-VWF multimer dysfunction may be useful in COVID-microvascular thrombosis and angiopathy.","output":"ADAMTS13 regulation of VWF multimer distribution in severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: After a year of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries have repeatedly imposed strict quarantine regimes as the virus mutates and becomes more contagious. Medical undergraduate education has been disrupted and transformed into prolonged home isolation and online learning. Although studies have reported that the COVID-19 pandemic tends to increase perceived stress (PS) and affect the mental health of medical students, the influencing factors are unclear. Therefore, based on the stress process model, this study will comprehensively evaluate the distribution of stressors of medical students and explore the personal and environmental predictors of PS during the epidemic. Participants and Methods: An online survey was conducted among medical students (n=369) from three medical universities in western China who engaged in online learning. A stress process conceptual framework was formed to explore the influencing factors of PS. The survey items contained four sections: (a) the potential stressors derived from academic, psychosocial and health-related demands;coping resources such as (b) online learning environment support and (c) personal resilience, including online learning behavior and individual characteristics;and (d) PS, perception of imbalanced demands and coping resources. Results: The mean PS score was 17.39 (SD=4.58), and over four-fifths (82.3%) of the students had moderate to high levels of stress. The average item scores of academic, psychosocial and health-related stressors were 2.72 (SD=0.55), 2.31 (SD=0.55) and 2.07 (SD=0.50), respectively. Gender, grade, psychosocial stressors, health-related stressors, specific online learning behavior (persistence, attitude and flexibility), and the online learning environment (teaching, social and cognitive presence) were predictors of PS. Conclusion: Our results specify that a reduction in psychological and health-related stressor stimulation, specific online learning behavior promotion, and well-established online learning environment support could be considered essential for alleviating the negative impacts of COVID-19 on the psychosocial health of medical undergraduates.","output":"Perceived Stress Among Chinese Medical Students Engaging in Online Learning in Light of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The design ideas of the postmodern era reflect the general trends of socio-cultural reality, namely the loss of traditional moral guidelines, disharmony and destructiveness combined with absurdity, a sense of crisis, abyss and uncertainty conveyed in signs and in spatial coordinates.

In this study, we show that the over-presentation of TMH-derived peptides is general, as it is predicted for bacteria and viruses and for both MHCI and MHC-II. Moreover, we show that TMHs are evolutionarily more conserved, because single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are present relatively less frequently in TMH-coding chromosomal regions compared to regions coding for extracellular and cytoplasmic protein regions. Thus, our findings suggest that both cytolytic and helper T cells respond more to membrane proteins, because these are evolutionary more conserved.

The median PaO(2)/FiO(2) prior to receiving iEpo was 92 mmHg and interquartile range (74 C 122). The median change in PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 9 mmHg (-9 C 37) corresponding to a 10% improvement (-8 C 41). Fifty-percent (40 / 80) met our a priori definition of a clinically significant improvement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) (increase in 10% from the baseline value). Prone position and lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) when iEpo was started predicted a more robust response, which held after multivariate adjustment. For proned individuals, improvement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 14 mmHg (-6 to 45) vs. 3 mmHg (-11 C 20), p = 0.04 for supine individuals; for those with severe ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 100, n = 49) the median improvement was 16 mmHg (-2 C 46). CONCLUSION: Fifty percent of patients have a clinically significant improvement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) after the initiation of iEpo. This suggests it is worth trying as a rescue therapy; although generally the benefit was modest with a wide variability. Those who were prone and had lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) were more likely to respond.","output":"Responsiveness of Inhaled Epoprostenol in Respiratory Failure due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Diabetes mellitus has been associated with a chronic low-grade inflammation and a higher risk of cardiovascular and infectious disease, that could be prevented by the effects of vitamin D. We aimed at evaluating the impact of vitamin D levels on the biomarkers of acute-phase response, inflammation and glucose metabolism in a large cohort of diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography were included. Diabetes mellitus was defined as previous diagnosis, specific treatment administration (oral drug or insulin), fasting glycaemia > 6.99 mmol/l or HbA1c > 48 mmol/l. Glucose parameters, white blood cells, Neutrophyl-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Monocyte-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (MLR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and vitamin D were measured at admission. Vitamin D levels were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay kit LIAISON? Vitamin D assay (Diasorin Inc). RESULTS We included diabetic 1472 patients and 2499 non diabetic patients, that were divided according to vitamin D tertiles. Among diabetic patients, lower levels of vitamin D were associated with female gender, (p=0.02), obesity (p=0.004), active smoking and acute presentation (p<0.001) and with a more atherogenic metabolic profile. The levels of white blood cells, leukocytes subfamilies, and inflammatory parameters significantly correlated with vitamin D levels in both patients with and without diabetes (diabetic: p=0.012 for WBC, p=0.004 for NLR and p<0.001 for MLR and C-reactive protein, non-diabetic: p<0.001 for WBC; NLR, MLR and C reactive protein, respectively). Among diabetic patients, results were confirmed at multivariate analysis with no significant interaction according to glycemic control. CONCLUSION The present study demonstrates that, among patients with cardiovascular disease, vitamin D deficiency is associated with metabolic dysregulation and with an elevation of cellular and humoral inflammatory parameters, especially among diabetics, although not being dependent from glycaemic control.","output":"Association of lower vitamin D levels with inflammation and leukocytes parameters in patients with and without diabetes mellitus undergoing coronary angiography."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We designed an in vitro study to evaluate the efficiency of an 0 5 vol% hydrogen peroxide-based spray in reducing Coronavirus 229E spread during a conventional dental procedure Methods: A class III cabinet-like chamber was custom-built, using phantoms for both patient and operator A suspension of HCoV-229E in artificial saliva having a similar viral load to SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic patients was inoculated inside the patients phantom mouth A 10 s-lasting dental procedure was performed using an aerosol-generating air-turbine, with or without high-volume evacuation (HVE) The effect of 0 5 vol% H2O2 cooling spray in reducing viral loads was tested Viral presence on the operator phantom was assessed by Real-Time quantitative PCR on the masks outer surface, on the phantoms forehead, and inside its mouth Results: When the H2O2 cooling spray was used, as compared to the conventional spray, viral loads were significantly lower on all tested sites, falling below the detection limit Viral loads did not significantly change in any tested site when HVE was used Conclusion: The use of 0 5 vol% H2O2 cooling spray by dental handpieces drastically reduced the possibility of coronaviruses spread during aerosol-generating dental procedures This strategy deserves further consideration among the preventive measures to be adopted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ? 2021 The Author(s) Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","output":"Aerosols modification with H2O2 reduces airborne contamination by dental handpieces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokine storm and multi-organ failure are the main causes of SARS-CoV-2-related death.

METHODS: A clinical database of all neonates undergoing congenital cardiac surgery admitted to the Cantonese cardiac center from 2014 to 2020 was retrospectively analyzed. AKI was based on the pRIFLE, AKIN, KDIGO, and mKDIGO classification. The predictive abilities for postoperative outcomes were compared by receiver operating curves, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of AKI definitions with postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: In the study population of 522 patients, 177, 110, 131, and 114 neonates had AKI according to the pRIFLE, AKIN, KDIGO, and mKDIGO criteria, respectively. After multivariate analysis, all definitions were found to be significant predictors of increased mortality.

Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and use predefined cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives and use this as a proxy for past infection. With the imperfect assays that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of the cumulative incidence and is usually corrected to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use an inference method-referred to as mixture-model approach-for the estimation of the cumulative incidence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that the mixture model outperforms the methods based on cutoffs, leading to less bias and error in estimates of the cumulative incidence. We illustrate how the mixture model can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test's ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the cumulative incidence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of classes of infections with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures. This is a very promising application of the mixture-model approach that could identify the elusive fraction of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.

People having diabetes are vulnerable to infectious diseases and have been clinically recognized; which may be because of their deregulated immune system. Hyperglycemia in diabetes is consequence of chronic resistance to insulin and relative insulin deficiency on target cells. Alpha-amylase, a salivary enzyme is shown to increase in diabetic individuals compared to nondiabetics and can be used as a marker for the diagnosis of diabetes. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to investigate the levels of salivary amylase in type II diabetic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 80 participants in the age range of 30C60 years, were divided into three groups as Group I: Uncontrolled diabetics (30), Group II: Controlled diabetics (30) and Group III: Age- and sex-matched healthy controls (20) were taken for the study. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected for salivary amylase level estimation and blood samples were from the antecubital vein, after 12 h of overnight fasting of each individual for the estimation of blood glucose levels. RESULTS: The mean random blood sugar and glycated hemoglobin A(1c) levels were found to be statistically significant among diabetics and healthy individuals. Salivary amylase levels were much higher in uncontrolled and controlled diabetics compared to healthy individuals showing a significant correlation (P = 0.001) between all groups. However, the salivary amylase levels nonsignificant (P = 0.060) between the controlled diabetics (Group II) and healthy individuals (Group III).

They are abundant in bio-fluids and harbor specific molecular constituents from their parental cells. Due to these characteristics, EXOs have a great potential in cancer diagnostics for liquid biopsy and personalized medicine. Despite this unique potential, EXOs are not yet widely applied in clinical settings, with two main factors hindering their translational process in diagnostics. Firstly, conventional extraction methods are time-consuming, require large sample volumes and expensive equipment, and often do not provide high-purity samples. Secondly, characterization methods have some limitations, because they are often qualitative, need extensive labeling or complex sampling procedures that can induce artifacts. In this context, novel label-free approaches are rapidly emerging, and are holding potential to revolutionize EXO diagnostics. These methods include the use of nanodevices for EXO purification, and vibrational spectroscopies, scattering, and nanoindentation for characterization. In this progress report, we summarize recent key advances in label-free techniques for EXO purification and characterization. We point out that these methods contribute to reducing costs and processing times, provide complementary information compared to the conventional characterization techniques, and enhance flexibility, thus favoring the discovery of novel and unexplored EXO-based biomarkers.

The median number of visits in the video cohort was more than in the in-person or hybrid groups (5 vs. 4). Median number of anti-obesity medications (AOMs) prescribed was similar among groups. The most common AOMs were metformin (all cohorts) followed by semaglutide 1.0 mg (in-person and video) or topiramate (hybrid). CONCLUSION: Patients on anti-obesity medications who were followed for 6 months via video or video plus in-person visits (hybrid) experienced clinically significant weight loss. Median number of AOMs were similar among groups, and the most common AOMs were metformin, semaglutide 1.0 mg, and topiramate.

This data set was composed of videos, kinematics, and workflow annotations described at three different granularity levels: phase, step, and activity. The participants were given the option to use kinematic data and videos to develop workflow recognition models. Four tasks were proposed to the participants: three of them were related to the recognition of surgical workflow at three different granularity levels, while the last one addressed the recognition of all granularity levels in the same model. One ranking was made for each task. We used the average application-dependent balanced accuracy (AD-Accuracy) as the evaluation metric. This takes unbalanced classes into account and it is more clinically relevant than a frame-by-frame score. Six teams, including a non-competing team, participated in at least one task. All models employed deep learning models, such as CNN or RNN. The best models achieved more than 95% AD-Accuracy for phase recognition, 80% for step recognition, 60% for activity recognition, and 75% for all granularity levels. For high levels of granularity (i.e., phases and steps), the best models had a recognition rate that may be sufficient for applications such as prediction of remaining surgical time or resource management. However, for activities, the recognition rate was still low for applications that can be employed clinically.

It is important to research and develop personal identification methods as social and institutional infrastructure. A critical consideration during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is that there is no contact between the subjects and personal identification systems. The aim of this study was to organize the recent 5-year development of contactless personal identification methods that use artificial intelligence. METHODS: This study used a scoping review approach to map the progression of contactless personal identification systems using artificial intelligence over the past 5 years. An electronic systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore databases. Studies published between January 2016 and December 2020 were included in the study. RESULTS: By performing an electronic literature search, 83 articles were extracted. Based on the PRISMA flow diagram, 8 eligible articles were included in this study. These eligible articles were divided based on the analysis targets as follows: (1) face and/or body, (2) eye, and (3) forearm and/or hand. Artificial intelligence, including convolutional neural networks, contributed to the progress of research on contactless personal identification methods.

Saturation mutagenesis of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) followed by in vitro selection, with wild type ACE2 and the engineered decoy competing for binding sites, failed to find S mutants that discriminate in favor of the wild type receptor. Variant N501Y in the RBD, which has emerged in a rapidly spreading lineage (B.1.1.7) in England, enhances affinity for wild type ACE2 20-fold but remains tightly bound to engineered sACE22.v2.4.

Identifying which patient groups are presenting less frequently will provide a better understanding of health care utilisation behaviours during a pandemic and inform healthcare providers of the potential challenges in managing these groups.MethodsThis single-centre retrospective study examined trends in presentations in 2020 to a private, mixed paediatric and adult ED in an inner city suburb within the state of Victoria that treats both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. The 2019 dataset was used as a reference baseline for comparison. All analyses were performed using baseline characteristics and triage data.ResultsThe total number of visits to the ED dropped from 24 775 in 2019 to 22 754 in 2020, representing an overall reduction of 8%. Significant reductions in daily presentations and admissions from the ED were observed in the months immediately following the peak of the two COVID-19 waves in the state of Victoria. Visits by those in the 0- to 17-year age group, triage categories 4 and 5 and musculoskeletal presentations were also reduced for most of 2020. Gastrointestinal/abdominal and urological/renal presentations were reduced immediately after the first COVID-19 wave, whereas infectious diseases visits were reduced during and after the second COVID-19 wave.ConclusionsThese findings add to the growing body of evidence regarding emergency care underutilisation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reduced private ED presentations were observed overall and in paediatric patients, lower acuity triage categories, musculoskeletal, abdominal/gastrointestinal and urological/renal presentations during the first wave, whereas infectious disease cases were reduced during the second wave.What is known about the topic?During the first and second waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, ED visits were reduced in the public sector across all diagnostic categories and all triage categories. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on private ED attendance is less well known.What does this paper add?Total visits to the private ED during the first and second waves of COVID-19 were reduced across all major diagnostic categories except cardiac presentations. During this same period, visits for triage categories 4 and 5 were significantly reduced.What are the implications for practitioners?ED underutilisation during the initial two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic is apparent in both the private and public sector.

DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional household survey. SETTING: Urban, semiurban and rural communities of the Wakiso and Hoima districts in Uganda. PARTICIPANTS: A total of N=2014 males aged 13-80 years participated in the survey. The current study included males who reported having ever been in a sexual union and responded to the IPV questions (N=1314). MEASURES: Data were collected face-to-face from May 2018 to July 2019 using an interviewer-mediated questionnaire. Lifetime IPV perpetration was measured as 'no physical and/or sexual IPV', 'physical' versus 'sexual violence only', and 'physical and sexual violence'. Past-year food insecurity was measured through the Food Insecurity Experience Scale and categorised into 'none', 'low' and 'high'. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine the crude and adjusted relative risk ratios (aRRRs) of IPV perpetration in relation to self-reported food insecurity, adjusting for sociodemographic and health risk behaviours. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported lifetime IPV perpetration was 14.6% for physical and 6.5% for sexual violence, while 5.3% reported to have perpetrated both physical and sexual IPV. Most (75.7%) males reported no food insecurity, followed by low (20.7%) and high (3.6%) food insecurity. In adjusted models, food insecurity was associated with increased risk of having perpetrated both physical and sexual violence (aRRR=2.57, 95% CI 1.52 to 4.32). IPV perpetration was also independently associated with having had more than one lifetime sexual partner and drinking alcohol, but not with education level or religion. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that food insecurity is associated with male IPV perpetration, and more efforts are needed to prevent and mitigate the expected worsening of this situation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Household food insecurity and its association with self-reported male perpetration of intimate partner violence: a survey of two districts in central and western Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Document: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has contributed to the development of important military and commercial technologies, including stealth and personal electronics DARPA's role and investments in defense-related research and development (R&D), including biological defense, has potential significance for the science and technology available to address the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and any future biological threats Advances in genome sequencing and editing, along with the application of engineering principles and computing and information sciences to the field of biology, have created opportunities to accelerate and expand the development of biotechnology products and processes Although DARPA has invested in biological research since its establishment in 1958, in 2014 the agency created the Biological Technologies Office, which focuses specifically on the biological sciences and biotechnology United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency;Research and development projects;Epidemics","output":"DARPA's Pandemic-Related Programs [June 30, 2020]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To investigate the validity and reliability of two variants of the Sit Up Squat Stand Test (SUSS) and Hand Grip Strength (HGS) in predicting BMI and BMI risk level in hospitalised patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN).

Sources of information: Program-specific documents, pre-existing, and related to COVID-19; documents from national and international kidney agencies; national and international webinars, including webinars that we hosted for input and feedback; with additional information from formal and informal review of published academic literature. Methods: Challenges in the care of patients with advanced CKD during the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted within the Canadian Senior Renal Leaders Forum discussion group. The Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) developed the COVID-19 rapid response team (RRT) to address these challenges. They identified a lead with expertise in advanced CKD who identified further nephrologists and administrators to form the workgroup. A nation-wide survey of advanced CKD clinics was conducted. The initial guidance document was drafted and members of the workgroup reviewed and discussed all suggestions in detail via email and a virtual meeting. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The document was reviewed by the CSN COVID-19 RRT, an ethicist and an infection control expert. The suggestions were presented at a CSN-sponsored interactive webinar, attended by 150 kidney health care professionals, for further peer input. The document was also sent for further feedback to experts who had participated in the initial survey. Final revisions were made based on feedback received until April 28, 2020.

We make specific suggestions for each of these areas. Limitations: The suggestions in this paper are expert opinion, and subject to the biases associated with this level of evidence. To expedite the publication of this work, a parallel review process was created that may not be as robust as standard arms length peer-review processes. Implications: These suggestions are intended to provide guidance for advanced CKD directors, clinicians, and administrators on how to provide the best care possible during a time of altered priorities and reduced resources.","output":"Management of Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Suggestions From the Canadian Society of Nephrology COVID-19 Rapid Response Team"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABCB4/MDR3 is located in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes and translocates phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids from the cytoplasmic to the extracellular leaflet.

PC-lipids account for 40% of the entire pool of lipids in the canalicular membrane with an unknown distribution over both leaflets. Extracted PC lipids end up in so-called mixed micelles. Mixed micelles are composed of phospholipids, bile salts and cholesterol. 90-95% of the phospholipids are member of the of the PC family, but only a subset of mainly 16.0-18:1 PC and 16:0-18:2 PC variants are present. To elucidate if ABCB4 is the key discriminator in this enrichment of specific PC-lipids, we used in vitro studies to identify crucial determinants substrate selection. We demonstrate PC-lipid moieties alone are insufficient for stimulating ABCB4 ATPase activity, and that at least two acyl chains and the backbone itself are required for a productive interaction. The nature of the fatty acids like length or saturation, has a quantitative impact on the ATPase activity. Our data demonstrate a two-step enrichment and protective function of ABCB4 to mitigate the harsh detergent effect of the bile salts, since ABCB4 can translocate more than just the PC-lipid variants found in bile.","output":"Stimulation of the ATPase activity of MDR3/ABCB4 requires an intact phosphatidylcholine lipid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA viruses are characterized by high mutation and recombination rates, which allow a rapid adaptation to new environments Most of the emerging diseases and host jumps are therefore sustained by these viruses Rapid evolution may also hinder the understanding of molecular epidemiology, affect the sensitivity of diagnostic assays, limit the vaccine efficacy and favor episodes of immune escape, thus significantly complicating the control of even well-known pathogens The history of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) fits well with the above-mentioned scenario Despite being known since the 1930s, it still represents one of the main causes of disease and economic losses for the poultry industry A plethora of strategies have been developed and applied over time, with variable success, to limit its impact However, they have rarely been evaluated objectively and on an adequate scale Therefore, the actual advantages and disadvantages of IBV detection and control strategies, as well as their implementation, still largely depend on individual sensibility The present manuscript aims to review the main features of IBV biology and evolution, focusing on their relevance and potential applications in terms of diagnosis and control","output":"Infectious bronchitis virus evolution, diagnosis and control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 severity.

Anthropometrics were measured and blood samples were taken pre- and post-supplementation. Fasting blood glucose, lipids, serum 25(OH)D, and inflammatory markers were measured. COVID-19 symptoms were noted on admission and monitored until full recovery. RESULTS: Vitamin D supplementation for 2 weeks caused a significant increase in serum 25(OH)D levels in the 5000 IU group only (adjusted p = 0.003). Within-group comparisons also showed a significant decrease in BMI and IL-6 levels overtime in both groups (p-values < 0.05) but was not clinically significant in between-group comparisons. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the 5000 IU group had a significantly shorter time to recovery (days) than the 1000 IU group in resolving cough, even after adjusting for age, sex, baseline BMI, and D-dimer (6.2  0.8 versus 9.1  0.8; p = 0.039), and ageusia (loss of taste) (11.4  1.0 versus 16.9  1.7; p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: A 5000 IU daily oral vitamin D3 supplementation for 2 weeks reduces the time to recovery for cough and gustatory sensory loss among patients with sub-optimal vitamin D status and mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. The use of 5000 IU vitamin D3 as an adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 patients with suboptimal vitamin D status, even for a short duration, is recommended.","output":"Effects of a 2-Week 5000 IU versus 1000 IU Vitamin D3 Supplementation on Recovery of Symptoms in Patients with Mild to Moderate Covid-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 outbreak forced many governments to enter a nationwide lockdown.

This study was conducted from May 2020 to June 2020 and data were collected using an offline survey with 89 elite track and field athletes (mean age: 24.7  5.4; n = 43 males; n = 46 females). The survey consisted of demographic data and questions on physical activity and sleep behavior at T0, T1 and T2. Athletes reported lower sleep quality scores at T1 compared to T0 and T2 (p < 0.0001) and registered delayed bedtime, wake-up time and longer sleep latency during the lockdown compared to pre-lockdown and post-lockdown whereas no changes in total sleep time were reported.

However, manual assessment of ONSD by a human operator is cumbersome and prone to human error. We aimed to develop and test an automated algorithm for ONSD measurement using ultrasound images and compare it to measurements performed by physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were recruited from the Neurological Intensive Care Unit. Ultrasound images of the optic nerve sheath from both eyes were obtained using an ultrasound unit with an ocular preset. Images were processed by two attending physicians to calculate ONSD manually. The images were processed as well using a novel computerized algorithm that automatically analyzes ultrasound images and calculates ONSD. Algorithm-measured ONSD was compared to manually measured ONSD using multiple statistical measures. RESULTS: Forty-Four patients with an average/standard deviation (SD) intracranial pressure of 14(9.7) mm Hg were recruited and tested (with a range between 1 and 57 mm Hg). A t-test showed no statistical difference between the ONSD from left and right eyes (P > 0.05). Furthermore, a paired t-test showed no significant difference between the manual and algorithm measure ONSD with a mean difference (SD) of 0.012(0.046) cm (P > 0.05) and percentage error of difference of 6.43% (P = 0.15). Agreement between the two operators was highly correlated (Interclass Correlation coefficient = 0.8, P = 0.26). Bland-Altman analysis revealed mean difference (SD) of 0.012 (0.046) (P = 0.303) and limits of agreement between -0.1 and 0.08. Receiver operator curve analysis yielded an area under the curve of 0.965 (P < 0.0001) with high sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The automated image-analysis algorithm calculates ONSD reliably and with high precision when compared to measurements obtained by expert physicians. The algorithm may have a role in computer-aided decision support systems in acute brain injury.","output":"Novel Algorithm for Automated Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter Measurement Using a Clustering Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeAdopting an interdisciplinary perspective, the purpose of this paper was to posit an industry-wide technological intervention for hotel housekeeper safety and health through the advancement of wearable technology.Design/methodology/approachUsing the task-technology fit (TTF) model and examples of successful safety and health applications of wearable technologies in the health-care and construction management industries, interventions and future research directions are presented to address workplace hazards experienced by hotel housekeepers.FindingsThe fit between a variety of hotel housekeeper user requirements, task demands and wearable functions are explored with justification for the use of wearable devices to improve safety and health-related outcomes.Research limitations/implicationsA research agenda is proposed for the adoption and use of wearables in the hospitality industry with the intention to generate meaningful interventions beyond corporate wellness, and the mitigation of employee privacy concerns to enhance wearable adoption.Practical implicationsGiven the importance of consumer safety and health assurance in a post-pandemic business environment, hospitality and tourism organizations should place greater emphasis on protecting front line employees who will be essential in regaining economic viability.Social implicationsTheoretical and practical foci should move beyond a simplistic view of hospitality and tourism worker safety and health that generally centers on wellness initiatives and other baseline strategies, toward a more holistic view benefitting the hospitality industry.Originality/valueExtant concerns about hotel housekeeper safety and health, in addition to new concerns and threats in a post-pandemic work environment, are largely understudied and worthy of investigation.","output":"A wearable technology solution and research agenda for housekeeper safety and health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health crisis is strongly affecting the psychological well-being of the general population. According to a very recent literature, the imposed lockdown and social distancing measures have generated a series of negative outcomes, including fear of the future, anxiety, and somatization symptoms. Few studies have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of parents and children, and still fewer studies have assessed the relationship between the psychological health of parents and children. The present study aimed at understanding the effect of parents psychological distress and verbal aggression on behavioral and emotional symptoms of children during the COVID-19 lockdown. Using an online survey administered in the first weeks of the lockdown in Italy, we explored the mediating effects of parent verbal hostility and child emotional symptoms on the relationship between parent distress and child hyperactivity/inattention in a sample of 878 Italian parents (87.4% mothers; mean(age) = 40.58). Two hypotheses were proposed: (1) parent distress would significantly predict child hyperactivity/inattention, and (2) parent verbal hostility and child emotional symptoms would mediate the association between parent distress and child hyperactivity/inattention. The serial mediated model confirmed both hypotheses, suggesting that higher rates of psychological distress in parents were associated with higher levels of hyperactivity/inattention in children. Parent verbal hostility and child emotional problems were also found to positively mediate this relation. Our results may be used to improve sociopsychological interventions in the general population in the near future. They may also contribute to the clinical definition of therapeutic paths for parents and families.","output":"The Effect of Parent Psychological Distress on Child Hyperactivity/Inattention During the COVID-19 Lockdown: Testing the Mediation of Parent Verbal Hostility and Child Emotional Symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is no agreed methodology for pharmacometric assessment of candidate antiviral drugs in COVID-19. The most widely used measure of virological response in clinical trials so far is the time to viral clearance assessed by qPCR of viral nucleic acid in eluates from serial nasopharyngeal swabs. We posited that the rate of viral clearance would have better discriminatory value. Using a pharmacodynamic model fit to individual SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance data from 46 uncomplicated COVID-19 infections in a cohort of prospectively followed adults, we simulated qPCR viral load data to compare type 2 errors when using time to clearance and rate of clearance under varying antiviral effects, sample sizes, sampling frequencies and durations of follow-up. The rate of viral clearance is a uniformly superior endpoint as compared to time to clearance with respect to type 2 error, and it is not dependent on initial viral load or assay sensitivity. For greatest efficiency pharmacometric assessments should be conducted in early illness and daily qPCR samples should be taken over 7 to 10 days in each patient studied.

METHODS Retrospective review of patient data and available frozen sections from 2003 to 2021 in which HAF was identified in 36 Mohs micrographic surgery patients. RESULTS Incidental HAF histologically persisted in the skin for as long as 10.75 years in 1 patient and 3 years or more in 36.8% (7/19) of the patients who remembered the time of implantation. HAF is more apparent in frozen sections stained with toluidine blue than those stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Although HAF volume tended to be less with time, fragmentation was present both early at 3 months and at 3 years or more. There was no correlation of persistence time with anatomic location or depth. In 90.3% of the cases (28/31), HAF was located in the subcutaneous fat. There was no granulomatous or giant cell response at any time period.

Findings showed the immune system in severe Covid-19 patients loses regulatory control of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 production, called the \\"Cytokine storm\\" process. This process can cause injury to vital organs, including lungs, kidneys, liver, and ultimately death if not inhibited. While many treatments have been proposed to reduce cytokine storm, but the safety and effectiveness of each of them are still in doubt. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells with self-renewal potential capable of suppressing overactive immune responses and leading to tissue restoration and repair. These immuno-modulatory properties of MSCs and their derivatives (like exosomes) can improve the condition of Covid-19 patients with serious infectious symptoms caused by adaptive immune system dysfunction. Many clinical trials have been conducted in this field using various MSCs around the world. Some of these have been published and summarized in the present article, while many have not yet been completed. Based on these available data, MSCs can reduce inflammatory cytokines, increase oxygen saturation, regenerate lung tissue and improve clinical symptoms in Covid-19 patients.

METHODS: 331 adults were hospitalized from 21 January to 22 February 2020 and classified as severe (10%) and critical (4.8%) cases; 1.5% died. 282 (85.2%) mild or moderate cases were admitted to regular wards. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, chest CT scan, laboratory, treatment and outcome data from patient records were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Patients were symptomatic for 9.825.75 (1C37) days. Pulmonary involvement was demonstrated on a chest CT scan in 97.9% of cases. It took 16.818.54 (3C49) days from the appearance of the first symptom until 274 patients tested virus-negative in NP swabs, blood, urine, and stool. And, 234 (83%) patients were already asymptomatic for 9.097.82 (1C44) days. Subsequently, 131 patients were discharged. 169 remained in hospital, these patients tested virus-free and were clinically asymptomatic, because of widespread persisting or increasing pulmonary infiltrates.

The new type of corona virus COVID-19 disease was firstly discovered in Wuhan-China. However, recently, the virus has been widely spread in most of the world countries and is reported as a pandemic. Further, nowadays, all the world countries are striving to control the coronavirus disease COVID-19. There are many mechanisms to detect the coronavirus disease COVID-19 including clinical analysis of chest CT scan images and blood test results.

The fluoride concentrations ranged between 0.29 and 8.92 mg/L (mean = 2.4 mg/L). 5% of the samples displayed lower than the recommended limit of 0.5 mg/L fluoride content, while 69% exceeded the allowable limits of 1.5 mg/L for drinking. The low F- content is distributed in a small part of the southeast, while elevated F- mainly in the central area of the study region. The PCA results indicated three principal components (PC), PC1 having the greatest variance (45.83%) and affected by positive loadings of TDS, Cl-, SO42-, Na+, and Mg2+, PC2 accounting for 17.03% and dominated by Ca2+, pH, HCO3-, and K+, and PC3 representing 12.17% and mainly comprising of CO32-.

In order to characterize the place of financial incentives, we investigated resource utilization and cost associated with hospital-acquired infections (HAI) and assessed the relative financial burden for hospital and insurer according to reimbursement policies. METHODS: We conducted a prospective matched case-control study over 18 months in a tertiary university medical center. Patients with central-line associated blood-stream infections (CLABSI), Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) or surgical site infections (SSI) were each matched to three control patients. Resource utilization, costs and reimbursement (per diem for CLABSI and CDI, diagnosis related group (DRG) reimbursement for SSI) were compared between patients and controls, from both the hospital and insurer perspective. RESULTS: HAIs were associated with increased resource consumption (more blood tests, imaging, antibiotic days, hospital days etc.). Direct costs were higher for cases vs. controls (CLABSI: $6400 vs. $2376 (p < 0.001), CDI: $1357 vs $733 (p = 0.047) and SSI: $6761 vs. $5860 (p < 0.001)). However as admissions were longer following CLABSI and CDI, costs per-day were non-significantly different (USD/day, cases vs. controls: CLABSI, 601 vs. 719, (p = 0.63); CDI, 101 vs. 93 (p = 0.5)). For CLABSI and CDI, reimbursement was per-diem and thus the financial burden ($14,608 and $5430 respectively) rested on the insurer, not the hospital. For SSI, as reimbursement was per procedure, costs rested primarily on the hospital rather than the insurer. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial infections are associated with both increased resource utilization and increased length of stay. Reimbursement strategy (per diem vs DRG) is the principal parameter affecting financial incentives to prevent hospital acquired infections and depends on the payer perspective.

Neutrophils activation and the formation of NETs have been described as major risk factors for acute lung injury, multi-organ damage, and mortality in COVID-19 disease. NETs-related lung injury involves both epithelial and endothelial cells, as well as the alveolar-capillary barrier. The markers for NETs formation, such as circulating DNA, neutrophil elastase (NE) activity, or myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, were found in lung specimens of COVID-19 victims, as well as in sera and tracheal aspirates obtained from COVID-19 patients. DNA threads form large conglomerates causing local obstruction of the small bronchi and together with NE are responsible for overproduction of mucin by epithelial cells. Various components of NETs are involved in the pathogenesis of cytokine storm in SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary disease. NETs are responsible for the interplay between inflammation and thrombosis in the affected lungs. The immunothrombosis, stimulated by NETs, has a poor prognostic significance.

The initial screening revealed that azithromycin (AZM) might have potential against COVID-19. Although clinical trials did not prove such efficacy, many countries have put AZM within their guidelines for treating COVID-19. Therefore, the present study was designed to assess the misuse of AZM in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among community pharmacies in Jordan from March 27 to May 8, 2021, and 184 pharmacies data were collected from the Google forms. During COVID-19, 42.9% of pharmacies sold more than 20 packs of prescribed AZM per month compared to 46.7% of pharmacies used to sell 0C5 packs AZM prescriptions per month before the pandemic. During COVID-19, pharmacists significantly dispensed AZM with and without prescriptions 107% and 127%, respectively, more than before the pandemic (p < 0.0001). Overall, pharmacists stocked 121% more AZM packs during COVID-19 than before the pandemic (p < 0.0001). Additionally, most pharmacists (59.7%) believed that AZM could cure COVID-19 patients. However, using multinomial logistic regression analysis, low-experienced pharmacists were unsure if AZM could positively affect COVID-19 patients (p < 0.05, OR = 3.76, 95% CI = 1.23C11.52). Furthermore, low-experienced pharmacists believed that increased use of AZM for the treatment of viral infections could lead to negative consequences (p < 0.001, OR = 0.161, 95% CI 0.063C0.414). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that AZM is misused by physicians, pharmacists, and the public in Jordan. Since AZM efficacy on SARS-CoV-2 is scarce, there is a need for new guidelines by governmental health authorities to implement strict enforcement of AZM dispensing during COVID-19 to avoid negative consequences of bacterial resistance.","output":"Azithromycin Misuse During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study from Jordan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enhancing the embodiment of artificial limbsthe individuals' feeling that a virtual or robotic limb is integrated in their own body schemeis an impactful strategy for improving prosthetic technology acceptance and human-machine interaction. Most studies so far focused on visuo-tactile strategies to empower the embodiment processes. However, novel approaches could emerge from self-regulation techniques able to change the psychophysiological conditions of an individual. Accordingly, this pilot study investigates the effects of a self-regulated breathing exercise on the processes of body ownership underlying the embodiment of a virtual right hand within a Spatially Augmented Respiratory Biofeedback (SARB) setting. This investigation also aims at evaluating the feasibility of the breathing exercise enabled by a low-cost SARB implementation designed for upcoming remote studies (a need emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic). Twenty-two subjects without impairments, and two transradial prosthesis users for a preparatory test, were asked (in each condition of a within-group design) to maintain a normal (about 14 breaths/min) or slow (about 6 breaths/min) respiratory rate to keep a static virtual right hand visible on a screen. Meanwhile, a computer-generated sphere moved from left to right toward the virtual hand during each trial (1 min) of 16. If the participant's breathing rate was within the target (slow or normal) range, a visuo-tactile event was triggered by the sphere passing under the virtual hand (the subjects observed it shaking while they perceived a vibratory feedback generated by a smartphone). Our resultsmainly based on questionnaire scores and proprioceptive drifthighlight that the slow breathing condition induced higher embodiment than the normal one. This preliminary study reveals the feasibility and potential of a novel psychophysiological training strategy to enhance the embodiment of artificial limbs.

Whole mouse imaging of virus-expressed luciferase has proved a useful way to track systemic infections. MCMV, in which the abundant lytic gene M78 was luciferase-tagged via a self-cleaving peptide (M78-LUC), allowed serial, unbiased imaging of systemic and peripheral infection without significant virus attenuation.

We applied luciferase imaging to tracking MCMV lacking M33, a chemokine receptor conserved in HCMV and a proposed anti-viral drug target. M33-deficient M78-LUC colonized normally in peripheral sites and local draining lymph nodes but spread poorly to the salivary gland, suggesting a defect in vascular transport consistent with properties of a chemokine receptor.","output":"Luciferase-tagged wild-type and tropism-deficient mouse cytomegaloviruses reveal early dynamics of host colonization following peripheral challenge."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Reusable elastomeric respirator use in health care may represent one solution to address N95 respirator shortages experienced during infectious disease outbreaks, but cleaning and disinfection requirements may limit their utility. Evidence of respirator cleaning and disinfection behaviors and practices by health care workers may inform guidance on reusable respirator use. METHODS: Medical system elastomeric respirator users were surveyed about respirator cleaning and disinfection practices and perceptions via an electronic survey. Respondents were subsequently classified based on reported compliance with their assigned respirator use. To explore whether respirator cleaning and disinfection issues affected compliance with assigned device use, responses were compared between user groups and adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: A total of 432 of 2,024 (21%) eligible elastomeric respirator users completed the survey. Most (>90%) reported that their respirator was clean, but only 52% reported that they always disinfect their respirators after use according to the hospital's expected practice. Only 40 respondents (9%) reported regularly cleaning the respirator with soap and water, in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. Reporting of suboptimal decontamination practice was not associated with assigned device compliance, however, except among providers and respiratory therapists. CONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: Although perceptions of cleanliness and adherence to expected decontamination practices during routine use did not appear to influence compliance with assigned respirator use overall, this did predict compliance among providers and respiratory therapists, both of whom have nonfixed workstations. Practical and effective strategies to assure easy access to and availability of clean reusable respiratory protective devices are needed to facilitate their use in health care respiratory protection programs.","output":"Cleaning and Disinfection Perceptions and Use Practices Among Elastomeric Respirator Users in Health care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article discusses the main directions of financial support for business by the Government of the Russian Federation in the conditions of economic imbalances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Government mandated lockdowns and norms of social distancing have further underscored the need for telepharmacy. Many developed and developing countries implemented such initiatives where pharmacists have provided tele-pharmacy services via telecommunications. However, the implementation and utilization of tele-pharmacy services are quite negligible in resource limited settings due to financial and administrative constraints. This study was aimed to ascertain the perception and readiness of pharmacists working in various sectors of a resource limiting country. METHODOLOGY: A cross sectional study was carried out in all provinces of Pakistan to explore the perceptions of pharmacists towards telepharmacy implementation through a 35-items study instrument. The collected data was analyzed descriptively and scored accordingly. The chi-square test was used for inferential analysis on pharmacists perception regarding implementation of tele-pharmacy with their demographics. RESULTS: Of 380 pharmacists, the mean age is 27.67  3.67 years with a preponderance of male pharmacists (n = 238, 62.6%). The pharmacists (n = 321, 84.5%) perceived that telepharmacy implementation improves patients quality of life and decreases patients visits (n = 291, 76.6%). Overall, pharmacists (n = 227, 59.7%) had negative perception towards benefits of telepharmacy implementation, but pharmacists had positive perception towards eligibility (n = 258, 67.9%), regulatory issues (n = 271, 71.3%) and telepharmacy during pandemic and beyond (n = 312, 82.1%).

Small countries, however, face distinctive challenges related to their health system governance and their ability to implement effective health systems reforms. The aim of this research was to perform a comparative assessment of existing diabetes management practices at the population level and explore governmental-related policy for Cyprus, Iceland, Luxembourg, Malta and Montenegro. This is the first time that such an evidence-based review study has been performed in the field of diabetes. The overall purpose was to set the agenda for health policy and inform strategic actions for small countries that can benefit from dealing with the diabetes epidemic at a country level. METHODS: We collected data and synthesized the evidence on dealing with diabetes for each of the five small European countries according to the (1) epidemiology of diabetes and other related metabolic abnormalities, (2) burden of diabetes status and (3) diabetes registers and national plans. We collected data by contacting Ministry representatives and other bodies in each state, and by searching through publicly available information from the respective Ministry of Health website on strategies and policies. RESULTS: Diabetes rates were highest in Cyprus and Malta. National diabetes registers are present in Cyprus and Montenegro, while national diabetes plans and diabetes-specific strategies have been established in Cyprus, Malta and Montenegro. These three countries also offer a free holistic healthcare service to their diabetes population. CONCLUSIONS: Multistakeholder, national diabetes plans and public health strategies are important means to provide direction on diabetes management and health service provision at the population level. However, political support is not always present, as seen for Iceland. The absence of evidence-based strategies, lack of funding for conducting regular health examination surveys, omission of monitoring practices and capacity scarcity are among the greatest challenges faced by small countries to effectively measure health outcomes. Nevertheless, we identified means of how these can be overcome. For example, the creation of public interdisciplinary repositories enables easily accessible data that can be used for health policy and strategic planning. Health policy-makers, funders and practitioners can consider the use of regular health examination surveys and other tools to effectively manage diabetes at the population level.","output":"Mapping the burden of diabetes in five small countries in Europe and setting the agenda for health policy and strategic action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Microglia\\\\mediated neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathological process of ischemic stroke, and the effect of imperatorin on post\\\\stroke neuroinflammation is not fully understood.

We sought to explore the prevalence patterns of serum inhalant and food allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) sensitization and serum total immunoglobulin E (tIgE) level among patients with clinical symptoms of suspected allergic diseases before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in south China. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A large epidemiology study was conducted on the prevalence patterns of sIgE sensitization and serum tIgE level among 13,715 patients with allergic symptoms in south China from 2017 to 2020. Chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used to test statistical significance of allergen sensitization difference among years. Logistic regression was performed to assess the magnitudes of the differences among years by adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The number of hospital visits for patients with suspected allergy symptoms decreased during COVID-19. The positive rates of indoor inhalant allergens (house dust mites, German cockroach, dog dander) and tIgE increased significantly in 2020, while no significant differences were found in food allergens (egg white, milk, soya bean, shrimp) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The odds of sIgE positives in indoor inhalant allergens and tIgE positive for 2017 and 2020 were all larger than 1.00.

Most of the vaccine and drug development has focused on the spike proteins and viral RNA-polymerases and main protease for viral replication. Using the bioinformatics and structural modelling approach, we modelled the structure of the envelope (E)-protein of novel SARS-CoV-2. The E-protein of this virus shares sequence similarity with that of SARS- CoV-1, and is highly conserved in the N-terminus regions. Incidentally, compared to spike proteins, E proteins demonstrate lower disparity and mutability among the isolated sequences. Using homology modelling, we found that the most favorable structure could function as a gated ion channel conducting H+ ions. Combining pocket estimation and docking with water, we determined that GLU 8 and ASN 15 in the N-terminal region were in close proximity to form H-bonds which was further validated by insertion of the E protein in an ERGIC-mimic membrane. Additionally, two distinct \\"core\\" structures were visible, the hydrophobic core and the central core, which may regulate the opening/closing of the channel. We propose this as a mechanism of viral ion channeling activity which plays a critical role in viral infection and pathogenesis.

Understanding the reasons for COVID-19Crelated disparities among patients with asthma has important public health implications. OBJECTIVE: To determine factors contributing to health disparities in those with asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous survey was sent through social media to adult patients with asthma, and a separate survey was sent to physicians who provide asthma care. The patient survey addressed demographic information including socioeconomic status, asthma control, and attitudes/health behaviors during COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 1171 patients (10.1% minority individuals) and 225 physicians completed the survey. Minority patients were more likely to have been affected by COVID-19 (eg, became unemployed, lived in a community with high COVID-19 cases). They had worse asthma control (increased emergency visits for asthma, lower Asthma Control Test score), were more likely to live in urban areas, and had a lower household income. Initial differences in attitudes and health behaviors disappeared after controlling for baseline demographic features. Institutional racism was demonstrated by findings that minority individuals were less likely to have a primary care physician, had more trouble affording asthma medications due to COVID-19, and were more likely to have lost health insurance because of COVID-19, and that 25% of physicians found it more challenging to care for black individuals with asthma during COVID-19.

Inadequate and defective IFN type I responses against SARS-CoV-2, associated with autoantibodies in a proportion of patients, lead to severe courses of disease. In addition, hyperactive responses of the humoral immune system have been described. In the current study we investigated a possible role of neutralizing autoantibodies against antiinflammatory mediators. Plasma from adult patients with severe and critical COVID-19 was screened by ELISA for antibodies against PGRN, IL-1-Ra, IL-10, IL-18BP, IL-22BP, IL-36-Ra, CD40, IFN-2, IFN-, IFN- and serpinB1. Autoantibodies were characterized and the antigens were analyzed for immunogenic alterations. In a discovery cohort with severe to critical COVID-19 high titers of PGRN-autoantibodies were detected in 11 of 30 (36.7%), and of IL-1-Ra-autoantibodies in 14 of 30 (46.7%) patients. In a validation cohort of 64 patients with critical COVID-19 high-titer PGRN-Abs were detected in 25 (39%) and IL-1-Ra-Abs in 32 of 64 patients (50%). PGRN-Abs and IL-1-Ra-Abs belonged to IgM and several IgG subclasses. In separate cohorts with non-critical COVID-19, PGRN-Abs and IL-1-Ra-Abs were detected in low frequency (i.e. in < 5% of patients) and at low titers. Neither PGRN-nor IL-1-Ra-Abs were found in 40 healthy controls vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 or 188 unvaccinated healthy controls. PGRN-Abs were not cross-reactive against SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins nor against IL-1-Ra. Plasma levels of both free PGRN and free IL-1-Ra were significantly decreased in autoantibody-positive patients compared to Ab-negative and non-COVID-19 controls. In vitro PGRN-Abs from patients functionally reduced PGRN-dependent inhibition of TNF- signaling, and IL-1-Ra-Abs from patients reduced IL-1-Ra- or anakinra-dependent inhibition of IL-1? signaling. The pSer81 hyperphosphorylated PGRN isoform was exclusively detected in patients with high-titer PGRN-Abs; likewise, a hyperphosphorylated IL-1-Ra isoform was only found in patients with high-titer IL-1-Ra-Abs. Thr111 was identified as the hyperphophorylated amino acid of IL-1-Ra. In longitudinally collected samples hyperphosphorylated isoforms of both PGRN and IL-1-Ra emerged transiently, and preceded the appearance of autoantibodies. In hospitalized patients, the presence of IL-1-Ra-Abs or IL-1-Ra-Abs in combination with PGRN-Abs was associated with a higher morbidity and mortality. To conclude, neutralizing autoantibodies to IL-1-Ra and PGRN occur in a significant portion of patients with critical COVID-19, with a concomitant decrease in circulating free PGRN and IL-1-Ra, indicative of a misdirected, proinflammatory autoimmune response. The break of self-tolerance is likely caused by atypical hyperphosphorylated isoforms of both antigens, whose appearances precede autoantibody induction. Our data suggest that these immunogenic secondary modifications are induced by the SARS-CoV-2-infection itself or the inflammatory environment evoked by the infection and predispose for a critical course of COVID-19.","output":"Autoantibodies against Progranulin and IL-1 receptor antagonist due to immunogenic posttranslational isoforms contribute to hyperinflammation in critically ill COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A comprehensive model to explain variation across U.

Treatment options remain limited due to the lack of antivirals. Octaguanidinium-conjugated morpholino oligomers (vivo-MOs) are single-stranded DNA-like antisense agents that can readily penetrate cells and reduce gene expression by steric blocking of complementary RNA sequences. In this study, inhibitory effects of three vivo-MOs that are complementary to the EV-71 internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) were tested in RD cells. Vivo-MO-1 and vivo-MO-2 targeting the EV-71 IRES showed significant viral plaque reductions of 2.5 and 3.5 log(10)PFU/ml, respectively. Both vivo-MOs reduced viral RNA copies and viral capsid expression in RD cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, vivo-MO-3 targeting the EV-71 RdRP exhibited less antiviral activity. Both vivo-MO-1 and 2 remained active when administered either 4 h before or within 6 h after EV-71 infection. Vivo-MO-2 exhibited antiviral activities against poliovirus (PV) and coxsackievirus A16 but vivo-MO-1 showed no antiviral activities against PV. Both the IRES-targeting vivo-MO-1 and vivo-MO-2 inhibit EV-71 RNA translation. Resistant mutants arose after serial passages in the presence of vivo-MO-1, but none were isolated against vivo-MO-2. A single T to C substitution at nucleotide position 533 was sufficient to confer resistance to vivo-MO-1.

The notion that the real age is not chronological, but the biological one led to the concept of \\"bioage\\", defining the biologic reactivity and resilience, including the immune competence of an individual. A competent immune network, systemic and mucosal is intrinsic to resilience and homeostasis of the human holobiont as the unit of evolution. In elderly, the immunosenescence could be associated with higher levels of proinflammatory mediators (such as IL-6), frialty and mortality. Proi-inflammatory state in elderly is denoted as inflammaging, characterized with low-grade (sterile) inflammation, as a physiologic response to life-long antigenic stimuli. When under control, inflammaging could be regarded as an efficient defense mechanism, oposed and regulated by anti-inflammatory pathways and molecules. Immunosensecence.

The results demonstrate the potential of A12-LLV2 as a live-attenuated vaccine as well as a safe source of antigen for chemically inactivated vaccines.","output":"Protection of swine by live and inactivated vaccines prepared from a leader proteinase-deficient serotype A12 foot-and-mouth disease virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To report a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection 6 months after the first infection in a young healthy female physician. Both episodes led to mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal specimens. Reinfection was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing. Kinetics of total anti-S receptor binding domain immunoglobulins (Ig anti-S RBD), anti-nucleoprotein (anti-N) and neutralizing antibodies were determined in serial serum samples retrieved during both infection episodes. Memory B-cell responses were assessed at day 12 after reinfection. RESULTS: Whole-genome sequencing identified two different SARS-CoV-2 genomes both belonging to clade 20A, with only one nonsynonymous mutation in the spike protein and clustered with viruses circulating in Geneva (Switzerland) at the time of each of the corresponding episodes. Seroconversion was documented with low levels of total Ig anti-S RBD and anti-N antibodies at 1 month after the first infection, whereas neutralizing antibodies quickly declined after the first episode and then were boosted by the reinfection, with high titres detectable 4 days after symptom onset. A strong memory B-cell response was detected at day 12 after onset of symptoms during reinfection, indicating that the first episode elicited cellular memory responses. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid decline of neutralizing antibodies may put medical personnel at risk of reinfection, as shown in this case. However, reinfection leads to a significant boosting of previous immune responses. Larger cohorts of reinfected subjects with detailed descriptions of their immune responses are needed to define correlates of protection and their duration after infection.","output":"Clinical, virologic and immunologic features of a mild case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen En este artculo se revisan las publicaciones y los estudios de mayor relevancia en el mbito de la cardiologa intervencionista en el a?o 2020 Dentro del intervencionismo coronario, varios estudios han aportado informacin relevante en cuanto al tratamiento quirrgico o percutneo del tronco coronario izquierdo, as como en el abordaje de bifurcaciones consideradas complejas En antiagregacin tras sndrome coronario agudo e intervencionismo, hay estudios importantes que supondrn modificaciones de las guas de prctica clnica En angina estable, los datos indican que el manejo inicial conservador puede ser adecuado Finalmente, la fisiologa coronaria sigue despertando gran inters en diferentes contextos clnicos y anatmicos En cuanto al intervencionismo estructural, contina experimentando un importante crecimiento y desarrollo Se ha publicado el primer estudio aleatorizado sobre el tratamiento antitrombtico tras implante de vlvula artica percutnea, que cambiar nuestra prctica clnica Destacan tambin los avances y primeros implantes de prtesis percutneas mitrales y tricspides y la evidencia en favor del cierre de la orejuela en pacientes de alto riesgo Finalmente, este a?o ha estado marcado por la pandemia de COVID-19 y su repercusin sobre la actividad asistencial e investigadora This article reviews the most relevant studies in the field of interventional cardiology in 2020 In the area of coronary intervention, relevant information with respect to the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) vs coronary artery bypass grafting for the left main treatment has been published, as well as, the best approach in dealing with complex bifurcation lesions There have also been significant studies regarding antiplatelet strategies in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI, which will potentially change our clinical practice Regarding stable angina, data point out that an initial conservative treatment can be an appropriate strategy Finally, coronary physiology continues to generate a great interest in different clinical and anatomical contexts The advances in the field of intervention for structural heart disease have continued to increase exponentially in the last year The first randomized trial assessing the optimal antithrombotic treatment after transcatheter aortic valve implantation has been published and that will have clinical implications It also highlightes the development and implantation of the first mitral and tricuspid percutaneous prosthesis, as well as, the evidence in favour of left atrial appendage closure in high-risk patients Finally, this year has been marked by the COVID-19 pandemic which has had an impact on the clinical and research activities","output":"Seleccin de lo mejor del a?o 2020 en cardiologa intervencionista"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On May 12, 2020, a symposium titled Liability of healthcare professionals and institutions during COVID-19 pandemic was held in Italy with the participation of national experts in malpractice law, hospital management, legal medicine, and clinical risk management.

The aim of this study is to describe how individuals with IDD have been affected in the first 100 days of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Shortly after the first COVID-19 case was reported in the USA, our organisation, which provides continuous support for over 11 000 individuals with IDD, assembled an outbreak committee composed of senior leaders from across the health care organisation. The committee led the development and deployment of a comprehensive COVID-19 prevention and suppression strategy, utilising current evidence-based practice, while surveilling the global and local situation daily. We implemented enhanced infection control procedures across 2400 homes, which were communicated to our employees using multi-faceted channels including an electronic resource library, mobile and web applications, paper postings in locations, live webinars and direct mail. Using custom-built software applications enabling us to track patient, client and employee cases and exposures, we leveraged current public health recommendations to identify cases and to suppress transmission, which included the use of personal protective equipment. A COVID-19 case was defined as a positive nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: In the 100-day period between 20 January 2020 and 30 April 2020, we provided continuous support for 11 540 individuals with IDD. Sixty-four per cent of the individuals were in residential, community settings, and 36% were in intermediate care facilities. The average age of the cohort was 46  12 years, and 60% were male. One hundred twenty-two individuals with IDD were placed in quarantine for exhibiting symptoms and signs of acute infection such as fever or cough. Sixty-six individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and their average age was 50. The positive individuals were located in 30 different homes (1.3% of total) across 14 states. Fifteen homes have had single cases, and 15 have had more than one case. Fifteen COVID-19-positive individuals were hospitalised. As of 30 April, seven of the individuals hospitalised have been discharged back to home and are recovering. Five remain hospitalised, with three improving and two remaining in intensive care and on mechanical ventilation. There have been three deaths. We found that among COVID-19-positive individuals with IDD, a higher number of chronic medical conditions and male sex were characteristics associated with a greater likelihood of hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: In the first 100 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in the USA, we observed that people with IDD living in congregate care settings can benefit from a coordinated approach to infection control, case identification and cohorting, as evidenced by the low relative case rate reported. Male individuals with higher numbers of chronic medical conditions were more likely to be hospitalised, while most younger, less chronically ill individuals recovered spontaneously at home.","output":"Supporting individuals with intellectual and developmental disability during the first 100 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous research has shown that the COVID-19 outbreak, social distancing and lockdown can affect people's psychological well-being. The aim of this study was to estimate the extent to which perceptions and expectations regarding the social, economic and domestic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak are associated with psychological distress, and identify some demographic, psychosocial and economic factors associated with increased vulnerability to psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak in Chile. 1078 people participated in a telephone survey between May 30 and June 10, 2020. The sample is representative of the Chilean adult population. Psychological distress was assessed through a questionnaire of anxious and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-4). We analyze the data set using ordinary least-squares regression models, first estimating models for the entire sample, and then stratifying the sample into different groups to explore differences by gender and age. 19.2% participants displayed significant psychological distress, with moderate to severe anxiety-depression symptoms being more prevalent in women than in men (23.9% vs 14.09%, chi square 6.89, p < 0.001). The results of this study suggest that being a woman, feeling lonely and isolated, living in the areas hit hardest by the pandemic and lockdown, expecting a lack of income due to having to stop working as a consequence of the pandemic, and having a history of mental health diagnosis are significantly associated with psychological distress (p < 0.05).

The majority of those compounds have been classified as primary and secondary metabolites. Secondary metabolites are essential in plants adaptation to new changing environments and in managing several biotic and abiotic stress. It also invests some of its photosynthesized carbon as secondary metabolites to establish a mutual relationship with soil microorganisms in that specific niche. As soil harbors both pathogenic and beneficial microorganisms, it is essential to identify some specific metabolites that can discriminate beneficial and pathogenic ones. Thus, a detailed understanding of metabolites architectures that interact with beneficial microorganisms could open a new horizon of ecology and agricultural research. Flavonoids are used as classic examples of secondary metabolites in this study to demonstrate recent developments in understanding and realizing how these valuable metabolites can be controlled at different levels. Most of the research was focused on plant flavonoids, which shield the host plant against competitors or predators, as well as having other ecological implications. Thus, in the present review, our goal is to cover a wide range of functional and signalling activities of secondary metabolites especially, flavonoids mediated selective cross-talk between plant and its beneficial soil microbiome.

However, to date, efforts to improve nanoparticle accumulation at target disease sites have largely failed to translate clinically, stemming from an incomplete understanding of nanoCbio interactions.

We and others have recently begun leveraging library-based nanoparticle screens to study structureCfunction relationships of lipid- and polymer-based drug delivery systems to guide nanoparticle design. These combinatorial screening efforts are showing promise in leading to the successful identification of critical characteristics that yield improved and specific accumulation at target sites. However, there is a crucial need to equally consider the influence of biological complexity on nanoparticle delivery, particularly in the context of clinical translation. For example, tissue and cellular heterogeneity presents an additional dimension to nanoparticle trafficking, uptake, and accumulation; applying imaging and screening tools as well as bioinformatics may further expand our understanding of how nanoparticles engage with cells and tissues.

TLR2 gene knockout (TLR2KO) mice have been widely used for animal models of neurological diseases. Since there is close relationship between immune system and neurobehavioral functions, it is important to clarify the exact role of TLR2 defect itself in neurobehavioral functions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of TLR2KO on neurobehavioral functions in mice and the mechanisms underlying the observed changes. METHODS Male TLR2KO and wild type (WT) mice aged 3, 7, and 12 months were used for neurobehavioral testing and detection of protein expression by Western blot. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrophysiological recording, and Evans blue (EB) assay were applied to evaluate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), synaptic function, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in 12-month-old TLR2KO and age-matched WT mice. RESULTS Compared to WT mice, TLR2KO mice showed decreased cognitive function and locomotor activity, as well as increased anxiety, which developed from middle age (before 7-month-old) to old age. In addition, significantly reduced regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), inhibited long-term potentiation (LTP), and increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability were observed in 12-month-old TLR2KO mice. Furthermore, compared with age-matched WT mice, significant reduction in protein levels of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin5) and increased neurofilament protein (SMI32) were observed in 7 and 12-month-old TLR2KO mice, and that myelin basic protein (MBP) decreased in 12-month-old TLR2KO mice.

One such factor that is being discussed and tested is the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. The available evidence suggests that BCG vaccination provides broad protection against respiratory infections as well as other infections. Therefore, BCG may prove to be a barrier for COVID-19 infection and may offer a ray of hope. In this review, we contrasted BCG vaccination program with COVID-19 mortality and analyzed trained immunity and cross protection against unrelated pathogens due to BCG vaccination. On analyzing the available data, we observed that countries without universal BCG vaccination policy are severely affected, while countries having universal BCG policies are less affected. Based on these data, we propose that the SARS-CoV-2 related qualified immunity, cross protection against unrelated pathogens and COVID-19 impact variations could be partly explained by the different national policies regarding BCG childhood vaccination.

The LungPass is an automated lung sound analysis platform developed using neural network technology and previously trained. We hypothesised that the LungPass could be used as a screening tool for LRT involvement in patients with COVID-19. Methods: In a prospective observational study involving 282 individuals with presenting in the emergency department with a strong clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and imaging findings consistent with COVID-19 LRT involvement (25.5% had concomitant hypoxia), and 32 healthy controls, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the LungPass in identifying LRT involvement in COVID-19. We also compared the auscultatory findings of the LungPass compared to a chest physician using a traditional, high-quality stethoscope. Results: Among individuals with COVID-19 LRT involvement, the LungPass identified crackles in at least one auscultation site in 93.6% and in two or more points in 84%. Moreover, the LungPass identified any abnormal lung sound (crackles or wheeze) in at least one auscultation site in 98.6% and in at least two points in 94% of the participants.

This recurrent syndrome is a combination of physically, mentally, or behaviorally disturbing changes occurring during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a cognitive-behavioral therapy-based educational intervention using social networks on PMS in female health center employees in Rudbar, Iran. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized superiority controlled trial will be conducted involving 140 female employees of health centers affiliated with the Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rudbar. The study involves a block size of 4 and 6 in a randomly varied order, 140 women who meet all the inclusion criteria will be randomly and equally divided into 2 groups: the intervention and the control groups. Those in the former group will receive a cognitive-behavioral therapy-based treatment for eight consecutive weeks on the social network platform WhatsApp; however, those in the control group will not be offered any treatment except usual care practices (unprotocolized usual care). The studys primary outcome is the severity of PMS symptoms, and the secondary outcomes include general self-efficacy, work-related quality of life, the impact of PMS on daily life, coping with the symptoms, and experiencing anxiety and depression at the beginning of the study to identify people with PMS. A daily record of the symptoms will be completed for two consecutive months by all female employees aged 20C45 years who wish to participate in the study. According to the initial screening, those with moderate to severe PMS will be included. We will use the MLwin software for the analyses. All questionnaires will be completed by both groups immediately and 8 weeks after the termination of the treatment. The data will be analyzed using linear mixed-effects modeling with random intercepts and slopes. DISCUSSION: It is anticipated that the findings of the present study may demonstrate the effectiveness of the cognitive behavioral therapy intervention on the severity of PMS symptoms that could guide healthcare providers in opting for suitable treatment alternatives for the syndrome.

The administration was repeated one month after the end of lockdown measures, with the addition of a qualitative questionnaire (COVID-QoL Questionnaire) exploring family reorganization and personal perception of lock down. Results: QoL and perceived health status did not worsen during lockdown, while caregiver burden increased (p = 0.01). Patient's QoL and caregiver burden were inversely correlated at T1 (ZBI total score mildly correlated with Mc Gill existential subscore, p = 0.02, rho = 0.30 and with Mc Gill total score, p = 0.05, rho = 0.265). No significant correlations were found at T2. According to the COVID-QoL questionnaire, caregivers perceived lower family help compared to patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Restricted measures of lockdown period during COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a significant reduction of QoL in our cohort of ALS patients, while caregiver burden significantly increased. ALS motor impairment may have played a role in the unchanged life conditions of patients. Instead, the restriction of family help for primary caregivers could be responsible of their increased burden, reflecting the importance of a wide social support in the management of this clinical condition.","output":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis caregiver burden and patients' quality of life during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: The COVID-19 lockdown has not only helped in combating the community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 but also improved air quality in a very emphatic manner in most of the countries. In India, the first phase of COVID-19 lockdown came into force on March 25, 2020, which was later continued in the next phases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the result of lockdown on air quality of major metropolitan cities-Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Jaipur, and Lucknow-from March 25 to May 3, 2020. For this study, the concentration of six criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, and O3) and air quality index during the COVID-19 lockdown period was compared with the same period of the previous year 2019. The results indicate a substantial improvement in air quality with a drastic decrease in the concentration of PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2, while there is a moderate reduction in SO2 and O3 concentration. During the lockdown period, the maximum reduction in the concentration of PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, and O3 was observed to be - 49% (Lucknow), - 57% (Delhi), - 75% (Mumbai), - 68% (Kolkata), - 48% (Mumbai), and - 29% (Hyderabad), respectively. The value of the air quality index (AQI) also dwindled significantly during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The maximum decline in AQI was observed - 52% in Bengaluru and Lucknow. The order of AQI was satisfactory > moderate > good > poor and the frequency order of prominent pollutants was O3 > PM10 > PM2.5 > CO > NO2 > SO2 during the lockdown period in all the aforementioned metropolitan cities.","output":"COVID-19 lockdown: a boon in boosting the air quality of major Indian Metropolitan Cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAcute hospital clinicians play a key role in initiating discussions around advance care planning (ACP) Despite a widespread agreement that ACP is beneficial and facilitates patient-centred decision making, ACP prevalence in the acute hospital setting can be sporadic COVID-19 created a heightened awareness of the need for early decision-making, in order to ensure patients received appropriate treatments, based on their general health, personal values and individual wishes MethodsA retrospective study of patients admitted to a tertiary UK hospital Cardiology department during two discrete time periods;December 2019 and April 2020 Data was collected from electronic records and compared for significant differences between groups This included the completion of ReSPECT forms, age, co-morbidities, frailty score and discharge diagnosis ResultsThe study included 164 patients in total There was no significant difference in age, co-morbidities or frailty between the groups ReSPECT form completion significantly increased from December 2019 to April 2020 (9/84 (11%) vs 39/80 (49%);p &lt;

The survey included questions about COVID-19 patient and outbreak management, personal protective equipment (PPE), and occupational health considerations. RESULTS: Our preliminary results (n=24) were from infectious disease MD/NP or infection control medical directors. All respondents agreed treatment of COVID-19 patients should only occur in the context of a clinical trial. Of 18 centers with neonatal populations, the majority (64.2%) did not have any neonatal specific treatment guidelines. Well-babies born to COVID-19 positive moms, are all being tested (10 of 10 respondents).

In the framework of such attempts, in a number of in vitro, as well as in vivo, models it was shown that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has an effect against SARS-CoV-2. While there were not enough clinical data to support the use of HCQ, several countries including Russia have included HCQ in treatment protocols for infected patients and for prophylaxis. In the current non-randomized, observational study we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharynx swabs from infected patients 7-10 days post symptoms with clinically mild disease and compared the viral RNA load dynamics between patients receiving HCQ (200 mg twice per day according to the Ministry of Health of Russian Federation treatment instructions, n = 33) and a control group without antiviral pharmacological therapy (n = 12). We found a statistically significant relationship between maximal RNA quantity and deterioration of patients' medical conditions, and as well we confirmed arterial hypertension to be a risk factor for people with COVID-19.

There is also little information on the temporal components of this relationship. Using the districts of Hong Kong over multiple census years as a case study, we demonstrate that there are differences in how wealth indicator variables are associated with longevity in (a) areas that are affluent but neighbored by socially deprived districts versus (b) wealthy areas surrounded by similarly wealthy districts. We also show that the inclusion of spatially-distributed variables reduces uncertainty in mortality rate predictions in each census year when compared with a baseline model. Our results suggest that geographic mortality models should incorporate nonlocal information (e.g., spatial neighbors) to lower the variance of their mortality estimates, and point to a more in-depth analysis of sociospatial spillover effects on mortality rates.","output":"The sociospatial factors of death: Analyzing effects of geospatially-distributed variables in a Bayesian mortality model for Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To better understand the mental health impact of disasters in general and specifically the mental health health impact of the COVID pandemic.

How were people's lives really affected by this pandemic and the subsequent measures taken? We do know that COVID 19 as a disaster had a wider scale of social impacts than it did physical ones. How does the isolation, inability to work as usual and general downturn of ordinary life impact on people? What if those persons already have a history of serious life events or of mental illness?

From the perspective of social psychological stress, it is important to depict the interactive infection law among distinct types of rumor engagers (i.e., advocates, supporters, and amplifiers) under different social psychological stress states, and explore the effectiveness of rumor intervention strategies (i.e., hindering and persuasion) from multiple dimensions, to scientifically predict the situation of public opinion field and guide the public to restore psychological stability. Therefore, this paper constructs an interactive infection model of multiple rumor engagers under different intervention situations based on a unique user-aggregated dataset collected from a Chinese leading online microblogging platform (Sina Weibo) during the COVID-19 in 2020. The simulation result shows that (1) in the period of social psychological alarm reaction, the strong level of hindering intervention on the rumor engagers leads to more serious negative consequences; (2) in the period of social psychological resistance, the persuasion and hindering strategies can both produce good outcomes, which can effectively reduce the overall scale of rumor supporters and amplifiers and shorten their survival time in social media; (3) in the period of social psychological exhaustion, rumor intervention strategies are not able to have a significant impact; (4) the greater the intensity of intervention, the more obvious the outcome.

The hybrid protein carrying the wild-type repressor domain is mostly secreted to the cell surface, whereas hybrid proteins with amino acid substitutions that cause the repressor domain to be thermodynamically unstable are retained intracellularly. Surprisingly, the retained hybrids are found in the vacuole, where the repressor moiety is degraded by vacuolar proteases. The following observations indicate that receptor-mediated recognition of the mutant repressor domain in the Golgi lumen targets these hybrid fusions to the vacuole. (a) The invertase-repressor fusions, like wild-type invertase, behave as soluble proteins in the ER lumen. (b) Targeting to the vacuole is saturable since overexpression of the hybrids carrying mutant repressor increases the fraction of fusion protein that appears at the cell surface. (c) Finally, deletion of the VPS10 gene, which encodes the transmembrane Golgi receptor responsible for targeting carboxypeptidase Y to the vacuole, causes the mutant hybrids to be diverted to the cell surface.

OBJECTIVES: PASSPORT-HF is a prospective, randomized, open, multicenter trial evaluating the effects of a hemodynamic-guided, HF nurse-led care approach using the CardioMEMS? HF-System on clinical end points. METHODS AND RESULTS: The PASSPORT-HF trial has been commissioned by the German Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) to ascertain the efficacy of PA pressure-guided remote care in the German health-care system. PASSPORT-HF includes adult HF patients in NYHA functional class III, who experienced an HF-related hospitalization within the last 12 months. Patients with reduced ejection fraction must be on stable guideline-directed pharmacotherapy. Patients will be randomized centrally 1:1 to implantation of a CardioMEMS? sensor or control. All patients will receive post-discharge support facilitated by trained HF nurses providing structured telephone-based care. The trial will enroll 554 patients at about 50 study sites. The primary end point is a composite of the number of unplanned HF-related rehospitalizations or all-cause death after 12 months of follow-up, and all events will be adjudicated centrally. Secondary end points include device/system-related complications, components of the primary end point, days alive and out of hospital, disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life including their sub-scales, and laboratory parameters of organ damage and disease progression.

In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the FakeWake phenomena from three aspects. To start with, we design the first fuzzy word generator to automatically and efficiently produce fuzzy words instead of searching through a swarm of audio materials. We manage to generate 965 fuzzy words covering 8 most popular English and Chinese smart speakers. To explain the causes underlying the FakeWake phenomena, we construct an interpretable tree-based decision model, which reveals phonetic features that contribute to false acceptance of fuzzy words by wake-up word detectors. Finally, we propose remedies to mitigate the effect of FakeWake. The results show that the strengthened models are not only resilient to fuzzy words but also achieve better overall performance on original training datasets.","output":"FakeWake: Understanding and Mitigating Fake Wake-up Words of Voice Assistants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Now-a-days, the novel coronavirus pandemic has projected millions of deaths around the globe.

With the possibility of exposure to a variety of respiratory toxicants from airborne pollutants in our environment during the course of daily activities, in occupational settings, the use of aerosol sprays for household products, and the development of inhalant bronchial therapies, pulmonary toxicology has become an important subspecialty of toxicology. The lung is susceptible to injury following hematogenous exposure to toxicants. Susceptibility to injury and the type of response following exposure to air- or blood-borne toxicants is largely dependent on the physiochemical characteristics and concentration of the toxicant, duration of exposure, site/tissue specific sensitivity, and the integrity of the defense mechanisms of the lung. In this chapter, nonneoplastic and neoplastic spontaneous lesions and those that develop in the lungs of rats following exposure to toxicants by various routes, but primarily by inhalation, are discussed in detail which provides insight into our understanding of how human lungs respond to toxic chemicals. In addition, the gross and microscopic anatomy of the rat lung is also discussed some detail. Although inhalation is the primary route of exposure in experimental studies, in the past, many studies used intratracheal instillation or direct injection of known carcinogens into the lung. These experiments often resulted in the development of squamous cell carcinomas even though they are very rare as a naturally occurring neoplasm. Instillation of chemicals or particles into the trachea or pleura or direct injection into the lung results in lesions or responses that may not be as relevant to understanding the mechanism of pulmonary carcinogenesis as inhalation of materials under more normal conditions. There remain, however, many areas where our understanding of the response of the lung to toxic chemicals is incomplete.","output":"Lung, Pleura, and Mediastinum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Data regarding the association between preexisting cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and the outcomes of patients requiring hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of preexisting CVRFs or CVDs on the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a Korean healthcare system. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to 10 hospitals in Daegu Metropolitan City, Korea, were examined. All sequentially hospitalized patients between February 15, 2020, and April 24, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 based on the positive results on the polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal samples. Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as requiring intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and death, were evaluated. Moreover, data on baseline comorbidities such as a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, current smoking, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accidents, and other chronic cardiac diseases were obtained. RESULTS: Of all the patients enrolled, 954 (42.0%) had preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. Among the CVRFs, the most common were hypertension (28.8%) and diabetes mellitus (17.0%). The prevalence rates of preexisting CVRFs or CVDs increased with age (P < 0.001). The number of patients requiring intensive care (P < 0.001) and invasive MV (P < 0.001) increased with age. The in-hospital death rate increased with age (P < 0.001). Patients requiring intensive care (5.3% vs. 1.6%; P < 0.001) and invasive MV (4.3% vs. 1.7%; P < 0.001) were significantly greater in patients with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. In-hospital mortality (12.9% vs. 3.1%; P < 0.001) was significantly higher in patients with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. Among the CVRFs, diabetes mellitus and hypertension were associated with increased requirement of intensive care and invasive MV and in-hospital death. Among the known CVDs, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure were associated with invasive MV and in-hospital death. In multivariate analysis, preexisting CVRFs or CVDs (odds ratio [OR], 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07C3.01; P = 0.027) were independent predictors of in-hospital death after adjusting for confounding variables. Among individual preexisting CVRF or CVD components, diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.51C3.90; P < 0.001) and congestive heart failure (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.06C5.87; P = 0.049) were independent predictors of in-hospital death.

In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, when medical personnel should use personal protective equipment against aerosol-generating procedures, the efficiency of medical procedures may decrease. The study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of different intravascular access methods applied by nurses wearing biosafety Level-2 suits in simulated paediatric COVID-19 resuscitation. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, crossover, single-blinded simulation trial was performed. Nursing staff attending Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support courses accredited by the American Heart Association participated in the study. A total of 65 nurses were recruited and randomly assigned to different study groups. They received standard training on intravascular access methods employing distinct devices. The participants wore biosafety Level-2 suits and performed vascular access with the following intraosseous devices: NIO-P, EZ-IO, and Jamshidi needle; intravenous (IV) access was used as a reference method. Both the order of participants and the access methods were random. Each participant performed intravascular access with each of the four methods tested. The effectiveness of the first attempt to obtain intravascular access and the following time parameters were analysed: the time between grasping the intravascular device out of the original packing until infusion line connection. The ease of the procedure was measured with a visual analogue scale (1 - easy; 10 - difficult). RESULTS: The first attempt success rate of intravascular access by using NIO-P and EZ-IO equalled 100% and was statistically significantly higher than that with the Jamshidi needle (80.0%; p = 0.02) and with the IV method (69.2%; p = 0.005). The time required to connect the infusion line varied and amounted to 33  4 s for NIO-P compared to 37  6.7 s for EZ-IO (p<0.001), 43  7 s for Jamshidi (p<0.001), and 98.5  10 s for IV access (p<0.001).

CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that nurses wearing biosafety Level-2 suits were able to obtain intraosseous access faster and more effectively as compared with IV access during simulated COVID-19 paediatric resuscitation. The most effective method of intravascular access was the NIO-P intraosseous device.

This study aimed to explore the psychological well-being of older people, which is important especially in an ageing society categorised as low income or middle income due to the limits of economic and healthcare resources. SETTING: The impact of COVID-19 on older persons in Thailand, an online survey, taken across nine provinces within the five regions of the country. PARTICIPANTS: Information was collected from 1230 adults aged at least 60 years old. If an older person was illiterate, unable to access the internet or had a disability preventing them from responding to the survey, an intermediary residing in the community conducted the survey interview. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The analysis focused on the worries of older adults and the factors associated with psychological distress experienced during the pandemic using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The majority of people aged at least 60 years old experienced psychological distress during COVID-19. Employment loss (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.38), inadequate income (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.44) and debt incursion (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.57 to 4.80) were detrimental to psychological well-being.

We review theoretical and empirical studies of host movement and infection spread, highlighting the multiple factors that impact the infection status of hosts. We then outline characteristics of hosts, parasites and the environment that influence these dynamics. Recent technological advances provide disease ecologists unprecedented ability to track the fine-scale movement of organisms.

A total of 1838 subjects aged 60 years or older, of whom 1531 subjects (321 smokers, 1152 non-smokers and 58 cigar/pipe smokers) who returned the smoking questionnaire and were not previously vaccinated, were used in the analyses. The main outcome measures were serological influenza (fourfold increase of antibody titre between 3 weeks and 5 months after vaccination); clinical influenza as determined by criteria of the Dutch Sentinel Stations from self reported symptoms in postal questionnaires 10 weeks and 5 months after vaccination; increases after vaccination and decreases after 5 months in logarithmic titres of antibody against the vaccine strains. No relation between smoking and either serological or clinical influenza was found, although the risk for serological influenza was slightly (not significantly) elevated in smokers compared to non-smokers. A statistical interaction was found between smoking and vaccination when serological influenza was the outcome measure indicating that the efficacy of vaccination was greater in smokers than in non-smokers (comparison of model with and without interaction; likelihood ratio test, p<0.0001). This finding is supported by a greater titre rise 3 weeks after vaccination for two out of four strains, but not by the antibody response after vaccination in previous studies on influenza and other infectious diseases.

Reovirus infection elicits production of type I interferons (IFNs), which trigger antiviral pathways through the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified, the functions of many of these genes are unknown. The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are one class of ISGs that restrict the cell entry of some enveloped viruses, including influenza A virus. One family member, IFITM3, localizes to late endosomes, where reoviruses undergo proteolytic disassembly; therefore, we sought to determine whether IFITM3 also restricts reovirus entry. IFITM3-expressing cell lines were less susceptible to infection by reovirus, as they exhibited significantly lower percentages of infected cells in comparison to control cells. Reovirus replication was also significantly reduced in IFITM3-expressing cells. Additionally, cells expressing an shRNA targeting IFITM3 exhibited a smaller decrease in infection after IFN treatment than the control cells, indicating that endogenous IFITM3 restricts reovirus infection. However, IFITM3 did not restrict entry of reovirus infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs), which do not require endosomal proteolysis, indicating that restriction occurs in the endocytic pathway. Proteolysis of outer capsid protein 1 was delayed in IFITM3-expressing cells in comparison to control cells, suggesting that IFITM3 modulates the function of late endosomal compartments either by reducing the activity of endosomal proteases or delaying the proteolytic processing of virions. These data provide the first evidence that IFITM3 restricts infection by a nonenveloped virus and suggest that IFITM3 targets an increasing number of viruses through a shared requirement for endosomes during cell entry.","output":"Interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) restricts reovirus cell entry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on risk factors for infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) from India.

The governance structure for VA implementation comprised a multidisciplinary team of technical experts, implementers and staff at different levels within ministries. A staged approach to VA implementation involved scoping and mapping of death registration processes, followed by pretest and pilot phases which allowed for redesign before a phased scale-up. Existing health workforce in countries were trained to conduct the VA interviews as part of their routine role. Costs included training and compensation for the VA interviewers, information technology (IT) infrastructure costs, advocacy and dissemination, which were borne by the funding agency in early stages of implementation. The complexity of the necessary infrastructure, logistics and IT support required for VA increased with scale-up. Quality assurance was built into the different phases of the implementation.

Attenuated vaccines have proven their potential to induce strong and long-lasting immune responses. We have previously described that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope (E) protein is a virulence factor. Based on this knowledge, a collection of mutants carrying partial deletions spanning the C-terminal domain of the E protein (rMERS-CoV-E*) has been generated using a reverse genetics system. One of these mutants, MERS-CoV-E*&#916;2in, was attenuated and provided full protection in a challenge with virulent MERS-CoV after a single immunization dose. The MERS-CoV-E*&#916;2in mutant was stable as it maintained its attenuation after 16 passages in cell cultures and has been selected as a promising vaccine candidate.IMPORTANCE The emergence of the new highly pathogenic human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that has already infected more than 80 million persons, killing nearly two million of them, clearly indicates the need to design efficient and safe vaccines protecting from these coronaviruses. Modern vaccines can be derived from virus-host interaction research directed to the identification of signaling pathways essential for virus replication and for virus-induced pathogenesis, in order to learn how to attenuate these viruses and design vaccines. Using a reverse genetics system developed in our laboratory, an infectious cDNA clone of MERS-CoV was engineered. Using this cDNA, we sequentially deleted several predicted and conserved motifs within the envelope (E) protein of MERS-CoV, previously associated with the presence of virulence factors. The in vitro and in vivo evaluation of these deletion mutants highlighted the relevance of predicted linear motifs in viral pathogenesis. Two of them, an Atg8 protein binding motif (Atg8-BM), and a forkhead-associated binding motif (FHA-BM), when deleted, rendered an attenuated virus that was evaluated as a vaccine candidate, leading to full protection against challenge with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV.

For instance, some criminals create rumors and send them on the internet, then other people help them to spread it. Spreading rumors can be an example of cyber abuse, where rumors or lies about the victim are posted on the internet to send threatening messages or to share the victims personal information. During pandemics, a large amount of rumors spreads on social media very fast, which have dramatic effects on peoples health. Detecting these rumors manually by the authorities is very difficult in these open platforms. Therefore, several researchers conducted studies on utilizing intelligent methods for detecting such rumors. The detection methods can be classified mainly into machine learning-based and deep learning-based methods. The deep learning methods have comparative advantages against machine learning ones as they do not require preprocessing and feature engineering processes and their performance showed superior enhancements in many fields.

The proposed model is based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Concatenated Parallel Convolutional Neural Networks (PCNN). The experiments were conducted on an ArCOV-19 dataset that included 3157 tweets;1480 of them were rumors (46.87%) and 1677 tweets were non-rumors (53.12%). The findings of the proposed model showed a superior performance compared to other methods in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F-score.","output":"A Novel Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Detecting COVID-19-Related Rumors on Social Media Based on LSTM and Concatenated Parallel CNNs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article outlines a playbook for labour policies to deal with novel shocks such as COVID-19 The labour-related characteristics of such shocks are outlined, with special attention to whether and how they require labour market policy responses that are different from the conventional policies Elements of a playbook for dealing with the crisis, as well as coming out of it, are outlined They include having a first-responder policy team in place;acting quickly but flexibly;determining early the novel versus permanent nature of the shock;keeping people in their existing jobs;co-ordinating across other departments and jurisdictions;balancing active labour market policy versus passive income support;co-ordinating with other departments and jurisdictions;having information on lessons from previous shocks;anticipating conflicts;and planning for the recovery with an exit strategy Although the playbook is illustrated with examples related to COVID-19, it applies to other novel shocks L'auteur decrit un livre de jeux en matiere de politiques du travail pour faire face aux nouveaux chocs comme celui de la pandemie de COVID-19 Il decrit les caracteristiques de ces chocs qui touchent l'emploi et se demande plus particulierement si ces chocs necessitent l'adoption de politiques differentes des politiques traditionnelles en ce qui a trait au marche du travail et comment la situation se presente L'auteur decrit les elements d'un livre de jeux pour gerer la crise, ainsi que pour en sortir Parmi ces elements figurent la constitution d'une equipe de premiers intervenants en matiere de politiques ;une intervention rapide mais flexible ;l'evaluation precoce de la nature, nouvelle ou permanente, du choc ;le maintien des travailleurs dans les emplois qu'ils occupent ;la coordination avec les autres ministeres et autorites ;l'equilibrage des politiques d'intervention directe sur le marche du travail et des programmes passifs de soutien au revenu ;la collecte d'informations sur les lecons tirees des secousses precedentes ;l'anticipation des conflits ;et la planification du retablissement au moyen d'une strategie de sortie Bien que le livre de jeux soit illustre a l'aide d'exemples lies a la COVID-19, il s'applique a d'autres nouveaux chocs","output":"Playbook for Labour Policies for Novel Shocks Such as COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The lack of guidelines for videoconferencing etiquette elucidated frustrations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors aimed to assess the perceptions of faculty educators and residents regarding videoconferencing etiquette. METHODS In 2021, a survey assessing perceptions regarding the formality of various meeting types and the importance of various videoconferencing etiquette practices (Likert scale of 1-5) was created and disseminated to all faculty educators and residents at a single institution. Responses of faculty versus residents were analyzed in general and by procedural and mixed/nonprocedural subspecialties. RESULTS The faculty response rate was 53.5% (38/71). The resident response rate was 7.3% (115/1569). A total of 19 departments were represented. Faculty respondents reported having significantly more hours of weekly formal meetings than residents, 4 (3-10) versus 2 (1-4) h (P < 0.05), and no difference in informal meeting hours, with 3 (2-6) versus 3 (1.6-5) h (P = 0.210). Faculty and residents concurred on the formality of all meeting types except for didactics, which residents regarded more frequently as informal (80.9% versus 57.9%; P < 0.01). Faculty rated wearing professional attire and keeping one's video on as mattering more, and that videoconferencing from bed was more inappropriate (P < 0.05). Furthermore, faculty and residents in mixed/nonprocedural specialties had more significantly discordant perceptions between them than did those in procedural specialties. CONCLUSIONS The data demonstrated that faculty educators and residents have differing perceptions regarding the formality of meeting types and etiquette practices. These should be addressed to prevent future frustrations and improve engagement in ongoing virtual conferencing education.","output":"Assessing Videoconference Etiquette in Academia: Determining Positive and Negative Associations With Online Interactions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected almost all countries and territories. As of December 6, 2020, the United States of America and India have the highest prevalence. Each country has implemented different strategies to control and reduce the spread of disease. Here, the association between prevalence number and health policies is evaluated by comparing 2 groups of countries: (1) Italy, the United States of America, Germany, Spain, and India with a higher prevalence than a linear trend line; and (2) Singapore and China with a lower or equal prevalence than linear forecasts. A rapid overview revealed that many countries have similar strategies for controlling COVID-19, including the suspension of air travel, the lockdown on the cities with the most cases detected, active case findings, monitoring of close contacts, and raising public awareness. Also, they used a gradual and phased plan to reopen activities. So, the difference between countries in the burden of COVID-19 can be attributable to the strict mode and nonstrict mode of implementation of strategies.

The COVID-19 pandemic, subsequent lockdown, and social distancing may have caused changes in newborn mothers mental health, postpartum depression (PPD), and breastfeeding practices. There is no information about this topic in Mexican mothers who have delivered newborns during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. The objective of this study was to explore whether quarantine measures, social distancing, and hospital containment policies altered the incidence rates of PPD, breastfeeding adherence, and skin-to-skin contact (SSC) in women giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsThis cross-sectional study included women who delivered a healthy baby at term in February to July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed an anonymous online survey incorporating the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.ResultsA total of 211 participants were included;their mean age was 30.5  4.6 years and the gestational age at the time of delivery was 38.3  2.0 weeks. Sixty (28.4%) participants reported PPD, and 196 (92.9%) reported breastfeeding their baby during COVID-19. Mothers with PPD had lower levels of exclusive breastfeeding ( P = 0.66) and breastfeeding with formula ( P = 0.29). Only 23 participants (10.9%) stopped breastfeeding because of issues with latching (30.4%). SSC was reported by 63% of participants and was more frequent immediately after birth (46%). Mothers with PPD reported less frequent SSC ( P = 0.001) and later initiation of SSC ( P = 0.001) after childbirth. Mothers who initiated SSC used exclusive breastfeeding more frequently during the first 48 h after birth ( P = 0.004).ConclusionsWe found a higher prevalence of PPD in new mothers during the pandemic. Mothers reporting PPD were less likely to initiate SSC after birth. These findings suggest that the pandemic and the measures adopted to fight its spread may have harmed maternal well-being during pregnancy and after delivery. Women giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic represent a vulnerable population that may need focused health care. SSC is a simple, cost-effective intervention that may help reduce the incidence of PPD.Trial registrationThis cross-sectional study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04769700).","output":"Postpartum depression and breastfeeding practices during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Mexican mothers: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Leukemia is fatal cancer in both children and adults and is divided into acute and chronic. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a subtype of this cancer. Early diagnosis of this disease can have a significant impact on the treatment of this disease. Computational intelligence-oriented techniques can be used to help physicians identify and classify ALL rapidly. Materials and Method. In this study, the utilized dataset was collected from a CodaLab competition to classify leukemic cells from normal cells in microscopic images. Two famous deep learning networks, including residual neural network (ResNet-50) and VGG-16 were employed. These two networks are already trained by our assigned parameters, meaning we did not use the stored weights; we adjusted the weights and learning parameters too. Also, a convolutional network with ten convolutional layers and 2?2 max-pooling layerswith strides 2was proposed, and six common machine learning techniques were developed to classify acute lymphoblastic leukemia into two classes. RESULTS: The validation accuracies (the mean accuracy of training and test networks for 100 training cycles) of the ResNet-50, VGG-16, and the proposed convolutional network were found to be 81.63%, 84.62%, and 82.10%, respectively. Among applied machine learning methods, the lowest obtained accuracy was related to multilayer perceptron (27.33%) and highest for random forest (81.72%). CONCLUSION: This study showed that the proposed convolutional neural network has optimal accuracy in the diagnosis of ALL. By comparing various convolutional neural networks and machine learning methods in diagnosing this disease, the convolutional neural network achieved good performance and optimal execution time without latency. This proposed network is less complex than the two pretrained networks and can be employed by pathologists and physicians in clinical systems for leukemia diagnosis.","output":"Timely Diagnosis of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Using Artificial Intelligence-Oriented Deep Learning Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccine-induced immunity is essential for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on humoral and cellular immunogenicity and safety of different SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with autoimmune rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) are limited. METHODS: A single center observational study evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of the two-dose regimen of the BBIBP-CorV inactivated, Gam-COVID-Vac and AZD1222 adenovirus-based, and BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 mRNA-based vaccines in patients with RMDs (n = 89) compared with healthy controls (n = 74). Neutralizing anti-RBD (receptor binding domain) specific antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell response were measured one and four months after the second vaccine dose in parallel with vaccination efficacy and safety. RESULTS: Disease-specific comparison showed that antibody response at four months was higher in spondylarthropathies compared to rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune RMDs. Risk factors for reduced immunogenicity included longer disease duration, positive immunoserological profile and anti-CD20 therapy of patients. The rate of positive anti-RBD antibody response for healthy controls versus patients after 4 months post vaccination was 69% vs. 55% for the inactivated viral vaccine BBIBP-CorV, 97% vs. 53% for the pooled data of adenovirus vector-based vaccines Gam-COVID-Vac and AZD1222, or 100% vs. 81% for the pooled data of mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively. Patients who received the Gam-COVID-Vac or mRNA-1273 vaccines had a higher proportion of TNF- producing CD4+ T-cells upon SARS-CoV-2 antigen stimulation compared to the inactivated viral vaccine. CONCLUSION: All five investigated vaccines were immunogenic in the majority of patients and healthy controls with variable antibody and T-cell response and an acceptable safety profile.","output":"Humoral and Cellular Immunogenicity and Safety of Five Different SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines in Patients With Autoimmune Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases in Remission or With Low Disease Activity and in Healthy Controls: A Single Center Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution kills many more people every year than COVID-19 has in its first year but is receiving less attention.

Although most patients present mild or moderate symptoms, up to 5-10% may have a poor disease progression, so there is an urgent need for effective drugs, which can be administered even before the onset of severe symptoms, i.e. when the course of the disease is modifiable. Recently, promising results of several studies on oral ivermectin have been published, which has prompted us to conduct the present review of the scientific literature. METHODS: A narrative review has been carried out, focusing on the following four main topics: a) short-term efficacy in the treatment of the disease, b) long-term efficacy in the treatment of patients with post-acute symptoms of COVID-19, c) efficacy in the prophylaxis of the disease, and c) safety of ivermectin. RESULTS: The reviewed literature suggests that there seems to be sufficient evidence about the safety of oral ivermectin, as well as the efficacy of the drug in the early-treatment and the prophylaxis of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In the view of the available evidence, the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC) recommends the use of oral ivermectin for both prophylaxis and early-treatment of COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between screen time in infancy and the development of autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study analyzed data from mother-child dyads in a large birth cohort in Japan. This study included children born to women recruited between January 2011 and March 2014, and data were analyzed in December 2020. The study was conducted by the Japan Environment and Childrens Study Group in collaboration with 15 regional centers across Japan. EXPOSURES: Screen time at 1 year of age. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcome variable, children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age, was assessed using a questionnaire administered to mothers of the participating children. RESULTS: A total of 84 030 mother-child dyads were analyzed. The prevalence of children with autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age was 392 per 100 000 (0.4%), and boys were 3 times more likely to have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder than were girls. Logistic regression analysis showed that among boys, when no screen was the reference, the adjusted odds ratios were as follows: less than 1 hour, odds ratio, 1.38 (95 % CI, 0.71-2.69; P = .35), 1 hour to less than 2 hours, odds ratio, 2.16 (95 % CI, 1.13-4.14; P = .02), 2 hours to less than 4 hours, odds ratio, 3.48 (95% CI, 1.83-6.65; P < .001), and more than 4 hours, odds ratio, 3.02 (95% CI, 1.44-6.34; P = .04). Among girls, however, there was no association between autism spectrum disorder and screen time. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among boys, longer screen time at 1 year of age was significantly associated with autism spectrum disorder at 3 years of age.

The objective of this study is to determine if a running V-loc suture is of comparable tensile strength to conventional closure. STUDY DESIGN Laboratory based study of human cadaveric tissue. METHODS Fresh human cadaveric tracheas were dissected and incised into segments. Anastomosis of adjacent segments was then performed with either submucosal interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, or a running submucosal 3-0 V-loc suture. Anastomosed specimens were stretched to failure on an Instron force tension machine. Surgeon satisfaction was recorded by visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS The tensile strength of 12 tracheal anastomoses was tested. Video documentation of V-loc suture technique and anastomosis failure was recorded. In both Vicryl (80%) and V-loc (100%) anastomoses, failure occurred at the membranous intercartilaginous region. In 20% of the Vicryl anastomoses, the suture was noted to break prior to tissue failure. Anastomoses with V-loc suture had equivalent failure force (mean, 59 N) compared to interrupted Vicryl (51 N), with P = .57.

Another gap in this literature has been the lack of involvement of the gaming community as stakeholders to identify feasible prevention approaches. This study investigated: (1) regular and problematic gamers level of support for different prevention strategies within primary, secondary, and tertiary approaches; and, (2) whether self-efficacy is associated with greater support for prevention strategies, as predicted by the Health Belief Model. A total of 992 participants completed an online survey that evaluated support for problem gaming prevention strategies and included measures of self-efficacy, gaming involvement, and GD symptoms, psychological distress, and mental health help-seeking behaviors. Participants reported stronger support for primary prevention strategies, including education, screening, and warning labels, than for other prevention approaches. Overall, 61% of participants expressed support for primary prevention as compared to secondary (39%) and tertiary (36%) approaches. There was stronger support for outpatient care (48%) than inpatient services (25%). In-game shutdown features received the lowest support (65% disapproval). Contrary to the Health Belief Model, self-efficacy was not associated with prevention support. Younger, female, and less frequent gamers were more likely to support primary and secondary prevention strategies.

The time dependent Vaidya metric which represents the spacetime of a radiating body like star is studied in an energy dependent gravity's rainbow, which is a UV completion of General Relativity. In our quest we have used gravitational collapse as the main tool. The focus is to probe the nature of singularity (black hole or naked singularity) formed out of the collapsing procedure. This is achieved via a geodesic study. For our investigation we have considered two different models of [Formula: see text] gravity, namely the inflationary Starobinsky's model and the power law model. Our study reveals the fact that naked singularity is as good a possibility as black hole as far as the central singularity is concerned. Via a proper fine tuning of the initial data, we may realize both black hole or naked singularity as the end state of the collapse. Thus this study is extremely important and relevant in the light of the Cosmic Censorship hypothesis. The most important result derived from the study is that gravity's rainbow increases the tendency of formation of naked singularities. We have also deduced the conditions under which the singularity will be a strong or weak curvature singularity. Finally in our quest to know more about the model we have performed a thermodynamical study. Throughout the study we have obtained results which involve deviation from the classical set-up. Such deviations are expected in a quantum evolution and can be attributed to the quantum fluctuations that our model suffers from. It is expected that this study will enhance our knowledge about quantization of gravity and subsequently about the illusive theory of quantum gravity.","output":"A non-static quantum inspired spacetime in f(R) gravity: Gravity's rainbow"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Public health authorities advocate vaccinations for the general population, including cancer patients and survivors. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, its vaccine has been eagerly awaited, but the extent of cancer patients' willingness to get vaccinated is not clear. As health promotion is crucial for these individuals, it is important to measure and analyze their willingness to receive the vaccine. Methods: A few days after the regulatory approval for the first COVID-19 vaccine, the CareAcross online interactive platforms were used to evaluate the willingness of patients to get vaccinated. Through an online survey, within a few hours, 1106 cancer patients selected either 'Yes, I plan to get the vaccine' or 'No, I will not get the vaccine'. The patients were from the UK, Germany, France, Spain or Italy;they had been diagnosed with breast, lung, prostate or colorectal cancer. Their responses were analyzed to determine how their cancer diagnosis (including date, metastatic status, and other aspects), and their country of origin, affected their reported willingness to get vaccinated. Results: Overall, 70.6% of patients indicated willingness to get the vaccine (WTV), and 29.4% reported the opposite (NWTV). The strongest determinant of WTV was the patient's country of origin: patients in the UK, Spain, Italy, Germany and France reported WTV of 84.1%, 64.2%, 58.7%, 47.4% and 38.3%, respectively. The next strongest determinant was the time elapsed since the patient's diagnosis: for the largest population with available diagnosis date (451 UK patients), the average time since diagnosis for patients with WTV vs NWTV was: breast, 3.5 vs 2.5 years;lung, 1.6 vs 1.4 years;prostate, 2.4 vs 3.3 years;colorectal, 1.9 vs 1.5 years. Among patients from other countries with available diagnosis date: as the time since diagnosis increased, among 148 Italian patients WTV gradually increased;among 94 Spanish patients, WTV substantially decreased;among 85 French patients, WTV gradually decreased;among 50 German patients, WTV substantially increased. There was no significant correlation of WTV percentages with cancer type;metastatic status;triple negative vs non-triple negative among breast cancer patients;non-small cell vs small cell among lung cancer patients. Conclusions: Despite longstanding efforts of the scientific community for health promotion through the COVID-19 vaccine, a substantial percentage of cancer patients reported no willingness to get vaccinated. This appeared to depend on each patient's country of origin, and the time elapsed since their diagnosis. This patient input was collected shortly after the first vaccine's approval. With increasing evidence of efficacy and safety through more vaccinations of citizens and patients, willingness is expected to increase. We are in the process of conducting a follow-up survey to track these changes and update the results to be reportable during ASCO.","output":"Multifactorial analysis of cancer patients' willingness for COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical health is a condition of the body Coronavirus outbreak leads to the need for self isolation Quarantine is a way of separating and restricting people exposed to the disease from other healthy individuals Keeping up physical health-improves the way of life and keeps us physically active Proper diet, eliminating unhealthy food, maintaining social distancing and proper hygiene improves immunity and reduces the spread of viruses A well-structured questionnaire containing socio-demographic information, knowledge, attitude and perception was framed and circulated through an online survey link In this prospective study, the advantages are economical, easy to create, gathers large data, wide reach, heterogeneous population and disadvantages maybe response bias and survey fatigue This survey was approved by the Scientific Review Board Saveetha Dental College, Chennai The sample size was 100 volunteers The results were collected and represented in pie charts In the present survey, we found that the majority of participants took good care of their physical health, and were aware about the importance of physical health in reducing the risk of virus Hence, it is important to improve and keep up good physical health during this lockdown in order to not fear the COVID19 occurrence and reduce the risk of virus","output":"Effects of quarantine lockdown on physical healtha survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Jaundice is the quite common benign condition in neonates, but due to its potential toxicity, neonates must be monitored. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of serum albumin level on the transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measurements in term neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. METHODS Serum albumin and total serum bilirubin (TSB) of 252 jaundiced term neonates were estimated and simultaneously TcB was measured over sternum and the effect of serum albumin on TcB measurements was evaluated. RESULTS The correlation between TSB and TcB was linear and significant for the entire cohort. When this correlation was studied separately in the groups with different albumin levels, maximum correlation (r = 0.888, R2 linear = 0.789, p < 0.001) was observed in group 1 with hypo-albuminemia followed by in group 2 with normal albumin levels (r = 0.854, R2 linear = 0.729, p < 0.001) and group 3 with higher albumin levels (r = 0.809, R2 linear = 0.689, p < 0.001).

Adjuvant S-1 has been shown to be non-inferior to uracil and tegafur plus leucovorin in terms of disease-free survival. This study aims to confirm the non-inferiority of S-1 compared with capecitabine as adjuvant treatment in patients with stage III colorectal cancer. METHODS This study was an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised, phase 3, multicentre trial done in 56 Japanese centres to assess the non-inferiority of S-1 to capecitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy. Eligible patients were aged 20-80 years with stage III colorectal adenocarcinoma, as defined by the presence of an inferior margin of the primary tumour above the peritoneal reflection; R0 resection; and colectomy with D3 or D2 lymph node dissection. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive eight courses of capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 orally twice daily, days 1-14, every 21 days) or four courses of S-1 (40 mg/m2 orally twice daily, days 1-28, every 42 days). Randomisation was done via phone call, fax, or web-based systems to the Japan Clinical Oncology Group Data Center and used a minimisation method with a random component adjusted by institution, tumour location (colon vs rectosigmoid and upper rectum), number of positive lymph node metastases (3 vs 4), and surgical technique (conventional vs non-touch isolation). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival with a non-inferiority margin for the hazard ratio (HR) set at 124, analysed by intention to treat. This trial was registered with UMIN Clinical Trial Registry, number UMIN000003272. FINDINGS Between March 1, 2010, and Aug 23, 2013, 1564 patients were randomly assigned to capecitabine (n=782) or S-1 (n=782), all of whom were included in the efficacy analysis; 777 patients in the capecitabine group and 768 in the S-1 group were included in the safety analysis. At the prespecified second interim analysis after final accrual, 258 (48%) of 535 required events were reported, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended early publication because S-1 could not show non-inferiority compared with capecitabine for disease-free survival. With a median follow-up of 237 months (IQR 141-352), 3-year disease-free survival was 820% (95% CI 785-850) for the capecitabine group and 779% (741-811) for the S-1 group (HR 123, 9905% CI 089-170; one-sided pnon-inferiority=046). The most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events in the capecitabine group were hand-foot skin reactions (123 [16%] of 777 patients), and in the S-1 group were diarrhoea (64 [8%] of 768 patients) and neutropenia (61 [8%]). There was one (<1%) treatment-related death in each group.

To facilitate efforts to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology and to target the virus therapeutically, it is essential to have a roadmap of likely functional regions embedded in its RNA genome. In this report, we used a bioinformatics approach, ScanFold, to deduce the local RNA structural landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with the highest likelihood of being functional. We recapitulate previously-known elements of RNA structure and provide a model for the folding of an essential frameshift signal. Our results find that SARS-CoV-2 is greatly enriched in unusually stable and likely evolutionarily ordered RNA structure, which provides a large reservoir of potential drug targets for RNA-binding small molecules. Results are enhanced via the re-analyses of publicly-available genome-wide biochemical structure probing datasets that are broadly in agreement with our models. Additionally, ScanFold was updated to incorporate experimental data as constraints in the analysis to facilitate comparisons between ScanFold and other RNA modelling approaches. Ultimately, ScanFold was able to identify eight highly structured/conserved motifs in SARS-CoV-2 that agree with experimental data, without explicitly using these data. All results are made available via a public database (the RNAStructuromeDB: https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2) and model comparisons are readily viewable at https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2-global-model-comparisons.","output":"A map of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA structurome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many reports on coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have highlighted age- and sex-related differences in health outcomes.

The Ochsner Health population is 31% black non-Hispanic and 65% white non-Hispanic. The primary outcomes were hospitalization and in-hospital death. RESULTS: A total of 3626 patients tested positive, of whom 145 were excluded (84 had missing data on race or ethnic group, 9 were Hispanic, and 52 were Asian or of another race or ethnic group). Of the 3481 Covid-19Cpositive patients included in our analyses, 60.0% were female, 70.4% were black non-Hispanic, and 29.6% were white non-Hispanic. Black patients had higher prevalences of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease than white patients. A total of 39.7% of Covid-19Cpositive patients (1382 patients) were hospitalized, 76.9% of whom were black. In multivariable analyses, black race, increasing age, a higher score on the Charlson Comorbidity Index (indicating a greater burden of illness), public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid), residence in a low-income area, and obesity were associated with increased odds of hospital admission. Among the 326 patients who died from Covid-19, 70.6% were black. In adjusted time-to-event analyses, variables that were associated with higher in-hospital mortality were increasing age and presentation with an elevated respiratory rate; elevated levels of venous lactate, creatinine, or procalcitonin; or low platelet or lymphocyte counts. However, black race was not independently associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio for death vs. white race, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.17). CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort in Louisiana, 76.9% of the patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and 70.6% of those who died were black, whereas blacks comprise only 31% of the Ochsner Health population. Black race was not associated with higher in-hospital mortality than white race, after adjustment for differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on admission.","output":"Hospitalization and Mortality among Black Patients and White Patients with Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International markets and digital technologies are considered among the factors affecting business innovation.

Methods In this double-center retrospective study, we reviewed CT scans from patients who underwent RFA for primary or secondary lung tumors. Patients with partial ablation or tumor recurrence during the imaging follow-up were not included. The imaging features were assessed in pre-defined time points: immediate post-procedure, 4 weeks, 5-24 weeks, 25-52 weeks and 52 weeks. Late follow-up (3 and 5 years after procedure) was assessed clinically in 48 patients. Results The study population consisted of 69 patients and 144 pulmonary tumors. Six out of 69 (9%) patients had primary lung nodules (stage I) and 63/69 (91 %) had metastatic pulmonary nodules. In a patient-level analysis, immediately after lung RFA, the most common CT features were ground glass opacities (66/69, 96 %), consolidation (56/69, 81 %), and hyperdensity within the nodule (47/69, 68 %).

The pandemic poses both challenges and opportunities for sustainable future transport, not least public transport provision, supply and use. The purpose of this study is to investigate how changes for society have translated into changes for mobility as an element of everyday life during the early stages of a pandemic.

Living labs are collaborative knowledge sharing systems that use multimethod, user-centred approaches that hold potential to catalyse these aims. However, their use in healthcare is limited, and no living lab has been developed in paediatric rehabilitation. In response to this gap and to propel innovative knowledge exchange, we propose a mixed methods study to co-develop a living lab prototype (ie, preliminary infrastructure with opportunity for scale up) in paediatric rehabilitation, with relevance to other healthcare contexts. METHODS: An exploratory sequential mixed methods study will be undertaken to determine research and knowledge exchange priorities and to inform the development of the living lab prototype. Stage 1: we will use a multipronged approach to sample 18C21 youth with developmental differences or rehabilitation needs, their youth siblings and parents/guardians from a provincial paediatric rehabilitation centre, to participate in qualitative and arts-based data collection. Data will provide insight into desirable features of the living lab. Stage 2: E-surveys to youth, siblings, parents/guardians and clinicians who receive or provide services at this same centre will expand on priorities and living lab features. Stage 3: integrated analysis will inform the living lab prototype development. ANALYSIS: Inductive thematic analysis using interpretive description, integrated analysis of visual data and descriptive and content analysis of e-survey data will be undertaken. Joint displays will facilitate data integration. Priorities will be identified using a modified rank-order method for each key living lab domain.

Intensive monitoring included complete source data verification of all critical datapoints whereas limited monitoring included automated data checks only. This study's endpoints included clinical trial outcome ascertainment as well as monitoring action items, protocol deviations, and adverse event ascertainment. RESULTS A total of 2708 patients underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and were randomized to either intensive monitoring (n=1354) or limited monitoring (n=1354). Monitoring action items were more common with intensive monitoring (52% vs 15%; p<0.001), but there was no difference in the percentage of patients with any protocol deviation (91.6% vs 90.4%; p=0.314).

Unfortunately, there is no chemotherapeutic agent in the regimen of antiviral drugs or no vaccine available to curb this infectious disease. As a consequence, this deadly infection has prevailed all over the world. The antiviral drugs used for viral diseases excluding COVID-19 infection are Ramdesvir, Favipiravir, and Ribavarin, and antimalarial agents (Chloroquine & Hydroxychloroquine) are being administered to the patients for redemption of this infection. Fortunately, these existing drugs have been found clinically active and are being used. In this review, we present the current scenario and status of epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, vaccine development for COVID-19, and its impact on the socio-economic structure.","output":"Covid-19: current knowledge, disease potential, prevention and clinical advances"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Safety monitoring is of paramount importance for vaccines authorized for emergent use (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) against SARS-CoV-2.

METHODOLOGY Our study included age and sex-based analysis of epidemiological data of infected and deceased patients from various countries. The patient data was graphically depicted with the slope's calculation to describe a gradual or steep spread of the disease along with subsequent rise or fall in the death reports. RESULTS Population groups of 20-49 years of age and 50 years-above were highly vulnerable to infection. Interestingly, 20-49 years of age group was most affected in India. However, higher population of the deceased were reported in the 50 years-above in all countries. India and South Korea demonstrated a gradual appearance of COVID-19 positive cases than other countries illustrated by reduced slope %. Further the highest percentage of infected people and deaths were reported from the densely populated states of India. We observed a sex independent prevalence of COVID-19. The BCG and JE vaccine are unique in the vaccination regime of India and South Korea. CONCLUSIONS Reduced ACE-2 expression in the children's nasal epithelium may be responsible for reduced SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Countries showed varying patterns in COVID-19 spread and associated mortality. It may be influenced by factors, such as screening strategy, countries demography, implementation of lockdown, etc. Due to limited evidence, it would be difficult to point to the influence of the virus on either sexes.

Social isolation imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic considerably reduces the possibility of conducting public consultations. This study hypothesized that such consultations can be carried out using new visualisation technologies in the virtual reality (VR) area. Owing to the development of new technologies, innovative services can be created which make it easier for recipients to absorb new content. To this end, the ArchitektVR application was developed, which uses enhanced reality for public consultations concerning planned land development. 3D visualisation with VR enables the presentation of various aspects of area development in a clear form, understandable to an average user with no specialist qualifications. It facilitates the presentation and creation of multiple variants/scenarios for the future shape of the area. The research assumptions were tested for a disused area of a water body. According to preliminary tests, the use of virtual reality could provide a new form of communication between decision-makers and citizens. Effective and easy-to-understand visualisations might provide encouragement to participate in local matters and enable citizens to make better decisions. 3D visualisation enabled concerned individuals to assess the potential development of a selected area fragment without an in-person visit, either in the field or to an office.

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to every country on the planet and has wreaked havoc on them by increasing the number of human deaths, caused intense hunger, and lowered economic productivity. Also due to a lack of sufficient radiologist, restricted amount of COVID-19 test kits available in hospitals, and a shortage of equipment due to the daily increase in cases, the number of persons infected with COVID-19 has increased. Even for experienced radiologists, examining chest X-rays is a difficult task. Many people have died as a result of inaccurate COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, as well as ineffective detection measures. This paper therefore presents a unique detection and classification approach (DCCNet) for quick diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images of patients. To achieve quick diagnosis, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) method is proposed in this paper to help medical experts diagnose COVID-19 disease. The diagnostic performance of the hybrid CNN model and HOG-based method was then evaluated using chest X-ray images collected from University of Gondar and online databases. This was achieved using Keras (with TensorFlow as a backend) and Python. After the DCCNet model was evaluated, a 99.9% training accuracy and 98.3% test accuracy was achieved, while a 100% training accuracy and 98.5% test accuracy was achieved using HOG. After evaluation, the hybrid model achieved 99.97% and 99.67% training and testing accuracy for detection and classification of COVID-19 which was better by 1.37% than when feature extraction was performed using CNN and 1.17% when HOG was used.

In the absence of epidemiological data on the reservoir species, patterns of zoonotic transmission have largely been approximated from primary human cases. This study aimed to identify meteorological factors that may increase the risk of primary MERS infections in humans. METHODS: A case-crossover design was used to identify associations between primary MERS cases and preceding weather conditions within the 2-week incubation period in Saudi Arabia using univariable conditional logistic regression. Cases with symptom onset between January 2015 C December 2017 were obtained from a publicly available line list of human MERS cases maintained by the World Health Organization. The complete case dataset (N = 1191) was reduced to approximate the cases most likely to represent spillover transmission from camels (N = 446). Data from meteorological stations closest to the largest city in each province were used to calculate the daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature (()C), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), and visibility (m). Weather variables were categorized according to strata; temperature and humidity into tertiles, and visibility and wind speed into halves. RESULTS: Lowest temperature (Odds Ratio = 1.27; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.04C1.56) and humidity (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.10C1.65) were associated with increased cases 8C10 days later. High visibility was associated with an increased number of cases 7 days later (OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.01C1.57), while wind speed also showed statistically significant associations with cases 5C6 days later. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that primary MERS human cases in Saudi Arabia are more likely to occur when conditions are relatively cold and dry. This is similar to seasonal patterns that have been described for other respiratory diseases in temperate climates. It was hypothesized that low visibility would be positively associated with primary cases of MERS, however the opposite relationship was seen. This may reflect behavioural changes in different weather conditions.

To apply PM premises in an emerging coronavirus pandemic acquires potentially greater relevance in order to allow the selection of specific preventive measures as well as biomarkers that will be useful in disease management. RECENT FINDINGS: The identification of the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had led to a plethora of strategies to contain viral dissemination, affecting life styles and personal behaviors. Viral genomic sequencing has shown that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) found on ciliated epithelial cells of the human lungs as its specific receptor. Neutralizing antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were detected in patients recovered from COVID-19; however, both T cells and NK cells were reduced in severe cases. Excessive and uncontrolled releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyteCmacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were increased in severe patients. These cytokines might be useful biomarkers of disease worsening and potential targets for new biological therapies currently under investigation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of cyanoacrylates glue for polypropylene-polyvinylidene fluoride (PP-PVDF) intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) fixation in a rabbit model. MATERIALS AND METHODS In 40 New Zealand white rabbits, three pieces (33cm) of a PP-PVDF mesh (n=120) were fixed in IPOM technique on both sides of a midline laparotomy. For mesh fixation we used spiral tacks, nonabsorbable sutures, or cyanoacrylate glue in a randomized manner. All animals were killed after 12 wk. The prosthetic materials were excised en bloc with the anterior abdominal wall for evaluation of the tensile strength and histologic analysis. Results are presented as mean and standard deviation. RESULTS Meshes fixed with glue showed a significantly higher tenacity of adhesions (2.750.97) compared with those with tacks (2.440.97 sutures versus 1.910.92 tacks). The percentage of adhesions in the glue group was comparable to the suture group (36.50%  27.60% glue, 37.62%  27.36% suture). The tensile strength of stapled and sutured meshes was significantly higher than the tensile strength glued mesh (14.150.97N suture versus 14.840.74 stapler versus 9.640.78N glue).

Hence, the closed and open tautomer forms should all be considered as the same compound.","output":"Characterization and demonstration of drug compound ring-chain tautomer formation and its impacts on quality control."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aimed to investigate the cardioprotective role of berberine in sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and consider the underlying mechanisms. C57BL/6J mice were randomized into four groups, namely, Control, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS + berberine and LPS + N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) + berberine. A single dose (10 mg/kg body weight) of LPS was intraperitoneally administered to mice to induce cardiac dysfunction, whereas the Control group was administered with an equivalent volume of saline. In the LPS + berberine and LPS + L-NAME + berberine group, berberine (10 mg/kg body weight) dissolved in hot water was intraperitoneally administered 30 min after the LPS treatment. In the LPS + L-NAME + berberine group, L-NAME (100 mg/kg body weight) dissolved in saline was intraperitoneally administered 30 min before the LPS treatment. Then, ~6 h after the LPS treatment, a significant decrease was observed in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS). Meanwhile, the plasma myocardial injury markers, inflammatory factors and oxidative stress levels were significantly increased in the LPS group compared with the Control group. The administration of berberine improved the ventricular function and decreased the plasma myocardial injury markers, inflammatory factors and oxidative stress levels. In addition, it increased the heart total nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and upregulated the protein expressions of p-Akt and phosphorylated endothelial (e)NOS, which indicated that the Akt/eNOS pathway was activated by berberine. However, the cardioprotective effects of berberine were counteracted by L-NAME, an NOS inhibitor, which inhibited the eNOS activity. In conclusion, berberine attenuated sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction by upregulating the Akt/eNOS pathway in mice.","output":"Berberine attenuates sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction by upregulating the Akt/eNOS pathway in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019. Some authors reported evidences that patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection could have a direct involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, and in symptomatic cases, gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain) could be very common. Area covered: In this article, we reviewed current published data of the gastrointestinal aspects involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection, including prevalence and incidence of specific symptoms, presumptive biological mechanism of GI infection, prognosis, clinical management and public health related concerns on the possible risk of oral-fecal transmission. Expert opinion: Different clues point to a direct virus infection and replication in mucosal cells of the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 could enters into the gastrointestinal epithelial cells by the Angiotensin-Converting enzyme 2 membrane receptor. These findings, coupled with identification of viral RNA found in stools of patients, clearly suggest that a direct involvement of gastrointestinal tract is very likely. This can justify most of the gastrointestinal symptoms but also suggest a risk for an oral fecal route for transmission, additionally or alternatively to the main respiratory route.","output":"Gastrointestinal Coronavirus disease 2019: epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenesis, prevention and management."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Herein, we present a case of apixaban elimination prolonged by 450% in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 due to multiple conditions, including drug-drug interaction, severe inflammation, and acute kidney injury.

Moreover, in preclinical experiments, xenon has been demonstrated to possess cardio- and neuroprotective properties. Altogether, the favorable hemodynamic profile combined with its potential for organ-protection could render xenon an attractive option for anesthesia in children with cardiovascular compromise. AIMS The aim of this study was to explore safety and feasibility of sevoflurane-augmented xenon anesthesia in school-aged children and to assess early postoperative neurocognitive effects of xenon-sevoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia when compared to a control group that did not have anesthesia. METHODS Forty children aged 4-12 years, suffering from congenital heart disease, undergoing diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization were randomized to either xenon-augmented sevoflurane anesthesia or sevoflurane alone. Safety was assessed by the incidence of intraprocedural hemodynamic instability and feasibility by anesthetic depth and respiratory profile. In addition, neurocognitive performance was assessed preoperatively, 2 hours after discharge from PACU and at 24 hours after anesthesia using the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks system. A healthy control group of 22 age- and gender-matched children not exposed to anesthesia underwent an identical neurocognitive test battery, at comparable time intervals. RESULTS Overall hemodynamics did not differ between groups. Xenon-sevoflurane anesthesia resulted in decreased intraoperative ephedrine requirements (median [IQR]) (0.00 mg/kg [0.00-0.00] vs 0.00 mg/kg [0.00-0.01], P = 0.047). Only neurocognitive tests in the domain of alertness were significantly impaired 2 hours postoperatively in both anesthesia groups in comparison with the control group (alertness variability: P = 0.02, odds ratio 5.8), but recovered at 24 hours. For working memory, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and motor coordination tasks, no significant interaction effects of anesthesia were found in the early postoperative period. CONCLUSION In this pilot trial, xenon-augmented sevoflurane anesthesia in school-aged children was feasible, and associated with decreased ephedrine requirements. All children exposed to anesthesia showed impaired neurocognitive performance in the immediate postoperative period when compared to control children; however, without significant differences between both treatment groups.","output":"The effect of xenon-augmented sevoflurane anesthesia on intraoperative hemodynamics and early postoperative neurocognitive function in children undergoing cardiac catheterization: A randomized controlled pilot trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As of June 2, 2020, 67,113 cases and 321 deaths due to Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) have been reported in healthcare personnel (HCP) in the United States Given the close contact of HCP with individuals with COVID-19, it is important to quantify the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in the healthcare setting Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of HCP exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at our academic medical center from March 15, 2020 to May 16, 2020 Exposure during the study period was defined as having contact with patients or other HCP with COVID-19 within 6 feet of distance for at least 90 seconds when HCP's eyes, nose, or mouth were not covered HCP with exposures were monitored for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 for 14 days from last exposure and those who developed symptoms were tested for SARSCoV- 2 using RT-PCR Results: We identified 33 exposure events;19 of which were patient-to-HCP exposures and 14 of which were HCP-to-HCP exposures These 33 events resulted in 959 exposed HCP among whom 238 (25%) developed one or more symptoms of COVID-19 and required SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing Testing was performed at 7 1  5 0 (mean  SD) days from exposure Of the 238 HCP who were tested, 82% were female and 49% were registered nurses (Table 1) Five HCP tested positive for SARSCoV- 2 by RT-PCR, but one was presumed to have acquired the disease from a household member with confirmed COVID-19 Among the four HCP who were infected due to occupational exposure, three were nurses while one was an environmental service worker (Table 1) Conclusion: Despite exposures among HCP, the risk of acquiring symptomatic COVID-19 in the healthcare setting was low with less than 1% of HCP with occupational exposure subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 With the definition of exposure now changed to at least 15 minutes of close contact without personal protective equipment, we anticipate fewer exposures at our healthcare facility and that much of COVID-19 transmission affecting HCP are due to community exposures","output":"Infection with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in healthcare personnel with exposure to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD) are a heterogeneous group of diseases with a common aetiopathogenic basis affecting all ages characterised by a systemic phenotypic expression with a wide range of severity and outcomes that often require immunosuppressive therapies, leaving patients at high risk of infection. Knowledge of the impact of COVID-19 in patients with SAD is limited because most are included in studies carried out in patients with autoimmune and rheumatic diseases (mainly inflammatory arthritis). Most studies supported an increased risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection in patients with AD and SAD. Although case-control studies reported no significant differences in the rate of poor outcomes between patients with and without AD, large population-based studies analysing baseline risk factors reported a 2-3 times higher rate of poor outcomes in patients with AD, especially in those with SAD. Individual risk factors associated with poor outcomes included gender male, older age, and underlying comorbidities and therapies (glucocorticoids, sulfasalazine, immunosuppressants and rituximab). Patients with SAD had less favourable COVID-19 outcomes than those with inflammatory arthritis, possibly due to a differentiated underlying therapeutic approach (glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants and B-cell depleting agents for most SAD, anti-cytokine therapies and JAK inhibitors for inflammatory arthritis). Despite the limited evidence, most studies suggest that patients with SAD have an increased risk of a worse evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including a greater risk of hospitalisation/ICU admission and worse survival rates and, therefore, should be considered a high-risk group for COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic epicentre has moved to the USA and Europe, where it is placing unprecedented demands on healthcare resources and staff availability.

Over 106 million COVID-19 cases including 2.3 million deaths have been reported to the WHO as of February 9, 2021. This review examines the epidemiology, transmission, clinical features, and phylogenetics of three lethal zoonotic coronavirus infections of humans: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV). RECENT FINDINGS: Bats appear to be the common natural source of SARS-like CoV including SARS-CoV-1 but their role in SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV remains unclear. Civet cats and dromedary camels are the intermediary animal sources for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infection, respectively whereas that of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads peak early on days 2-4 of symptom onset and thus high transmission occurs in the community, and asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission occurs commonly. Nosocomial outbreaks are hallmarks of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections whereas these are less common in COVID-19. Several COVID-19 vaccines are now available. SUMMARY: Of the three lethal zoonotic coronavirus infections of humans, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a devastating global pandemic with over a million deaths. The emergence of genetic variants, such as D614G, N501Y (variants 1 and 2), has led to an increase in transmissibility and raises concern about the possibility of re-infection and impaired vaccine response. Continued global surveillance is essential for both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, to monitor changing epidemiology due to viral variants.","output":"Lethal zoonotic coronavirus infections of humans - comparative phylogenetics, epidemiology, transmission, and clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019, The Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first cases of COVID19 in the Maldives was reported on 7th March 2020 with a total of 13 cases by 27th March from number of resort islands and were confined to the islands in which the cases were detected.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed perfusion lung scans results between April to December, 2020. The images were interpreted by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians as daily routine studies. Ventilation images were performed only if deemed necessary for accurate diagnosis of acute PE. RESULTS A total of 128 lung perfusion scans in 127 patients were included. The scans were interpreted with certainty using the modified PIOPID criteria in 122 patients (95.3%). The results included low probability for acute PE in 110 patients (85.9%), normal in 6 patients (4.7%) and high probability of acute PE in 6 patients (4.7%). Ventilation imaging were performed in 4 patients with high probability, after negative testing for COVID19. The other 2 high probability results were confirmed clinically and with radiologic imaging. Only 6 scans (4.7%) were interpreted as intermediate perfusion scans, two of which due to inability to differentiate old from new perfusion defects in patients with chronic thromboembolic disease. Thus, the true indeterminate results due to the lack of ventilation scan were encountered in only 4 intermediate probability lung scans (3.1%). Thus, the total number of requested ventilation scans was 8 scans (6.2%) when considering both the high and intermediate probability interpretations. Six scans were performed (2 in the intermediate and 4 in the high probability scans). The two ventilation scans performed in the intermediate probability changed the diagnosis to low probability and the four performed in the high probability confirmed the initial interpretation of high probability scans by perfusion only. CONCLUSION The ventilation part of lung scans is required only in a small number of patients for certain interpretation of the result.

Limited data exists regarding the involvement of cardiovascular system in COVID-19 patients. We sought to evaluate the cardiovascular (CV) complications and its impact on outcomes in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a single center observational study among symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Data regarding clinical profile, laboratory investigations, CV complications, treatment and outcomes were collected. Cardiac biomarkers and 12 lead electrocardiograms were done in all while echocardiography was done in those with clinical indications for the same. Corrected QT-interval (QTc) at baseline and maximum value during hospitalization were computed. RESULTS: Of the 108 patients, majority of them were males with a mean age of 51.2  17.7 years. Hypertension (38%) and diabetes (32.4%) were most prevalent co-morbidities. ECG findings included sinus tachycardia in 18 (16.9%), first degree AV block in 5 (4.6%), VT/VF in 2 (1.8%) and sinus bradycardia in one (0.9%). QTc prolongation was observed in 17.6% subjects. CV complications included acute cardiac injury in 25.9%, heart failure, cardiogenic shock and acute coronary syndrome in 3.7% each, probable myocarditis in 2.8% patients.

An institution-based retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out using medical records of COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Boru Meda Hospital with a positive reverse transcription (RT)-PCR result from May 9, 2020 to September 20, 2020. All patients with a positive RT-PCR were admitted to the hospital, regardless of symptom and severity status. A total of 279 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analysis. The median age of patients was 28 years (interquartile range 23C40). The majority (69.5%) were male. Around a quarter (n = 73; 26.2%) of the patients were symptomatic, of which cough (n = 49; 67.1%) and fever (n = 32; 43.8%) were common symptoms. Among symptomatic patients, 48 (65.8%) were mild, four (5.5%) moderate, 12 (16.4%) severe, and nine (12.3%) were critical. The case fatality rate was 2.1%. Hypertension, age older than 25 years, and HIV/AIDS were significantly associated with symptomatic infection. In this study, most of the COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic. However, the proportion of severe and critical patients among those with symptoms was high. More studies are needed to assess the effect of HIV/AIDS on the severity and mortality of COVID-19.","output":"Clinical Profile and Treatment of COVID-19 Patients: Experiences from an Ethiopian Treatment Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Predicting product sales of large retail companies is a challenging task considering volatile nature of trends, seasonalities, events as well as unknown factors such as market competitions, change in customer's preferences, or unforeseen events, e.g., COVID-19 outbreak.

For example, in patients with radicular pain associated with intervertebral disc herniation or lumbar spinal stenosis, epidural steroid injections (ESI) are commonly used and often improve pain and function while avoiding more invasive surgical approaches. Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has allowed remote evaluations to mitigate COVID-19 transmission using telemedicine. In this article, we review our experience in using telemedicine for interventional pain care and current literature, providing a framework for current practice and future study. During restrictive periods of COVID-19 mitigation, patients were referred for ESI, evaluated by telemedicine, and then seen in-person for a physical exam and possible ESI. After a chart review of these patients, we found that telemedicine evaluation was successfully used to support decision making about the ESI. The majority of patients referred received an ESI. During the interval between telemedicine evaluation and ESI, there was no evidence of progression of disease or neurologic deterioration. There were no emergency room visits due to pain complaints. In our literature review, similar case series supported the use of telemedicine in planning and supporting procedural care in several clinical specialties, including interventional pain management. Future research in larger cohorts will help rigorously evaluate safety and query satisfaction for both patients and providers. In conclusion, we suggest that using telemedicine to support procedural care requires more research but shows promise in increasing access to interventional pain care. The use of telemedicine has recently seen a sharp increase in frequency due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. According to the World Health Organization, telemedicine represents \\"healing at a distance\\"1 . They define telemedicine as \\"the delivery of healthcare services by health care professionals using information and communication technologies for the exchange of valid information for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease and injuries.\\" Telemedicine has become an important and effective option for providing patient care. However, the use of telemedicine in the context of procedural therapies for pain management is new and rapidly evolving.

In this paper, we report our experience in using the Abstract State Machine formal method and the ASMETA framework in developing a prototype of the control software of the MVM (Mechanical Ventilator Milano), a mechanical lung ventilator that has been designed, successfully certified, and deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to time constraints and lack of skills, no formal method was applied for the MVM project. However, we here want to assess the feasibility of developing (part of) the ventilator by using a formal method-based approach. Our development process starts from a high-level formal specification of the system to describe the MVM main operation modes. Then, through a sequence of refined models, all the other requirements are captured, up to a level in which a C++ implementation of a prototype of the MVM controller is automatically generated from the model, and tested. Along the process, at each refinement level, different model validation and verification activities are performed, and each refined model is proved to be a correct refinement of the previous level.

The present research aimed to develop and evaluate a digital intervention for problematic smartphone use in a student population. A mixed-method case series design was used. The participants were 10 students with mildCmoderate dependency on the online world (measured via a self-report questionnaire). An intervention comprising goal setting, personalised feedback, mindfulness, and behavioural suggestions was delivered via a smartphone application. Time spent on smartphones was measured objectively through the same application. Changes in problematic technology use, wellbeing, mindfulness, and sleep were also evaluated. The findings indicate that the intervention resulted in a reduction in self-reported problematic smartphone use, but not screen time. The findings also indicate that over the course of participation, there was a positive influence on wellbeing, online dependency, mindfulness, and sleep.

The quality of the identified existing reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR tool. The risk of bias in RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and overall quality of the individual outcomes was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) method. RESULTS The literature search provided four systematic reviews, from which one yielded a sufficient AMSTAR evaluation and subsequently provided three RCTs relevant for inclusion. Due to the lack of sufficient reporting of the data, quantitative synthesis was not applicable. In the qualitative synthesis for the primary outcome, the results from the RCTs showed that there was a slight indication of steroid treatment reducing the frequency of vertiginous attacks. No serious adverse events were reported. Based on the GRADE approach the quality for both findings is very low. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes.

The changes are characteristic for the adaptive integrated stress response (ISR), which is known to be triggered by unfolded proteins, nutrient and metabolic deficiency, and mitochondrial dysfunctions. However, after a prolonged incubation with myxothiazol (13C17 h), levels of ATF4 mRNA and ATF4-regulated transcripts were found substantially suppressed. The suppression was dependent on the p53 response, which is triggered by the impairment of the complex III-dependent de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines by mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The initial adaptive induction of ATF4/ISR acted to promote viability of cells by attenuating apoptosis. In contrast, the induction of p53 upon a sustained inhibition of ETC complex III produced a pro-apoptotic effect, which was additionally stimulated by the p53-mediated abrogation of the pro-survival activities of the ISR. Interestingly, a sustained inhibition of ETC complex I by piericidine did not induce the p53 response and stably maintained the pro-survival activation of ATF4/ISR. We conclude that a downregulation of mitochondrial ETC generally induces adaptive pro-survival responses, which are specifically abrogated by the suicidal p53 response triggered by the genetic risks of the pyrimidine nucleotide deficiency.","output":"A sustained deficiency of mitochondrial respiratory complex III induces an apoptotic cell death through the p53-mediated inhibition of pro-survival activities of the activating transcription factor 4"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Patients with umbilical hernias complicated by liver cirrhosis have an increased likelihood of complications following herniorrhaphy. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes in patients with umbilical hernias complicated by liver cirrhosis. METHODS Between 2001 and 2010, 44 patients were enrolled in this study. The comparison between non-operative and operative group was performed. Patients who underwent emergency versus elective surgery were also compared. RESULTS Of the 44 patients, there were 33 men and 11 women. Thirty-one patients (70.5%) underwent surgery and 13 patients (29.5%) were treated conservatively. Overall morbidity and mortality rates following herniorrhaphy were 42% and 6.5%. The mean albumin level was significantly lower and total bilirubin, creatinine and mean model of end-stage liver disease score were significantly higher in non-operative group than in operative group. Combined resection was performed more frequently in the emergency group than in elective group. A significantly higher proportion of patients in emergency operation group had postoperative complications (P=0.01), especially ascites (P=0.02). The operative time and postoperative hospital stay were significantly shorter in the elective operation group than in emergency operation group. CONCLUSIONS Early, elective repair of umbilical hernias in cirrhotic patients should be advocated considering the hepatic reserve and patient's condition.

Regular exposure to such stressful news may elicit different emotions in people and engage them in using strategies to control their emotions. In the present study, we aimed at exploring the most common negative emotion(s) experienced by individuals, as well as the most frequent Emotion Regulation (ER) strategies used facing the COVID-19-related news. We also examined whether the variable of personal relevance can moderate these emotional responses. Methods: 617 individuals living in Tehran who regularly read the news about the COVID-19 from the early stages of spread completed an online survey. After excluding the participants with high scores from the Beck Depression Inventory (&gt;18), data obtained from 443 participants were analyzed in terms of the experienced negative emotions and ER strategies. Results: Anxiety (55.8%) was the most common negative emotion reported by participants facing COVID-19-related news and problem-solving was the most frequent strategy used to control negative emotions. Both groups with high and low personal relevance indicated a similar pattern in experiencing high and low arousal emotions, as well as using ER strategies, and no significant differences were found (X 2=0.006, p=0.51; X 2=0.14, p=0.39, respectively). We also found that participants with high scores in the resilience scale used an integrative rather than a single approach of the ER strategies (rbp=0.15, p=0.01). Conclusion: We found that during the COVID-19 outbreak, news media may have important role in triggering anxiety in people who regularly read the relevant news, and problem-solving was the most frequent strategy among them. Being directly involved with COVID-19 in personal life did not make any differences in the way that individuals emotionally respond to the news.

Despite the need to evaluate both the psychological distress and positive protective resources, brief and reliable assessment tools are lacking. Aim: Study 1 aimed at developing a new assessment tool to measure psychological distress and esteem in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study 2 aimed to explore and compare the psychological reactions of healthcare workers of the COVID-19 and the non-COVID-19 wards. Methods: In Study 1, psychologists created 25 items based on their clinical experience. A preliminary qualitative evaluation selected the best 15 items for the new tool (CPI-HP) assessing the COVID-19 psychological impact with 2 scales: psychological distress and esteem. The CPI-HP was administered to 110 healthcare professionals to study its psychometric properties and the internal structure with exploratory graph analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Study 2 compared two groups of healthcare professionals of the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 departments. Results: In Study 1, the CPI-HP showed satisfying psychometric properties, and the two-factor structure was confirmed with good fit indices. In Study 2, the two groups of healthcare workers showed comparable levels of psychological distress and resilient coping, but the COVID-19 group displayed significantly higher esteem and appreciation of the experience. Discussion: All operators showed high psychological distress during the emergency, but the COVID-19 group reported higher resources, probably due to stronger group cohesion and greater esteem, perceived meaning, and own work value. Conclusion: Assessing the psychological distress and resources of healthcare professionals with specific tools is important. Psychological interventions should promote their psychological health.","output":"Psychological Differences Among Healthcare Workers of a Rehabilitation Institute During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Two-Step Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present with a variety of symptoms. Severity of the disease may be associated with several factors. Here, we review clinical features of COVID-19 inpatients with different severities. This cross-sectional study was performed in Imam Reza hospital, Mashhad, Iran, during February-April 2020. COVID-19 patients with typical computed tomography (CT) patterns and/or positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were included. The patients were classified into three groups of moderate, severe, and critical based on disease severity. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings were collected and compared. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Overall, 200 patients with mean age of 69.75  6.39 years, of whom 82 (41%) were female were studied. Disease was severe/critical in the majority of patients (167, 83.5%). Disease severity was significantly associated with age, malignant comorbidities, dyspnea, nausea/vomiting, confusion, respiratory rate, pulse rate, O2 saturation, extent of CT involvement, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), pH, pO2, and aspartate transaminase (P < 0.05). Moreover, complications including shock, coagulopathy, acidosis, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and intubation were significantly higher in patients with higher severities (P < 0.05). O2 saturation, nausea/vomiting, and extent of lung CT involvement were independent predictors of severe/critical COVID-19 (OR 0.342, 45.93, and 25.48, respectively; P < 0.05). Our results indicate O2 saturation, nausea/vomiting, and extent of lung CT involvement as independent predictors of severe COVID-19 conditions.

However, the question what works in water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH)? remains poorly understood. Evaluations of community interventions to prevent infectious disease typically use lab-confirmed infection as a primary outcome; however, WASH trials mostly use reported diarrhoea. While diarrhoea is a significant source of morbidity, it is subjected to significant misclassification error with respect to enteric infection due to the existence of non-infectious diarrhoea and asymptomatic infection. We show how this may lead to bias of estimated effects of interventions from WASH trials towards no effect. The problem is further compounded by other biases in the measurement process. Alongside testing for infection of the gut, an examination of the causal assumptions underlying WASH interventions present several other reliable alternative and complementary measurements and outcomes. Contemporary guidance on the evaluation of complex interventions requires researchers to take a broad view of the causal effects of an intervention across a system. Reported diarrhoea can fail to even be a reliable measure of changes to gastrointestinal health and so should not be used as a primary outcome if we are to progress our knowledge of what works in WASH.","output":"Evaluations of water, sanitation and hygiene interventions should not use diarrhoea as (primary) outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 is a novel single stranded RNA virus that has gripped humanity all over.

Considerations relating to food security, prospects of and challenges before plant breeding in the Siberian Federal District (SFD), the largest agricultural area of the Russian Federation, are provided in the article. The agricultural area used in the SFD is about 50 million hectares and accounts for 13 % of the countrys gross grain production. The need for the introduction of modern molecular biological methods, bioengineering and IT technology is demonstrated and discussed. As Russia as a whole, Siberia is largely engaged in unpromising extensive farming practices, which rely on natural soil fertility, and this factor should be taken into account. Another issue is noncompliance with intensive farming technologies used for cultivating new-generation commercial cultivars. Although capital investments in plant breeding are the most cost effective investments in crop production, breeders efforts remain underfunded. The article explains the need for fundamental reform in this economic sector: the recognition of plant breeding as being a fundamental science; a fair increase in its funding; the development of a breeding strategy, nationally and regionally; the further expansion of the network of the Breeding Centers; the re-establishment and improvement of the universities departments specialized in plant breeding and seed production; having more state-funded places in the universities for training plant breeders to be able to maintain and cement the countrys advanced position in plant breeding and to develop new globally competitive next-generation cultivars of main crops. Should these issues be ignored, all the problems that have accumulated to date will lead to risks of long-term instability in this economic sector.

At the same time, current agricultural systems contribute significantly to exceeding the planetary boundaries. The disruption of the phosphorus and nitrogen cycles in particular stands out from the manifold effects of modern food production on the Earth system. One central issue that will have to be faced in the future is how increased yields in agriculture will be achieved with high-energy requirements in fertilizer production and pollution of water and soil by phosphorus and reactive nitrogen. City region food systems (CRFS) can be a solution to overcome these issues. Nevertheless, to ensure sustainable CRFS, innovative technologies and methods need to be developed, including nutrient and energy recovery and adapted horticultural cultivation methods that fit complex urban dynamics. Such new strategies need to be integrated in long-term social and political transformation processes to enhance acceptance of food produced by recyclates. The joint contribution of experts from the wastewater, horticultural, and political sciences, together with industrial and societal sector actors, is critical to reach these objectives.

Thromboelastography (TEG) maximum amplitude (MA) has been validated as a marker of hypercoagulability and MA &#8805;68 mm has been utilized as a marker of hypercoagulability in other conditions. METHODS: The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between coagulation, inflammatory, and TEG parameters in patients with COVID-19 on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of consecutive patients that received ECMO for the treatment of COVID-19. TEG, inflammatory, and coagulation markers were compared in patients with and without a thrombotic complication. Correlation tests were performed to identify the coagulation and inflammatory markers that best predict hypercoagulability as defined by an elevated TEG MA. RESULTS: A total of 168 TEGs were available in 24 patients. C-reactive protein and fibrinogen were significantly higher in patients that developed a thrombotic event versus those that did not (P = 0.04 and P = 0.04 respectively). D-dimer was negatively correlated with TEG MA (P < 0.01), while fibrinogen was positively correlated (P < 0.01). A fibrinogen >441 mg/dL was found to have a sensitivity of 91.2% and specificity of 85.7% for the detection of MA &#8805;68 mm. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with ECMO, D-dimer concentration had an inverse relationship with degree of hypercoagulability as measured by TEG MA. D-dimer elevation may potentially reflect hemostatic perturbation in patients on ECMO or the severity of COVID-19 related sepsis rather than designate patients likely to benefit from anticoagulation.

Disparity in the infection of SARS-CoV2 among host population and species is an established fact without any clear explanation. To initiate infection, viral S-protein binds to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of the host cell. Our analysis of retrieved amino acid sequences deposited in data bases shows that S-proteins and ACE2 are rich in cysteine (Cys) residues, many of which are conserved in various SARS-related coronaviruses and participate in intra-molecular disulfide bonds. High-resolution protein structures of S-proteins and ACE2 receptors highlighted the probability that two of these disulfide bonds are potentially redox-active, facilitating the primal interaction between the receptor and the spike protein. Presence of redox-active disulfides in the interacting parts of S-protein, ACE2, and a ferredoxin-like fold domain in ACE2, strongly indicate the role of redox in COVID-19 pathogenesis and severity. Resistant animals lack a redox-active disulfide (Cys133-Cys141) in ACE2 sequences, further strengthening the redox hypothesis for infectivity. ACE2 is a known regulator of oxidative stress.

However, we note a high degree of uncertainty and lack of assessments addressing the economic benefits of AT policies;particularly when they are used as a mix of policies at the local level. This study aims to address this knowledge gap. We use the city of Oxford as a case study and apply the WHO Health Economic Assessment Tool and different baselines to assess four policy packages promoting a mode shift to AT for the 2030C2050 period. In total, 312 policy scenarios were produced and analysed. Results show that a policy mix that maximises economic benefits entails bike-sharing, cycle parking, training and education, low traffic neighbourhoods, e-bike grants, a workplace parking levy and increased use of a cycle-to-work Scheme. Considering the health impacts from increased physical activity and avoided CO2 emissions, benefits are estimated in the range of: 62C256 prevented premature deaths;18C50 million tonnes of avoided CO2e emissions;resulting in a total gross benefit of 3.45C11.28 billion. These impacts remain high and robust when key input parameters are tested via a sensitivity analysis.

METHODS The volume of referrals and those who were consented for organ donation in the province in the pre-pandemic period of May 2017 to February 2020 were compared to those of the initial pandemic period (March through December 2020). RESULTS Prior to the pandemic, there were 201 deceased donor referrals in the Western Cape province - 152 (75.6%) and 49 (24.4%) in public and private sectors, respectively. The mean referral rates ranged between 59-69 referrals per year, translating into a monthly rate of 4.8 (range 2.8-5.8). During the first 10 months of the pandemic, there were 18 referrals - 12 (66.7%) and six (33.3%) in the public and private sectors; a decrease of 63%, with a mean monthly referral rate of 1.8. The overall consent rate prior to the pandemic in the public and private sectors was 36.6% (38% and 27%, respectively) with an increase to 44.4% (37.5% and 62.5%) during the pandemic. CONCLUSION Despite a 10% increase in consent rate for deceased donation during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in the number of potential donors referred.

This study was performed to gather electronic clinic utilization data and to better define barriers to visit completion. METHODS: A retrospective review of 199 patients cared for by a general surgery service with subsequent referral to the electronic clinic (January 2019 to June 2019) was performed. Data regarding demographics, medical characteristics, travel distance, and postoperative complications were collected. Patients were categorized based upon visit completion. The &#967;2 and Fisher exact analyses were performed as appropriate. Reasons for cancellations were categorized. RESULTS: More than 1/5 of all patients (21.6%) failed to complete the visit. No differences were observed in completion rates according to the type of operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and age. The failed-completion group had a significantly (P < .05) higher proportion of non-Caucasian patients and those with a marital status of single. Travel distance had no impact. Complication rates were low. Pre-clinic readmission within 30 days contributed to failed completion. Reasons for cancellation included medical issues, technical difficulties, and patient preference to have no follow-up in the electronic clinic. CONCLUSION: Several factors contribute to a patient's failure to complete an electronic clinic visit including marital status, medical complications, technical issues, and patient preference.

DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Rehabilitation hospital. PARTICIPANTS: We assessed the general cognitive functioning through tablet-supported video calls in 9 of 12 consecutive patients (N=9) admitted to the hospital at least 30 days earlier for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19. Three patients were excluded based on the exclusion criteria. None of the patients presented cognitive symptoms before hospitalization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: General cognitive functioning, measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test. RESULTS: A general cognitive decay was observed in 3 patients (33.3%) who had a pathologic score on the MMSE, with a specific decline in attention, memory, language, and praxis abilities. The cognitive malfunctioning appears to be linearly associated with the length of stay (in d) in the intensive care unit (ICU). The longer the amount of time spent in the ICU, the lower the MMSE score, indicating a lower global cognitive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that some patients with COVID-19 might also benefit from neuropsychological rehabilitation, given their possible global cognitive decay. The link between neuropsychological functioning and the length of stay in the ICU suggests that neurocognitive rehabilitative treatments should be directed explicitly toward patients who treated in the ICU, rather than toward every patient who experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome owing to COVID-19. However, given the limitation of a case series study, those hypotheses should be tested with future studies with larger samples and a longer follow-up period.","output":"Neuropsychological Features of Severe Hospitalized Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients at Clinical Stability and Clues for Postacute Rehabilitation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease due to SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan city, China in December 2019 and rapidly spread more than 200 countries as a global health pandemic.

METHODS A systematic literature review was performed using the PubMed and MEDLINE databases for studies published between 1986 and 2020. All studies assessing outcomes related to endovascular Onyx embolization, NBCA embolization, or coiling were included. RESULTS A total of 73 studies were ultimately selected, including 180 (67% male) patients comprising 243 aneurysms treated endovascularly. The mean age was 38.2  17.6 years, and the most common symptom on presentation is headache (31%). Most aneurysms were located on the MCA (52.5%), and over half presented with rupture (53.8%). Coiling was the most commonly employed technique (50.4%), and obliteration rates were comparable across coiling, NBCA, and Onyx (99.1%, 100%, 100%, respectively).

Previous research suggests that people who is able to regulate their emotions tends to have better social connections with others. Additional studies indicate that it is possible to train the ability to regulate emotions voluntarily, using a procedure that involves three steps: (1) asking participants to evoke an autobiographical memory associated with a positive emotion;(2) analyze participants brain activity in real-time to estimate their emotional state;and (3) provide visual feedback about the emotions evoked with the autobiographical memory. However, there is not enough research on how to provide the visual feedback required for the third step. Therefore, this manuscript introduces five virtual environments that can be used to provide emotional visual feedback. Each virtual environment was designed based on evidence found in previous studies, suggesting that there are visual cues, such as colors, shapes and motion patterns, that tend to be associated with emotions. In each virtual environment, the visual cues changed, intending to represent five emotional categories.

Nevertheless, whether bupivacaine can cause neurotoxicity in fetus remains unclear. Hence, this study was design to investigate the effects of maternal bupivacaine use on fetus hippocampal cell apoptosis and the possible related mechanism. METHODS On day 15 of pregnancy, sciatic nerve of pregnant wistar rat (180-200 g) were exposed by lateral incision of the right thigh and 0.2 ml of bupivacaine was injected.

Starting with 707 studies, after three rounds of different quality criteria, 13 articles were selected for analysis, including a hermeneutic analysis, which was followed by a fourth and final recovery round assessing bibliotherapy articles concerning healthcare workers. Results: Our findings showed that through bibliotherapy, patients developed several capacities, including the re-signification of their own activities through a new outlook of their moral horizon. There are no research road maps serving as guides to conduct research on the use of bibliotherapy to enhance mental health. Additionally, values such as autonomy and justice were closely linked with positive results in bibliotherapy. This implies that bibliotherapy has the potential to have a positive impact in different settings. Conclusions: Our contribution is to offer a road map that presents state-of-the-art bibliotherapy research, which will assist institutions and healthcare professionals to plan clinical and specific interventions with positive outcomes.","output":"Bibliotherapy as a Non-pharmaceutical Intervention to Enhance Mental Health in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed-Methods Systematic Review and Bioethical Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis is the most complex and challenging peacetime crisis that the world has ever faced in recent history Over the course of 5 months, the novel","output":"Reimagining Governance: Reclaiming Solidarity and Subsidiarity in the Time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laryngectomized patients showed an unconventional response to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.

This has resulted in a cessation of normal face-to-face services and patient advice can only be offered by remote means. A service evaluation was carried out to assess the quality of information published on websites and social media pages of specialist orthodontic practices in London, against General Dental Council guidance on communication and advertising and the British Orthodontic Society (BOS) COVID-19 specific guidance for orthodontics in primary care in relation to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study also aimed to provide a gold standard template for orthodontic practices to aid in the delivery of information on a digital platform during the current (COVID-19) pandemic and future possible spikes. Materials and methods: All orthodontic practices providing care in the London region were identified from a CQC Database and subsequently checked against predetermined criteria based on the BOS guidance and the GDC Guidance on Ethical Advertising. Results: Of the 83 orthodontic practices sampled; 78 had a website of which 18 (23.1%) were non-compliant with GDC guidance. Facebook pages were identified for 62 orthodontic practices. 17 practices did not provide any update in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was more frequently carried out on practice websites (78.2%) compared to Facebook pages (33.9%). A number of practices were identified as having novel strategies to manage communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Variation was observed in information published by practices despite the regularly updated, blanket information provided by the BOS. Communication may have been delivered by a different means during the pandemic which this study did not account for. In addition, the sampling method may not have identified all practices within the London region, however the sample size seems appropriate to draw meaningful conclusions.

Many serological tests are available and require urgent independent validation. Here, we report performance characteristics of Orient Gene Biotech COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette (OG) and compare it to Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay (ASIA). Patients (n = 102) with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) were tested. The patients were asymptomatic (n = 2) or had mild (n = 37) or severe symptoms requiring hospitalization in a medical unit (n = 35) or intensive care unit (n = 28). Specificity was evaluated for 42 patients with previous viral and parasitic diseases as well as a high level of rheumatic factor. The sensitivity of OG was 95.8% (95% confidence interval [CI95%], 89.6 to 98.8) for samples collected 10 days after the onset of symptoms, which was equivalent to the sensitivity of ASIA of 90.5% (CI95%, 82.8 to 95.6). OG uncovered six false-negative results of ASIA, of which two had only IgM with OG. Specificity was 100% (CI95%, 93.4 to 100) with both tests on samples, including patients infected with endemic coronavirus. Overall, OG performance characteristics indicate that the test is suitable for routine use in clinical laboratories, and its performance is equivalent to that of immunoassay.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has led to a severe medical, social and economic crisis globally. Use of antivirals has given inconsistent results; thus systematic summaries of available evidence are required for any recommendations for treatment. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of antivirals for Covid-19. Methods. The databases we searched were-Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Medrxiv. Title/abstract screening, full-text screening and data abstraction were carried out in duplicate by two researchers. Pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method of random effects for meta-analysis. Results. Twenty studies were found eligible for inclusion: 6 randomized controlled trials, 9 cohort studies and 5 case series. Moderate-quality evidence suggests a likely clinical benefit from the use of remdesivir in improving the number of recoveries (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.07-1.31; I2 = 0%) and time to recovery in days (median -3.02; 95% CI -4.98 to -1.07; I2 = 97%). A possibility of lower mortality is suggested by low-quality evidence with remdesivir (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.40-1.37, I2 = 58%). Moderate-quality evidence suggests no certain benefit of using lopinavir/ritonavir for Covid-19 compared to arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir combined with arbidol or other medications used as controls. Conclusion. Further evidence from randomized controlled trials is required for all antivirals to treat Covid-19.

The aim of this study is to achieve insight into coronavirus disease-care participation of surgical residents in the Netherlands, the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the experienced quality of surgical training, and the influence on Burn-out and Work Engagement compared with the non-coronavirus disease 2019 period in January 2020. METHODS: In this study, we have conducted 2 digital surveys immediately before and 2 months after the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We surveyed a validated Dutch questionnaire 'Utrecht Burn-out Scale,' derived from the Maslach Burn-out Inventory, and also collected the 'Utrecht Work Engagement Scale' measuring work engagement. Additionally, we describe the coronavirus disease-care participation of surgical residents, the impact on how they experienced the quality of their surgical training, and the influence on 'Burn-out and Work Engagement' compared with the pre-coronavirus disease 2019 period for surgical residents in the Netherlands. RESULTS: In January 2020, a total of 317 residents completed the online survey, and in April 2020, a total of 313 residents completed the online survey. Of the responders, 48.6%, in April, participated in coronavirus disease-care in both the coronavirus disease ward as well as the coronavirus disease intensive care unit. Residents experienced that the coronavirus disease 2019 influenced their surgical training in 85.2% of responders. In only 5% of the residents did the pandemic not affect the exposure to surgical training in the operating theater. More burn-out symptoms were noted amongst coronavirus disease ward deployed residents versus no coronavirus disease ward deployment, (16.0% vs 7.6%, P = .06). The Work-Engagement questionnaire showed a significantly lower work engagement score of 4.2 for residents who were deployed in a coronavirus disease-care intensive care unit versus a score of 4.6 for residents scheduled in a coronavirus disease ward (P = .02). CONCLUSION: This study shows a significant impact of the first months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the Dutch surgical trainee program, with a major redistribution of residents with a decrease of surgical exposure and education.

To date, little is known about the cause, clinical associations, and trajectory of Long COVID. METHODS: Participants of an outpatient clinical trial of Peginterferon-Lambda as treatment for uncomplicated SARS-CoV-2 infection were invited to long term follow-up visits 4, 7, and 10 months after initial COVID-19 diagnosis. Ongoing symptoms and functional impairment measures (work productivity and activity index (WPAI), NIH toolbox smell test, 6-minute walk test) were assessed and blood samples obtained. Long COVID was defined as presence of 2 or more typical symptoms (fatigue, hyposmia/hypogeusia, dyspnea, cough, palpitations, memory problems, joint pain) at follow up. Associations between baseline characteristics, initial COVID-19 clinical course, and presence of Long COVID during follow-up were assessed using generalized estimating equations accounting for repeated measurements within individuals. RESULTS: Eighty-seven participants returned for at least one follow-up visit. At four months, 29 (34.1%) had Long COVID; 19 (24.7%) met criteria at 7 months and 18 (23.4%) at 10 months (Figure 1). Presence of Long COVID symptoms did not correlate significantly with functional impairment measures.

It is hence important to continue searching for SARS-CoV-2 broadly neutralizing MAbs and defining their epitopes. Here, we isolate 9 neutralizing mouse MAbs raised against the spike protein of a SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain and evaluate their neutralizing potency towards a panel of variants, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617.1, and B.1.617.2. By using a combination of biochemical, virological, and cryo-EM structural analyses, we identify three types of cross-variant neutralizing MAbs, represented by S5D2, S5G2, and S3H3, respectively, and further define their epitopes. S5D2 binds the top lateral edge of the receptor-binding motif within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) with a binding footprint centred around the loop(477C489), and efficiently neutralizes all variant pseudoviruses, but the potency against B.1.617.2 was observed to decrease significantly. S5G2 targets the highly conserved RBD core region and exhibits comparable neutralization towards the variant panel. S3H3 binds a previously unreported epitope located within the evolutionarily stable SD1 region and is able to near equally neutralize all of the variants tested.

METHODS: We performed a multicenter, case-control study including all hospitalized patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 and blood cultures drawn from March 1, 2020 to May 7, 2020 at three academic medical centers in New Jersey, USA. Data collection included demographics, clinical and microbiologic variables, and patient outcomes. Risk factors and outcomes were compared between cases (sBSI) and controls (no sBSI). RESULTS: A total of 375 hospitalized patients were included. There were 128 sBSIs during the hospitalization. For the first set of positive blood cultures, 117 (91.4%) were bacterial and 7 (5.5%) were fungal.

Despite ART-mediated suppression of viral replication, ART is not a cure and is associated with viral persistence, residual inflammation, and metabolic disturbances. Indeed, due to the presence of viral reservoirs, lifelong ART therapy is required to control viremia and prevent disease progression into acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Successful ART treatment allows people living with HIV (PLHIV) to achieve a similar life expectancy to uninfected individuals. However, recent studies have illustrated the presence of increased comorbidities, such as accelerated, premature immune aging, in ART-controlled PLHIV compared to uninfected individuals. Studies suggest that both HIV-infection and ART-treatment lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately resulting in cellular exhaustion, senescence, and apoptosis. Since mitochondria are essential cellular organelles for energy homeostasis and cellular metabolism, their compromise leads to decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), ATP synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and beta-oxidation, abnormal cell homeostasis, increased oxidative stress, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and upregulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations and cellular apoptosis. The progressive mitochondrial damage induced by HIV-infection and ART-treatment likely contributes to accelerated aging, senescence, and cellular dysfunction in PLHIV. This review discusses the connections between mitochondrial compromise and cellular dysfunction associated with HIV- and ART-induced toxicities, providing new insights into how HIV and current ART directly impact mitochondrial functions and contribute to cellular senescence and aging in PLHIV. Identifying this nexus and potential mechanisms may be beneficial in developing improved therapeutics for treating PLHIV.","output":"The Impact of HIV- and ART-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Cellular Senescence and Aging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Special Capital Region of Jakarta is the epicentre of the transmission of COVID\\\\19 in Indonesia.

This study is a case series of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to 11 hospitals in Korea. METHODS: Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of respiratory specimens by active surveillance that were finally discharged between February 20 and April 30, 2020 were included. Patients were classified into mild and non-mild groups on initial admission according to oxygen demand and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and the mild group was followed up and subgrouped into non-aggravation and aggravation groups. RESULTS: A total of 161 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection were enrolled. Among the mild group of 136 patients, 11.7% of patients experienced clinical aggravation during hospitalization, but there was no initial clinical parameter on admission predicting their aggravation. Fever (odds ratio [OR], 4.56), thrombocytopenia (OR, 12.87), fever (OR, 27.22) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 300 U/L (OR, 18.35), and CRP > 1 mg/dL (OR, 11.31) significantly indicated aggravation in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th 5-day periods, respectively. PCR positivity lasted for a median of 22 days and 32 days after the onset of illness in the non-aggravation and aggravation groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Old age was associated with early severe presentation. Clinical aggravation among asymptomatic or mild patients could not be predicted initially but was heralded by fever and several laboratory markers during the clinical course.","output":"Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19: Clinical Dynamics of Mild Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection Detected by Early Active Surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate the effect of oral immunoprophylaxis in diarrhea of newborn calves egg powder with antibodies specific to E. coli K99 (ETEC) and rotavirus were used in a field trial in south west Germany.

METHODS: An MBSHXD and IDD-related common target gene set was established through TCMSP, UniProt, and two disease gene databases. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were performed through the R platform and STRING to discover the potential mechanism. Molecular docking between the active ingredients and the core genes is used to calculate the binding energy. RESULTS: A total of 147 active ingredients and 79 common genes (including 10 core genes, TNF, VEGFA, IL6, MAPK3, AKT1, MAPK8, TP53, JUN, MMP9, and CXCL8) were identified. The results of GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that MBSHXD plays an essential role in regulating inflammation and oxidative stress. The meaningful pathways are the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, the IL-17 signaling pathway, the TNF signaling pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, and apoptosis. In addition, the PPI network and molecular docking further demonstrated the roles that nine bioactive ingredients of MBSHXD play in IDD treatment through their interference with core target proteins. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that MBSHXD has the characteristics of a multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway in the treatment of IDD by regulating inflammation and oxidative stress, and network pharmacology may provide a feasible method to verify the molecular mechanism of MBSHXD for IDD by combining with molecular docking.","output":"Herbal Formula Modified Bu-Shen-Huo-Xue Decoction Attenuates Intervertebral Disc Degeneration via Regulating Inflammation and Oxidative Stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BARIATRIC SURGERY TOWARDS NEW RECOMMANDATIONS The french NICE has produced a document describing the current limits to the optimal care of obesity, in particular concerning bariatric surgery.

However, healthcare providers as the frontline caregivers dealing with infected patients, are more vulnerable to mental health problems. Despite this fact, there is scarce information regarding the mental health impact of COVID-19 among frontline health care providers in South-West Ethiopia. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the levels and predictors of anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among frontline healthcare providers in Gurage zonal public hospitals, Southwest Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 322 health care providers from November 10C25, 2020 in Gurage zonal health institutions. A simple random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. A pretested self -administered structured questionnaire was used as a data collection technique. The data were entered into the Epi-data version 3.01 and exported to SPSS version 25.0 for analysis. Both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics (chi-square tests) were presented Bivariable and Multivariable logistic regression analyses were made to identify variables having a significant association with the dependent variables. RESULTS: The results of this study had shown that the overall prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress among health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 36%, [95% CI = (30.7%- 41.3%)], 25.8% [95% CI = (21.1%- 30.4%)] and 31.4% [95% CI = (26.4%- 36.0%)] respectively. Age, Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR = 7.9], Educational status, [AOR = 3.2], low monthly income [AOR = 1.87], and presence of infected family members [AOR = 3.3] were statistically associated with anxiety. Besides this, gender, [AOR = 1.9], masters [AOR = 10.8], and degree holder [AOR = 2.2], living with spouse [AOR = 5.8], and family [AOR = 3.9], being pharmacists [AOR = 4.5], and physician [AOR = (0.19)], were found to be statistically significant predictors of depression among health care providers. Our study finding also showed that working at general [AOR = 4.8], and referral hospitals [AOR = 3.2], and low monthly income [AOR = 2.3] were found to be statistically significant predictors of stress among health care providers.

However, the clinical diagnosis process of any disease such as breast cancer, coronary artery diseases, diabetes, COVID-19, among others, is often associated with uncertainty due to the complexity and fuzziness of the process. In this work, a fuzzy neural network expert system with an improved gini index random forest-based feature importance measure algorithm for early diagnosis of breast cancer in Saudi Arabia was proposed to address the uncertainty and ambiguity associated with the diagnosis of breast cancer and also the heavier burden on the overlay of the network nodes of the fuzzy neural network system that often happens due to insignificant features that are used to predict or diagnose the disease. An Improved Gini Index Random Forest-Based Feature Importance Measure Algorithm was used to select the five fittest features of the diagnostic wisconsin breast cancer database out of the 32 features of the dataset. The logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and gaussian na?ve bayes learning algorithms were used to develop two sets of classification models. Hence, the classification models with full features (32) and models with the 5 fittest features. The two sets of classification models were evaluated, and the results of the evaluation were compared. The result of the comparison shows that the models with the selected fittest features outperformed their counterparts with full features in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and sensitivity. Therefore, a fuzzy neural network based expert system was developed with the five selected fittest features and the system achieved 99.33% accuracy, 99.41% sensitivity, and 99.24% specificity. Moreover, based on the comparison of the system developed in this work against the previous works that used fuzzy neural network or other applied artificial intelligence techniques on the same dataset for diagnosis of breast cancer using the same dataset, the system stands to be the best in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. The z test was also conducted, and the test result shows that there is significant accuracy achieved by the system for early diagnosis of breast cancer. ? 2022 by the authors.

It appears that such preventive measures are critical to \\"flattening the curve\\" of the spread of COVID-19. The public's adoption of such behaviors is an essential component in the battle against what has been referred to as the \\"invisible enemy.\\" OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to develop a model for predicting COVID-19 preventive behaviors among US college students. The Health Belief Model has a long history of use and empirical support in predicting preventive health behaviors, but it is not without its purported shortcomings. This study identifies a more optimal and defensible combination of variables to explain preventive behaviors among college students. This segment of the US population is critical in helping slow the spread of COVID-19 because of the relative reluctance of college students to perform the needed behaviors given they do not feel susceptible to or fearful of COVID-19. METHODS: For this study, 415 US college students were surveyed via Qualtrics and asked to answer questions regarding their fear of COVID-19, information receptivity (seeking relevant information), perceived knowledge of the disease, self-efficacy, and performance of preventive behaviors. The PROCESS macro (Model 6) was used to test our conceptual model, including predictions involving sequential mediation. RESULTS: Sequential mediation results show that fear of COVID-19 leads individuals to seek out information regarding the disease, which increases their perceived knowledge and fosters self-efficacy; this is key to driving preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Self-imposed preventive measures can drastically impact the rate of infection among populations. Based on this study's newly created sequential mediation model, communication strategies for encouraging COVID-19 preventive behaviors are offered. It is clear that college students, and very possibly adults of all ages, must have a healthy fear of COVID-19 to set in motion a process where concerned individuals seek out COVID-19-related information, increasing their store of knowledge concerning the disease, their self-efficacy, and ultimately their likelihood of performing the needed preventive behaviors.","output":"Improving Predictions of COVID-19 Preventive Behavior: Development of a Sequential Mediation Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess the views, needs and intended behaviour of general practitioners and practice nurses (PNs) regarding pandemic influenza.

Depleting LARP7 suppresses the expression of CDK1 complex, arrests the cell at the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, and reduces BRCA2 phosphorylation, which thereby facilitates RAD51 recruitment to damaged DNA to enhance HR. Importantly, LARP7 depletion observed in breast cancer patients leads to chemoradiotherapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo.

In this paper, we argue that a comprehensive and more nuanced analysis is required to test this hypothesis, taking into consideration both taking into consideration both environmental dynamics and the persistence of viral infectivity. First, we examine the evidence regarding the presence of the virus in stools and sewage. Then we discuss the current framework of disease transmission through water and excreta and how the transmission of a respiratory disease fits into it. Against this background, we propose a framework to test the faecal-oral hypothesis, unpacking the different environmental routes from faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person. This framework should not be seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis but rather as an expanded view of its complexities, which could help shaping an agenda for research into a number of unanswered questions. Finally, the paper briefly discusses practical implications, based on current knowledge, for containment of the pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 faecal-oral transmission: Are we asking the right questions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Poverty disproportionally affects persons with disabilities, elderly individuals and racialized groups. Leisure, play and rest are not prioritized in either services for or research with people living in poverty. Purpose. This study aims to examine the facilitators and barriers to participation in meaningful leisure activities for adults living in poverty. Method. We used community-based participatory research and art-based elicitation strategies with 39 service users at a food security organization. Findings. Individuals experiencing poverty value and engage in a variety of free and affordable leisure activities, but they are not afforded the necessary leisure opportunities, accommodations and supports as the general population. We co-created a map of local leisure resources to foster collective capacity in leisure planning, and to support organizations working with this population. Implications. Occupational therapists can work alongside members of underserved communities to uncover and address the systemic and local contextual barriers to engagement in leisure activities.","output":"Leisure Possibilities of Adults Experiencing Poverty: A Community-Based Participatory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A distributed denial of service (DDoS) is an attack to stop the server machine partially/completely with a request flood using internet or intranet.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of lockdown on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic progression in nine different countries (New Zealand, France, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, the UK, Sweden, and the USA). DESIGN: We conducted a cross-country comparative evaluation using a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-based model completed with pharmacokinetic approaches. MAIN MEASURES: The rate of new daily SARS-CoV-2 cases in the nine countries was calculated from the World Health Organization's published data. Using a SIR-based model, we determined the infection (?) and recovery (?3) rate constants; their corresponding half-lives (t1/2? and t1/2?3); the basic reproduction numbers (R0 as ?/?3); the rates of susceptible S(t), infected I(t), and recovered R(t) compartments; and the effectiveness of lockdown. Since this approach requires the epidemic termination to build the (I) compartment, we determined S(t) at an early epidemic stage using simple linear regressions. KEY RESULTS: In New Zealand, France, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and the UK, early-onset stay-at-home orders and restrictions followed by gradual deconfinement allowed rapid reduction in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (t1/2? &#8804; 14 days) with R0 &#8804; 1.5 and rapid recovery (t1/2?3 &#8804; 18 days). By contrast, in Sweden (no lockdown) and the USA (heterogeneous state-dependent lockdown followed by abrupt deconfinement scenarios), a prolonged plateau of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (terminal t1/2? of 23 and 40 days, respectively) with elevated R0 (4.9 and 4.4, respectively) and non-ending recovery (terminal t1/2?3 of 112 and 179 days, respectively) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset lockdown with gradual deconfinement allowed shortening the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and reducing contaminations. Lockdown should be considered as an effective public health intervention to halt epidemic progression.","output":"Is Lockdown Effective in Limiting SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic Progression?-a Cross-Country Comparative Evaluation Using Epidemiokinetic Tools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dysfunction in T-cell antitumor activity contributes to the tumorigenesis, progression, and poor outcome of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), with this dysfunction resulting from high expression of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) in T cells. However, the molecular mechanisms maintaining high PD-1 expression in T cells have not been fully investigated in ccRCC. Here, we describe a mechanism underlying the regulation of PD-1 at the mRNA level and demonstrated its impact on T-cell dysfunction. Transcriptomic analysis identified a correlation between transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and PDCD1 in ccRCC samples. The mechanism underlying the regulation of PD-1 mRNA was then investigated in vitro and in vivo using syngeneic tumor models. We also observed that TGF1 had prognostic significance in ccRCC patients, and its expression was associated with PD-1 mRNA expression. CcRCC-derived TGF1 activated P38 and induced the phosphorylation of Ser10 on H3, which recruited p65 to increase SRSF3 and SRSF5 expression in T cells. As a result, the half-life of PD-1 mRNA in T cells was prolonged. SRSF3 coordinated with NXF1 to induce PD-1 mRNA extranuclear transport in T cells. We then demonstrated that TGF1 could induce SRSF3 expression to restrict the antitumor activity of T cells, which influenced immunotherapy outcomes in ccRCC mouse models. Our findings highlight that tumor-derived TGF1 mediates immune evasion and has potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in ccRCC.","output":"Tumor cell-derived TGF1 Attenuates Antitumor Immune Activity of T cells via Regulation of PD-1 mRNA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RT-PCR is considered to be the standard gold diagnostic test for detecting COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2. Recent reports and recent pieces of evidence from scientific literature, however, tell a different story. There have been speculations of SARS-CoV-2 escaping the RT-PCR because of the series of mutations it has gone through. It is possible that host-dependent RNA editing and high person-to-person transmission have equipped the virus with mutations enabling it to spread faster and even evade the RT-PCR. Added to this is burnout among healthcare workers and technicians handling the RT-PCR machines and sampling. All of these factors may be working in unison to result in the deluge of false-negative cases India is facing during the second COVID-19 wave. The mutant strains are spreading to other parts, posing challenges to the whole world. These circumstances warrant supplementary diagnostic tests such as serological and radiological findings to deal with cases of high clinical suspicion.

We designed this study to investigate whether the spinous process (SP) stabilization, which was previously used in adults, can also be used in children. METHODS: Children aged 4-12 years who were admitted to our hospital between 2012 and 2020 and underwent 3D cervical computed tomography (CT) were retrospectively screened. Children without cervical spine fractures, tumors, deformities, or any ab-normalities and motion artifacts on CT were included in the study. Eight hundred seventy children were identified. Then, 360 children randomly selected from the patient pool were divided into nine different age groups or 3 different age groups (4-6 years, 7-9 years, and 10-12 years). The length, height, thickness, and anomalies of subaxial SPs were studied on CT images of children. The suitability of the SPs for the microplate/screw stabilization system was investigated. RESULTS: The suitability rate for screw insertion was 57.6% and the suitability rate for the stabilization in at least one segmental unit was 74.7%. The eligibility rate for stabilization involving C3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 vertebrae was 16.1%. There were nine different stabilization combinations and C6-7 segmental unit (71.9%) were the most common in those combinations. Bifidity prevented screw insertion in 21% of children. We found that the screw acceptance rate of SP started to increase statistically around 8 years of age and the number of segmental units that could be stabilized was at the age of 10-12 at most. CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, we believe that the SP stabilization method recommended for children can be used as a salvage method, to support anterior stabilization or alone in a small number of selected cases.","output":"A new posterior stabilization technique in pediatric subaxial cervical vertebrae: Stabilization of spinous processes with the microplate/screw system: A radiological anatomy study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Orthorexia nervosa (ON) has in recent years attracted attention, but the scarcity of empirical research on the matter generates uncertainty about its progression. This study aims to gain insight into the developmental pathway of ON and factors contributing to it, to establish its etiology. In order to gain insights into health professionals' experience with patients that they identified as suffering from ON, this study adopted mixed methods, with a sequential exploratory design: first, semi-structured interviews (n = 10) were conducted; following, a questionnaire (n = 101) was delivered online. Nutritionists, psychologists, psychotherapists, and support workers with experience in treating eating disorders in the Netherlands were the study's target group. Results shed light on environmental factors influencing the development of ON (e.g. pseudoscientific nutritional experts on social media), baseline risks (e.g. high level of education), initiating events (e.g. experiencing a break up), symptoms (e.g. feelings of depression and anxiety), diagnosis and type of treatment administered (e.g. cognitive-behavioral therapy). The current study is unique in its use of health professionals' experiential knowledge to assess how ON develops and who typically develops it. Furthermore, it contributes to the sparse literature on potential ways to treat ON. More top-down investigations into health professionals' experiences are encouraged as the literature on ON thickens.","output":"Developmental pathway of Orthorexia Nervosa: factors contributing to progression from healthy eating to excessive preoccupation with healthy eating.

In December 2019, the COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and then the whole world continued to pay close attention to the development of the COVID-19 in China. Until now, the outbreak and development of the COVID-19 has lasted for more than a year. Looking back on the process of the COVID-19, several key stages and events have had a profound impact on the development of the COVID-19. We divided the evolution of the outbreak since its origin into different phases. The policy changes of the Chinese government in different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated, and the transformation nodes of the policies and differences in each stage were determined. We divided the evolution of the outbreak into three stages of the outbreak are initial outbreak stage, the carrying of the virus (people or goods) stage, and the non-direct contact transmission (goods transmission) stage. This paper reviews the three stages of the evolution of responses by the Chinese government to COVID-19 using a phase analysis method to examine different policy starting points, changes to policy, and reasons for policy change. The study provides a resource for COVID-19 policy review and includes image of the three-phase shift in policy as the epidemic progressed.

As remote communications will outlast the pandemic, it is crucial to protect users' security and respect their privacy in this unprecedented setting, and that requires a thorough understanding of their behaviors, attitudes, and concerns toward various aspects of remote communications. To this end, we conducted an online study with 220 worldwide Prolific participants. We found that privacy and security are among the most frequently mentioned factors impacting participants' attitude and comfort level with conferencing tools and meeting locations. Open-ended responses revealed that most participants lacked autonomy when choosing conferencing tools or using microphone/webcam in their remote meetings, which in several cases contradicted their personal privacy and security preferences.

There are still no approved agents for disease prophylaxis. We thus decided to use a drug repositioning strategy to perform a state-of-the-art review of a promising but controversial drug, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), in an effort to provide an objective, scientific and methodologically correct overview of its potential prophylactic role. The advantage of using known drugs is that their toxicity profile is well known and there are fewer commercial interests (e.g., expired patents), thus allowing the scientific community to be freer of constraints. The main disadvantage is that the economic resources are almost always insufficient to promote large multinational clinical trials. In the present study, we reviewed the literature and available data on the prophylactic use of HCQ. We also took an in-depth look at all the published clinical data on the drug and examined ongoing clinical trials (CTs) from the most important CT repositories to identify a supporting rationale for HCQ prophylactic use. Our search revealed a substantial amount of preclinical data but a lack of clinical data, highlighting the need to further assess the translational impact of in vitro data in a clinical setting. We identified 77 CTs using a multiplicity of HCQ schedules, which clearly indicates that we are still far from reaching a standard of care. The majority of the CTs (92%) are randomized and 53% are being conducted in a phase 3 or 2/3 setting. The comparator is placebo or control in 55 (77%) of the randomized studies. Forty-eight (62%) CTs expect to enroll up to 1,000 subjects and 50 (71%) plan to recruit healthcare workers (HCW). With regard to drug schedules, 45 (58.5%) CTs have planned a loading dose, while 18 (23.4%) have not; the loading dose is 800 mg in 19 trials (42.2%), 400 mg in 19 (42.2%), 600 mg in 4 (8.9%) and 1,200 mg in 1 (2.2%). Forty trials include at least one daily schedule, while 19 have at least one weekly schedule. Forty-one (53.2%) will have a treatment duration of more than 30 days. Awaiting further developments that can only derive from the results of these prospective randomized CTs, the take-home message of our review is that a correct methodological approach is the key to understanding whether prophylactic HCQ can really represent an effective strategy in preventing COVID-19.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine as Prophylaxis for COVID-19: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aortic dissection and rupture is a rare occurrence in pregnant and postpartum patients.
