Numerous works have been proposed in order to improve the temperature dependence relation of the attraction parameter of the equation - the so called alpha function. In this work, five currently available alpha functions are evaluated for the prediction of molar volumes and enthalpies of natural gas samples. Additionally, parameters of one of the models are readjusted to volumetric data of methane, in order to represent its supercritical behavior more accurately. Experimental data of 44 mixtures are compared with calculated results. Van der Waals mixing rules are used, with binary interaction parameters set as zero. In the case of the original alpha function, it is also tested how the inclusion of non-zero binary parameters affects the predictions. The extended Saffari-Zahedi model presents the smallest average deviation for the molar volumes (1.35%). For the enthalpy calculation, the inclusion of the binary parameters results in deviation values of 2.62% for gas-gas transitions and 4.44% for gas-liquid transitions.","output":"Comparison of modified alpha functions of the PR-EoS for volume and enthalpy prediction of natural gases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the shortcomings of our health, social, and economic systems. While responding to the health crisis, governments are scrambling to understand and address the knock-on economic effects from market disruptions, and respond to other major disturbances (e.g. natural disasters). We conducted 61 key informant interviews with Indo-Fijian small-scale fisheries (SSF) actors (i.e. fishers, boat owners (that may or may not fish), crew members, and traders) in May 2020, two months after Fiji got its first case of COVID-19 and a month after Cyclone Harold hit the country. We examined how these SSF groups whose access to resources depends on their ability to navigate existing social relations of power, have lived through, experienced, and responded to the two stresses. We found the main impact of COVID-19 on SSF actors was the reduction in sales of fish (73.8 % of respondents) likely a result of reduction in local consumption and/or the loss of tourism markets. Loss of purchasing power meant almost a fifth of Indo-Fijian SSF actors interviewed (comprising 44.4 % of crew members, 16.4 % fishers, 11.5 % boat owners, 8.3 % traders) were unable to obtain sufficient food to meet their families daily needs. Many of these SSF actors do not have access to social security or similar safety nets leaving them vulnerable to the current crisis as well as to other shocks and changes. Furthermore, social inequities and power relations surrounding access to fisheries resources and government aid contributed to their vulnerability to economic stresses from COVID-19 and a severe cyclone. An understanding of early impacts of COVID-19 on SSF through an intersectional lens can assist decision-makers to quickly mobilise assistance to help people who are most vulnerable, and avoid widening inequities among social groups.","output":"Politics of vulnerability: Impacts of COVID-19 and Cyclone Harold on Indo-Fijians engaged in small-scale fisheries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundIn face of the developing COVID-19 pandemic with a need for rapid and practical vaccination strategies, Ad26.COV2.S was approved as single shot immunization regimen. While effective against severe COVID-19, Ad26.COV2.S vaccination induces lower SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels compared to its mRNA-based counterparts. To support decision making on the need for booster vaccinations in Ad26.COV2.S-primed individuals, we assessed the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of homologous and heterologous booster vaccinations in Ad26.COV2.S-primed health care workers (HCWs). MethodsThe SWITCH trial is a single-(participant)-blinded, multi-center, randomized controlled trial among 434 HCWs who received a single Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. HCWs were randomized to no boost, Ad26.COV2.S boost, mRNA-1273 boost, or BNT162b2 boost. We assessed the level of SARS-CoV-2-specific binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies against infectious virus, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses, and reactogenicity. ResultsHomologous and heterologous booster vaccinations resulted in an increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses when compared to single Ad26.COV.2.S vaccination. In comparison with the homologous boost, the increase was significantly larger in heterologous regimens with the mRNA-based vaccines. mRNA-1273 boosting was most immunogenic, associated with higher reactogenicity. Only mild to moderate local and systemic reactions were observed on the first two days following booster. ConclusionsBoosting of Ad26.COV2.S-primed HCWs was well-tolerated and immunogenic. Strongest responses were detected after boosting with mRNA-based vaccines. Based on our data, efficacy on infection and transmission of boosters is expected. In addition to efficacy, decision making on boost vaccinations should include timing, target population, level of SARS CoV-2 circulation, and the global inequity in vaccine access.

However, there is little information regarding longitudinal changes in laboratory prognostic variables in relation to disease progression in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. DESIGN AND SETTING: This retrospective observational report describes disease progression from symptom onset, to admission to hospital, clinical response and discharge/death among patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary centre in South East England. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred and fifty-one patients treated for SARS-CoV-2 between March and September 2020 were included in this analysis. Ethical approval was obtained from the HRA Specific Review Board (REC 20/HRA/2986) for waiver of informed consent. RESULTS: The majority of patients presented within 1 week of symptom onset. The lowest risk patients had low mortality (1/45, 2%), and most were discharged within 1 week after admission (30/45, 67%). The highest risk patients, as determined by the 4C mortality score predictor, had high mortality (27/29, 93%), with most dying within 1 week after admission (22/29, 76%). Consistent with previous reports, most patients presented with high levels of C reactive protein (CRP) (67% of patients >50 mg/L), D-dimer (98%>upper limit of normal (ULN)), ferritin (65%>ULN), lactate dehydrogenase (90%>ULN) and low lymphocyte counts (81%<lower limit of normal (LLN)). Increases in platelet counts and decreases in CRP, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (p<0.001), lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil counts, urea and white cell counts (all p<0.01) were each associated with discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Serial measurement of routine blood tests may be a useful prognostic tool for monitoring treatment response in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Changes in other biochemical parameters often included in a COVID-19 bundle did not show significant association with outcome, suggesting there may be limited clinical benefit of serial sampling.

Broad-spectrum antimicrobials are frequently prescribed to patients hospitalized with COVID-19 which potentially acts as a catalyst for the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). ObjectivesWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis during the first 18 months of the pandemic to quantify the prevalence and types of resistant co-infecting organisms in patients with COVID-19 and explore differences across hospital and geographic settings.MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science (BioSIS), and Scopus from November 1, 2019 to May 28, 2021 to identify relevant articles pertaining to resistant co-infections in patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Patient- and study-level analyses were conducted. We calculated pooled prevalence estimates of co-infection with resistant bacterial or fungal organisms using random effects models. Stratified meta-analysis by hospital and geographic setting was also performed to elucidate any differences. ResultsOf 1331 articles identified, 38 met inclusion criteria. A total of 1959 unique isolates were identified with 29% (569) resistant organisms identified. Co-infection with resistant bacterial or fungal organisms ranged from 0.2 to 100% among included studies. Pooled prevalence of co-infection with resistant bacterial and fungal organisms was 24% (95% CI: 8-40%;n=25 studies: I 2 =99%) and 0.3% (95% CI: 0.1-0.6%;n=8 studies: I 2 =78%), respectively. Among multi-drug resistant organisms, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida auris were most commonly reported. Stratified analyses found higher proportions of AMR outside of Europe and in ICU settings, though these results were not statistically significant. Patient-level analysis demonstrated >50% (n=58) mortality, whereby all but 6 patients were infected with a resistant organism. ConclusionsDuring the first 18 months of the pandemic, AMR was moderately prevalent in COVID-19 patients and varied by hospital and geography although there was substantial heterogeneity. Given the variation in patient populations within these studies, clinical settings, practice patterns, and definitions of AMR, further research is warranted to quantify AMR in COVID-19 patients to improve surveillance programs, infection prevention and control practices and antimicrobial stewardship programs globally.","output":"Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (November 2019 - June 2021)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Passive immunotherapy with plasma derived from patients convalescent from SARS-CoV-2 infection can be a promising approach in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

We included 116 patients (40 with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection and 76 with non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection). On ICU day 1, both patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection and non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection had higher levels of interleukin-3, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-17A, eotaxin, and epidermal growth factor compared with healthy controls. There were no differences in cytokines over time between patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection and non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection.

Functional deficits in glutamatergic cortico-limbic areas are hypothesized to play a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Consistently, the clinical antidepressant efficacy of the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine gives hope for a new class of glutamatergic rapid-acting antidepressants. In this context, metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors have received attention as interesting targets for new antidepressants. AREAS COVERED The present review summarizes the preclinical evidence supporting the antidepressant effect of the pharmacological modulation of mGlu receptors. Antidepressant properties in animal models of mGlu1 antagonists, mGlu5 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), mGlu2/3 agonists, PAMs, orthosteric antagonists and NAMs, mGlu4 and mGlu7 PAMs are reviewed. To date, orthosteric mGlu2/3 antagonists are the most promising compounds in development as antidepressants. EXPERT OPINION Although accumulating clinical and preclinical evidence concur to confirm a primary role of glutamate transmission modulation for the induction of a rapid antidepressant effect, very little is still known about the cellular mechanisms involved.

This paper presents a case study of the Danish Health Authority's (DHA) Facebook page, focusing on the initial phase of the pandemic and on posts about face masks. Face masks were chosen as an exemplar of the many topics where scientific research was being communicated as it unfolded, and where relations between science, policy, and politics were also evolving in public. In other words, topics where what should be communicated and why was unclear and unstable. A qualitative thematic analysis of the DHA Facebook page, grounded in the practice-based knowledge of one of the authors and feedback meetings with DHA staff, unpicks what kinds of engagements between authority and citizens occurred, both explicitly and implicitly. The analysis particularly looks for dialogueas a mode of communication implicitly promised by social media platforms, and as a well-established ingredient of trust in relationships between experts and citizens. Drawing on Grudin's definition of dialogue as reciprocal and strange, we argue that the DHA's Facebook policy limited such encounters, in part by practical necessity, and in part due to professional constraints on the ability to discuss entanglements between health guidelines and politics. But we also identify strangeness in the apparent disconnect between individual engagements and collective responses;and reciprocity in the sharing of affect and alternative forms of expertise. We also highlight the invisible majority of silent engagements with DHA information on the Facebook page, and ask whether the visibly frustrated dialogue that ran alongside was a price worth paying for this informational exchange. The paper also serves as an example of qualitative research situated within ongoing practice, and as such we argue for the virtue of these more local, processual forms of evidence-based science communication.

RESULTS: After RNA extraction and expression measurements of N1, N2 and RP genes from all the collected filters, no presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed. Control test to exclude false positive results were successfully accomplished. CONCLUSIONS: No presence of SARS-CoV-2 in quartz fiber filters samplers for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 fractions was observed in our study carried out in Madrid during the month of May 2020. Nevertheless, the absence of viral genomes could be due to different factors including: limited social interactions and economic activities resulting in reduced circulation of the coronavirus, lower daily PM concentration in outdoor air, as well as to meteorological stability and higher temperature that characterize spring season. Further researches should be carried out during the winter, in presence of higher viral circulation and daily PM exceedances.","output":"Determination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in different particulate matter size fractions of outdoor air samples in Madrid during the lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the automated cartridge-based PCR approach ARIES SARS-CoV-2 Assay targeting the ORF-sequence and the N-gene of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In line with the suggestions by Rabenau and colleagues, the automated ARIES SARS-CoV-2 Assay was challenged with strongly positive samples, weakly positive samples and negative samples. Further, intra-assay and inter-assay precision as well as the limit-of-detection (lod) were defined with quantified target RNA and DNA. The Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-Cov-2 Assay was used as gold standard. RESULTS: Concordance between the ARIES assay and the Cepheid assay was 100% for strongly positive samples and for negative samples, respectively. For weakly positive samples as confirmed applying the Cepheid assay, a relevant minority of 4 out of 15 samples (26.7%) went undetected by the ARIES assay. Intra- and inter-assay precision were satisfactory, while the lod was in the 10(3) DNA copies/reaction-range, in the 10(3) virus copies/reaction-range, or in the 10(3)-10(4) free RNA copies/reaction-range in our hands. CONCLUSIONS: The automated ARIES assay shows comparable test characteristics as the Cepheid assay focusing on strongly positive and negative samples but a slightly reduced sensitivity with weakly positive samples.

The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) describes personal determinants that play a key role in behavior change. This study investigated whether these determinants are associated with adherence to physical distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (i.e. keeping 1.5 m physical distance and staying at home). Decreased psychosocial well-being and lack of social support were explored as barriers to adherence. METHODS Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted among adults in Belgium. The first survey (N = 2,379; March 2020) focused on adherence to physical distancing measures. The second survey (N = 805; April 2020) focused on difficulty with, and perseverance in, adhering to these measures. Linear regression models were fitted to examine associations with HAPA determinants, psychosocial well-being, and social support. RESULTS Self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, intention, action planning, and coping planning were related to adhering to, difficulty with, and perseverance in, adhering to physical distancing measures. Decreased psychosocial well-being and lack of social support were related to more difficulties with adhering to physical distancing and lower perseverance. CONCLUSIONS Health action process approach determinants are associated with adherence to physical distancing measures.

The trajectories of infections, recovery, and deaths vastly differed across Indian states. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether persistent investments by states in critical social sectors, such as health and education, explain their preparedness and hence better management of the pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses secondary data on the number of infected, recovered and deceased due to COVID-19, along with data on population and income across 302 districts in 11 major states in India. Data on health and education indices are collected at the state-level. Linear regression models that also control for heteroskedasticity are applied.FindingsThis study finds that higher investments in health care and education reduce the propensity of the infection spread. Further, states with persistent investments in health care and education exhibit a higher rate of recovery. This study also finds that death rates are significantly lower in states with higher investments in education.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings support the conjecture that states that have consistently invested in social sectors benefited from the associated positive externalities during the crisis that helped them manage the pandemic better.Originality/valueThis study will help policymakers understand the underlying social forces critical to the success in the fight against pandemics. Apart from improving preparedness for future pandemics, the evidence provided in the paper may help give better direction and purpose to tax-financed public spending in states where social sector development has hitherto received low priority.","output":"Managing the COVID-19 pandemic: does social infrastructure matter?

There is a need to characterize the complexity of mutant spectra in coronaviruses sampled from infected patients. In particular, the possible relationship between SARS-CoV-2 mutant spectrum complexity and disease associations has not been established. In the present study, we report an ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) analysis of the mutant spectrum of amplicons from the nsp12 (polymerase)- and spike (S)-coding regions of thirty nasopharyngeal isolates (diagnostic samples) of SARS-CoV-2 of the first COVID-19 pandemic wave (Madrid, Spain, April 2020) classified according to the severity of ensuing COVID-19. Low frequency mutations and deletions, counted relative to the consensus sequence of the corresponding isolate, were overwhelmingly abundant. We show that the average number of different point mutations, mutations per haplotype and several diversity indices was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 isolated from patients who developed mild disease than in those associated with moderate or severe disease (exitus). No such bias was observed with RNA deletions. Location of amino acid substitutions in the three dimensional structures of nsp12 (polymerase) and S suggest significant structural or functional effects. Thus, patients who develop mild symptoms may be a richer source of genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 than patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. IMPORTANCEThe study shows that mutant spectra of SARS-CoV-2 from diagnostic samples differ in point mutation abundance and complexity, and that significantly larger values were observed in virus from patients who developed mild COVID-19 symptoms. Mutant spectrum complexity is not a uniform trait among isolates. The nature and location of low frequency amino acid substitutions present in mutant spectra anticipate great potential for phenotypic diversification of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Point Mutation and Deletion Spectra, and Their Association with Different Disease Outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a devastating CNS infection caused by JC virus (JCV), a polyomavirus that commonly establishes persistent, asymptomatic infection in the general population. Emerging evidence that PML can be ameliorated with novel immunotherapeutic approaches calls for reassessment of PML pathophysiology and clinical course. PML results from JCV reactivation in the setting of impaired cellular immunity, and no antiviral therapies are available, so survival depends on reversal of the underlying immunosuppression. Antiretroviral therapies greatly reduce the risk of HIV-related PML, but many modern treatments for cancers, organ transplantation and chronic inflammatory disease cause immunosuppression that can be difficult to reverse. These treatments  most notably natalizumab for multiple sclerosis  have led to a surge of iatrogenic PML. The spectrum of presentations of JCV-related disease has evolved over time and may challenge current diagnostic criteria. Immunotherapeutic interventions, such as use of checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive T cell transfer, have shown promise but caution is needed in the management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, an exuberant immune response that can contribute to morbidity and death. Many people who survive PML are left with neurological sequelae and some with persistent, low-level viral replication in the CNS. As the number of people who survive PML increases, this lack of viral clearance could create challenges in the subsequent management of some underlying diseases.","output":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and the spectrum of JC virus-related disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reported rates of HER2 positivity in cervical cancer (CC) range from 0% to 87%. The importance of HER2 as an actionable target in CC would depend on HER2 positivity prevalence.

We searched Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane database, and grey literature for articles reporting the proportion of HER2 positivity in CC. Studies assessing HER2 status by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization in invasive disease were eligible. We performed descriptive analyses of all 65 included studies. Out of these, we selected 26 studies that used standardized American Society of Clinical Oncology / College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) Guidelines compliant methodology. We conducted several meta-analyses of proportions to estimate the pooled prevalence of HER2 positivity and subgroup analyses using geographic region, histology, tumor stage, primary antibody brand, study size, and publication year as moderators. The estimated pooled prevalence of HER2 overexpression was 5.7% (CI 95%: 1.5% to 11.7%) I2 = 87% in ASCO/CAP compliant studies and 27.0%, (CI 95%: 19.9% to 34.8%) I2 = 96% in ASCO/CAP non-compliant ones, p < 0.001.

Infections from infected surfaces have been identified as drivers of Covid-19 transmission, but many epidemiological models do not include an environmental component to account for indirect transmission. We formulate a deterministic Covid-19 model with both direct and indirect transmissions. The computed basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] represents the average number of secondary direct human-to-human infections, and the average number of secondary indirect infections from the environment. Using Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient, we compute sensitivity indices of the basic reproductive number [Formula: see text]. As expected, the most significant parameter to reduce initial disease transmission is the natural death rate of pathogens in the environment. Variation of the basic reproduction number for different values of direct and indirect transmissions are numerically investigated. Decreasing the effective direct human-to-human contact rate and indirect transmission from human-to-environment will decrease the spread of the disease as [Formula: see text] decreases and vice versa. Since the effective contact rate often accounted for as a factor of the force of infection and other interventions measures such as treatment rate are prominent features of infectious diseases, we consider several functional forms of the incidence function, and numerically investigate their potential impact on the long-term dynamics of the disease. Simulations results revealed some differences for the time and infection to reach its peak.

FTSGs were obtained from the donor forearm with a proximal S-shaped incision, thereby avoiding additional wound creation. Morbidity outcomes were compared to 68 consecutive patients with STSG reconstruction from January 2009 to May 2010. Complications, including tendon exposure, subjective functional impairment, complete graft loss, partial graft loss, infection, paresthesias, and hematoma/seroma, were evaluated, as were aesthetic outcomes. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients underwent FTSG reconstruction. No significant differences between FTSGs and STSGs were demonstrated in terms of graft loss 40% (4% vs 4%, P = 1.000), partial graft loss (<40%) (29% vs 40%, P = .207), tendon exposure (9% vs 12%, P = .573), infection (15% vs 13%, P = .805), paresthesias (12% vs 7%, P = .382), subjective functional impairment (0% vs 2%, P = .316), or hematoma/seroma (2% vs 0%, P = .316).

STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive study. METHODS: The data concerning the organization of the vaccination campaign were taken from the operative protocol developed by the hospital dedicated task force, composed by experts in hygiene, public health, occupational medicine, pharmacists, nurses, hospital quality, and disaster managers. Data about the numbers of vaccine administered daily were collected by the Innovation and Development Operative Unit database. RESULTS: Vaccinations against COVID-19 started across the EU on the 27th of December 2020. The first phase of the vaccination campaign carried out in our hospital was directed to healthcare workers immunization including medical residents, social care operators, administrative staff and technicians, students of medicine, and health professions trainees. The second phase was enlarged to the coverage of extremely fragile subjects. Thanks to the massive employment of healthcare workers and the establishment of dynamic pathways, it was possible to achieve short turnaround times and a large number of doses administered daily, with peaks of 870 vaccines per day. From the 27th of December up to the 14th of March a total of 26,341 doses of Pfizer have been administered. 13,584 were first doses and 12,757 were second doses. From the 4th to the 14th of March, 296 first doses of Moderna were dispensed. It was necessary to implement adequate spaces and areas adopting anti-contagion safety measures: waiting area for subjects to be vaccinated, working rooms for the dilution of the vaccine and the storage of the material, vaccination rooms, post-vaccination observation areas, room for observation, and treatment of any adverse reactions, with an emergency cart available in each working area. CONCLUSIONS: The teaching hospital of Pisa faced the beginning of the immunization campaign readjusting its spaces, planning an adequate hospital vaccination area and providing an organization plan to ensure the achievement of the targets of the campaign. This represented a challenge due to limited vaccine doses supplied and the multisectoral teams of professionals to coordinate in the shortest time and the safest way possible.

In contrast, avian and other vertebrate species are a reservoir of type A influenza virus genome diversity, hosting strains representing at least 120 of 144 combinations of 16 viral hemagglutinin and 9 viral neuraminidase subtypes. Viral genome segment reassortments and mutations emerging within this reservoir may spawn new influenza virus strains as imminent epidemic or pandemic threats to human health and poultry production. Traditional methods to detect and differentiate influenza virus subtypes are either time-consuming and labor-intensive (culture-based) or remarkably insensitive (antibody-based). Molecular diagnostic assays based upon reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have short assay cycle time, and high analytical sensitivity and specificity. However, none of these diagnostic tests determine viral gene nucleotide sequences to distinguish strains and variants of a detected pathogen from one specimen to the next. Decision-quality, strain- and variant-specific pathogen gene sequence information may be critical for public health, infection control, surveillance, epidemiology, or medical/veterinary treatment planning. The Resequencing Pathogen Microarray (RPM-Flu) is a robust, highly multiplexed and target gene sequencing-based alternative to both traditional culture- or biomarker-based diagnostic tests. RPM-Flu is a single, simultaneous differential diagnostic assay for all subtype combinations of type A influenza viruses and for 30 other viral and bacterial pathogens that may cause influenza-like illness. These other pathogen targets of RPM-Flu may co-infect and compound the morbidity and/or mortality of patients with influenza.

METHODS: Fifty patients with indication to primary ACLR were randomly and equally divided into hamstring autograft or allograft tendon groups. The graft maturation was measured at 6- and 12-month follow-up by the SNQ score and other radiological parameters on MRI scans. Clinical and functional recovery was evaluated by Lysholm score, Visual Analogues Scale, Tegner activity scale and modified Cincinnati knee rating system at 6, 12 and 60 months after surgery to estimate the predictive value of the radiological parameters for clinical outcomes. Return-to-sport (ACL-RSI) was measured 60 months after surgery. RESULTS: Three patients had retear of the neo-ligament (two from Auto group and one from Allo group). All the clinical/functional parameters significantly improved over time, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. At 6 months, the SNQ value was significantly higher in the Auto than in the Allo group (12.9 vs 7.9, p = 0.038), but at 12 months they were comparable (9.8 vs 10.4). The 6-month SNQ values did not correlate with the clinical scores, whereas the 12-month SNQ values significantly correlated with the Cincinnati score, Lysholm score and Tegner activity scale collected at 60-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: No clinical or functional differences have been found between the two treatment groups, supporting the suitability of using allograft in primary ACLR, when available. The results at MRI scans showed a different graft maturation trend in the two groups, with allografts being more reactive in the first 6 months. MRI together with the subjective evaluation allows to evaluate objectively the status of the neo-ligamentization process and therefore helps the surgeon to dictate the individual time for return-to-sport.

The adaptive immunity is found to be more significant after booster vaccination, and is linked to improved placental antigen transmission. Two vaccination doses are associated with more robust maternal and fetal antibody levels.

This knowledge complements and refines the epidemiological information about the spread and impact of the virus. For this analysis, we rely on the descriptive exploration of (1) data from The European Surveillance System (TESSy) database developed at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on the number of cases and fatality rates and (2) of weekly mortality data collected by Eurostat. The analysis at territorial level studies the changes in R0-the basic reproduction number-and median excess mortality, across territories with different levels of urbanization. The unique findings of this study encompassing most European Union Member States confirm and define the demographic and territorial differential impacts in terms of infections and fatalities during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. The information is important for stakeholders at European Union, national and sub-national levels in charge of designing containment measures for COVID-19 and adaptation policies for the future by anticipating the rebound for certain segments of the population with differential medical and economic needs.","output":"Demographic and territorial characteristics of COVID-19 cases and excess mortality in the European Union during the first wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The WHO has announced the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak to be a global pandemic. The distribution of community outbreaks shows seasonal patterns along certain latitude, temperature and humidity, that is, similar to the behaviour of seasonal viral respiratory tract infections. COVID-19 displays significant spread in northern mid-latitude countries with an average temperature of 5-11C and low humidity. Vitamin D deficiency has also been described as pandemic, especially in Europe. Regardless of age, ethnicity and latitude, recent data showed that 40 % of Europeans are vitamin D deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels <50 nmol/l), and 13 % are severely deficient (25(OH)D < 30 nmol/l). A quadratic relationship was found between the prevalences of vitamin D deficiency in most commonly affected countries by COVID-19 and the latitudes. Vitamin D deficiency is more common in the subtropical and mid-latitude countries than the tropical and high-latitude countries. The most commonly affected countries with severe vitamin D deficiency are from the subtropical (Saudi Arabia 46 %; Qatar 46 %; Iran 334 %; Chile 264 %) and mid-latitude (France 273 %; Portugal 212 %; Austria 193 %) regions. Severe vitamin D deficiency was found to be nearly 0 % in some high-latitude countries (e.g. Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Netherlands). Accordingly, we would like to call attention to the possible association between severe vitamin D deficiency and mortality pertaining to COVID-19. Given its rare side effects and relatively wide safety, prophylactic vitamin D supplementation and/or food fortification might reasonably serve as a very convenient adjuvant therapy for these two worldwide public health problems alike.","output":"'Scientific Strabismus' or two related pandemics: coronavirus disease and vitamin D deficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19\\\\associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is a recently recognized entity associated with the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and known post\\\\viral pneumonia complications.

Surprisingly, inhibition of GSK3 by lithium chloride (LiCl), CHIR99021, or dominant-negative GSK3 triggers macropinocytosis. GSK3 inhibition causes a rapid increase in acidic endolysosomes that is independent of new protein synthesis. GSK3 inhibition or Axin1 mutation increases lysosomal activity, which can be followed with tracers of active cathepsin D, ?-glucosidase, and ovalbumin degradation. Microinjection of LiCl into the blastula cavity of Xenopus embryos causes a striking increase in dextran macropinocytosis. The effects of GSK3 inhibition on protein degradation in endolysosomes are blocked by the macropinocytosis inhibitors EIPA or IPA-3, suggesting that increases in membrane trafficking drive lysosomal activity.","output":"GSK3 Inhibits Macropinocytosis and Lysosomal Activity through the Wnt Destruction Complex Machinery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a pandemic that has claimed so far over half a million human life across the globe.

Certain phytochemicals present in some spices are claimed to possess antiviral, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal properties. Hence, an in-silico study was done by selecting eighteen well reported antiviral phytochemicals from some spices commonly used in Indian kitchen viz. Curcuma longa (Turmeric), Nigella sativa (Black cumin), Piper nigrum (Black pepper), Trachyspermum ammi (Carom) and Zingiber officinale (Ginger) to find out whether they can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Firstly, we predicted the structure of TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2), a host protein that truncates spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 thereby facilitating its endocytosis, and then docked against its catalytic domain the selected phytochemicals and camostat (a well-known synthetic inhibitor of TMPRSS2). Thereafter, stability of seven best docked phytochemicals and camostat were scrutinized by Molecular Dynamic Simulation (MDS). MDS analysis indicated bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC), carvacrol and thymol as better inhibitors than the camostat due to their stable binding with TMPRSS2 in its oxyanion hole and inducing subtle modification in the spatial arrangement of the catalytic triad residues. Among these three phytochemicals, carvacrol appeared to be the best inhibitor, followed by BDMC, whereas thymol was least effective.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Hence, targeting the viral entry mechanisms remains a major strategy for COVID-19 treatment. Although recent efforts have focused on the direct inhibition of S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) interactions with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), allosteric targeting remains an unexplored possibility. Therefore, in this study, for the first time, we employed an integrative meta-analytical approach to investigate the allosteric inhibitory mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and its association with hACE2. Findings revealed two druggable sites (Sites 1 and 2) located at the N-terminal domain (NTD) and S2 regions of the protein. Two high-affinity binders; ZINC3939013 (Fosaprepitant - Site 1) and ZINC27990463 (Lomitapide - Site 2) were discovered via site-directed high-throughput screening against a library of a??1500 FDA approved drugs. Interestingly, we observed that allosteric binding of both compounds perturbed the prefusion S-protein conformations, which in turn, resulted in unprecedented hACE2 displacement from the RBD. Estimated &#916;G binds for both compounds were highly favorable due to high-affinity interactions at the target sites. In addition, Site 1 residues; R190, H207, K206 and K187, I101, R102, I119, F192, L226, V126 and W104 were identified for their crucial involvement in the binding and stability of ZINC3939013.

Beyond SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, the pandemic may have devastating consequences for HIV care delivery. Understanding these is crucial as reduced antiretroviral therapy (ART) availability alone could lead to 500,000 AIDS-related deaths in 2020C2021. With Latin America now a focal point in the pandemic, we sought to describe the impact of COVID-19 on HIV care at Latin American clinical sites. METHODS: Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet) and additional Brazilian HIV care sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, and Peru were included. An electronic survey of COVID-19 effects on HIV clinic operations was administered in Spanish or English via phone and email, April 28-June 2, 2020. We also compared national COVID-19 case, mortality, and policy data from public sources. RESULTS: Brazils and Mexicos epidemics appear most pronounced, with >10,000 confirmed COVID-19-related deaths (Figure 1); countries implemented social distancing policies at different times after initial cases, with Haiti earliest and Mexico latest (Figure 2). Nearly all 13 sites reported decreased hours and providers for HIV care. Twelve of 13 reported increased use of telehealth, suspension/postponements of routine HIV appointments, and/or suspension of HIV research. Eleven of 13 reported initiation of new COVID-19 research but suspension of community HIV testing, and nearly half provided additional ART supplies. Nearly 70% reported impacts on HIV viral load testing and nearly 40% reported personal protective equipment stock-outs (Table). All 13 sites experienced changes in resources/services in tandem with national policies; there was wide variation, however, in the number of economic and health supports implemented thus far (e.g., quarantines, tax deferrals, interest rate reductions, etc.), from 172 COVID-19-related policies in Brazil to only 30 in Mexico.

This paper therefore aims to systematically search for studies that have addressed their country's lack of donations and analyse the risk of blood transfusion-transmission. As such, it will answer the question should blood services focus more on donation vigilance or worry more about the risks of transmission through blood products? METHODS: 38 articles were identified through a systematic review adopting the PRISMA and STROBE guidelines. Meta-analysis was conducted using OpenMeta software. RESULTS: The average decrease in blood donations was found to be 38%, with some regions showing up to 67% decrease. To assess the risk of actual blood transfusion-transmission, three datasets were analysed. Firstly, the viral load in COVID-19 patients was studied and found to have less than 1% detection rate (ARD = ?0.831, 95% ?0.963, ?0.699). Secondly, the prevalence of finding viral RNA in a pool of donations was nearly ?1.503 (ARD = ?1.538, ?1.468). Lastly, recipients who were given blood products of positive donors were found to be ?0.911 (ARD 95% = ?1.247, ?0.575).

In the context of a project taking a whole systems approach to tuberculosis infection prevention and control (IPC), we aimed to evaluate the potential impact of conventional and novel IPC measures on Mtb transmission to patients and other clinic attendees. Methods An individual-based model of patient movements through clinics, ventilation in waiting areas, and Mtb transmission was developed, and parameterised using empirical data from eight clinics in two provinces in South Africa. Seven interventions - co-developed with health professionals and policy-makers - were simulated: 1. queue management systems with outdoor waiting areas, 2. ultraviolet germicidal irradiation systems (UVGI), 3. appointment systems, 4. opening windows and doors, 5. surgical mask wearing by clinic attendees, 6. simple clinic retrofits, and 7. increased coverage of long antiretroviral therapy prescriptions and community medicine collection points through the CCMDD service. Results In the model, 1. outdoor waiting areas reduced the transmission to clinic attendees by 83% (interquartile range [IQR] 76-88%), 2. UVGI by 77% (IQR 64-85%), 3. appointment systems by 62% (IQR 45-75%), 4. opening windows and doors by 55% (IQR 25-72%), 5. masks by 47% (IQR 42-50%), 6. clinic retrofits by 45% (IQR 16-64%), and 7. increasing the coverage of CCMDD by 22% (IQR 12-32%). Conclusions The majority of the interventions achieved median reductions in the rate of transmission to clinic attendees of at least 45%, meaning that a range of highly effective intervention options are available, that can be tailored to the local context. Measures that are not traditionally considered to be IPC interventions, such as appointment systems, may be as effective as more traditional IPC measures, such as mask wearing.","output":"Modelling the effect of infection prevention and control measures on rate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission to clinic attendees in primary health clinics in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The treatment of coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) is a principal aim worldwide that is required restore public health in the population.

Such dysfunctional immune response has been described as a dysregulated and exacerbated production of cytokines and chemokines that attracts and activates inflammatory cells, which start and sustain pulmonary and systemic damage, thus causing complications that lead to multi organ failure and death. Therefore, we suggest that blocking key inflammation receptors could help to reduce migration and activation of Th17, monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils, thus mitigating the cytokine storm and averting severe complications and death. Importantly, the optimum treatment for COVID-19 severe patients could combine a modulator of the immune response with a direct antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2, in order to address both the viral load and the hyperinflammatory effects of the immune dysregulation.

Loneliness resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may also have negative implications on those with chronic musculoskeletal pain. OBJECTIVES The aim of this review was to identify the role of loneliness specific to the recent COVID-19 pandemic as it relates to the prevalence and severity of chronic pain in the geriatric population and to provide an overview for clinicians. STUDY DESIGN Narrative review. METHODS A literature search was conducted using combinations of relevant search terms. Databases included PubMed and relevant grey literature sources. Reference lists of selected articles were also searched for additional relevant literature. RESULTS Recent literature supports that social isolation and loneliness stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic have negative implications on chronic musculoskeletal pain. Loneliness has been well documented to have deleterious effects on physical and mental health, and it is increasingly linked to worsening debility and pain interference for those with chronic musculoskeletal pain. This has been found to be most prominent in the geriatric population, who are at the greatest risk for social decline and loneliness. Loneliness has also been found to have negative effects on cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, and mental health, as well as cognitive decline. LIMITATIONS Potential selection bias due to the narrative review design. Some included studies required the use of online questionnaires, which may not be accessible for the geriatric population, those without technology literacy, or low socioeconomic status populations. Future studies should emphasize screening patients for access to technological devices and reliable internet while partnering with community programs focused on digital literacy and resource access. CONCLUSIONS A myriad of deleterious effects stemming from social isolation and loneliness have been documented, of which geriatric populations are especially susceptible. Both early identification of at-risk patients and safe interventions are essential to mitigate loneliness and stop the progression of debility.

However, the impact of lockdowns and shutdowns on the power system in different regions as well as periods of the pandemic can hardly be reflected on the foundation of current studies. In this paper, a prediction-based analysis method is developed to point out the electricity consumption gap resulted from the pandemic situation. The core of this method is a novel optimized grey prediction model, namely Rolling IMSGM(1,1) (Rolling Mechanism combined with grey model with initial condition as Maclaurin series), which achieves better prediction results in the face of long-term emergencies. A novel initial condition is adopted to track data with various characteristics in the form of higher-order polynomials, which are then determined by intelligent algorithms to realize accurate fitting. Historical power consumption data in China are utilized to carry out the monthly forecasts during COVID-19. Compared with other competitive models prediction results, the superiority of IMSGM(1,1) are demonstrated. Through analyzing the gap between predicted consumption values and the actual data, it can be found that the impact of the pandemic on electricity varies in different periods, which is related to its severity and the local lockdown policies. This study helps to understand the impact on power industry in the face of such an emergency intuitively so as to respond to possible future events.","output":"Prediction-based analysis on power consumption gap under long-term emergency: A case in China under COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technology, economics, and government policies, disrupt business models. Since the initiation of feed-in tariffs and renewable energy policies, the Malaysian solar photovoltaic industry has experienced acceleration growth. Changes in policies and a limited feed-in tariff quota system affected the solar photovoltaic industry in Malaysia. However, new policies and frameworks towards self-consumption and large-scale solar with net energy metering and financing options have changed the business models. To better understand Malaysia's present solar PV business models and financing options, interviews and surveys were conducted with business representatives and customers. In addition, Malaysian solar PV business models were compared with Germany, the USA, Japan, and Thailand. The drivers, barriers, and challenges faced by solar service companies and customers in Malaysia are presented. Interestingly, the Malaysian solar energy business was immune to the Covid-19 pandemic, and an overwhelming increase in the installation capacity took place owing to existing attractive policies. The study provides valuable insights on the guidelines of existing business models and new energy policies that might assist renewable energy policymakers, local solar photovoltaics companies, and foreign investors.","output":"Energy policies shaping the solar photovoltaics business models in Malaysia with some insights on Covid-19 pandemic effect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive degenerative disease, of which smoking is the main causer. We carried out this study with the aim of exploring the underlying mechanism of methylprednisolone (MP) treating the COPD. To stimulate COPD in vitro, cigarette smoke extract (CSE)was employed to induce human bronchial epithelial cells BEAS-2B. With the help of MTT and Tunel assays, the viability and apoptosis of BEAS-2B cells after indicated treatment were assessed. The levels of inflammatory response and oxidative stress were determined by the changes of markers basing on their commercial kits. Additionally, annexin A1 (ANXA1) expressions at both protein and mRNA levels were assessed with Western blot and Reverse transcription?quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Moreover, the expressions of apoptosis- and formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) receptors and the adenosine 5-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway-related proteins were determined with Western blot., related proteins and proteins. As a result, MP up-regulated the ANXA1 expression in CSE-induced BEAS-2B cells. MP enhanced the viability but suppressed the apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress of CSE-induced BEAS-2B cells via regulating FPR2/AMPK pathway, while ANXA1 knockdown exhibited oppositive effects on them.

MATERIALS/METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with intact MBM treated with SRS from 2008 to 2019. Cox-frailty models were constructed to include confounders selected by penalized Cox regression models with a LASSO selector. Interaction effect testing was used to determine whether a significant effect between IO and PDLDm could be demonstrated with respect to LC. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 67 patients with 244 MBMs treated with SRS (30 patients with 122 lesions treated with both SRS and IO) were included. The logarithm of PDLDm was selected as a predictor of LC (HR 0.307, 95% CI 0.098C0.441), adjusting for IO receipt (HR 0.363, 95% CI 0.108C1.224).

Although more than 60 antiviral drugs have been approved by the FDA, most of them are for the management of few viruses like HIV, Hepatitis and Influenza. There is no antiviral for many viruses including Dengue, Chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis. Many of these neglected viruses are increasingly becoming global pathogens. Lack of broad spectrum of action and the rapid rise of resistance and cross-resistance to existing antiviral have further increased the challenge of antiviral development. Sulfonamide, as a privileged scaffold, has been capitalized to develop several bioactive compounds and drugs. Accordingly, several reviews have been published in recent times on bioactive sulfonamides. However, there are not enough review reports of antiviral sulfonamides in the last five years. Sul fonamides scaffolds have received sufficient attention for the development of non-nucleoside antivirals following the emergence of cross-resistance to nucleoside inhibitors. Hybridization of bioactive pharmacophores with sulfonamides has been used as a strategy to develop sulfonamide antivirals. This review is an effort to analyze these attempts and evaluate their translational potential. Parameters including potency (IC 50), toxicity (CC 50) and selectivity (CC 50/IC 50) have been used in this report to suggest the potential of sulfonamide derivatives to progress further as antiviral. Since most of these antiviral properties are based on the in vitro results, the drug-likeness of molecules has been predicted to propose in vivo potential.

The medical fraternity recommends a vaccine as one of the best solutions to save the universe. However, to be effective, the population should reflect an encouraging attitude to accept it. The study aimed to measure vaccine acceptability and reason for hesitancy among the public. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight hundred and forty one adults visiting a tertiary care hospital responded to a pretested validated questionnaire on vaccine acceptability and hesitancy. The Chi-square test and independent t-test, followed by multinomial logistic regression, were used to analyze the findings. RESULTS: Overall, 53.4% (n = 445) of participants interested to take vaccine, 27.2% (n = 229) were not sure, and the remaining 19.4% (n = 163) did not intent to vaccinate.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 61 years-old woman underwent percutaneous coronary intervention(PTCA) after ST elevation myocardial infarction(STEMI). In the first day after PTCA epigastric abdominal disconfort was reported, and new PTCA excluded early complication. During hospitalization, due to anemization and hypotension CT scan was performed which revealed ASR with large hemoperitoneum. Emergency surgical splenectomy was performed. Postoperative course was uneventful and patient started 90 mg Ticageclor twice daily in the first post-operative day(POD) plus low molecular weight Heparin and restarted dual antiplatelet therapy(DAPT) the seventh POD. During follow up, patient underwent to assessment of platelet function showing normal level of DAPT inhibition. Due to the lack of pathological aggregation activity, DAPT was maintained. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: ASR is mainly linked to oncological, malformative, inflammatory and thromboembolic conditions. Despite anticoagulant and anti-aggregating drug-related ASR has been already described, we report the first case of drug-related ASR as immediate complication of PTCA due to DAPT. After surgery, careful anti-aggregating management was required to balance in stent restenosis and hemorragic risk. Assessment of platelet activity was performed to design a tailored anti-aggregating therapy. CONCLUSION: Drug-related ASR is dangerous complication due to the high mortality rate and misleading symptoms.

Using this approach, the connections between spatial locations and domains of scientific activity were analysed. The results show that the mobility flow at UPWr rose significantly after the authorities of the university decided to increase the funding for STA, and eventually was slowed down by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the findings in the geographical aspect show that there were two main regions of destination, which were the Iberian Peninsula and the closest neighbouring countries, where the predominant institutions could be observed.

We show that intra-host evolution in chronic human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) infection in immunocompromised individuals elicited mutations that favor viral entry and persistence, suggesting that similar processes may operate across enveloped respiratory viruses. We profiled longitudinal HPIV3 infections from two immunocompromised individuals that persisted for 278 and 98 days. Mutations accrued in the HPIV3 attachment protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), including the first in vivo mutation in HN's receptor binding site responsible for activating the viral fusion process. Fixation of this mutation was associated with exposure to a drug that cleaves host cell sialic acid moieties. Longitudinal adaptation of HN was associated with features that promote viral entry and persistence in cells, including greater avidity for sialic acid and more active fusion activity in vitro, but not with antibody escape. Long term infection thus led to mutations promoting viral persistence, suggesting that host-directed therapeutics may support the evolution of viruses that alter their biophysical characteristics to persist in the face of these agents in vivo.","output":"Human parainfluenza virus evolution during lung infection of immunocompromised humans promotes viral persistence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structure predictions suggest a partial conservation of RNA structure elements in coronavirus terminal genome regions.

Epilepsy emergencies (serial seizures or status epilepticus) were reported in 24.1 % of patients, for which non-compliance was the commonest cause, followed by deferral of epilepsy surgery for patients with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE). Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that use of anxiolytic medications, non-compliance, keeping patients with DRE on dual anti-seizure medications (ASMs), or adding third medication increased the odds of increased seizure frequency by 2.7, 3.5, 16.6 and 6.1 times, respectively. CONCLUSION: Some COVID-19 related issues had influenced the risk of seizure worsening including postponing epilepsy surgery for patients with DRE, non-compliance, and psychiatric comorbidities. Special attention should be paid to these issues to mitigate the risk of SUDEP.","output":"Risk estimation of SUDEP during COVID-19 pandemic era in a tertiary referral center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Although the etiology of MS is unknown, genetic and environmental factors play a role. Infectious pathogens are the likely environmental factors involved in the development of MS. Pathogens associated with the development or exacerbation of MS include bacteria, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae, the Staphylococcus aureus-produced enterotoxins that function as superantigens, viruses of the herpes virus (Epstein-Barr virus and human herpesvirus 6) and human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) families and the protozoa Acanthamoeba castellanii. Evidence, from studies with humans and animal models, supporting the association of these various pathogens with the development and/or exacerbation of MS will be discussed along with the potential mechanisms including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading and bystander activation. In contrast, infection with certain parasites such as helminthes (Schistosoma mansoni, Fasciola hepatica, Hymenolepis nana, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercolaris, Enterobius vermicularis) appears to protect against the development or exacerbation of MS. Evidence supporting the ability of parasitic infections to protect against disease will be discussed along with a brief summary of a recent Phase I clinical trial testing the ability of Trichuris suis ova treatment to improve the clinical course of MS. A complex interaction between the CNS (including the blood-brain barrier), multiple infections with various infectious agents (occurring in the periphery or within the CNS), and the immune response to those various infections may have to be deciphered before the etiology of MS can be fully understood.","output":"Role of pathogens in multiple sclerosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SMEs are the backbone of most global economies providing around two-thirds of the total employment.

Recycling carbon tax revenues to lower corporate income tax rates encourages investments, allowing plants to emit less per unit of output. Using detailed confidential plant-level data, we evaluate this theoretical prediction by exploiting the treatment intensity through plants emission intensity. We find that the carbon tax lowers emissions by 4 percent. Furthermore, we find that the policy had a positive output effect and negative emission intensity effect, suggesting that the carbon tax encouraged plants to produce more with less energy.

The changes of cathepsin B and cathepsin L activities, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), protein oxidation (total sulfhydryl and carbonyl contents), and chemical interactions (nonspecific association, ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfides) of myofibrillar protein and gels, as well as the gel strength and WHC of two groups under 0-100 mM H2O2, were measured. The results indicated that mild oxidation (10 mM H2O2) made a better gel strength and WHC. Cathepsin B and L activities decreased with increasing H2O2 concentrations but their effects on myofibrillar protein degradation still existed during 0.1-50 mM H2O2, which was expressed by higher carbonyl contents and ionic bonds at 0.1 and 50 mM H2O2, higher total sulfhydryl contents at 0 mM H2O2, and a lower intensity of MHC and actin of the control group than the E64 group. Besides more protein degradation, cathepsin proteolysis also resulted in lower gel strength and WHC in control gels than E64 gels under mild oxidation, which could be explained by lower hydrophobic interaction and moderate disulfides bonds between gel protein molecules of control gels.","output":"Effects of Cathepsins on Gel Strength and Water-Holding Capacity of Myofibrillar Protein Gels from Bighead Carp (Aristichthys nobilis) under a Hydroxyl Radical-Generation Oxidizing System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on many aspects of daily life.

Methods Patients with history of pediatric transplantation (age 18 years), re-transplantation, multi-organ transplantation, or pre-existing diabetes mellitus were excluded. A total of 1,919 non-diabetic adult patients who underwent a primary LT between May 2014 and December 2017 were included. Risk factors were identified using Cox regression analysis. Results NODAT occurred in 19.7% (n=377) of adult liver transplant recipients. Multivariate analysis showed steroid use, increased age, and high body mass index (BMI) in recipients, and implantation of a left-side liver graft was closely associated with NODAT in adult LT. In living donor liver transplant (LDLT) patients (n=1,473), open donor hepatectomy in the living donors, steroid use, small for size liver graft (graft to recipient weight ratio 0.8), increased age, and high BMI in the recipient were predictive factors for NODAT. The use of antimetabolite and basiliximab induction reduced the incidence of NODAT in adult LT and in adult LDLT. Conclusions Basiliximab induction, early steroid withdrawal, and antimetabolite therapy may prevent NODAT after adult LT.

They request access to information about and seek to communicate with the donor. However, some countries mandate donor anonymity. Other countries allow donor-conceived persons to access donor information, but they can only use this access if their parents have disclosed donor conception to them. We investigated a thorny issue of donor conception: whether donor conception should be shifted from an anonymous basis to a non-anonymous basis. METHODS: We review the issues and concerns regarding donor conception. We then consider the impact of direct-to-consumer genetic testing on donor conception, as well as the influence of donor conception on offspring's identity and the potential of different types of donors. To discuss the future policy of donor conception, the policies on the anonymity of gamete donors were investigated using publicly-available documents in 15 countries. RESULTS: The aim of mandating donor anonymity is to protect the privacy of the donor and intended parents. However, the diffusion of direct-to-consumer genetic testing may make it impossible to maintain anonymity. Birth via donor conception shapes the offspring's identity, and the donor may further influence the development of offspring's identity through communications. It remains important to disclose donor conception to donor-conceived offspring and to provide them with donor information. However, that information might be insufficient for some donor-conceived persons. Here are benefits to having open-identity donors and known donors. Such donors can make an agreement with the parents regarding future communication with the offspring, although both sides should respect privacy. Subsequent counseling for all parties involved can result in better tripartite communication agreements. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, ethical and practical issues that complicate donor anonymity are driving a shift to non-anonymous donor conception, in which all parties come to a communication agreement. To pave the way for such a donor conception system, transitional measures can be put into place. For countries that already adopted non-anonymous donor conception, ensuring the communication agreements is important to protect the rights of parents, donor, and offspring.","output":"Shifting to a model of donor conception that entails a communication agreement among the parents, donor, and offspring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background\\": Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with hypercoagulability and a high rate of thrombosis.

Ten days prior to admission, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with dexamethasone, which led to rapid clinical improvement. After resuscitation, coronary angiography revealed an acute thrombotic occlusion in the two previous drug-eluting stents (implanted in 2010 and 2018), with a high thrombus burden. He was successfully treated by percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient did not present any further complications during his hospital stay and was transferred to a cardiac rehabilitation centre.

However, it is unclear whether the additional procedures influence overall clinical outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our posttrapeziectomy suture suspensionplasty technique, performed using the abductor pollicis longus and flexor carpi radialis tendons, in patients with advanced thumb CMC arthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated 36 thumbs of 35 patients with advanced thumb CMC arthritis treated with combined operative excision of trapezium followed by a suture suspensionplasty using flexor carpi radialis and abductor pollicis longus tendons. We used a minimal volar approach to create a sling construct with a nonabsorbable suture material, which could support the thumb metacarpal base without pin fixation or tendon transfer. For radiographic evaluation, we used the ratio of the radial metacarpal subluxation to metacarpal articular width, estimated from the bilateral stress-view radiographic images of the thumb, and calculated the trapezial space ratio by dividing the trapezial space height by the proximal phalangeal length. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the visual analog scale and disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand scores, along with evaluation of the improvement in both postoperative range of motion and strength recovery. RESULTS The mean duration of follow-up was 26 months (range, 18-60 months). The average visual analog scale and disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand scores decreased from 5.9 to 0.4 and from 51.6 to 27.0, respectively. The range of motion during palmar abduction and opposition of the metacarpophalangeal joint improved with an increase in mean value from 49.1 degrees to 54.1 degrees, and from 7.8 to 9.3 Kapandji score, respectively. The grip and key pinch strengths showed no significant changes from mean preoperative values of 13.3 kg and 3.8 kg to 13.2 kg and 3.2 kg, respectively, as measured at the 18-month follow-up.

However, these data (e.g., computed tomography (CT) scan images, viral/molecular test results) that can be expensive to produce and/or not easily accessible. For instance, partially due to privacy concerns and other factors, the volume of available disease data can be limited.

Moreover, the system also provides users (e.g., healthcare providers) with predictions on hospitalization status and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. This provides healthcare administrators and staff with a good estimate on the demand for healthcare support.

However, to date, no research has fully explored these behavioral risks or the consequences. Methods: Two thousand and ninety home-confined students from two Chinese high schools participated in an online-based questionnaire battery that assessed their sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related exposures, daytime sleepiness, problematic smartphone use, and PTSD.

Results: The problematic smartphone use, daytime sleepiness and PTSD prevalence were respectively 16.4%, 20.2% and 6.9%. The number of COVID-19 related exposure was directly associated with problematic smartphone use and PTSD symptoms. Problematic smartphone use was found to be a mediator between COVID-19 related exposure and PTSD symptoms, and daytime sleepiness was found to partially mediate the associations between problematic smartphone use and PTSD. Conclusions: The more exposure associated with the pandemic, the more psychological and behavioral problems the adolescents had.

Biological targets have multiple peculiarities that add to the challenges of the SERS biosensing. In regards to the direct non-labeled sensing of bacteria, it was discovered that all bands in the registered SER spectra were generated by metabolites released from bacterial cells. It undermined the prior notion of non-labeled detection and identification of bacteria based on the presumed spectra of cellular walls. However, it also provides new opportunities for the SERS analysis of bacteria. The SERS measurements of viruses can be performed with SERS-active surfaces or colloidal solutions of silver nanoparticles. However, the use of surfaces requires extensive sample preparation and often lacks sensitivity, while colloidal SERS substrates have another problemmost types of silver nanoparticles are negatively charged and have a poor interaction with likewise predominantly negatively charged virions. Thus, a challenge is posed to develop SERS-ready positively charged silver nanoparticles or use other methods to enforce the non-specific binding of viruses to the silver surfaces. Meanwhile, SER spectra of proteins are nearly impossible to acquire at adequate sensitivity. Thus, non-direct measurements are the only way. SERS provides the most benefits when working with relatively small molecules, so small molecules serving as Raman probes can be used as an intermediary to produce SER spectra. For enzymes like butyrylcholinesterase, it means measuring SER spectra of substrates and products of the relevant reaction, while for other proteins, specialized techniques must be developed. It can be concluded that biological targets require a case-by-case approach.

The aim of this study was to compare Acute Care Surgery activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and during a control period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed including patients who underwent Acute Care Surgery in three tertiary care hospitals in Spain during a control (11th March 2019 to 21st April 2019) and a pandemic (16th March 2020 to 26th April 2020) period. Type of surgical procedures, patients' features and postoperative complications were compared. RESULTS: two hundred and eighty-five and 117 patients were included in each group. Mean number of patients who underwent Acute Care Surgery during the control and pandemic periods was 2.3 and 0.9 patients per day and hospital (p < 0.001), representing a 58.9% decrease in Acute Care Surgery activity. Time from symptoms onset to patient arrival at the Emergency Department was longer during the pandemic (44.6 vs. 71.0 h, p < 0.001). Surgeries due to acute cholecystitis and complications from previous elective procedures decreased (26.7% vs. 9.4%) during the pandemic, while bowel obstructions and abdominal wall hernia surgeries increased (12.3% vs. 22.2%) (p = 0.001). Morbidity was higher during pandemic period (34.7% vs. 47.1%, p = 0.022), although this difference was not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis. Reoperation rate (17.9% vs. 12.8%, p = 0.212) and mortality (6.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.358) were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: during the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant reduction in the performance of Acute Care Surgery procedures was observed. Moreso, a longer time from symptoms onset to patient arrival at the Emergency Department was noted. Higher morbidity was observed in patients undergoing Acute Care Surgery during the pandemic period, although there was not any difference in mortality or reoperation rate.","output":"Acute Care Surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: Changes in volume, causes and complications.

Methods: Data of reported NCP cases and Baidu Migration Indexin all provinces of the country as of February 14, 2020 were collected. The correlation analysis between cumulative number of reported cases and the migration index from Hubei was performed, and the imported risks from Hubei to different provinces across China were further evaluated. Results: A total of 49 970 confirmed cases were reported nationwide, of which 37 884 were in Hubei Province. The average daily migration index from Hubei to other provinces was 312.09, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei were 117.95 and 194.16, respectively. The cumulative NCP cases of provinces was positively correlated with the migration index derived from Hubei province, also in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei, with correlation coefficients of 0.84, 0.84, and 0.81. In linear model, population migration from Hubei Province, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei account for 71.2%, 70.1%, and 66.3% of the variation, respectively. The period of high exported risk from Hubei occurred before January 27, of which the risks before January 23 mainly came from Wuhan, and then mainly from other cities in Hubei. Hunan Province, Henan Province and Guangdong Province ranked the top three in terms of cumulative imported risk (the cumulative risk indices were 58.61, 54.75 and 49.62 respectively). Conclusion: The epidemic in each province was mainly caused by the importation of Hubei Province.

Two combinations of these antigens (38 and Enol; all SSU antigens designated as SSU1 and SSU2) were engineered to mediate production of BPs coated with either antigens 38 and Enol or SSU1 and SSU2 inside recombinant Escherichia coli. The isolated and purified empty BPs, 38-BP-Enol and SSU1-BP-SSU2, showed size ranges of 312C428 nm and 292C344 nm with and without the QuilA(?) adjuvant, respectively, and all showed a negative surface charge. Further characterization of purified BPs confirmed the presence of the expected antigen-comprising fusion proteins as assessed by tryptic peptide fingerprinting analysis using quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and immunoblotting. Vaccination with 38-BP-Enol and SSU1-BP-SSU2 formulated with and without QuilA(?) adjuvant induced significant antigen-specific humoral immune responses in mice. Antigen-coated BPs induced significant and specific Ig (IgM + IgG) and IgG immune responses (1.0  10(6)C1.0  10(7)) when compared with mice vaccinated with empty BPs. Functionality of the immune response was confirmed in challenge experiments using an acute murine S. suis infection model, which showed 100% survival of the 38-BP-Enol and SSU1-BP-SSU2 vaccinated mice compared to 70% survival when vaccinated with empty BPs.

Patients were included if they had 1 visit and 1 medication in their record between January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2017. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the association between continuous and categorized medication risk score with all-cause mortality. Among 427,103 patients, the median age was 50 years (interquartile range, 29C64 years); 61% were female; 50% were White, 11% were Black, and 38% were Hispanic; and 6873 had a death date recorded. Patients 30 to 49 years old had the highest hazard ratios (HRs), followed by the 50- to 64-year-olds and lastly those 65 years or older. Controlling for all covariates, 30- to 49-year-olds with a score of 20 to 30 (versus <10) had a 604% increase in the hazard of death (HR, 7.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.86C12.85), 50- to 64-year-olds had a 254% increase (HR, 3.54; 95% CI, 2.71C4.63), and 65-year-olds had an 87% increase (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.67C2.09).

We propose that DNA damage induced-apoptosis accelerates viral release, triggered by depletion of host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) from nuclear RNA bound to replicating viral sequences. Methods: Information theory-based analysis of interactions between RBPs and individual sequences in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Influenza A (H3N2), HIV-1, and Dengue genomes identifies strong RBP binding sites in these viral genomes. Replication and expression of viral sequences is expected to increasingly sequester RBPs - SRSF1 and RNPS1. Ordinarily, RBPs bound to nascent host transcripts prevents their annealing to complementary DNA. Their depletion induces destabilizing R-loops. Chromosomal breakage occurs when an excess of unresolved R-loops collide with incoming replication forks, overwhelming the DNA repair machinery. We estimated stoichiometry of inhibition of RBPs in host nuclear RNA by counting competing binding sites in replicating viral genomes and host RNA. Results: Host RBP binding sites are frequent and conserved among different strains of RNA viral genomes. Similar binding motifs of SRSF1 and RNPS1 explain why DNA damage resulting from SRSF1 depletion is complemented by expression of RNPS1. Clustering of strong RBP binding sites coincides with the distribution of RNA-DNA hybridization sites across the genome. SARS-CoV-2 replication is estimated to require 32.5-41.8 hours to effectively compete for binding of an equal proportion of SRSF1 binding sites in host encoded nuclear RNAs. Significant changes in expression of transcripts encoding DNA repair and apoptotic proteins were found in an analysis of influenza A and Dengue-infected cells in some individuals. Conclusions: R-loop-induced apoptosis indirectly resulting from viral replication could release significant quantities of membrane-associated virions into neighboring alveoli. These could infect adjacent pneumocytes and other tissues, rapidly compromising lung function, causing multiorgan system failure and other described symptoms.","output":"A proposed molecular mechanism for pathogenesis of severe RNA-viral pulmonary infections [version 2;peer review: 4 approved] (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 has put an enormous pressure on health systems around the world.

The necessity of a proper selection of the root material and its surface sterilization prior to mycobiont isolation is stressed, together with the need of including suitable control treatments in inoculation experiments. The culture-dependent approach employing plating of single short (~ 2 mm) hair root segments on nutrient media is substantiated as a useful tool for characterization of Ericaceae root-associated fungal communities; it targets living mycelium and provides metabolically active cultures that can be used in physiological experiments and taxonomic studies, thus providing essential reference material for culture-independent approaches. On the other hand, it is stressed that not every mycobiont isolated from an ericoid hair root necessarily represent an ErM fungus. Likewise, not every intracellular hyphal coil formed in the Ericaceae rhizodermis necessarily represents the ErM symbiosis. Taxonomy of the most important ericoid mycobionts is updated, mutualism in the ErM symbiosis is briefly discussed from the mycobiont perspective, and some interesting lines of possible future research are highlighted.","output":"Ericoid mycorrhizal symbiosis: theoretical background and methods for its comprehensive investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various comorbidities represent risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is the ideal approach to achieving herd immunity. However, reaching herd immunity through vaccination has several challenges such as certain groups? objection to vaccines due to religious objections, fears regarding possible risks or skepticism about the benefits. This objection and skepticism is of great concern to the current COVID-19 vaccination campaign. If the proportion of vaccinated people in a community falls below the herd immunity threshold, exposure to contagious SARS-CoV-2 could result in a new surge of of COVID-19.

METHODS: The survey was conducted through the Chinese Medical Network for Neuroinflammation. Patients in 10 MS centers from 8 cities including Wuhan were included. Information about MS and NMOSD disease duration and the usage of DMDs were collected. Data of suspected cases of COVID-19 were obtained from hospital visits, questionnaires, and patient self-reporting. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was confirmed through clinical evaluation by a panel of experts in conjunction with chest CT and viral RNA detection. RESULTS: Eight hundred eighty-two of 1,804 (48.89%) patients with MS and 2,129 of 3,060 (69.58%) patients with NMOSD were receiving DMDs.

Compared with the normal group, the detection rates of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) were significantly higher in the thrombocytosis group (P = 0.017 and 0.042, respectively). HRV single infection was a risk factor associated with thrombocytosis [odds ratio (OR) = 1.560, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.108C2.197]. Furthermore, ST was more likely to occur in younger patients who had clinical manifestations of wheezing and dyspnea and who had been diagnosed with bronchiolitis. Furthermore, the course of disease lasted longer in these patients. ST is associated with viral respiratory tract infections, especially RSV and HRV infections. HRV single infection is a risk factor associated with thrombocytosis.","output":"Association between secondary thrombocytosis and viral respiratory tract infections in children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present paper intends to provide an overview and a critical assessment of the administrative simplification policies implemented in Portugal over the past 20+ years. Throughout these decades, the major instruments for administrative simplification have been: (i) Decree-Law n. 135/99, of 22 April;(ii) the Simplex programme;(iii) the 2015 new Code of Administrative Procedure and its 2021 amendment;and (iv) the COVID-19 legislation. Although Decree-Law n. 135/99 (i) was the first attempt to specifically address simplification, it was a very thin one. The Simplex programme (ii), created in 2006, was the first cross-sectoral robust policy of simplification;its motto is the simpler the betterand it encompassed reforms in all government areas aiming at cutting red tape, promoting administrative efficiency, and making the citizensand the corporationslives easier when dealing with State. The new Code of Administrative Procedure (iii), approved in 2015, brought about specific normative solutions to simplify procedures, namely, prior communications, administrative assistance, procedural conferences, and the electronic one-stop shop. Finally, the COVID-19 legislation (iv) was made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic and by the fact that public health restrictions made it impossible for citizens to establish personal contact with the administration in many cases.","output":"The Simplification of Procedures in Portuguese Administrative Law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The existing finite natural resources have witnessed unsustainable usage in the past few years, especially for food production, with accompanying environmental devastation and ecosystem damage. Regrettably, the global population and consumption demands are increasing ceaselessly, leading to the need for more resources for food production, which could potentially aggravate the sustainability and ecosystem degradation issues, while stimulating drastic climate change. Meanwhile, the unexpected emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and some implemented measures to combat its spread disrupted agricultural activities and the food supply chain, which also led to a reduction in ecosystem carbonization. This study sets out to explore policy framework and selected feasible actions that are being adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could potentially reduce the emissions even after the pandemic to promote a resilient and sustainable agri-food system. In this study, we reviewed 27 articles that focus on the current state of the agri-food system in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the decarbonization of the agroecosystem. This review has taken the form of a systematic methodology in analyzing the adoption and implementation of various measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 on the impact of the agri-food system and reduction in ecosystem degradation. Up to 0.3 Mt of CO 2 reduction from the agri-food system alone was reportedly achieved during the first 6 months of the pandemic in 23 European countries. The various adopted measures indicate that the circular economy approach is a panacea to achieve the needed sustainability in the agri-food system. Also, it dictates a need for a paradigm change towards improvement on localized food production that promotes sustainable production and consumption. ? The recent emergence of the agro-food system nexus as impacted by COVID-19 is reviewed. ? Feasible adoption of COVID-19 measures for agroecosystem decarbonization is explored. ? The gaps and constraints in the adoption of the CE approach to the agro-food systems were uncovered. ? Circular economy in agroecosystems a panacea to sustainable agri-food system.

Due to the unbounded global spread of the disease, having biosensors with high performance such as high sensitivity and accuracy is of utmost importance. In this paper, the effects of various parameters on the behaviors of micro-biosensors are investigated in order to enhance their performance. These parameters are related to the geometry and material, and they are assumed to be gradually changing in the longitudinal direction of the biosensor according to a power law. Therefore, they are called functionally graded geometrical and material parameters. Another aspect is when considering microcantilever-based biosensors, the main behavior parameter is the deflection at the free end. In the analyses, the influences of the surface stress and van der Waals intermolecular forces are taken into account. Also, the total energy of the beam, which is the combination of the van der Waals energy and the elastic strain energy, is accomplished. In addition, the equivalent force causing the deflection is also evaluated using Castigliano method for two cases. These cases account for a concentrated force at the free end and a distributed load along the biosensor, respectively. Since the governing equations account for the size dependency and the considered parameters are functions of the position, the solution is too complex to be achieved analytically, and therefore, numerical methods are applied. For uniform biosensors made of homogeneous materials, or in other words when all parameters are not varying with the position, the obtained results are compared with those in the literature, and good agreement is obtained. On the other hand, the performance, which include sensitivity and limit of detection, of functionally graded biosensors can be enhanced by proper choices of the considered parameters and the corresponding exponent of the gradation function.","output":"Enhancing the performance of micro-biosensors by functionally graded geometrical and material parameters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Patients with suspected COVID-19 might be admitted to hospital. We aimed to describe the characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative probable COVID-19 patients and give some suggestions to manage suspected COVID-19 patients. Methods We analyzed 616 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 35 SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative probable COVID-19 patients who were admitted in Wuhan Union Hospital from February 13, 2020 to February 16, 2020. Telephone interviews were conducted and medical records were reviewed for epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiographic data. Results Of the 35 SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative probable COVID-19 patients, all of them had tested at least 3 times of nucleic acid, 3 were believed to be non-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with confirmed patients, antibody negative probable patients were younger (P=0.017), exhibited similar symptoms and chest CT images, had higher lymphocyte count (P=0.004) and albumin level (P<0.001), showed lower lactate dehydrogenase level (P=0.011) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P<0.001). During hospitalization, all the 35 patients had contacted with confirmed COVID-19 patients, but all used general face mask for protection and maintained a social distance of more than one meter from each other. All the isolation wards were kept ventilation and disinfected once a day. After discharged from hospital, all of them had negative nucleic acid tests and no one developed symptoms again. Conclusions The conditions of patients with AbN probable COVID-19 were less critical than those of patients with confirmed COVID-19. Room ventilation and daily disinfection, wearing face masks, and maintaining social distance might be helpful to prevent patients from hospital acquired COVID-19 infection.","output":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics in patients with SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative probable COVID-19 in Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a number of international cruise ships were infected, thereby resulting in serious public health and human rights problems Multiple difficulties were encountered in the prevention and control of the coronavirus disease onboard ships, while rule-based international cooperation in this regard appeared inefficient and ineffective By applying interdisciplinary methodologies, including empirical research of law, policy science, and health studies, this research reviewed the legal difficulties in the prevention and control of COVID-19 on international cruise ships and sought solutions from a policy-making and strategic perspective We found that, apart from the inherent nature of cruise ships such as crowded semi-enclosed areas, shared sanitary facilities and limited medical resources, there are also nonnegligible legal reasons affecting the effectiveness of containment measures on board In particular, there is ambiguity and even inconsistency of relevant international norms and domestic regulations, and some of the key rules are neither mandatory nor enforceable We conclude by suggesting that rule-based international cooperation on this issue must be strengthened with respect to information sharing and management, a more effective supervisory mechanism, clarification of key rules over jurisdiction and distributions of obligations among the port states, flag states, nationality states, and cruise ship companies","output":"Prevention and Control of COVID-19 Pandemic on International Cruise Ships: The Legal Controversies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Recent worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a current, ongoing life-threatening crisis and international public health emergency. The early diagnosis and management of the disease remains a major challenge. In this review, we aim to summarize the updated epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A broad search of the literature was performed in PubMedMedlineWeb of knowledge, and Google ScholarWorld Health Organization-WHOusing the keywords severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, COVID-19, SARS, SARS-CoV-2EpidemiologyTransmissionPathogenesisClinical Characteristics. We reviewed and documented the information obtained from literature on epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical appearances of SARS-CoV-2 infection.RESULTS: The global cases of COVID-19 as of April 2, 2020 have risen to more than 900,000 and morbidity has reached more than 47,000. The incidence rate for COVID-19 has been predicted to be higher than the previous outbreaks of other coronavirus family members, including those of SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The main clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic stages to severe lower respiratory infection in the form of pneumonia. Most of the patients also presented with fever, cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, myalgia and breathlessness.Individuals at higher risk for severe illness include elderly people and patients with a weakened immune system or that are suffering from a underlying chronic medical condition like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, respiratory illness or cardiovascular diseases.CONCLUSIONS: SARS-Cov-2 has emerged as a worldwide threat, currently affecting 170 countries and territories across the globe. There is still much to be understood regarding SARS-CoV-2 about its virology, epidemiology and clinical management strategies;this knowledge will be essential to both manage the current pandemic and to conceive comprehensive measures to prevent such outbreaks in the future.","output":"COVID-19: A Conundrum to Decipher"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is primarily diagnosed through viral RNA positivity in nasopharyngeal swabs, and it is associated with the early detection of specific immunoglobulins to SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

Conversely, a sedentary lifestyleassociated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disordersnegatively impacts on general health status, including susceptibility to infections. At a time of a pandemic SARS-CoV2 infection, and in the context of the multiorgan crosstalk (widely accepted as a mechanism participating in the pathophysiology of all organs and systems), we examine the complex interplay mediated by skeletal muscle contraction involving the immune system and how this contributes to control health status and to counteract viral infections. In so doing, we review the molecular mechanisms and expression of molecules modulated by PA, able to provide the proper molecular equipment against viral infections such as the current SARS-CoV2. METHODS: A critical review of the literature was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and mediators induced by PA that potentially impact on viral infections such as SARS-CoV2. RESULTS: We showed the effects mediated by regular moderate PA on viral adverse effects through the regulation of biological processes involving the crosstalk between skeletal muscle, the immune system and adipose tissue. Evidence was provided of the effects mediated by modulation of the expression of inflammation markers. CONCLUSION: A tigth association between PA and reduction in inflammation status allows effective counteracting of SARS-CoV2 infection.

The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access. ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.","output":"Planning and provision of ECMO services for severe ARDS during the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the health of children worldwide.

Therefore, the research model extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology with the task technology fit model, awareness and self-efficacy to determine user intention to adopt wireless sensor network application for medical assistance. A research survey was conducted towards Saudi citizens in voluntary setting. In response, 348 valid responses were retrieved. Sample size was computed with prior-power analysis using G-power software. The research model is empirically tested with latest statistical approach namely structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings of the structural model indicate that wireless sensor network application was jointly predicted by performance expectancy, social influence, effort expectancy, facilitating condition, task technology fit, awareness and self-efficacy and explained substantial variance R2 79.5% in individual behavior to adopt wireless sensor network application. The effect size analysis (f2) revealed that task technology fit and facilitating condition were the most important factors to determine user intention to adopt wireless sensor network application.

This may warrant determining whether cases of unintentional ocular exposure are increasing, especially in children. Objective: To describe the epidemiologic trend of pediatric eye exposures to ABHS and to report the severity of the ocular lesions. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective case series conducted from April 1, 2020, to August 24, 2020. Cases were retrieved from the national database of the French Poison Control Centers (PCC) and from a pediatric ophthalmology referral hospital in Paris, France. Cases of ocular exposure to chemical agents in children younger than 18 years during the study period were reviewed. Cases of ABHS exposure were included. Exposures: The following data were collected: age, sex, circumstances of exposure, symptoms, size of the epithelial defect at first examination, time between the incident and re-epithelialization, and medical and/or surgical management. Main Outcomes and Measures: Comparison of the number of eye exposures to ABHS in children between April to August 2020 and April to August 2019. Results: Between April 1 and August 24, 2020, there were 7 times more pediatric cases of ABHS eye exposures reported in the PCC database compared with the same period in 2019 (9.9% of pediatric eye exposures in 2020 vs 1.3% in 2019; difference, 8.6%; 95% CI, 7.4-9.9; P < .001). The number of cases occurring in public places increased in 2020 (from 16.4% in May to 52.4% in August). Similarly, admissions to the eye hospital for ABHS exposure increased at the same period (16 children in 2020 including 10 boys; mean [SD] age, 3.5 [1.4] years vs 1 boy aged 16 months in 2019). Eight of them presented with a corneal and/or conjunctival ulcer, involving more than 50% of the corneal surface for 6 of them. Two cases required amniotic membrane transplant. Conclusions and Relevance: These data support the likelihood of an increasing number of unintentional ocular exposures to ABHS in the pediatric population. To maintain good public compliance with hand disinfection, these findings support that health authorities should ensure the safe use of these devices and warn the parents and caregivers about their potential danger for children.","output":"Pediatric Eye Injuries by Hydroalcoholic Gel in the Context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The threat to the public health of the United States from the COVID-19 pandemic is causing rapid, unprecedented shifts in the health care landscape.

First, we partnered to reach underserved populations with the academic center's newly developed COVID test. Second, we developed and distributed evidence-based resources to these same communities via a large community health navigator team. Third, as telemedicine became the norm for medical consultation, the 2 institutions began to research how reducing the digital divide could help improve access to care.

Using PM(2.5) observations and the ERA5 reanalysis, the evolution of the air quality in BTH during the January 2021 sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) is explored. The subseasonal variability of the PM(2.5) concentration after the SSW onset is evidently enhanced. Stratospheric circumpolar easterly anomalies lasted for 53 days during the JanuaryCFebruary 2021 SSW with two evident stratospheric pulses arriving at the ground. During the tropospheric wave weakening period and the intermittent period of dormant stratospheric pulses, the East Asian winter monsoon weakened, anomalous temperature inversion developed in the lower troposphere, anomalous surface southerlies prevailed, atmospheric moisture increased, and the boundary layer top height lowered, all of which favor the accumulation of pollutant particulates, leading to two periods of pollution processes in the BTH region. In the phase of strengthened East Asian winter monsoon around the very beginning of the SSW and another two periods when stratospheric pulses had reached the near surface, opposite-signed circulation patterns and meteorological conditions were observed, which helped to dilute and diffuse air pollutants in the BTH region. As a result, the air quality was excellent during the two periods when the stratospheric pulse had reached the near surface. The increased subseasonal variation of the regional pollutant particulates after the SSW onset highlights the important role of the stratosphere in the regional environment and provides implications for the environmental prediction.","output":"Observational Subseasonal Variability of the PM(2.5) Concentration in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Area during the January 2021 Sudden Stratospheric Warming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), early reports indicated that certain groups of patients were at risk of developing severe COVID-19 infections. This included patients with arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases [1]. Many of those patients were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme 1 inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). SARS-CoV2- utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a membrane receptor to enter target cells [2]. Due to different chemical structures with ACE1, ACE2 is insensitive to ACEIs. ACEIs and ARBs may increase the amount of ACE-2 formation and, theoretically, increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, thus inducing inflammation [2]. The fear that ACEI or ARB might facilitate COVID-19 infections and increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection emerged [3]. The question is all the more delicate as arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are very common in the general population, especially in the elderly, for which ACEIs/ARBs are prescribed in 25-30% of cases [4]. In response, many scientific organizations and journals issued statements cautioning against discontinuation of these agents due to the lack of evidence of harm, and because discontinuation would predictably lead to uncontrolled blood pressure with its own cardiovascular disease risks. Moreover, direct evidence from COVID-19-infected patients, taking or not taking these agents, and on which reliable recommendations could be based, was not yet available.","output":"Outcome of patients hospitalized for Covid-19 and exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers in France: Results of the ACECoV study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is profoundly affecting almost all aspects of economic and social life globally.

An observational survey study, Real-World Tele-Health Evaluation of Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) Symptoms Communication/Observation Procedure Evaluation in Outpatient Clinical Settings (TeleSCOPE), was conducted to better understand how this shift affected the evaluation of drug-induced movement disorders (DIMDs), including TD. METHODS: Twenty-minute online quantitative surveys were conducted with neurology and psychiatry specialists (physicians and advanced practice providers) who met the following criteria: >=3 years of practice with >=70% of time spent in a clinic;prescribed a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor or benztropine for DIMD at least once in the past 6 months;and conducted telehealth visits with >=15% of their patients from December 2020 to January 2021. RESULTS: Respondents included 277 clinicians (neurology = 109, psychiatry = 168). Telehealth visits increased after COVID-19, with significantly greater increases in psychiatry vs neurology: phone (38% vs 21%);video (49% vs 42%). Across both specialties, top drivers/prompts for further DIMD evaluation were as follows: mention of tics or movements by family members or others (86%);trouble with gait, falls, walking, or standing (82%);difficulty swallowing or eating (74%);and difficulty writing, using phone, computer (71%). However, in the 6 months prior to June 2021, virtual evaluation, diagnosis, and monitoring of patients were challenging. For both specialties, many at-risk patients (ie, taking a dopamine receptor blocking agent) were not evaluated for DIMDs via video-based visits (psychiatry = 45%, neurology = 70%) or phone-only visits (psychiatry = 76%, neurology = 91%). Clinicians listed evaluation of gait/falls/walking/standing as the most challenging aspect of virtual assessment for phone-only visits (psychiatry = 53%, neurology = 57%) and video-based visits (psychiatry = 26%, neurology = 31%). Additional challenges included limited access to computers, insufficient training for clinicians and staff, and greater difficulty obtaining reimbursements (especially for complex telehealth visits). Patients without a participating caregiver, along with lower functioning patients, were at the highest risk of a missed DIMD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth significantly reduced clinicians' ability or willingness to evaluate, diagnose, and monitor DIMDs. Clinicians stated multiple factors increased the risk of a missed or incorrect diagnosis. Challenges to optimal telehealth effectiveness included lack of patient access to computers, need for more clinician/staff training, lack of awareness of coverage, need for sufficient fee reimbursement. In-person evaluation continues to be the gold standard for assessing and treating DIMDs. However, if telehealth is necessary, the use of specific questions and directions is recommended for better communication and more accurate assessments.

In addition to SMC staff, meeting attendees included committee members (NDC, SMC), patient group representatives/advocates (PACE, SMC), pharmaceutical company representatives (SMC), and clinical experts (PACE). Results: 155 respondents completed the survey including attendees of NDC (n=47), PACE (n=15), and SMC meetings (n=93). 98% of respondents for NDC, 100% for PACE, and 89% for SMC rated their experience of attending virtually as very good or good. Most respondents found the technology easy to use (98%, 93%, and 95% respectively). Areas for improvement included: duration and comfort breaks;when to have cameras on;consistency of presentation slides;and discussion or social setting. Implementation of suggested improvements is ongoing. Reduced travel was one of the most valued aspects: What  worked well is that all interested parties could attend, without geography/travel being a potential barrier (Patient group representative/advocate). Conclusions: Across all committees, user satisfaction with virtual meetings was high and technical issues were minimal. Virtual meetings have important implications for the accessibility of HTA decision-making, beyond the pandemic.","output":"PNS67 Gaining Trust in the Use of Virtual Meetings for Health Technology Assessment during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oral lesions related to the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been increasingly described; however, clinical and epidemiological information is still scant. Although a diversity of therapeutic strategies for the management of these lesions are present in the literature, one can note a lack of standardization and doubtful effectiveness. Thus, the present study aimed to report a series of cases in which a combination of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) was used for orofacial lesions in patients suffering from COVID-19. It was noted, in all cases, a marked improvement in tissue repair and pain relief within a few days; moreover, the patients recovered their orofacial functions satisfactorily. Based on the present series of cases and having in mind the conspicuous lack of information on the different aspects of COVID-19, the protocol which combined aPDT with PMBT seemed to be effective in the management of COVID-19-related orofacial lesions.","output":"Photobiomodulation therapy and antimicrobial photodynamic therapy for orofacial lesions in patients with COVID-19: A case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Authors present 6 cases of abdominal bleeding associated with COVID-19, representing 1.35% of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients and hypothesize that there could be, although not very frequently, a relationship between SARS-CoV2 and bleeding.

From smart-working to online learning, also considering entertainment activities, people started to extensively use platforms for remote communication and for sharing video, text, and audio content. Such systems are able to cope with the need of communicating, but the common feeling is that people, and especially students, are missing the physical relationships with classmates and colleagues. In this paper, we analyse two modalities that can be used to give an online University lecture, by focusing on the sense of presence, i.e. on the ability to produce into students the psychological sense of being in a classroom together with the teacher and their classmates. We consider a standard web-conferencing system, and a Virtual Reality social platform. We also take into account the usability factors, to understand if extended reality systems could be, in a near future, a possible alternative to improve distance lectures and meetings.

The viral outbreak started in late 2019 and rapidly became a serious health threat to the global population. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Several therapeutic options have been adopted to prevent the spread of the virus. Although vaccines have been developed, antivirals are still needed to combat the infection of this virus. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, and its genome encodes polyproteins that can be processed into structural and nonstructural proteins. Maturation of viral proteins requires cleavages by proteases. Therefore, the main protease (3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or Mpro) encoded by the viral genome is an attractive drug target because it plays an important role in cleaving viral polyproteins into functional proteins. Inhibiting this enzyme is an efficient strategy to block viral replication. Structural studies provide valuable insight into the function of this protease and structural basis for rational inhibitor design. In this review, we describe structural studies on the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The strategies applied in developing inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and currently available protein inhibitors are summarized. Due to the availability of high-resolution structures, structure-guided drug design will play an important role in developing antivirals. The availability of high-resolution structures, potent peptidic inhibitors, and diverse compound scaffolds indicate the feasibility of developing potent protease inhibitors as antivirals for COVID-19.","output":"Progress in Developing Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3C-Like Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hong Kong (HK) is a densely populated city near the epicentre of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Stringent border control together with aggressive case finding, contact tracing, social distancing and quarantine measures were implemented to halt the importation and spread of the virus. METHODS: We performed an epidemiological study using government information covering the first 100 confirmed cases to examine the epidemic curve, incidence, clusters, reproduction number (Rt), incubation period and time to containment. RESULTS: A total of 93 of the 100 cases were HK residents (6 infected in Mainland China, 10 on the Diamond Princess Cruise). Seven were visitors infected in Mainland China before entering HK. The majority (76%) were aged &#8805;45 years, and the incidence increased with age (P < 0.001). Escalation of border control measures correlated with a decrease in the proportion (62.5% to 0%) of cases imported from Mainland China, and a reduction in Rt (1.07 to 0.75). The median incubation period was 4.2 days [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0-4.5; 5th and 95th percentiles: 1.3 and 14.0). Most clusters with identifiable epidemiological links were households involving 2-4 people. Three medium-spreading events were identified: two from New Year gatherings (6-11 people), and another from environmental contamination of a worship hall (12 people). Despite intensified contact tracing, containment was delayed in 78.9% of cases (mean = 5.96 days, range = 0-24 days). An unusual transmission in a multi-storey building via faulty toilet plumbing was suspected with >100 residents evacuated overnight. Our analysis indicated that faulty plumbing was unlikely to be the source of this transmission. CONCLUSION: Timely stringent containment policies minimized the importation and transmission of COVID-19 in HK.","output":"Epidemiological characteristics of the first 100 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, a city with a stringent containment policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mannan-containing products are capable of modulating immune responses in animals. However, different products may have diverse immunomodulation. The experiment was conducted to examine effects of mannan oligosaccharide (Actigen; ACT) on growth performance and serum concentrations of antibodies and inflammatory mediators in weanling pigs (Sus scrofa) experimentally infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). A total of 32 PRRSV-negative pigs (3 wk old) were randomly assigned from within blocks to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2 by 2 factorial arrangement [2 types of diet: control (0%) and ACT addition (0.04%); and with and without PRRSV] in a randomized complete block design. Pigs were blocked by initial BW within sex. Ancestry was equalized across treatments. Pigs (8/treatment) were kept individually in each pen. After 2 wk of an 8-wk period of feeding the treatments, pigs received an intranasal inoculation of PRRSV or sham medium at 5 wk of age. Infection by PRRSV decreased ADG, ADFI, and G:F throughout the experiment (P < 0.01). Actigen did not affect ADG (P = 0.450), but decreased (P = 0.047) ADFI from 28 to 42 days postinoculation (DPI). During that time, ACT improved G:F in infected pigs but not in sham controls (interaction, P = 0.009). Dietary ACT did not affect viremia in infected pigs (P > 0.05), but increased PRRSV-specific antibody titer at 35 DPI (P = 0.042). Infection with PRRSV induced the febrile responses of pigs from 3 to 10 DPI (P < 0.001) with return to normal at 14 DPI. During the experimental period, the rectal temperature of pigs was found slightly elevated by ACT (P = 0.045). Infected pigs had greater serum concentrations of IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-, IL-10, and haptoglobin (Hp) than sham controls (P < 0.001). These results indicate that PRRSV stimulated secretion of cytokines involved in innate, T-helper 1, and T-regulatory immune responses. Actigen tended to decrease the serum TNF- concentration regardless of PRRSV (P = 0.058). The ACT  PRRSV interaction was significant for IL-1 (P = 0.016), IL-12 (P = 0.026), and Hp (P = 0.047), suggesting that infected pigs fed ACT had greater serum concentrations of these mediators than those fed the control. The increases in IL-1 and IL-12 may favorably promote innate and T-cell immune functions in infected pigs fed ACT. Feeding ACT may be useful as ACT is related to increased PRRSV antibody titers and G:F in infected pigs at certain times during infection.","output":"Mannan oligosaccharide increases serum concentrations of antibodies and inflammatory mediators in weanling pigs experimentally infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus(,)(2)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel and facile post-mortem interval (PMI) biosensor was fabricated using a double-label strategy to detect the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) biomarker.

Glucose oxidase (GOx) was used as a signal label to conjugate with GAPDH. GAPDH recognition was achieved through the dissolution of the surface-attached CdSe QDs by hydrogen peroxide generated through GAPDH-conjugated GOx-catalyzed -glucose oxidation. To enhance sensitivity, a competitive interaction was introduced between free and conjugated GAPDH to the active site of the anti-GAPDH antibody. The electrochemical response due to CdSe dissolution decreased proportionally with the concentration of free GAPDH.

This is being met with large quantities of imported produce as well as venison sourced from the UK, with wild-shot deer, parkland herds and farmed deer all contributing to the supply chain. This increase in demand has resulted in an expansion of the number and size of deer farming enterprises, and consequently an opportunity for veterinary consultancy and advice to farmers. During the Covid-19 pandemic, farmed venison demand has remained stable, but there has been a significant reduction in the value of wild venison. Some of the procedures and technologies used routinely to improve fertility and reproduction in cattle and sheep farming can be transferred to deer farming;by doing so, benefits in reproductive efficiency and performance of the herd can be realised.

Based on the empirical evidence of preexisting studies, it is hypothesized that psychological burden will increase concurrent to the severity of COVID-19 experience (tested positive, hospitalized, and death) independent of the other stressors resulting from the pandemic, such as a subjective sense of uncertainty or financial burden. Data of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in EUROPE, and a European cross-national panel study were used to examine this hypothesis. Besides Chi(2) test and Spearmans rho, a logistic regression model was constructed to test the hypothesized model. The study confirms that there is significantly higher risk for psychological burden by heightened COVID-19 severity in the social environment independent of multiple also significantly influential variables depicting stressors to everyday life of older people during the pandemic. The results point to the importance of multiple factors (social, financial, health, and sociodemographic) which have significantly affected the psychological condition of the individual during the past year.

Individuals 21 to 90 years old (N = 1101, Mdn age = 30) with United States-based MTurk accounts completed a stand-alone screening survey. The screening consisted of basic demographic, substance use, and physical/mental health questions, as well as items to gauge language proficiency/attention (i.e., data quality).ResultsPoor quality data was infrequent (6.5% of participants) and associated with self-reported non-United States residence, affirmative responding (e.g., currently pregnant, using both alcohol and nicotine), and other response characteristics (e.g., not disclosing health conditions). Among those passing quality checks, alcohol and nicotine use were relatively common (71.5% and 24.8%). Major physical (6.3%) and mental health conditions (14.8%) were less common.

METHODS: Consecutive chest CT performed in the emergency department between March 1st and April 7th 2020 for COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed. The three features of pneumonia (GGO, semi-consolidation and consolidation) and the percentage of well-aerated lung were quantified using a HU threshold based software. ROC curves identified the optimal cut-off values of CT parameters to predict hypoxia worsening and hospital discharge. Multiple Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze the capability of CT quantitative features, demographic and clinical variables to predict the time to hospital discharge. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients (median age 56-years-old, 51 men) with COVID-19 pneumonia at CT were enrolled. The quantitative features of COVID-19 pneumonia were not associated to age, sex and time-from-symptoms onset, whereas higher number of comorbidities was correlated to lower well-aerated parenchyma ratio (rho = ?0.234, p = 0.04) and increased semi-consolidation ratio (rho = ?0.303, p = 0.008). Well-aerated lung (57%), semi-consolidation (17%) and consolidation (9%) predicted worst hypoxemia during hospitalization, with moderate areas under curves (AUC 0.76, 0.75, 0.77, respectively).

The commonly used Caprini model is limited by its inadequate ability to discriminate between risk stratums on the surgical population in southwest China and lengthy risk factors. The purpose of this study was to establish an improved VTE risk assessment model that is accurate and simple. METHODS: This study is based on the clinical data from 81,505 surgical patients hospitalized in the Southwest Hospital of China between January 1, 2019 and June 18, 2021. Among the population, 559 patients developed VTE. An improved VTE risk assessment model, SW-model, was established through Logistic Regression, with comparisons to both Caprini and Random Forest. RESULTS: The SW-model incorporated eight risk factors. The area under the curve (AUC) of SW-model (0.807 [0.758, 0.853], 0.804 [0.765, 0.840]), are significantly superior (p = 0.001 and p = 0.044) to those of the Caprini (0.705 [0.652, 0.757], 0.758 [0.719, 0795]) on two test sets, but inferior (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002) to Random Forest (0.854 [0.814, 0.890], 0.839 [0.806, 0.868]). In decision curve analysis, within threshold range from 0.015 to 0.04, the DCA curves of the SW-model are superior to Caprini and two default strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The SW-model demonstrated a higher discriminative capability to distinguish VTE positive in surgical patients compared with the Caprini model. Compared to Random Forest, Logistic Regression based SW-model provided interpretability which is essential in guarantee the procedure of risk assessment transparent to clinicians.

However, most -secretase inhibitors (GSIs) used to achieve pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling are at the basic research or preclinical stage, limiting the translation of fundamental findings into clinical practice. This present study aimed to evaluate the potential of several clinical candidates of GSIs as browning agents for the treatment of obesity. METHODS Seven GSIs that are clinical candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease or cancer were selected and their impacts on Notch inhibition as well as promoting beige biogenesis were compared using in vitro culture of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. RESULTS Four compounds (i.e.RO4929097, PF-03084014, LY3039478, and BMS-906024) that efficiently inhibited the expression of Notch target genes in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were identified. Moreover, these compounds were optimized for dose-dependent effects at three gradient concentrations (0.5, 1, and 10 M) to promote beige adipogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes without causing severe cytotoxicity.

To assess this possibility, this paper presents a detailed simulation and evaluation of 5G wireless offloading for object detection within a powerful, new smart wearable called VIS4ION, for the Blind-and-Visually Impaired (BVI). The current VIS4ION system is an instrumented book-bag with high-resolution cameras, vision processing and haptic and audio feedback.

To determine the video requirements, the paper evaluates the impact of video bit rate and resolution on object detection accuracy and range. A new street scene dataset with labeled objects relevant to BVI navigation is leveraged for analysis. The vision evaluation is combined with a detailed full-stack wireless network simulation to determine the distribution of throughputs and delays with real navigation paths and ray-tracing from new high-resolution 3D models in an urban environment.

Furthermore, N6-methyladenine (N6mA) decreases misincorporation of 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG) opposite to N6mA by repair DNA polymerases.

In addition to its transcriptional function, IRF3 also activates a nontranscriptional, proapoptotic signaling pathway. While the proapoptotic function of IRF3 protects against viral infections, it is also involved in harmful immune responses that trigger hepatocyte cell death and promote liver disease. Thus, we hypothesized that a small-molecule inhibitor of the proapoptotic activity of IRF3 could alleviate fatty-acid-induced hepatocyte cell death. We conducted a high-throughput screen, which identified auranofin as a small-molecule inhibitor of the proapoptotic activity of IRF3. In addition to the nontranscriptional apoptotic pathway, auranofin also inhibited the transcriptional activity of IRF3. Using biochemical and genetic tools in human and mouse cells, we uncovered a novel mechanism of action for auranofin, in which it induces cellular autophagy to degrade IRF3 protein, thereby suppressing IRF3 functions. Autophagy-deficient cells were unable to degrade IRF3 upon auranofin treatment, suggesting that the autophagic degradation of IRF3 is a novel approach to regulate IRF3 activities. Using a physiologically relevant in vitro model, we demonstrated that auranofin inhibited fatty-acid-induced apoptotic cell death of hepatocytes.

Translating these discoveries to humans requires examination of postmortem autopsy brain tissue. Yet banked brain tissue is routinely prepared using immersion fixation, which is a significant barrier to optimal preservation of tissue architecture. The challenges involved in adopting perfusion fixation in brain banks and the extent to which it improves histology quality are not well defined. METHODOLOGY We searched four databases to identify studies that have performed perfusion fixation in human brain tissue and screened the references of the eligible studies to identify further studies. From the included studies, we extracted data about the methods that they used, as well as any data comparing perfusion fixation to immersion fixation. The protocol was preregistered at the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/cv3ys/ . RESULTS We screened 4489 abstracts, 214 full-text publications, and identified 35 studies that met our inclusion criteria, which collectively reported on the perfusion fixation of 558 human brains. We identified a wide variety of approaches to perfusion fixation, including perfusion fixation of the brain in situ and ex situ, perfusion fixation through different sets of blood vessels, and perfusion fixation with different washout solutions, fixatives, perfusion pressures, and postfixation tissue processing methods. Through a qualitative synthesis of data comparing the outcomes of perfusion and immersion fixation, we found moderate confidence evidence showing that perfusion fixation results in equal or greater subjective histology quality compared to immersion fixation of relatively large volumes of brain tissue, in an equal or shorter amount of time. CONCLUSIONS This manuscript serves as a resource for investigators interested in building upon the methods and results of previous research in designing their own perfusion fixation studies in human brains or other large animal brains. We also suggest several future research directions, such as comparing the in situ and ex situ approaches to perfusion fixation, studying the efficacy of different washout solutions, and elucidating the types of brain donors in which perfusion fixation is likely to result in higher fixation quality than immersion fixation.","output":"Perfusion fixation in brain banking: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of billions of people globally.

This study explored the lived experiences of frontline clinicians who successfully transitioned their in-person speech-language therapy services to telepractice through an implementation science lens. METHODS: The study was conducted in partnership with one publicly funded program in Ontario, Canada that offers services to preschoolers with speech, language and communication disorders. Sixteen frontline speech-language pathologists and assistants at this organization shared their lived experience transitioning to telepractice during the pandemic during videoconference interviews. A narrative inquiry approach was used to analyze interview transcripts to identify the processes (or steps) this program took to implement telepractice and to understand the facilitators and barriers to telepractice implementation during the pandemic. RESULTS: The following six stages were identified from clinicians narratives: abrupt lockdown; weeks of uncertainty; telepractice emerged as an option; preparation for telepractice; telepractice trials; and finally, full implementation of telepractice. The stages of events offered significant insights into how government public health measures influenced clinicians decisions and their processes of adopting telepractice. In terms of barriers, clinicians reported a lack of knowledge, skills and experience with telepractice and a lack of technological support. The organizations learning climate and team approach to transitioning services were identified as the main facilitator of implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest a need for better coordination of public health measures and professional services, which would have eased clinicians stress and facilitated an earlier transition to telepractice. Fostering an organizations learning climate may improve organizations resilience in response to emergency situations.

COVID-19 has accelerated some of the contradictory dynamics that have characterized EUCChina relations in the last few years. China has proven to be a necessary partner and crucial provider of medical supplies, but it has also deployed a more assertive, and at times aggressive, public diplomacy which has reinforced advocates of moderating dependency from China inside the EU. The pandemic has fostered EU calls for a more balanced relationship based on reciprocity and a level playing field and locked pending negotiations in a stalemate. It is also likely to impact the debates on supply chain diversification, monitoring of Chinese FDI, and restrictions on Chinese 5G providers. In this context, Chinese attempts to revitalize the Health Silk Road have been unsuccessful, and China has turned to a more conservative strategy to preserve the BRIs (limited) advances in the EU. ? 2022 selection and editorial matter, Vassilis Ntousas and Stephen Minas;individual chapters, the contributors.","output":"COVID-19 and EU-China relations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"En diciembre de 2019, se detectaron en China los primeros casos de una neumona cuyo agente causante se identific como un nuevo coronavirus, el SARS-CoV-2.

COVID-19 not only taught us new habits to limit contagion, imposed restrictions also limited people's everyday practices and behavior. Our study aims to analyze how (much) the pandemic may have incidentally fostered social learning of sustainability (SLS), representing a shift from rule-based behavior and forced behavior changes to more associative and potentially long-lasting sustainable behavior. To answer this question, we analyzed data from two mixed-method surveys with which we approached two customized samples in a higher education setting in Australia (n = 100) and Austria (n = 264). The findings show that in a higher education and, specifically, a university context, there are less sustainable practices evaluated as stable and 'new normal';than assumed. Still, sustainability is more rule-related and less associative, predominantly in Australia. Nevertheless, a certain degree of awareness of what sustainable practices are can be observed mainly in Austria. As a broader implication, the study at hand leads to the conclusion that through COVID-19, sustainability at least became more tangible. Furthermore, universities as a specific institution have the potential to put sustainability higher on their agenda and take responsibility for social change.

Temporal summation in humans has been studied by observing the increase in pain or flexion reflex by repetitive electrical or thermal stimulations. Nonetheless, because the measurement is accompanied by severe pain, a minimally invasive method is desirable. Gradual augmentation of flexion reflex and pain induced by repetitive stimulation of the sural nerve was observed using three stimulation methods-namely, bipolar electrical, magnetic, and monopolar electrical stimulation, with 11 healthy male subjects in each group. The effects of frequency, intensity, and number of repetitive stimuli on the increase in the magnitude of flexion reflex and pain rating were compared among the three methods. The reflex was measured using electromyography (EMG) from the short head of the biceps femoris. All three methods produced a frequency- and intensity-dependent progressive increase in reflex and pain; pain scores were significantly lower for magnetic and monopolar stimulations than for bipolar stimulation (P < 0.05). The slope of increase in the reflex was steep during the first 4-6 stimuli but became gentler thereafter. In the initial phase, an increase in the reflex during the time before signals of C-fibers arrived at the spinal cord was observed in experiments using high-frequency stimulation, suggesting that wind-up was caused by inputs of A-fibers without the involvement of C-fibers. Magnetic and monopolar stimulations are minimally invasive and useful methods for observing the wind-up of the flexion reflex in humans. Monopolar stimulation is convenient because it does not require special equipment. There is at least a partial mechanism underlying the wind-up of the flexion reflex that does not require C-fibers.","output":"A Minimally Invasive Method for Observing Wind-Up of Flexion Reflex in Humans: Comparison of Electrical and Magnetic Stimulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thrombocytopenia occurs in one-third of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and can indicate the severity of disease and may also increase the bleeding risk of performing invasive procedures.

The need for enhanced respiratory precautions for infected patients and patients under investigation has necessitated a new process for interventions and resuscitation. LOCAL PROBLEM: Along with changing regulations and equipment, significant staff anxiety surrounded caring for infected patients and preparing for emergency situations. METHODS: A huddle process was implemented in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit for acutely ill patients who required enhanced respiratory precautions and were at risk of imminent decompensation, or who required a bedside procedure. During a huddle, the multidisciplinary team used process maps displayed in patient rooms; the huddle process created a situational awareness of events among these teams. INTERVENTION: After implementation of huddles, a survey was distributed to cardiac intensive care unit staff in order to understand their satisfaction with the huddle process. RESULTS: A total of 36 staff responded to the survey. They thought the huddles helped them to prepare for resuscitation scenarios, helped limit the number of personnel responding to an emergency, and reduced their anxiety surrounding caring for these patients. Staff suggested generalizing this huddle process to all patients at acute risk for decompensation in the cardiac intensive care unit.

They occur in certain eco-epidemiological foci that reflect manipulation by human activities, such as migration, urbanization and deforestation, of which poverty, conflict and climate change are key drivers. Given their synergistic impacts, risk factors and the vulnerabilities of poor populations and the launch of a new 2030 roadmap for NTDs in the context of the global sustainability agenda, it is warranted to update the state of knowledge of the leishmaniases and their effects. Using existing literature, we review socioeconomic and psychosocial impacts of leishmaniasis within a framework of risk factors and vulnerabilities to help inform policy interventions. Studies show that poverty is an overarching primary risk factor. Low-income status fosters inadequate housing, malnutrition and lack of sanitation, which create and exacerbate complexities in access to care and treatment outcomes as well as education and awareness. The co-occurrence of the leishmaniases with malnutrition and HIV infection further complicate diagnosis and treatment, leading to poor diagnostic outcomes and therapeutic response. Even with free treatment, households may suffer catastrophic health expenditure from direct and indirect medical costs, which compounds existing financial strain in low-income communities for households and healthcare systems. The dermatological presentations of the leishmaniases may result in long-term severe disfigurement, leading to stigmatization, reduced quality of life, discrimination and mental health issues. A substantial amount of recent literature points to the vulnerability pathways and burden of leishmaniasis on women, in particular, who disproportionately suffer from these impacts. These emerging foci demonstrate a need for continued international efforts to address key risk factors and population vulnerabilities if leishmaniasis control, and ultimately elimination, is to be achieved by 2030.","output":"Vulnerabilities to and the Socioeconomic and Psychosocial Impacts of the Leishmaniases: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to study the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic first wave on the in-hospital length of stay of operated proximal femur fractures.

The data were collected from the pre-pandemic, early part first wave and later part first wave of COVID-19 pandemic to calculate the average preoperative stay (POS) and total length of stay (LOS) of operated proximal femur fracture patients. Also, a sub-analysis of POS and LOS was done as per age (male/female), sex (<60/60 years) and fracture subtype (intertrochanteric, neck of femur and subtrochanteric fracture) of the patients to study if any of these had a significant direct impact on the POS and LOS. RESULTS: The LOS and POS were found to be significantly increased during early part of first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to the pre-pandemic era (13.6  7.7 days vs. 11.1  5.7 days). The later part of the first wave of the pandemic however saw the LOS and POS to return to near pre-pandemic values, although still remaining higher. CONCLUSION: The study highlights that unpreparedness during the early part of the unprecedented pandemic event leads to a significant increase in LOS of operated patients with its associated implications; however, prompt action by the government, hospital administration and hospital staff the LOS could be reduced to near pre-pandemic values in the later part of the first wave of the pandemic.

One-half of the pigs in each group were orally infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus; the remaining pigs served as controls. Threeday-old control pigs concentrated the nonabsorbable fluid marker twelve f old along the small and large intestine, indicating an efficiency of about 95% in absorption of the exogenous daily fluid load presented to the intestine. In contrast, the marker concentration in infected pigs showed no change whatsoever along either the small or large intestine, indicating a complete absence of net fluid absorption or secretion in these animals. Three-week-old control pigs concentrated the marker similarly to the 3-day-old group, with the bulk of the fluid absorption occurring in the small intestine. Infected pigs in the 3-wk-old group had marked net fluid secretion in the proximal small intestine, so that about twice the fluid load was presented to the large intestine of the 3-wk-old infected pigs as compared to the 3-day-old infected group. However, in contrast to the 3-day-old infected group, the large intestine of the 3-wk-old infected pigs increased fluid absorption some six times over the control, and this compensatory response prevented diarrhea in these older animals. Analysis of luminal contents indicated that in the older pigs, unabsorbed carbohydrate was almost completely fermented to short-chain fatty acids in the colon, whereas in the younger pigs the carbohydrate passed through the colon unchanged. These results demonstrate that development of microbial digestion, together with rapid short-chain fatty acid absorption, is a primary feature responsible for the colonic compensation in the older pigs with transmissible gastroenteritis.","output":"Colonic Compensation in Transmissible Gastroenteritis of Swine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Accurate civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems are the primary data source to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality. This study assesses how the pandemic impacted CRVS system processes in Loreto region of Peru, one of the worst affected countries globally. DESIGN: Qualitative study. SETTING: Loreto, a remote region, which had the highest reported mortality rate in Peru during the pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Semistructured individual interviews and documentary analysis were conducted between September 2020 and May 2021 with 28 key informants from eight institutions involved in death certification. Key informants were identified using a purposive sampling strategy commencing at the Health Directorate of Loreto, and the snowball method was used where a participant suggested another organisation or person. Information from key informants was used to compare business process maps of the CRVS system before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: During early May 2020, there were seven times more registered deaths than in earlier years, but key informants believed this underestimated mortality by 20%C30%. During the pandemic, families had to interact with more institutions during the death certification process. Several issues disrupted death certification processes, including the burden of increased deaths, the Environmental Health Directorate often removing a body without the familys express agreement, the creation of COVID-19 cemeteries where no death certificate was needed for burial, greater participation of funeral homes that often used outdated paper forms, and closure of civil registry offices. There was increased use of the online National Death System (SINADEF) but many users had problems with access. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic substantially disrupted CRVS processes in Loreto, making death certification more difficult, placing greater burden on the family and leading to more participation from unregulated organisations such as funeral homes or cemeteries.

Latent neural process, a member of NPF, is believed to be capable of modelling the uncertainty on certain points (local uncertainty) as well as the general function priors (global uncertainties). Nonetheless, some critical questions remain unresolved, such as a formal definition of global uncertainties, the causality behind global uncertainties, and the manipulation of global uncertainties for generative models. Regarding this, we build a member GloBal Convolutional Neural Process(GBCoNP) that achieves the SOTA log-likelihood in latent NPFs. It designs a global uncertainty representation p(z), which is an aggregation on a discretized input space. The causal effect between the degree of global uncertainty and the intra-task diversity is discussed. The learnt prior is analyzed on a variety of scenarios, including 1D, 2D, and a newly proposed spatial-temporal COVID dataset.

The two pulse oximeters showed similar accuracy when compared to SaO? measurement in extracted arterial blood (the gold standard) performed in intensive care units on newborns and children with an arterial line. Errors in SpO? because of variability in path-lengths difference between the two wavelengths are expected to be smaller in the two-infrared pulse oximeter.","output":"Pulse Oximetry with Two Infrared Wavelengths without Calibration in Extracted Arterial Blood."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to analyze the presence of adequate infrastructure and work process in primary health care for the diagnosis, management, and treatment of syphilis in Brazil in 2012, 2014, and 2018.

Two outcomes were assessed: adequate infrastructure and work process. The independent variables were macroregion, municipality size, Municipal Human Development Index (HDI-M), and coverage of the Family Health Strategy (FHS). Variance-weighted least squares regression was used to estimate annual changes in percentage. In total, 13,842 primary basic health units (UBS) and 17,202 professional health care teams were assessed in Cycle I; 24,055 UBS and 29,778 teams in Cycle II, and 28,939 UBS and 37,350 teams in Cycle III. About 1.4% of UBS had adequate infrastructure in Cycle I; 17.5% had in Cycle II; and 42.7% had in Cycle III. Adequate work process also increased in the three cycles, ranging from 47.3% in Cycle I to 45.5% in Cycle II and 75.4% in Cycle III. However, inequities are observed, considering that richer regions and larger municipalities, with higher HDI-M and lower FHS coverage improved the most.

University hospitals are also taking on the role of manufacturers of custom-made solutions thanks to 3D printing technology. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a monocentric observational case study regarding the distributed manufacturing of three groups of products during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic from 14 March to 10 May 2020: personal protective equipment, ventilatory support, and diagnostic and consumable products. Networking during this period has enabled the delivery of a total of 17,276 units of products manufactured using 3D printing technology. The most manufactured product was the face shields and ear savers, while the one that achieved the greatest clinical impact was the mechanical ventilation adapters and swabs. The products were manufactured by individuals in 57.3% of the cases, and our hospital acted as the main delivery node in a hub with 10 other hospitals. The main advantage of this production model is the fast response to stock needs, being able to adapt almost in real time. CONCLUSIONS: The role of 3D printing in the hospital environment allows the reconciliation of in-house and distributed manufacturing with traditional production, providing custom-made adaptation of the specifications, as well as maximum efficiency in the working and availability of resources, which is of special importance at critical times for health systems such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Application of 3D printing and distributed manufacturing during the first-wave of COVID-19 pandemic.

Quercetin has strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antiviral properties, and it is characterized by a very high safety profile, exerted in animals and in humans. Like most other polyphenols, quercetin shows a very low rate of oral absorption and its clinical use is considered by most of modest utility. Quercetin in a delivery-food grade system with sunflower phospholipids (Quercetin Phytosome(?), QP) increases its oral absorption up to 20-fold. METHODS: In the present prospective, randomized, controlled, and open-label study, a daily dose of 1000 mg of QP was investigated for 30 days in 152 COVID-19 outpatients to disclose its adjuvant effect in treating the early symptoms and in preventing the severe outcomes of the disease. RESULTS: The results revealed a reduction in frequency and length of hospitalization, in need of non-invasive oxygen therapy, in progression to intensive care units and in number of deaths. The results also confirmed the very high safety profile of quercetin and suggested possible anti-fatigue and pro-appetite properties. CONCLUSION: QP is a safe agent and in combination with standard care, when used in early stage of viral infection, could aid in improving the early symptoms and help in preventing the severity of COVID-19 disease. It is suggested that a double-blind, placebo-controlled study should be urgently carried out to confirm the results of our study.","output":"Possible Therapeutic Effects of Adjuvant Quercetin Supplementation Against Early-Stage COVID-19 Infection: A Prospective, Randomized, Controlled, and Open-Label Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently divorce cases have become increasingly popular and have become popular in the community.

We tested whether neuroaffective responses to motivationally relevant stimuli are associated with cue-induced nicotine self-administration. We hypothesized that smokers with stronger neuroaffective responses to nicotine-related cues than to pleasant stimuli (C>P) are more vulnerable to cue-induced nicotine self-administration than smokers with stronger neuroaffective responses to pleasant stimuli than to nicotine-related cues (P>C). Methods Smokers (N=36) looked at pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, and nicotine-related images signaling that an electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) was immediately available for use. We measured event-related potentials (a direct measure of cortical activity) and computed the amplitude of the late positive potential, a robust index of motivational salience. We used k-means cluster analysis to identify individuals characterized by the C>P or the P>C neuroaffective profile. We compared the ENDS use frequency in the two groups using quantile regression for counts. Results Cluster analysis assigned 18 smokers to the C>P profile and 18 smokers to the P>C profile. Smokers with the C>P neuroaffective profile used the ENDS significantly more often than smokers with the P>C profile. Significant differences in the number of puffs persisted across different quantiles. Conclusions These results support the hypothesis that individual differences in the tendency to attribute motivational salience to drug-related cues underlie vulnerability to cue-induced drug self-administration.

The effect of the interposition of these filters on delivered fresh gas flow and the resulting inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) is currently unknown.Methods: In a bench study, two different Venturi systems (Whisperflow and Harol) were used to generate three different gas flow/FiO2 couples (80 L/min-FiO2 0.6; 100 L/min-FiO2 0.5; 120 L/min- FiO2 0.4). Different combinations of filters were applied at the flow generator input line and/or at the helmet inlet port. Two types of filters were used for this purpose: a heat and moister exchanger filter and an electrostatic filter. The setup without filters was used as Baseline. Gas flow and FiO2 were measured for each setup.Results: Compared to Baseline, the interposition of filters reduced the gas flow between 1 and 13% (p<0.01). The application of a filter at the Venturi system or at the Helmet generated a comparable flow reduction (-3  2% vs. -4  2%, p=0.12), while a greater flow reduction (-7  4%) was observed when filters were applied at both sites (p<0.001).

Utilizing surrogate synchrony (SUSY) to estimate the dyadic coupling between the COVID-19 case infection rate processes in this region from March to December 2020, results indicate that significant synchrony is present between Arkansas and three of its neighbors. The highest level of instantaneous synchrony occurs between Arkansas and Tennessee, with the next highest level occurring between Arkansas and Missouri. There is evidence of directionality in the synchrony, indicating that Arkansas case infection rates lead Mississippi while rates in Missouri and Tennessee lead Arkansas. The lagged cross-correlations suggest the greatest synchrony to occur between 3 and 6 days. To explore the effect of IHE reopening on COVID-19, synchrony is compared between pre- and post-reopening windows. Results suggested that, following reopening, there are gains in detectable synchrony and that COVID-19 is in-flowing to Arkansas from all of its neighboring states. Taken together, results suggest that there is spatiality to COVID-19 with neighboring states having case infection rates that are significantly synchronous at a lag time that would be expected based on symptom onset.

Chest X-Ray (CXR) is the first line imaging test for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis as it is fast, cheap and easily accessible. Inspired by the success of deep learning (DL) in computer vision, many DL-models have been proposed to detect COVID-19 pneumonia using CXR images. Unfortunately, these deep classifiers lack the transparency in interpreting findings, which may limit their applications in clinical practice. The existing commonly used visual explanation methods are either too noisy or imprecise, with low resolution, and hence are unsuitable for diagnostic purposes. In this work, we propose a novel explainable deep learning framework (CXRNet) for accurate COVID-19 pneumonia detection with an enhanced pixel-level visual explanation from CXR images. The proposed framework is based on a new Encoder-Decoder-Encoder multitask architecture, allowing for both disease classification and visual explanation. The method has been evaluated on real world CXR datasets from both public and private data sources, including: healthy, bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia and COVID-19 pneumonia cases The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a satisfactory level of accuracy and provide fine-resolution classification activation maps for visual explanation in lung disease detection. The Average Accuracy, the Precision, Recall and F1-score of COVID-19 pneumonia reached 0.879, 0.985, 0.992 and 0.989, respectively.

Walking and balance impairment in stroke survivors often contribute to a restriction in daily activities and social participation. Task-oriented training (TOT) is an effective treatment strategy and manual therapy (MT) is used successfully to enhance ankle joint flexibility in this population. No study, however, has compared TOT against its combination with MT in a randomised controlled trial. Aims of this pilot study are therefore to explore the feasibility of a full-scale RCT using predefined feasibility criteria. Secondary aims are to explore the preliminary effects of specific TOT with a combined specific TOT-MT versus a control group in people post stroke. METHODS: This is a protocol of a 4-week prospective randomised controlled parallel pilot trial in people post stroke at the chronic stage with limited upper ankle joint mobility and an impairment in balance and mobility. At a German outpatient therapy centre using 1:1:1 allocation, 36 patients will be randomised into one of three groups: 15-min talocrural joint MT plus 30-min specific TOT (group A), 45-min specific TOT (group B), and controls (group C). Training will be goal-oriented including tasks that are based on daily activities and increased in difficulty utilising predefined progression criteria based on patients skill levels. Interventions will be provided face-to-face 2 times per week, for 4 weeks, in addition to 20-min concurrent x4 weekly home-based training sessions. Data will be collected by blinded assessors at baseline, post-intervention and 4-week follow-up. The primary outcome will be feasibility assessed by recruitment, retention and adherence rates, compliance, adverse events, falls and the acceptability of the intervention. Secondary outcomes will be walking speed, single and dual tasking functional mobility, ankle range of motion, disability and health-related quality of life.

DESIGN Individuals (N = 397) who reported meeting recommended guidelines for MVPA prior to COVID-19 completed an online questionnaire during the United States' COVID-19 lockdowns in April/May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Participants reported their MVPA currently and before COVID-19, and answered questions about five contextual cues (e.g. time of day, interaction partners, type of workout, surrounding events, location of exercise) that characterized their exercise routines currently and before COVID-19. RESULTS Contextual cues were perceived as highly disrupted and less consistent during COVID-19 (vs. before) and these changes were associated with greater declines in MVPA. For each cue, distinct effects predicting MVPA declines also emerged for perceived disruption due to COVID-19 restrictions, perceived importance of cue in getting one to exercise, and cue consistency over time. CONCLUSION Building on prior research, COVID-19 restrictions affected the context in which people exercised, and changes in these contextual cues were related to declines in MVPA. Re-establishing consistency in certain cues (e.g. time of day) after a disruption may help to forestall declines in MVPA compared to others (e.g. type of workout).","output":"Contextual disruption and exercise: mapping changes to exercise routines and engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy is emerging as a powerful treatment approach for several types of cancers. Modulating the immune system to specifically target cancer cells while sparing healthy cells, is a very promising approach for safer therapies and increased survival of cancer patients. Tumour-associated antigens are favorable targets for cancer immunotherapy, as they are exclusively expressed by the cancer cells, minimizing the risk of an autoimmune reaction. The ability to initiate the activation of the immune system can be achieved by virus-like particles (VLPs) which are safe and potent delivery tools. VLP\\\\based vaccines have evolved dramatically over the last few decades and showed great potential in preventing infectious diseases. Immunogenic potency of engineered VLPs as a platform for the development of effective therapeutic cancer vaccines has been studied extensively. This study involves recombinant VLPs presenting multiple copies of tumour-specific mucin 1 (MUC1) epitope as a potentially powerful tool for future immunotherapy. RESULTS: In this report VLPs based on the structural protein of Norovirus (NoV VP1) were genetically modified to present multiple copies of tumour-specific MUC1 epitope on their surface. Chimeric MUC1 particles were produced in the eukaryotic Leishmania tarentolae expression system and used in combination with squalene oil-in-water emulsion MF59 adjuvant to immunize BALB/c mice. Sera from vaccinated mice demonstrated high titers of IgG and IgM antibodies which were specifically recognizing MUC1 antigen. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results show that immunization with recombinant chimeric NoV VP1- MUC1 VLPs result in high titers of MUC1 specific IgG antibodies and show great therapeutic potential as a platform to present tumour-associated antigens.

However, the presently available parenteral influenza vaccine induces only systemic humoral immunity, which does not prevent influenza virus infection on the mucosal surface. Secretary IgA antibodies play an important role in preventing natural infection. Moreover, the IgA antibody response mediates cross-protection against variant viruses in animal models. Thus, a mucosal influenza vaccine that induces mucosal immunity would be a powerful tool to protect individuals from the influenza virus. Although the function of the mucosal immune system, especially in the respiratory tract, is not completely understood, there are several studies underway to develop mucosal influenza vaccines. Here, we will review current knowledge concerning the induction of IgA, the role of B-cell production of influenza virus specific IgA antibodies in anti-influenza immunity, and the role of humoral memory responses induced upon vaccination.","output":"Mucosal Immunization and Adjuvants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To review the evidence from studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 culture, with the results of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods We searched LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO Covid-19 database for Covid-19 using the terms viral culture or viral replication and associated synonyms up to 10 September 2020. We carried out citation matching and included studies reporting attempts to culture or observe SARS-CoV-2 matching with cutoffs for RT-PCR positivity. One reviewer extracted data for each study and a second reviewer checked end edited the extraction and summarised the narratively by sample: fecal, respiratory, environment, blood or mixed. Where necessary we wrote to corresponding authors of the included or background papers for additional information. We assessed quality using a modified QUADAS 2 risk of bias tool. This is the fourth version of this review that was first published on the 4th of August and updated on the 21t of August, on the 3rd and 10th of September. Results We included 29 studies reporting culturing or observing tissue invasion by SARS-CoV in sputum, naso or oropharyngeal, urine, stool, blood and environmental samples from patients diagnosed with Covid-19. The data are suggestive of a relation between the time from collection of a specimen to test, cycle threshold and symptom severity. The quality of the studies was moderate with lack of standardised reporting. Twelve studies reported that Ct values were significantly lower and log copies higher in samples producing live virus culture. Five studies reported no growth in samples based on a Ct cut-off value. These values ranged from CT > 24 for no growth to Ct > 34 or more. Two studies report a strong relationship between Ct value and ability to recover infectious virus and that the odds of live virus culture reduced by 33% for every one unit increase in Ct. A cut-off RT-PCR Ct > 30 was associated with non-infectious samples. One study that analysed the NSP, N and E gene fragments of the PCR result reported different cut-off thresholds depending on the gene fragment analysed. The duration of RNA shedding detected by PCR was far longer compared to detection of live culture. Six out of eight studies reported RNA shedding for longer than 14 days. Yet, infectivity declines after day 8 even among cases with ongoing high viral loads. A very small proportion of people re-testing positive after hospital discharge or with high Ct are likely to be infectious. Conclusion Prospective routine testing of reference and culture specimens are necessary for each country involved in the pandemic to establish the usefulness and reliability of PCR for Covid-19 and its relation to patient factors. Infectivity is related to the date of onset of symptoms and cycle threshold level. A binary Yes / No approach to the interpretation RT-PCR unvalidated against viral culture will result in false positives with possible segregation of large numbers of people who are no longer infectious and hence not a threat to public health.","output":"Viral cultures for COVID-19 infectivity assessment.

In this article we propose a novel increasing shrinkage prior, called the cumulative shrinkage process, for the parameters that control the dimension in overcomplete formulations. Our construction has broad applicability and is based on an interpretable sequence of spike-and-slab distributions which assign increasing mass to the spike as the model complexity grows. Using factor analysis as an illustrative example, we show that this formulation has theoretical and practical advantages relative to current competitors, including an improved ability to recover the model dimension.

Due to the size of the surface area of airways and respiratory epithelium combined with the daily amount of continuous gas exchange, in mammalians the lung represents the most exposed organ serving as immediate entry port for airborne antigens. Together with several physicochemical clearance processes, both local and systemic immunological defense mechanisms ensure the passage of airways and the tissue integrity of respiratory epithelium and pulmonary interstitium necessary for the maintenance of gas exchange. Several recent observations concerning the molecular and cellular constituents of the pulmonary immunological defense have substantially broadened our knowledge of the maintenance of the vital functionality of airways, raising the unique specialization of the organization of pulmonary immune compartment. The purpose of the present review is to highlight the main findings on the complexity of pulmonary immunity, including the overview of the main characteristics of its cellular and molecular participants. Unrevealing these mechanisms may promote our understanding the local and systemic immunopathological processes occurring after airway infections (including SARS-CoV-2) and the critical assessment of potential therapeutic interventions.

However, no study has investigated whether maintaining bound representations with more features in WM requires extra object-based attention. We investigated this by examining whether a secondary task consuming object-based attention was more disruptive to the maintenance of bindings in WM when more features were stored per object. We instructed participants to memorize three bound representations in a WM task while manipulating the number of features (two vs. three features) contained in each representation. Moreover, we manipulated whether a secondary task consuming object-based attention was interpolated into the maintenance phase of WM. If extra object-based attention was required after the addition of an extra feature in the bound representation, the secondary task would result in a greater disruption of the three- rather than two-featured binding. In two experiments, we found that the added secondary task significantly impaired the binding performance, but the performance of the two- and three-featured bindings was disrupted to the same extent. These results suggest that the presence of more features in a bound representation in WM does not require extra object-based attention.","output":"Does the presence of more features in a bound representation in working memory require extra object-based attention?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. BACKGROUND: Repeated echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function is integral in management of intensive care units (ICU) patients. Machine learning (ML) can assist by integrating whole-cardiac cycle echo data derived from flow assessment and deformation imaging, and grouping patients on the basis of patterns of cardiac dysfunction and its evolution over time. Cardiac involvement has been suggested to be important in COVID-19 outcome and echo evaluation can inform on cardiac status. We use unsupervised ML to investigate and integrate longitudinal data from the COVID-HO study (NCT04371679) to determine the potential of tracking changes in cardiac function during ICU hospitalization. METHODS: In a single-centre, COVID-19 patients (n = 38) were prospectively followed with echocardiography as part of ICU management. The endpoint was defined as death or ICU discharge. LV myocardial deformation, as well as aortic, mitral and pulmonary artery blood-pool Doppler velocity profiles were used as input for ML. Clinical data was used to validate the ML derived phenotypes. Echo data from the initial and final echo examination were used to create an output space where participants were positioned based on cardiac function blinded to outcome status. Regression was used to estimate the echo and clinical characteristics of different regions in the space. Patient trajectories in the output space were investigated for each patient. RESULTS: Endpoint was not reached in 24% (n = 9) at the time of analysis. The cohort was 68% male, aged 65  12 years, and with an ICU mortality 21% (n = 8). The median spent in ICU was 10 (IQR 7-18) days. The ML analysis demonstrated a heterogeneous output space (Fig 1A) we could define a gradual change in the shape of the pulmonary outflow velocity profile, from a normal towards pulmonary hypertension (Fig 1A, x axis). Jointly with differences in diastolic function (mitral inflow fusion and A wave accentuation) defined two regions: with signs of pulmonary hypertension (gray); and with normal pulmonary pressures but LV diastolic dysfunction (yellow). Investigation of patient trajectories (Fig 1B) demonstrated the feasibility of tracking changes during ICU hospitalization, showing a shift of a patient that died in the ICU, from initial diastolic dysfunction towards pulmonary hypertension (red), and a patient shifting from a region with normal diastolic function towards pulmonary hypertension, but with a positive outcome (blue). Echo data concurs with observed dynamics (Fig 1C and 1D). CONCLUSION: ML can integrate complex, whole-cardiac cycle echo data to group heterogeneous patients based on similarity of cardiac function. Patient trajectories across the output space demonstrate the feasibility of ML for echo data-based follow-up of patients during ICU hospitalization. Further echo and clinical data integration can improve characterisation of the output space regions and better define changes in cardiac function during hospitalization.","output":"Evolution of cardiac function in COVID 19 patients in the intensive care unit: insights from machine learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandmie lie au COVID-19 a conduit la France  imposer un confinement strict, affectant les habitudes des familles dans de nombreux domaines Cette tude visait  valuer les changements possibles dans les comportements alimentaires des enfants, les pratiques ducatives parentales en matire d'alimentation et les motivations d'achat des aliments, pendant le confinement par rapport  la priode avant confinement Pendant le confinement, les parents de 498 enfants ags de 3  12 ans (238 gar?ons ;M = 7,32 ;ET = 2,27) ont rpondu  une enqute nationale en ligne comprenant les items issus de questionnaires valids (ex CEDQ, CEBQ, HomeSTEAD) Ils ont dcrit leur situation et celle de l'enfant pendant le confinement, et rtrospectivement sur la priode le prcdant (volet quantitatif) L'enqute comprenait aussi trois questions ouvertes (volet qualitatif) pour lesquelles les parents pouvaient partager leurs expriences positives et ngatives concernant l'alimentation familiale durant cette priode, et ce qu'ils aimeraient maintenir au-del Dans le volet quantitatif de l'tude, de nombreux parents ont signal des changements dans les comportements alimentaires des enfants (60 %), dans les pratiques ducatives (65 %) et dans les motivations d'achat des aliments (85 %) Lorsque des changements taient dcrits, l'apptit de l'enfant, le plaisir  manger, la ? ractivit aux aliments ?, le ? manger motionnel ? et la frquence des collations augmentaient Aussi, 53 % des parents rapportaient une augmentation du niveau d'ennui de leur enfant L'ennui accru des enfants prdisait de manire significative une augmentation de la ? ractivit aux aliments ? et de la frquence des collations entre les repas Lorsque les parents ont chang leurs pratiques, ils sont devenus plus permissifs : moins de rgles, plus d'apaisement avec la nourriture (? soothing with food ?), plus d'autonomie de l'enfant dans le choix des aliments  consommer, dans les quantits consommes, et du lieu de consommation Les parents achetaient plus frquemment des aliments ? plaisir ? et durables, prparaient plus de repas ? faits maison ? et cuisinaient davantage avec l'enfant Ces changements des pratiques et motivations des parents taient expliqus par le niveau d'tude, la situation professionnelle et financire et l'augmentation du niveau de stress Les analyses du volet qualitatif rvlent, sur le versant vcu positivement, une rappropriation de l'alimentation tant sur la qualit des aliments choisis (locaux, frais ) que sur les pratiques (importance du ? fait-maison ?, de la transmission ), et un plaisir affirm de cuisiner ensemble et de partager les repas Sur le versant ngatif, les parents soulignent la surcharge impose par la frquence des repas  prparer, le stress et la surconsommation Le confinement a entra?n des changements notables dans les habitudes alimentaires des familles : les comportements et pratiques sont devenus plus centrs sur l'enfant, et plus axs sur les valeurs de plaisir, de commensalit et de durabilit [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Nutrition Clinique et Metabolisme is the property of Elsevier B V and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Les habitudes alimentaires des familles fran?aises pendant le confinement li au COVID-19 : (comment) ont-elles chang ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has necessitated the rapid development of prophylactic vaccines.

Mobility data points were defined as daily length of visit or time spent in a single location based on mobile phone users shared locations from February 7 - March 29, 2020. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate relationships between normalized per capita infection prevalence and six parameters of social distancing. Results: Mobility data indicated the following percent changes compared to median values of baseline activity: -50% in transit stations, -45% in retail/recreation, -36% in workplaces, -23% in grocery/pharmacy, -19% in parks, and +12% in residential living areas. Multivariable linear regression revealed significant correlation between prevalence of infection per capita and parameters of social distancing (R= 0.604, P= 0.002).

Amidst many critical issues, work-family conflict (WFC) remains a central topic, due to the hardships in separating different life domains, the pervasiveness of technology, and decreased opportunities for recovery, all considering new, emerging job demands. Although many studies have involved healthcare workers, less attention has been paid to technical-administrative staff (TA); moreover, previous studies about the impact of remote working on WFC have provided mixed results. OBJECTIVES: The study aims at examining the relationships between WFC and cognitive demands, off-work hours technology assisted job demands (off-TAJD) and recovery, in the TA of a hospital in northwest Italy. METHODS: A sample of 211 individuals (response rate of 58%), in line with the population, filled in an online self-report questionnaire in the second half of April 2020. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis showed a positive relationship between WFC and perceived ICT stress, off-TAJD and cognitive demands, and a negative relationship with recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the role of cognitive demands, technology overload and invasiveness, as potential predictors of WFC. The results also indicate the mitigating role of recovery, even in the face of a prolonged and forced experience of remote work. The study emphasises the need for transparent policies, based on trust, autonomy and right to disconnect, and the centrality of training, especially for supervisors, on topics such as evaluation of results, proper recovery management and correct use of technology.","output":"Work-family conflict during the Covid-19 pandemic: teleworking of administrative and technical staff in healthcare.

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. The clinical data of 65 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 admitted to Chongqing Public Health Medical Center and Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital from January 2020 to March 2020 during the period of supporting to combat COVID-19 by the medical team of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and Chongqing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine were analyzed. According to different treatment regimens, patients were divided into conventional treatment group (conventional antivirus, anti-infection and symptomatic support treatments), Xuebijing group (Xuebijing was applied to patients with elevated inflammatory cytokines) and combination group (Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin, human immunoglobulin was applied to patients with low immunity indicated by monitoring results of lymphocytes and their subsets). The improvement of blood routine examination, blood gas analysis, myocardial enzyme spectrum, liver and kidney function, lymphocytes and their subsets and cytokines as well as severity score in three groups before and after treatment were observed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to draw the 28-day survival curve of each group, and the cumulative survival rate among the groups was compared. RESULTS Among the 65 severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients, only 20 patients received conventional treatment, 22 patients were treated with Xuebijing based on conventional treatment, and 23 patients were treated with Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin based on conventional treatment. Before treatment, CD4+ T cell count in combination group was higher than other two groups, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was lower than other two groups, while other indicators showed no statistically significant differences among the three groups, suggesting that the baseline of the three groups was relatively balanced before treatment. The patients in the conventional treatment group were relieved after treatment, and it was characterized by that the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly lower than those before treatment [APACHE II score: 5.202.74 vs. 6.201.93, LDH (mols-1L-1): 4.11.0 vs. 4.70.9, both P < 0.01], but there was still liver damage, which was manifested as higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than that before treatment [U/L: 30.5 (23.8, 41.5) vs. 21.0 (17.0, 34.0), P < 0.05]. In Xuebijing group, the respiratory function and immunity of patients were improved after treatment, and the improvement degree of the ratio of CD4+ T cell was more significant than that in the conventional treatment group (4.866.31 vs. -0.9512.38, P < 0.05). However, the patients still lived with an \\"inflammatory storm\\" and liver damage after treatment. It was shown that IL-4 was significantly higher than that before treatment (ng/L: 2.571.15 vs. 1.921.04, P < 0.05), while albumin (ALB) decreased significantly compared with before treatment [g/L: 33.0 (30.5, 35.6) vs. 36.2 (32.1, 41.4), P < 0.01]. While the treatment of Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin could improve patients' respiratory function and enhance their immunity more effectively, it was shown that arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), T lymphocyte count, ratio of CD4+ T cell, CD4+ T cell count, CD8+ T cell count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio were significantly higher than those before treatment, while ALB, IL-6, APACHE II score and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were significantly lower than those before treatment. T lymphocyte count, the ratio of CD4+ T cell and IL-6 in combination group were improved more significantly than those in conventional treatment group and Xuebijing group [T lymphocyte count (109/L): 310.68359.28 vs. 46.54240.01, 81.59256.76; ratio of CD4+ T cell: 14.5314.49 vs. -0.9512.38, 4.866.31; IL-6 (ng/L): -25.5339.05 vs. -1.755.45, 12.7844.81], PaO2/FiO2 was improved more significantly as compared with the Xuebijing group [mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 146.31109.73 vs. 59.4187.70], and the differences were statistically different (all P < 0.05).

Euglycemic DKA may occur in patients with both type 1 and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), as well as pregnancy. The absence of marked hyperglycemia can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, resulting in potential adverse outcomes. Diabetes is a major comorbidity associated with severe hospital course and high fatality rate among patients with COVID-19 infection. We report our experience in a patient with gestational diabetes mellitus who developed euglycemic DKA and COVID-19 infection in her third trimester of pregnancy. Clinical Case: A 30-year-old lady at 29weeks gestation presented with two-day history of vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. She reported good fetal movements. She had been diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) at 20 weeks gestational age, receiving treatment with multiple daily injections of insulin. 5 days earlier, she had tested positive for COVID-19 infection. She was asymptomatic; testing was performed as she had been in contact with a confirmed case. On examination she was afebrile and vitally stable, but dehydrated. Her initial laboratory investigations showed ketonemia with normal glucose level and normal anion gap. She was treated as a case of starvation ketosis and dehydration, with intravenous fluids and electrolyte replacement. However, 3 days later, the patient complained of worsening nausea and vomiting with dry cough and she developed hypotension. Chest X-ray showed bilateral mid and lower zone pulmonary infiltrates. She was treated as COVID-19 pneumonia, received 2 units of COVID-19 convalescent plasma and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Repeated investigations showed worsening ketosis with high anion gap metabolic acidosis, consistent with a diagnosis of euglycemic DKA. Insulin infusion was initiated, isotonic saline with electrolyte replacement was also continued. She symptomatically improved over the next two days, with resolution of ketonemia and acidosis. The patient was discharged and she was well at her outpatient follow up visit. She underwent emergency Cesarean Section at 37 weeks gestational age, due to non-reassuring electronic fetal monitoring. She delivered a healthy female infant weighing 2445grams. Conclusion: Pregnancy is a high-risk period for DKA particularly when associated with other stressors that were identified in our patient C GDM, restricted calorie intake and COVID-19 infection. Diabetes is a risk factor for developing severe forms of COVID-19 and on the other hand, COVID-19 infection is associated with poor glycemic control and higher risk of hyperglycemic emergencies including ketoacidosis in diabetic patients. Prompt recognition of euglycemic DKA is critical in pregnancy, as this condition is associated with high fetal mortality rates.","output":"Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis in a Patient With Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter provides a historical perspective of the notion that the sleepingCwaking brain is intimately related to complaints of unrefreshing sleep, widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and suffering.

Because capturing representative mild and asymptomatic cases require active surveillance, they are less characterized than moderate or severe cases of COVID-19. However, a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections might shed light into the immune mechanisms associated with the control of symptoms and protection. To this aim, we have determined the temporal dynamics of the humoral immune response, as well as the serum inflammatory profile, of mild and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in a cohort of 172 initially seronegative prospectively studied United States Marine recruits, 149 of whom were subsequently found to be SARS-CoV-2 infected. The participants had blood samples taken, symptoms surveyed and PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 performed periodically for up to 105 days. We found similar dynamics in the profiles of viral load and in the generation of specific antibody responses in asymptomatic and mild symptomatic participants. A proteomic analysis using an inflammatory panel including 92 analytes revealed a pattern of three temporal waves of inflammatory and immunoregulatory mediators, and a return to baseline for most of the inflammatory markers by 35 days post-infection. We found that 23 analytes were significantly higher in those participants that reported symptoms at the time of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR compared with asymptomatic participants, including mostly chemokines and cytokines associated with inflammatory response or immune activation (i.e., TNF-, TNF-, CXCL10, IL-8). Notably, we detected 7 analytes (IL-17C, MMP-10, FGF-19, FGF-21, FGF-23, CXCL5 and CCL23) that were higher in asymptomatic participants than in participants with symptoms; these are known to be involved in tissue repair and may be related to the control of symptoms. Overall, we found a serum proteomic signature that differentiates asymptomatic and mild symptomatic infections in young adults, including potential targets for developing new therapies and prognostic tests.","output":"Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection Is Associated With Higher Levels of Serum IL-17C, Matrix Metalloproteinase 10 and Fibroblast Growth Factors Than Mild Symptomatic COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Ascites is a common complication of cancer. Symptomatic ascites contributes to cancer-related morbidity and is distressing for patients (pts). Therapeutic abdominal paracentesis (TAP) provides symptom relief but requires specialized procedural knowledge and is usually performed in the inpatient setting with several days of hospitalization. Additionally, high hospital bed occupancy during the COVID-19 pandemic prevented timely admission for TAP. An Advanced Practice Nurse (APN)-led ambulatory TAP service was introduced at our center, with the aim of improving access to TAP and reducing hospital bed occupancy. Methods: A multidisciplinary team developed workflows and safety guidelines for TAP to enable right-siting of pts in a cancer day care unit. Pts were scheduled for radiologically guided insertion of abdominal drains in the morning before 10am to allow adequate time for drainage. Pre-procedure clinical examination and safety checks were performed by APNs in the day unit. Following the procedure, abdominal fluid was drained with concurrent administration of 20% IV albumin. Drains were removed by the APN and pts were examined before discharge on the same day. Data for all cancer pts requiring TAP in the day unit and hospital from 1 Jan to 30 Nov 2020 were extracted from the electronic medical record system. The primary outcome was length-of-stay (LOS). The primary safety outcome was adverse events in the day unit. Continuous data were compared using the ttest. Data analysis was done in SPSS version 22. Results: The number of TAPs performed in the day unit and general ward requiring hospitalization were 102 and 133, respectively. There was a significant reduction in average LOS with TAPs performed in the day unit vs. hospitalization (1.48 vs. 5.82 days, p<0.001) (Table). The mean difference was 4.34 (95% confidence interval 3.33-5.34) days saved per pt, or a saving of 443 inpatient bed days. The TAP day unit service encountered 10 adverse events (AEs) requiring admission to the ward for continued drainage. AEs were borderline baseline blood pressure, pt frailty and inability to care for an indwelling catheter. There were no infective or bleeding complications. The majority of TAPs (86.8%) were performed in one day, with the remainder over 2-days with the abdominal drain left in-situ and reattendance at the day unit the next day for further drainage. Differences in average length-of-stay with TAP in the hospital vs. day unit. Conclusions: An APN-led ambulatory abdominal paracentesis service is a safe alternative to inpatient paracentesis. Optimal utilization of a day unit enabled reduced LOS for pts with advanced cancer. This reduction in LOS was critical during a pandemic where bed demand was high. This was possible from advanced scheduling and control over the day unit capacity.","output":"Safety and feasibility of a nurseled ambulatory abdominal paracentesis service"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patient selection and cannulation arguably represent the key steps for the successful implementation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Cannulation is traditionally performed in the operating room or the catheterization laboratory for a number of reasons, including physician preference and access to real-time imaging, with the goal of minimizing complications and ensuring appropriate cannula positioning. Nonetheless, the patients' critical and unstable conditions often require emergent initiation of ECMO and preclude the safe transport of the patient to a procedural suite. AIMS: Therefore, with the objective of avoiding delay with the initiation of therapy and reducing the hazard of transport, we implemented a protocol for bedside ECMO cannulation. MATHERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 89 patients required ECMO support at Hennepin County Medical Center between March 2015 and December 2019. Twenty-eight (31%) required veno-venous support and were all cannulated at the bedside. Overall survival was 71% with no morbidity or mortality related to the cannulation procedure. CONCLUSION: In the current pandemic, the strategy of veno-venous bedside cannulation may have additional benefits for the care of patients with refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus-disease-2019, decreasing the risk of exposure of health care worker or other patients to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 occurring during patient transport, preparation, or during disinfection of the procedural suite and the transportation pathway after ECMO cannulation.","output":"Bedside veno-venous ECMO cannulation: A pertinent strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: First introduced in 2006, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) has stirred great interest, as evidenced by 75 publications as of October 2015, with 56 of them just in the last 2 years.

The molecular diagnostics of various RNA/DNA pathogens is discussed while highlighting recent applications in clinical settings with focus on point-of-care (POC) bioassays and on automated fluidic platforms. The strengths and limitations of this isothermal method are also addressed. SUMMARY: RPA is becoming a molecular tool of choice for the rapid, specific, and cost-effective identification of pathogens. Owing to minimal sample-preparation requirements, low operation temperature (25C42 C), and commercial availability of freeze-dried reagents, this method has been applied outside laboratory settings, in remote areas, and interestingly, onboard automated sample-to-answer microfluidic devices.

We refined a generalized additive model for selecting thresholds with substantial health risk enhancement, based on Taiwan population records of 2000C2017, considering lag effects and different spatial scales. Reference-adjusted risk ratio (RaRR) is proposed, defined as the ratio between the relative risk of an essential health outcome for a threshold candidate against that for a reference; the threshold with the highest RaRR is potentially the optimal one. It was found that the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is a more sensitive heat-health indicator than temperature. At lag 0, the highest RaRR (1.66) with WBGT occurred in emergency visits of children, while that in hospital visits occurred for the working-age group (1.19), presumably due to high exposure while engaging in outdoor activities. For most sex, age, and sub-region categories, the RaRRs of emergency visits were higher than those of hospital visits and all-cause mortality; thus, emergency visits should be employed (if available) to select heat-warning thresholds.

Methods Hundred and forty-one consecutive patients underwent surgery for acute type A aortic dissection at our institution from 2010 to 2016. Of those, 104 patients underwent ascending aorta and hemiarch repair under hypothermic circulatory arrest with antegrade cerebral perfusion (standard group). Since 2013, 37 patients have undergone the standard procedure combined with antegrade stent implantation in the descending aorta (stented group). A matched analysis using the logistic EuroSCORE (37 patients per group) was done. All data were collected prospectively. Results The mean logistic EuroSCORE was 29 in both groups, P = 1. Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 150  57 (standard) vs 157  48 (stented) min, P = 0.6; aortic clamping 99  47 (standard) vs 100  36 (stented) min, P = 1. Stented patients had longer circulatory arrest times with antegrade cerebral perfusion, 23  7 vs 15  7 min, P < 0.001. Stroke occurred in 24.3% (standard) vs 8.1% (stented), P = 0.1; paraplegia developed in 2.7% (standard) vs 0% (stented), P = 1. Abdominal intervention due to suspected visceral ischaemia was needed in 18.9% (standard) vs 5.4% (stented), P = 0.2. 30-day mortality was 13.5% (standard) vs 0% (stented), P = 0.05. Survival at 6-month was 100% and 86.5% in patients with implanted stents and standard repair, respectively, P = 0.02. Conclusions Antegrade, open stent graft implantation into the descending aorta during acute type A aortic dissection repair is safe and is associated with improved outcomes at 6 months postoperatively compared to the standard repair technique.","output":"Modified frozen elephant trunk for acute type A aortic dissection: a comparative study with standard repair technique."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to the increased likelihood of clinical exposure during patient management.

One of its key enzymes, similar to other coronaviruses, is the 2-O-RNA methyltransferase (MTase) that is essential for viral RNA stability and expression. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 2-O-RNA MTase in a complex with the pan-methyltransferase inhibitor sinefungin solved at 2.2 ? resolution. The structure revealed an overall fold consistent with the fold observed in other coronaviral MTases. The major differences are in the conformation of the C-terminus of the nsp16 subunit and an additional helix in the N-terminus of the nsp10 subunits. The structural analysis also revealed very high conservation of the SAM binding pocket suggesting that the SAM pocket is a suitable spot for the design of antivirals effective against all human coronaviruses. Importance Some coronaviruses are dangerous pathogens while some cause only common colds. The reasons are not understood although the spike proteins probably play an important role. However, to understand the coronaviral biology in sufficient detail we need to compare the key enzymes from different coronaviruses. We solved the crystal structure of 2-O-RNA methyltransferase of the OC43 coronavirus, a virus that usually causes mild colds.

Our work focuses on TSS optimization and respective data offloading scheme. We propose a heuristics-based optimal TSS algorithm, a distinctive community identification algorithm, and an opportunistic data offloading algorithm. The proposed scheme has an overall polynomial time complexity of the order O(k(3)), where k is the number of nodes in the primary target set for convergence. However we have obtained its realization to linear order for practical reasons. To validate our results, we have used state-of-the-art datasets and compared it with literature-based approaches. Our analysis shows that the proposed Final Target Set Selection (FTSS) algorithm outperforms the greedy approach by 35% in terms of traffic over cellular towers. It reduces the traffic by 20% as compared to the heuristic approach.

Human contact networks exhibit strong community structure. Understanding how such community structure affects epidemics may provide insights for preventing the spread of disease between communities by changing the structure of the contact network through pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions. We use empirical and simulated networks to investigate the spread of disease in networks with community structure. We find that community structure has a major impact on disease dynamics, and we show that in networks with strong community structure, immunization interventions targeted at individuals bridging communities are more effective than those simply targeting highly connected individuals. Because the structure of relevant contact networks is generally not known, and vaccine supply is often limited, there is great need for efficient vaccination algorithms that do not require full knowledge of the network. We developed an algorithm that acts only on locally available network information and is able to quickly identify targets for successful immunization intervention. The algorithm generally outperforms existing algorithms when vaccine supply is limited, particularly in networks with strong community structure. Understanding the spread of infectious diseases and designing optimal control strategies is a major goal of public health. Social networks show marked patterns of community structure, and our results, based on empirical and simulated data, demonstrate that community structure strongly affects disease dynamics.

METHODS: We identified patients (&#8805;18 years) who completed a clinically indicated exercise stress test between January 1, 2016, and February 29, 2020, and had a test for SARS-CoV-2 (ie, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test) between February 29, 2020, and May 30, 2020. Maximal exercise capacity was quantified in metabolic equivalents of task (METs). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the likelihood that hospitalization secondary to COVID-19 is related to peak METs, with adjustment for 13 covariates previously identified as associated with higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. RESULTS: We identified 246 patients (age, 5912 years; 42% male; 75% black race) who had an exercise test and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among these, 89 (36%) were hospitalized. Peak METs were significantly lower (P<.001) among patients who were hospitalized (6.72.8) compared with those not hospitalized (8.02.4). Peak METs were inversely associated with the likelihood of hospitalization in unadjusted (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.92) and adjusted models (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.99). CONCLUSION: Maximal exercise capacity is independently and inversely associated with the likelihood of hospitalization due to COVID-19. These data further support the important relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and health outcomes. Future studies are needed to determine whether improving maximal exercise capacity is associated with lower risk of complications due to viral infections, such as COVID-19.","output":"Inverse Relationship of Maximal Exercise Capacity to Hospitalization Secondary to Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivation Novel pathogens evolve quickly and may emerge rapidly, causing dangerous outbreaks or even global pandemics. Next-generation sequencing is the state-of-the art in open-view pathogen detection, and one of the few methods available at the earliest stages of an epidemic, even when the biological threat is unknown. Analyzing the samples as the sequencer is running can greatly reduce the turnaround time, but existing tools rely on close matches to lists of known pathogens and perform poorly on novel species. Machine learning approaches can predict if single reads originate from more distant, unknown pathogens, but require relatively long input sequences and processed data from a finished sequencing run. Results We present DeePaC-Live, a Python package for real-time pathogenic potential prediction directly from incomplete sequencing reads. We train deep neural networks to classify Illumina and Nanopore reads and integrate our models with HiLive2, a real-time Illumina mapper. DeePaC-Live outperforms alternatives based on machine learning and sequence alignment on simulated and real data, including SARS-CoV-2 sequencing runs. After just 50 Illumina cycles, we increase the true positive rate 80-fold compared to the live-mapping approach. The first 250bp of Nanopore reads, corresponding to 0.5s of sequencing time, are enough to yield predictions more accurate than mapping the finished long reads. Our approach could also be used for screening synthetic sequences against biosecurity threats.

The spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan in China throughout the world has been alamingly rapid. Epidemiologic techniques succeeded in containing the disease in China, but efforts were not as successful in the rest of the world, particularly the United States where there have been 1,592, 599 cases with 95,863 deaths as of May 25, 2020. Projections are for continued new infections and deaths if no effective treatments can be activated over the next six months.. We performed a systematic review to determine the potential time course of development of treatments and vaccines focusing on availability in the last half of 2020. Methods. Our search was performed during the week of May 17, 2020. Publications: We reviewed up to date information from several sources to identify potential treatments for COVID-19: We used the Reagan-Udall Expanded Access Navigator COVID-19 Treatment Hub to track the efforts of companies to develop treatments. We then used the results to search for publications on pubmed.gov and on MedRxiv, the preprint server. We further used a targeted Google search to find announcements of trial results. Clinical Trials: We searched for all investigational trials involving potential treatments using several different sources: (A) covid-trials.org, then validated results on (B) clinicaltrials.gov and the (C) World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). We focused on trials which were completed or currently recruiting for patients, reasoning that the timeline to arrive at treatments by the end of the year would require completion within the next 6 months. We excluded studies which were clearly observational, with no randomization, control or comparison group. We furtherset a cutoff of 100 for numbers of subjects since smaller trial size could lack statistical power to establish superiority of the intervention over the control condition. Results. Published Data: We found 19 publications reporting findings on 6 classes of agents. There were 9 publications related to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), three on lopanovir/ritonavir (LPV/R) (one of which was combined with interferon beta-1),three on remdesivir, two on favipiravir, one on mepaluzamab, and one on tocilizumab. Ten publications reported randomized controlled trials, the rest were retrospective observational. Only one publication touched on outpatient management, the rest on hospitalized patients. Clinical Trials: We found 409 trials meeting our minimum requirement of 100 subjects which were recruiting or completed. The WHO has launched the Solidarity megatrial performed in over 100 countries actively comparing HCQ, lopanovir/ritonavir (LPV/R) alone and in combination with interferon beta-1, and remdesivir. That trial is scheduled to complete enrollment in the first quarter of 2021. In addition, we found 46 trials of HCQ, 11 trials of LPV/R and 8 trials of interferons. There were 18 ongoing trials of antiviral agents, 24 immune modulator trials, 9 vaccine trials, and 62 trials of other agents.We excluded a large number of trials of Chinese traditional medications, reasoning that there was insufficient clinical experience with these agents outside China to offer these treatments to the rest of the world. Forty four trials were hoping to complete enrollment by the end of the second quarter of 2020. Of these, only 9 were conducted on outpatients. A few vaccine trials are hoping to complete Phase 3 enrollment by the end of the third quarter, but a prolonged follow-up of patients will likely be required. Conclusion. Several treatments for severe disease in hospitalized patients have now been granted emergency authorization. However, the disease is propagated primarily by infected ambulatory individuals. There are only a few randomized controlled studies in outpatients which can be expected to yield results in time to impact on the continuing spread of the epidemic in 2020. It will be necessary for public health authorities to make hard decisions with limited data. The choices will be hardest in dealing with potential early release of vaccines.

To prepare neuropsychologists for the difficult task of differentiating PTSD-related from neuropathology-related deficits in the oncoming wave of COVID-19 survivors, we integrate research across a spectrum of related areas. METHODS Several areas of literature were reviewed: psychiatric, neurologic, and neuropathological outcomes of SARS and MERS patients; neurological outcomes in COVID-19 survivors; PTSD associated with procedures common to COVID-19 patients; and differentiating neuropsychological deficits due to PTSD from those due to acquired brain injuries in other patient groups. CONCLUSIONS Heightened risk of PTSD occurred in MERS and SARS survivors. While data concerning COVID-19 is lacking, PTSD is known to occur in patient groups who undergo similar hospital courses, including ICU survivors, patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated, and those that experience delirium. Research with patients who develop PTSD in the context of mild traumatic brain injury further suggests that PTSD may account for some or all of a patient's subjective cognitive complaints and neuropsychological test performance. Recommendations are provided for assessing PTSD in the context of COVID-19.","output":"Post-traumatic stress disorder: a differential diagnostic consideration for COVID-19 survivors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To investigate whether a four-week course of neuronavigated intermittent theta burst stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is superior to the non-neuronavigated F3-EEG method of positioning. Methods We conducted a single-center, two-arm, randomized and double-blinded study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03953521). 37 inpatients with an at least moderate depressive episode were randomized to receive either neuronavigated or 10-20-EEG-system based F3 guided iTBS. Both groups received twenty week daily sessions of intermittent theta burst stimulation while continuing to receive standard-of-care treatment by their ward physicians. For navigated iTBS, we used magnetic resonance imaging to target the border between the anterior and middle third of the middle frontal gyrus is considered to represent the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Differences in the treatment arms were blinded by completely mimicking the procedures of the respective other treatment group. Rating physicians were not involved in the treatment procedure. Primary outcome was defined as the change of the 21-item version of the Hamilton Depression Score (HAMD) from baseline to end of treatment at week 4. Secondary outcomes included HAMD score during the treatment, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, WHO Quality of Life-BREF and Clinical Global Impression. For primary outcome, we used a planned group comparison for the absolute change in the HAMD. For secondary outcome measures we calculated analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with the within-subjects factor time (primary: baseline vs. week 4; secondary: all visits) and the between-subjects factor group (navigated vs. F3 guided group). We also did planned contrasts between both groups for all variables and all treatment and follow-up visits with the aim not to oversee any group differences. For group contrasts we used Student T-tests for metric and chi-square tests for categorial variables. Significance threshold was set to 5% uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Results Enrolment of 80 patients with interim analysis was planned. Interim analysis was performed after 37 patients (intention to treat). 6 patients dropped out, leaving 31 for analysis. With respect to primary outcome criteria, absolute change in the HAMD did not differ significantly between groups. In accordance, relative change and number of responders and remitters were not significantly different. Overall number of responders was 53% and of remitters was 60%. On a descriptive level, the results favor the clinical effects of the F3 group for the absolute and relative change in the HAMD and the number of responders. Number of remitters were exactly the same for both groups. Therefore, we decided to stop the trial due to the added burden of magnetic resonance imaging and neuronavigated treatment in relation to the effect. Secondary outcomes did also not differ significantly between groups. Patients did not differ in their baseline characteristics nor with respect to intake of medication during the trial period and all had access to the same therapeutic interventions. Conclusion We noticed a high antidepressive effect of add-on intermittent theta burst treatment to standard inpatient treatment but failed to demonstrate a clinical superiority of neuronavigated localization. The non-navigated, F3 guided theta burst treatment used as a control group may be sophisticated enough to dilute potential added benefits, and the difference between the localization approaches is either negligible or too small to justify the additional efforts of navigation. The effects of concomitant treatment may mask effects, but our patient population reflects clinical reality in an inpatient setting. Further prospective studies are warranted to compare neuronavigated with surface-based approaches.","output":"A direct comparison of neuronavigated and non-neuronavigated intermittent theta burst stimulation in the treatment of depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the 2008 recession, Ireland has experienced large-scale doctor emigration. This paper seeks to ascertain whether (and how) the COVID-19 pandemic might disrupt or reinforce existing patterns of doctor emigration. METHOD: This paper draws on qualitative interviews with 31 hospital doctors in Ireland, undertaken in JuneCJuly 2020. As the researchers were subject to a government mandated work-from-home order at that time, they utilised Twitter? to contact potential respondents (snowball sampling); and conducted interviews via Zoom? or telephone. FINDINGS: Two cohorts of doctors were identified; COVID Returners (N = 12) and COVID Would-be Emigrants (N = 19). COVID Returners are Irish-trained emigrant doctors who returned to Ireland in March 2020, just as global travel ground to a halt. They returned to be closer to home and in response to a pandemic-related recruitment call issued by the Irish government. COVID Would-be Emigrants are hospital doctors considering emigration. Some had experienced pandemic-related disruptions to their emigration plans as a result of travel restrictions and border closures. However, most of the drivers of emigration mentioned by respondents related to underlying problems in the Irish health system rather than to the pandemic, i.e. a culture of medical emigration, poor working conditions and the limited availability of posts in the Irish health system. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This paper illustrates how the pandemic intensified and reinforced, rather than radically altered, the dynamics of doctor emigration from Ireland. Ireland must begin to prioritise doctor retention and return by developing a coherent policy response to the underlying drivers of doctor emigration.","output":"COVID-19 and doctor emigration: the case of Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: While a common phenomenon in other viral illnesses, data regarding coinfection/superinfections in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited and emerging. Superinfections may contribute to the overall high mortality in those suffering from severe COVID19. We aimed to study the rate of coinfections and secondary bacterial/fungal infections among SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in a community hospital. METHODS: This is a single-centre IRB approved, retrospective observational study. Adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time Reverse TranscriptaseCPolymerase Chain Reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swabs admitted from March 1st to April 20th 2020 were included. Relevant clinical and laboratory data were manually collected from electronic medical records. RESULTS: A total of 129 patients were included in the study. 91 patients had a respiratory pathogen panel PCR on admission. This panel includes testing for influenza, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Only one patient was positive for coinfection with the parainfluenza virus. None of them was found to be positive for bacterial coinfection at admission. Thirteen patients (10.1%) had secondary bacterial or fungal infections that developed during their respective hospital stays, 12 of them were critically ill. The mean duration from admission to the onset of secondary infection was 13 days. Positive Blood Cultures [Image: see text] Positive Lower Respiratory Tract Cultures [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our data revealed that the rate of viral coinfection was 1.1 % and bacterial coinfection was 0% at admission. Study timing can play a role as upper respiratory virus infection rate is low in the population during March and April. Secondary infections were found to be common in patients admitted to the ICU. Potential explanations for this include compromised immunity in severely ill patients, extended ICU stay, central venous catheters and endotracheal intubation. It is evident that with severe COVID-19 illness, an extended hospital course often ensues, leading to increased risk of secondary infections and contributing to the overall high mortality of these patients.

In this paper, we discuss the possible relationships among lysosomotropism, increasing lysosomal pH, and the SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease process, and we deduce a possible approach for treatment and prophylaxis. Lysosomotropism is a biological characteristic of small molecules, such as (hydroxyl)chloroquine, amitriptyline, NB 06, or sertraline, which is present in addition to intrinsic receptor-mediated or enzymatic pharmacological effects. Lysosomotropic compounds affect prominent inflammatory messengers, such as IL1B, CCL4, CCL20, and IL6, as well as cathepsin L dependent viral entry (fusion) into host cells. Therefore, this heterogeneous group of compounds is a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections, as well as influenza A infections and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) triggered by bacterial or viral infections. Patients who have already taken medications with lysosomotropic compounds for other pre-existing conditions may benefit from this treatment in the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased lysosomal pH levels play an important role in the disease process in common skin disorders, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, thus suggesting that affected individuals might benefit from their particular conditions in the COVID-19 pandemic. We suggest data analysis of patients with these diseases, and who are treated with lysosomotropic compounds, and, if the results are promising, subsequent clinical testing of off-label therapy with clinically approved lysosomotropic compounds in the current COVID-19 pandemic and future influenza A pandemics.","output":"Lysosomotropic Active CompoundsHidden Protection against COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 Infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using data on the daily number of motor vehicle collisions resulting in death or injury and adjusting for seasonality, a complicated analysis shows a small decrease when compared with England and Wales, where there is no minimum price for alcohol.

Antibodies were integrated in our medical repertoire against infectious diseases more than hundred years ago by using animal sera to treat tetanus and diphtheria.

The COVID-19 pandemic was a reminder about the importance of antibodies for therapy against infectious diseases. While monoclonal antibodies could be generated by hybridoma technology since the 70ies of the former century, nowadays antibody phage display, among other display technologies, is robustly established to discover new human monoclonal antibodies. Phage display is an in vitro technology which confers the potential for generating antibodies from universal libraries against any conceivable molecule of sufficient size and omits the limitations of the immune systems. If convalescent patients or immunized/infected animals are available, it is possible to construct immune phage display libraries to select in vivo affinity-matured antibodies. A further advantage is the availability of the DNA sequence encoding the phage displayed antibody fragment, which is packaged in the phage particles. Therefore, the selected antibody fragments can be rapidly further engineered in any needed antibody format according to the requirements of the final application.

However, there is little systematic tracking of global research and development. We present research on investments into infectious diseases research from funders in the G20 countries across an 18-year time period spanning 2000-17, comparing amounts invested for different conditions and considering the global burden of disease to identify potential areas of relative underfunding. METHODS: The study examined research awards made between 2000 and 2017 for infectious disease research from G20-based public and philanthropic funders. We searched research databases using a range of keywords, and open access data were extracted from funder websites. Awards were categorised by type of science, specialty, and disease or pathogen. Data collected included study title, abstract, award amount, funder, and year. We used descriptive statistics and Spearman's correlation coefficient to investigate the association between research investment and disease burden, using Global Burden of Disease 2017 study data. FINDINGS: The final 2000-17 dataset included 94a??074 awards for infectious disease research, with a sum investment of $1049 billion (annual range 41 billion to 84 billion) and a median award size of $257a??176 (IQR 62a??562-770a??661). Pre-clinical research received $611 billion (582%) across 70a??337 (748%) awards and public health research received $295 billion (281%) from 19a??197 (204%) awards. HIV/AIDS received $421 billion (401%), tuberculosis received $70 billion (67%), malaria received $56 billion (53%), and pneumonia received $35 billion (33%). Funding for Ebola virus ($12 billion), Zika virus ($03 billion), influenza ($44 billion), and coronavirus ($05 billion) was typically highest soon after a high-profile outbreak. There was a general increase in year-on-year investment in infectious disease research between 2000 and 2006, with a decline between 2007 and 2017. Funders based in the USA provided $816 billion (778%). Based on funding per 2017 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), HIV/AIDS received the greatest relative investment ($772 per DALY), compared with tuberculosis ($156 per DALY), malaria ($125 per DALY), and pneumonia ($33 per DALY). Syphilis and scabies received the least relative investment (both $9 per DALY). We observed weak positive correlation (r=030) between investment and 2017 disease burden. INTERPRETATION: HIV research received the highest amount of investment relative to DALY burden. Scabies and syphilis received the lowest relative funding. Investments for high-threat pathogens (eg, Ebola virus and coronavirus) were often reactive and followed outbreaks. We found little evidence that funding is proactively guided by global burden or pandemic risk. Our findings show how research investments are allocated and how this relates to disease burden and diseases with pandemic potential.

Postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) is a well-known phenomenon that may explain the olfactory dysfunction reported by SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Methods: A scoping literature review was performed to identify studies that investigated the mechanisms of postviral olfactory dysfunction. Studies demonstrating pathophysiological, histological, immunochemical, and epidemiological outcomes of PVOD were included. Results: Fourteen studies were included in addition to one international news article. Three studies reported destruction of the olfactory epithelium following intranasal inoculation of various viral strains in mice. Three studies isolated pathogenic, anosmia inciting viruses (Parainfluenza virus, Human Coronavirus, Rhinovirus) through nucleic acid amplification. Eleven studies demonstrated female predilection in patients with PVOD and COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction, of which the majority were over 50 years old.

As of 20 May 2020, there are a total of 5,085,449 confirmed cases and 329,239 death cases in the world with more than 200 countries affected. Malaysia reported a total of 7,009 confirmed cases, 5,706 recoveries and 114 deaths. According to the Global Web Index (GWI), it can be seen that there is a significant increase in the usage of social media among global users for the past month, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. By going online, people can stay updated to the news more easily and information can be spread at a higher speed. However, it can also bring negative impact among the users when people misuse this platform to spread fake news, causing misconception, anxiety and fear as they become viral. The spread of fake news can lead to several misconceptions among social media users, which can cause unnecessary fear and anxiety. For example, when Movement Control Order (MCO) was first announced in Malaysia on 16 March 2020, fake news about the shortage of food supply spread through the social media within hours, and this had led to more people rushing to the supermarkets to stock up their groceries.

The unique clinical phenomena in severe COVID-19 can be perplexing, and they include disproportionately severe hypoxemia relative to lung alveolar-parenchymal pathology and rapid clinical deterioration, with poor response to O(2) supplementation, despite preserved lung mechanics. Factors such as microvascular injury, thromboembolism, pulmonary hypertension, and alteration in hemoglobin structure and function could play important roles. Overwhelming immune response associated with cytokine storms could activate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may result in consumption of nitric oxide (NO), a critical vasodilation regulator. In other inflammatory infections, activated neutrophils are known to release myeloperoxidase (MPO) in a natural immune response, which contributes to production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl). However, during overwhelming inflammation, HOCl competes with O(2) at heme binding sites, decreasing O(2) saturation. Moreover, HOCl contributes to several oxidative reactions, including hemoglobin-heme iron oxidation, heme destruction, and subsequent release of free iron, which mediates toxic tissue injury through additional generation of ROS and NO consumption. Connecting these reactions in a multi-hit model can explain generalized tissue damage, vasoconstriction, severe hypoxia, and precipitous clinical deterioration in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

AIMS: The aim was to compare three interactive examination designs, all based on active learning pedagogy, in terms of nursing students engagement and preparedness, their learning achievement, and instructional aspects. METHODS: A comparative research design was used including final-year undergraduate nursing students. All students were enrolled in a quality improvement course at a metropolitan university in Sweden. In this comparative study to evaluate three course layouts, participants (Cohort 1, n = 89; Cohort 2, n = 97; Cohort 3, n = 60) completed different examinations assessing the same course content and learning objectives, after which they evaluated the examinations on a questionnaire in numerical and free-text responses. Chi-squared tests were conducted to compare background variables between the cohorts and KruskalCWallis H tests to assess numerical differences in experiences between cohorts. Following the guidelines of the Good Reporting of a Mixed Methods Study (GRAMMS), a sequential mixed-methods analysis was performed on the quantitative findings, and the qualitative findings were used complementary to support the interpretation of the quantitative results.

In fall 2020, national guidance for reopening omitted testing or screening recommendations. We report the experience of 2 large independent K-12 schools (School-A and School-B) that implemented an array of SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies that included periodic universal testing. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 was identified through periodic universal PCR testing, self-reporting of tests conducted outside school, and contact tracing. Schools implemented behavioral and structural mitigation measures, including mandatory masks, classroom disinfecting, and social distancing. RESULTS: Over the fall semester, School-A identified 112 cases in 2320 students and staff; School-B identified 25 cases (2.0%) in 1400 students and staff. Most cases were asymptomatic and none required hospitalization. Of 69 traceable introductions, 63 (91%) were not associated with school-based transmission, 59 cases (54%) occurred in the 2 weeks post-thanksgiving.

There was no transmission from students to staff. CONCLUSIONS: Although school-age children can contract and transmit SARS-CoV-2, rates of COVID-19 infection related to in-person education were significantly lower than those in the surrounding community. However, social activities among students outside of school undermined those measures and should be discouraged, perhaps with behavioral contracts, to ensure the safety of school communities.

In 2009, in order to assess outcomes and evaluate risk factors for progression of illness, two cohort studies were initiated: FLU 002 in outpatients and FLU 003 in hospitalized patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between October 2009 and December 2012, adults with influenza-like illness (ILI) were enrolled; outpatients were followed for 14 days and inpatients for 60 days. Disease progression was defined as hospitalization and/or death for outpatients, and hospitalization for >28 days, transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) if enrolled from general ward, and/or death for inpatients. Infection was confirmed by RT-PCR. 590 FLU 002 and 392 FLU 003 patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 were enrolled from 81 sites in 17 countries at 2 days (IQR 1C3) and 6 days (IQR 4C10) following ILI onset, respectively. Disease progression was experienced by 29 (1 death) outpatients (5.1%; 95% CI: 3.4C7.2%) and 80 inpatients [death (32), hospitalization >28 days (43) or ICU transfer (20)] (21.6%; 95% CI: 17.5C26.2%). Disease progression (death) for hospitalized patients was 53.1% (26.6%) and 12.8% (3.8%), respectively, for those enrolled in the ICU and general ward.

Few data are available comparing the cost and clinical and angiographic outcomes associated with available techniques. The aim of this study is to compare the cost and efficacy of current endovascular stroke therapies. METHODS A single-center retrospective review was performed of the medical record and hospital financial database of all ischemic stroke cases admitted from 2009 to 2013. Three discrete treatment methodologies used during this time were compared: traditional Penumbra System (PS), stent retriever with local aspiration (SRLA) and A Direct Aspiration first Pass Technique (ADAPT). Statistical analyses of clinical and angiographic outcomes and costs for each group were performed. RESULTS 222 patients (45% men) underwent mechanical thrombectomy. Successful revascularization was defined as Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2b/3 flow, which was achieved in 79% of cases with PS, 83% of cases with SRLA, and 95% of cases with ADAPT. The average total cost of hospitalization for patients was $51,599 with PS, $54,700 with SRLA, and $33 ,11 with ADAPT (p<0.0001). Average times to recanalization were 88 min with PS, 47 min with SRLA, and 37 min with ADAPT (p<0.0001). Similar rates of good functional outcomes were seen in the three groups (PS 36% vs SRLA 43% vs ADAPT 47%; p=0.4).

The following variables were extracted for this study: age, gender, temperature, and saturation of oxygen on admission, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, heparin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir, together with data on mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations. At the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1449 had been discharged home from the hospitals, 240 were still admitted, and 85 had been transferred to hospitals not included in the study. Median follow-up time was 8 (IQR 5-12) days. Hydroxychloroquine had been used in 1857 patients. Hydroxychloroquine was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender, with OR (95% CI): 0.44 (0.29-0.67). This association remained significant when saturation of oxygen < 90% and temperature > 37 C were added to de model with OR 0.45 (0.30-0.68) p < 0.001, and also when all the other drugs, and time of admission, were included as covariates.

These images that represent a lack of quality training can then be annotated and used to fully train a U-net-based segmentation model. The proposed QU-net++ model detects this lack of quality training based on the disagreement in segmentations produced from the final two output layers.

Detailed information about the lifetime and kinematics of airborne droplets of different size is relevant in order to evaluate hygiene measures like wearing masks but also social distancing and ventilation concepts for indoor environments. However, the evaporation process of expiratory droplets and aerosols is not fully understood. Consequently, the main objective of this study is to present evaporation characteristics of saliva droplets. An acoustic levitator is utilized in conjunction with microscopic imaging for recording the temporal evolution of the evaporation of saliva droplets under well-defined ambient conditions. Following the evaporation of the water content, a saliva droplet reaches a final size, which remains stable in the timescale of hours. By investigating numerous droplets of different size, it was found that the final droplet diameter correlates well to 20 % of the initial diameter. This correlation is independent of the ambient conditions for a temperature range from 20 C to 29 C and a relative humidity from 6 % to up to 65 %. The experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics are implemented into a numerical model, which is based on one-dimensional droplet kinematics and a rapid mixing evaporation model. By taking into account the evaporation-falling curve as presented by Wells, the significance of the experimental results for predicting the lifetime of saliva droplets and aerosols is demonstrated.

TLRs play an important role in innate immune responses to infection. The host has evolved to use other TLR and PAMP agonists as agents to stimulate a protective inflammatory immune response against infection. Because only a small number of doses are given, TLR agonists appear to have greater potential and fewer safety concerns than other uses as vaccine adjuvants. In the present days, development of peptides targeting immune response can be approved for survival in biological monitoring systems before vaccine exposures. Peptide vaccines are easy to synthesize, more stable and relatively safe. In addition, production of peptides becomes simple, easily reproducible, fast and cost effective. Getting vaccinated against Covid-19, which has become a pandemic in the human population, is the most practical way to control the outbreak. The new coronavirus does not contain a drug or vaccine to prevent it from spreading to humans. To getting a proper vaccine candidate against the novel coronavirus, the present study used the reverse vaccinology approach by using a complete set of SARS-CoV-2 proteins; such as: Spike, Envelope, Nucleocapsid, Membrane, NSPs, and ORFs to extract the antigenic elements that produce B-cell, T-cell and IFN positive epitopes. These epitopes with precise binding to the Toll-Like receptors (1-10) have developed epitope based vaccine candidates. We have prioritized a set of epitopes based on their antigenicity, allergenicity, sequence conservation and projected population coverage world-wide. The selected epitopes were employed for in-silico docking interactions with Toll-Like receptors and molecular dynamic simulation confirmed the stability of the vaccine candidates resulting epitope of spike proteins with both the TLR 7 and 8 shows the best binding affinity. We believe that this ideal epitope vaccine candidate could enhance the immune response of the host and reduce the reinfection risk.","output":"Inferring Toll-Like Receptor induced epitope subunit vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2: A Reverse Vaccinology approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In April 2020 in order to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 on the territory of the Russian Federation, strict quarantine measures were introduced.

These leaks can be difficult to manage given the limited field of view and lack of deep access. Herein, we describe 8 consecutive patients who underwent intraoperative repair of CSF leak, with no postoperative evidence of wound dehiscence or drainage. METHODS A retrospective review was performed on 8 cases where CSF leak was encountered during an anterior cervical spine surgery. Patients had ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, intradural disk herniation, or dural ectasia. Intraoperative repair was as follows. First, CSF was drained to low pressure, and durotomy was covered by dural substitute and sealant agent. Then the interbody graft used was manually undersized in the anteroposterior dimension to allow for expansion of the agents used. Anterior instrumentation was then performed. Finally, a wound drain was anchored to a biologic bag for shoulder level passive drainage. RESULTS In all 8 cases, there were no cases of wound dehiscence or CSF leak using this strategy. Likewise, there was no evidence of cord compression or neurologic deficits. No meningitis or persistent headaches were reported, and there was no need for lumbar drain placement at any time postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Once durotomy is encountered during anterior spine surgery, draining the CSF to a low pressure followed by dural substitute with a sealing agent, followed by a smaller anteroposterior size graft is an effective strategy of preventing complications in an inescapable problem.","output":"Reliable Intraoperative Repair Nuances of Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak in Anterior Cervical Spine Surgery and Review of the Literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to reduce transmission of COVID-19, social distancing measures were proposed, including spatial distancing (2m distance), or even generalized lockdown.

Aim of our study, is to identify and compare the characteristics of cases referred for autopsy during the first month of the lockdown period for the COVID-19 outbreak, versus the cases referred during the same period in 2019. 231 autopsy cases were included in our study, 125 in 2019 and 106 in 2020. Regarding gender, age and nationality, no significant differences were detected between the two time periods. Age subgroup analysis demonstrated increased number of cases within the age group 70-79 years, in 2020. As to the place of death, the increase in the percentage of out-of-hospital deaths was not confirmed as statistically significant. Regarding type of death (violent, sudden/unexpected), the drop of violent deaths in the 2020 examined period, was not confirmed as statistically significant; however, further subgroup analysis showed a significant drop of fatal injuries resulting from road traffic accidents in the 2020 period. The slight increase of sudden/unexpected deaths, especially myocardial infarction cases, did not reach statistical significance. One month after lockdown, we cannot detect significant differences in the two time periods examined. Further study should be conducted soon when more data will become available. Frequency of fatal myocardial infarction seems to remain unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic while deaths resulting from road traffic accidents exhibit a significant decrease. Homicides and suicides remain at low levels, in our jurisdiction area, seemingly unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. It appears that since sudden/unexpected deaths, statistically remain unaffected, the preventive measures taken by the Greek authorities prevented overwhelming of the healthcare system, which could function properly.","output":"Impact of Covid-19 lockdown on characteristics of autopsy cases in Greece.

NG2 cells are known for their ability to differentiate into oligodendrocytes and are commonly referred to as oligodendrocyte precursor cells. However, recent investigations have begun to identify additional functions of NG2 cells in CNS health and pathology. NG2 cells form physical and functional connections with neurons and other glial cell types throughout the CNS, allowing them to monitor and respond to the neural environment. Growing evidence indicates that NG2 cells become reactive under pathological conditions, though their specific roles are only beginning to be elucidated. While reactive microglia and astrocytes are well-established contributors to neuroinflammation and the development of epilepsy following CNS infection, the dynamics of NG2 cells remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated NG2 cell reactivity in a viral-induced mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: C57BL6/J mice were injected intracortically with Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) or PBS. Mice were graded twice daily for seizures between 3 and 7 days post-injection (dpi). At 4 and 14 dpi, brains were fixed and stained for NG2, the microglia/macrophage marker IBA1, and the proliferation marker Ki-67. Confocal z stacks were acquired in both the hippocampus and the overlying cortex. Total field areas stained by each cell marker and total field area of colocalized pixels between NG2 and Ki67 were compared between groups. RESULTS: Both NG2 cells and microglia/macrophages displayed increased immunoreactivity and reactive morphologies in the hippocampus of TMEV-injected mice. While increased immunoreactivity for IBA1 was also present in the cortex, there was no significant change in NG2 immunoreactivity in the cortex following TMEV infection. Colocalization analysis for NG2 and Ki-67 revealed a significant increase in overlap between NG2 and Ki-67 in the hippocampus of TMEV-injected mice at both time points, but no significant differences in cortex. CONCLUSIONS: NG2 cells acquire a reactive phenotype and proliferate in response to TMEV infection.

After 2 days of antibiotic therapy the fever still persisted, so the individual was admitted to the local hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 2 days he was transferred to our spinal unit. Considering the worsening of the chest X-ray and fever despite 48 h of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, we strongly suspected viral pneumonia.

This study aimed to: (i) identify the nutrient density-to-cost ratio of NZ foods; (ii) model the impact of substituting foods with a lower nutrient density-to-cost ratio with those with a higher nutrient density-to-cost ratio on diet quality and affordability in representative NZ population samples for low and medium socioeconomic status (SES) households by ethnicity; and (iii) evaluate food processing level. Foods were categorized, coded for processing level and discretionary status, analyzed for nutrient density and cost, and ranked by nutrient density-to-cost ratio. The top quartile of nutrient dense, low-cost foods were 56% unprocessed (vegetables, fruit, porridge, pasta, rice, nuts/seeds), 31% ultra-processed (vegetable dishes, fortified bread, breakfast cereals unfortified <15 g sugars/100 g and fortified 15C30 g sugars/100 g), 6% processed (fruit juice), and 6% culinary processed (oils). Using substitution modeling, diet quality improved by 59% and 71% for adults and children, respectively, and affordability increased by 20C24%, depending on ethnicity and SES. The NZ diet can be made healthier and more affordable when nutritious, low-cost foods are selected. Processing levels in the healthier, modeled diet suggest that some non-discretionary ultra-processed foods may provide a valuable source of low-cost nutrition for food insecure populations.","output":"Nutrient Dense, Low-Cost Foods Can Improve the Affordability and Quality of the New Zealand DietA Substitution Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, breastfeeding women have experienced restricted access to support, placing them at increased risk of mental health concerns and limited breastfeeding assistance. This study investigated the effect of the pandemic on feeding choices and maternal wellbeing amongst breastfeeding mothers living in Australian and New Zealand. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey that examined feeding methods, maternal mental wellbeing, worries, challenges, and positive experiences during the pandemic. Most women were exclusively breastfeeding (82%). Partial breastfeeding was associated with perceived low milk supply and longer pregnancy duration during the pandemic. Reduced mental health and wellbeing was associated with lower levels of family functioning, increased perceived stress, and perinatal anxiety. Longer pregnancy duration during the pandemic was associated with lower mental health wellbeing scores, while higher perceived stress scores were reported for regions with higher COVID-19 infection rates and women with perceived low milk supply. Women reported that the pandemic resulted in less pressure and more time for family bonding, while worries about the pandemic, family health, and parenting challenges were also cited. Mental health concerns of breastfeeding women appear to be exacerbated by COVID-19, highlighting a critical need for access to mental health and broader family support during the pandemic.","output":"Wellbeing of Breastfeeding Women in Australia and New Zealand during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been much talk of psychological science undergoing a renaissance with recent years being marked by dramatic changes in research practices and to the publishing landscape.

The results from our analyses reveal that students perceived the simulation as similar to a natural infectious disease and that the immersive components of the simulation afforded students the opportunity to discuss their understandings of natural disease and to compare them to their experiences with the virtual disease. We found that while the virtual disease capitalized on students knowledge of natural infectious disease through virtual symptoms, these symptoms may have led students to think of its transfer more as an observable or mechanical event rather than as a biological process.

The main aim of this study was to analyze mRNA expression in the tears of patients with COVID-19 compared with healthy subjects using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). The functional evaluation of the transcriptome highlighted 25 genes that differ statistically between healthy individuals and patients affected by COVID-19. In particular, the NGS analysis identified the presence of several genes involved in B cell signaling and keratinization. In particular, the genes involved in B cell signaling were downregulated in the tears of COVID-19 patients, while those involved in keratinization were upregulated.

Because respirators are basic personal protective equipment to protect frontline healthcare workers against COVID-19, the chronic, global shortage of N95/N99 masks is one of the most urgent threats to our collective ability to save lives from the coronavirus. The reuse of masks may need to be considered as a crisis capacity strategy to ensure continued availability even though most of the masks are considered one-time use. Moreover, environmentalists warn that single-use masks add to the glut of plastic pollution, threatening the health of oceans and marine life. In this study, we develop a method to decontaminate respirators to reuse filtering facepiece respirators. Samples of SARS-CoV-2 are applied to the 4  4 cm(2) samples of FFP2 and FFP3 respirator materials. The filtration efficiency of plasma treated samples is measured using a planar particle image velocimetry technique with a neutrally charged polydisperse aerosol particle of NaCl. The measured viral decontamination and filtration efficiencies show that the developed plasma decontamination system can achieve a 4-log reduction for the coronavirus without reducing the filtration efficiency of masks after 5-min plasma exposure. The developed plasma decontamination system demonstrates the feasibility to tackle the acute shortages of FFRs in many countries and their environmental and economic burdens against discarding reusable masks.","output":"Development of a rapid plasma decontamination system for decontamination and reuse of filtering facepiece respirators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) receive disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), such as teriflunomide, to reduce disease activity and slow progression. DMTs mediate their efficacy by modulating or suppressing the immune system, which might affect a patient's response to vaccination. As vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus become available, questions have arisen around their efficacy and safety for patients with MS who are receiving DMTs. Data are beginning to emerge regarding the potential influence of certain DMTs on a patient's response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and are supported by evidence from vaccination studies of other pathogens. This review summarizes the available data on the response to vaccines in patients with MS who are receiving DMTs, with a focus on teriflunomide. It also provides an overview of the leading COVID-19 vaccines and current guidance around COVID-19 vaccination for patients with MS. Though few vaccination studies have been done for this patient population, teriflunomide appears to have minimal influence on the response to seasonal influenza vaccine. The evidence for other DMTs (e.g., fingolimod, glatiramer acetate) is less consistent: some studies suggest no effect of DMTs on vaccine response, whereas others show reduced vaccine efficacy. No unexpected safety signals have emerged in any vaccine study. Current guidance for patients with MS is to continue DMTs during COVID-19 vaccination, though adjusted timing of dosing for some DMTs may improve the vaccine response.","output":"Vaccine Response in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis Receiving Teriflunomide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated vaccine acceptance of putative COVID-19 vaccines among a national sample of vaccine hesitant parents.

DESIGN: Multinational network cohort study. SETTING: Hospital electronic health records from the United States, Spain, and China, and nationwide claims data from South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: 303 264 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 from January 2020 to December 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prescriptions or dispensations of any drug on or 30 days after the date of hospital admission for covid-19. RESULTS: Of the 303 264 patients included, 290 131 were from the US, 7599 from South Korea, 5230 from Spain, and 304 from China. 3455 drugs were identified. Common repurposed drugs were hydroxychloroquine (used in from <5 (<2%) patients in China to 2165 (85.1%) in Spain), azithromycin (from 15 (4.9%) in China to 1473 (57.9%) in Spain), combined lopinavir and ritonavir (from 156 (<2%) in the VA-OMOP US to 2,652 (34.9%) in South Korea and 1285 (50.5%) in Spain), and umifenovir (0% in the US, South Korea, and Spain and 238 (78.3%) in China). Use of adjunctive drugs varied greatly, with the five most used treatments being enoxaparin, fluoroquinolones, ceftriaxone, vitamin D, and corticosteroids. Hydroxychloroquine use increased rapidly from March to April 2020 but declined steeply in May to June and remained low for the rest of the year. The use of dexamethasone and corticosteroids increased steadily during 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple drugs were used in the first few months of the covid-19 pandemic, with substantial geographical and temporal variation. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and umifenovir (in China only) were the most prescribed repurposed drugs.

Herein, we reported a successful critical case of COVID-19 and shared our experience of treatment, which would do a favor for other COVID-19 patients. CASE SUMMARY: : A 65-year-old man, Wuhan citizen, was infected by COVID-19, and his pulmonary lesions progressed quickly in five days. On admission to Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China, the immediate arterial blood gas(ABG) analysis showed the PaO2/FiO2(P/F) ratio was 134.4mmHg, moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) was diagnosed. Emergency tracheal intubation was performed, and the initial ventilator mode and parameters were set up based on the lung-protective ventilation strategy, but the P/F ratio could not be improved, and then the prone position ventilation was carried out for four consecutive days, as long as 16 hours every day, the P/F ratio rose to 180mmHg approximately, which still did not reach to the standard of extubation. And then we found that it was complicated with acute cor pulmonale(ACP) by ultrasound examination, dobutamine and diuretic were used for the treatment of ACP caused by ARDS successfully, and the P/F ratio went up to about 250mmHg. Seven days later after admission, the endotracheal intubation was successfully removed, after extubation, High-Flow nasal cannula(HFNC) oxygen therapy was used as a sequential strategy to prevent reintubation. Ultimately, he was discharged on day 34 after admission. CONCLUSION: : Our case presented the treatment process of a critical COVID-19.

Sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome from patient samples is an important epidemiological tool for monitoring and responding to the pandemic, including the emergence of new mutations in specific communities. METHODS. SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from positive samples collected, along with epidemiological metadata, at a walk-up, rapid testing site in the Mission District of San Francisco, California during November 22-December 2, 2020 and January 10-29, 2021. Secondary household attack rates and mean sample viral load were estimated and compared across observed variants. RESULTS. A total of 12,124 tests were performed yielding 1,099 positives. From these, 811 high quality genomes were generated. Certain viral lineages bearing spike mutations, defined in part by L452R, S13I, and W152C, comprised 54.9% of the total sequences from January, compared to 15.7% in November. Household contacts exposed to West Coast variants were at higher risk of infection compared to household contacts exposed to lineages lacking these variants (0.357 vs 0.294, RR=1.29; 95% CI:1.01-1.64). The reproductive number was estimated to be modestly higher than other lineages spreading in California during the second half of 2020. Viral loads were similar among persons infected with West Coast versus non-West Coast strains, as was the proportion of individuals with symptoms (60.9% vs 64.1%). CONCLUSIONS. The increase in prevalence, relative household attack rates, and reproductive number are consistent with a modest transmissibility increase of the West Coast variants; however, additional laboratory and epidemiological studies are required to better understand differences between these variants.","output":"Estimation of secondary household attack rates for emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants detected by genomic surveillance at a community-based testing site in San Francisco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies showed that miR-874 expression was abnormally expressed in many tumors.

This challenges universities that extensively investigated educational technologies. Stakeholders are keen to understand the underlying factors and mechanisms that influence technology adoption. However, the extant contradictive and inconsistent research findings from individual country or region fail to address the problem. To provide a holistic view, we follow the PRISMA protocol and synthesize 145 empirical studies across 42 countries and regions from 2001 to 2020. Our main contribution lies in integrating the institutional theory and the elements of country, culture, and university with the decision to adopt VLEs. Specifically, we develop three individual themes and two institutional themes about the factor characteristics. Power distance associates with the institutional cognitive-cultural influence, and long- and short-term orientation affects VLE adoption through the institutional normative facilitation. Masculinity-femininity links to individual cognition, while uncertainty avoidance has a connection with individual digital capability in the VLE adoption processes.

At the core of the scheduling tool is a hierarchical optimization model that generates a feasible schedule with the highest total preference score while satisfying the maximum possible demand. Feasible schedules had to abide by a set of complex seniority requirements which prioritized more senior nurses when allocating the available shifts. Our scheduling tool was implemented in a 391-bed home in Toronto. The tool allowed nursing managers to generate feasible schedules within a fraction of an hour, in contrast to the status-quo manual approach which could took up to tens of hours.

Nanoparticles (NPs) can offer a handful of tools to tackle these problems by enabling efficacious and safe delivery of both virus- and host-directed therapeutics. Furthermore, they can enable maximized clinical outcome while eliminating the chance of resistance to therapy by tissue-targeting and concomitant delivery of multiple therapeutics. The promising application of NPs as vaccine platforms is reflected by the major advances in developing novel COVID-19 vaccines. Two of the most critical COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA-based vaccines delivered via NPs, making them the first FDA-approved mRNA vaccines. Besides, NPs have been deployed as simple, rapid, and precise tools for point of care disease diagnosis.

We found that, during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the nationwide reduced air pollution (except for O3) could be largely explained by traffic control measures. During the traffic control period, every doubling of vehicle density was associated with a decrease of 4.2 (2.0, 6.4) g/m3 in PM2.5, 5.5 (2.9, 8.1) g/m3 in PM10, 1.5 (0.9, 2.0) g/m3 in NO2, and 0.04 (0.02, 0.07) mg/m3 in CO comparing cities with different vehicle densities. Similarly, for every 10% increase in the truck proportion, PM2.5 decreased by 12.3 (4.1, 20.6) g/m3, PM10 decreased by 14.3 (4.6, 23.9) g/m3, and CO decreased by 0.14 (0.05, 0.23) mg/m3. Moreover, the associations between vehicle density and reduction in PM2.5, PM10, and CO during the traffic control period were stronger and showed near-complete linearity in cities with low green coverage rate (All P < 0.05 for interaction). According to our estimation, PM2.5 emissions from every doubling of vehicle density can lead to over 8000 excess deaths per year, 66% of which were caused by cardiopulmonary diseases.

While current telediagnostic possibilities are often limited to a verbal consultation, the field of surgery has already made use of robotics for one of the most challenging areas of medicine: invasive procedures. Since comprehensive diagnostics are a prerequisite for each surgery, we built upon the knowledge gained in telesurgery and developed a telediagnostic system that allows for an extensive perioperative and emergency examination. It is based on a robotic platform consisting of a remote lead robotic arm at the physician's site and a follower robot at the patient's site. Mirroring all movements directly and using force-feedback, both parties can precisely interact, enabling tasks such as auscultation, percussion, and palpation without the need for extensive training. Our overall setup also includes the possibility to measure and monitor all relevant vital parameters and can be used to perform ear and nasopharyngeal inspections as well as an automatic swab to screen for COVID or other contagious diseases prior to hospital admission. In this paper, we focus on the potential of this technology for the surgical community by demonstrating the ease of adding an ultrasound probe to our modular setup to perform a high-quality emergency ultrasound examination.

With limited space and degraded resources in coastal areas, offshore waters will be a particular focus of Blue Economy expansion over the next decade. When emerging and established economic sectors expand in offshore waters (within national Exclusive Economic Zones), different potential Blue Economy opportunities and challenges will arise. Following a series of interdisciplinary workshops, we imagine two technically possible futures for the offshore Blue Economy and we identify the actions required to achieve the more sustainable outcome. Under a business as usual scenario the focus will remain on economic growth, the commodification of nature, the dominance of private over public and cultural interests, and prioritisation of the interests of current over future generations. A more sustainable scenario would meet multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals and ensure inclusive economic developments, environmental sustainability, and fair and equitable access to resources and technologies across users, nations, and generations. Challenges to this more sustainable future are a lack of infrastructure and technology to support emerging offshore sectors, limited understanding of environmental impacts, inequitable outcomes, and a lack of planning and governmental oversight. Addressing these challenges will require a shift in societal values, a more balanced allocation of funding to offshore activities, transparency in information sharing between industries and across nations, and adjustment of international legal and institutional mechanisms. The sustainable and equitable offshore Blue Economy we envisage is achievable and provides a unique opportunity to build global capacity and partnership.

There are some problems in the segmentation of stroke lesions, such as imbalance of the front and back scenes, uncertainty of position, and unclear boundary. To meet this challenge, this paper proposes a cross-attention and deep supervision UNet (CADS-UNet) to segment chronic stroke lesions from T1-weighted MR images. Specifically, we propose a cross-spatial attention module, which is different from the usual self-attention module. The location information interactively selects encode features and decode features to enrich the lost spatial focus. At the same time, the channel attention mechanism is used to screen the channel characteristics. Finally, combined with deep supervision and mixed loss, the model is supervised more accurately.

The infection results in a dysregulated systemic inflammation, multi-organ dysfunction, and critical illness. Cells of the central nervous system (CNS) are also affected triggering a dysregulated neuroinflammatory response.Low doses of glucocorticoids (GCs) orally or intravenously administered has been proved to reduce mortality of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. However, low doses administered by those routes do not reach therapeutic levels in the CNS. In contrast, if dexamethasone is administered by the intranasal route can result in therapeutic doses in the CNS even at low doses of the GC. Methods: : This is an approved multicentric randomized controlled protocol to compare the effectiveness of low doses of intranasal dexamethasone versus intravenous administered in adult moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. The protocol is conducted in five health institutions in Mexico City. A total of 120 patients will be randomized in two groups (intravenous vs intranasal) at 1:1 ratio, both groups will be treated with these dexamethasone schemes for 10 days. The primary outcome of the study will be clinical improvement, defined as a statistically significant higher reduction in the NEWS-2 score in intranasally versus intravenously dexamethasone treated patients. The second outcome will be the reduction in mortality during hospitalization. Conclusions: : This protocol is currently undertaken to improve the efficacy of the standard therapeutic dexamethasone regimen for moderate and severe COVID-19 patients.

Because there were large concerns about the spread of COVID-19 among citizens thereafter, we conduct a follow-up cross-sectional study to estimate the seroprevalence, and we also added a validation study using a different assay.We conducted cross-sectional serologic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody using 1000 samples from patients at outpatient settings who visited the clinic from May 26 to June 7, 2020, stratified by the decade of age and sex. We used both Kurabo and Abbott serology assays to identify IgG against SARS-CoV-2.There were 18 and 2 positive IgG among 1000 serum samples using Kurabo and Abbott serology assays, respectively (1.8%, 95% CI 1.1%-2.8%, and 0.2%, 95% CI 0.02%-0.7% respectively). By applying the latter figure to the census of Kobe City (population: 1,518,870), it is estimated that the number of people with positive IgG is 3038 (95% CI: 304-10,632) while a total of 285 patients were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at the end of the study period.

BV13 is a 54-month prospective longitudinal cohort study of 111 subjects who were present in the Bataclan concert hall during the November 2015 terrorist attack in Paris. Objectives Our first objective was to investigate the association between stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic and PTSD symptoms, notably with respect to two positive risk factors: trait mindfulness and social support. The second was to explore how PTSD severity mediated the relationship between trait mindfulness and COVID-19-induced stress. Method The primary endpoint was evaluated using the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). PTSD symptoms were evaluated using the PTSD Check List Scale (PCL-5) during the sanitary crisis and two years before. Social support was assessed with a Likert scale that measured perceived support from family, friends and the workplace. Trait mindfulness was measured with the 14-item Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI). Results 54 months after the attack, a univariate analysis identified a significant positive correlation between COVID-19 stress (CPDI) and PCL-5 (r=0.77, p<0.01) scores, on the one hand, and significant negative correlations with FMI (r=C0.59, p<0.01), and social support (r=C0.28, p<0.01) scores, on the other hand. In the multivariate model, CPDI scores were closely associated with PCL-5 scores (p<0.01) after adjustment for FMI and social support scores. CPDI and FMI scores were significantly associated (p=0.05), but not CPDI and social support scores (p=0.89). The PTSD score was a strong mediator of the relationship between trait mindfulness (FMI) and COVID-19 stress (CPDI) scores. Conclusion PTSD symptoms diminished the beneficial impact of trait mindfulness on stress related to COVID-19. Our finding highlights that subjects with previous experience of trauma need specific treatment for PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 crisis. HIGHLIGHTS Trait mindfulness may be protective against COVID-19 crisis-induced stress. This protection could be compromised by the presence of PTSD symptoms. Patients with PTSD should receive special psychological monitoring during the health crisis.","output":"Stress induced by the COVID-19 health situation in a cohort of 111 subjects present in the Bataclan concert hall during the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris Estrs inducido por la situacin de salud del COVID-19 en una cohorte de 111 sujetos presentes en la sala de conciertos Bataclan durante los atentados terroristas de noviembre del 2015 en Paris  11 °ֲϮڼ 111 ԶCOVID-19 ״Ӧ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objective Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are commonly used for the treatment of patients with heart disease, hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM) In the aftermath of the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, initial data raised concerns that ACE/ARB use can increase the expression of ACE2 receptors, leading to the worsening of COVID-19 However, recent studies have suggested that their use might be safe in a select subgroup of patients We conducted a single-center retrospective study to evaluate the association of in-patient use of ACE/ARB with outcomes among a predominantly ethnic minority patient population of the inner New York City (NYC) Methods This was a retrospective analysis of all hospital admissions with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2020 Results Of the 469 patients included in the study, 91 patients (19 4%) used ACE/ARB therapy during their hospital stay and were labeled as ACE/ARB group Patients in the ACE/ARB therapy group were older and had a higher incidence of HTN, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure, DM, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Admission D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were similar between the two groups, but absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was lower in the non-ACE/ARB group (0 971 k/ul vs 1 135 k/ul, p=0 0144) The incidence of hyperkalemia and the rise in creatinine were similar between the two groups Univariate analysis by treatment group using the log-rank test produced significant results (p=0 0062), indicating a higher survival rate for the ACE/ARB group Conclusion The use of ACE/ARB appears to be safe in all patients in whom their use is medically indicated","output":"The Association of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors With Outcomes Among a Predominantly Ethnic Minority Patient Population Hospitalized With COVID-19: The Bronx Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the development and implementation of inclusive COVID-19 (corona disease 2019) Feminist Framework (CFF) on the equitability of response for researchers, health care advocates, and public health policymakers at international platforms.

Methods Data from the European Renal Association COVID-19 Database (ERACODA) were used. KFRT-patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 1st, 2020, and January 31st, 2021 were included. The association of Quetelet's body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2), divided into: <18.5 (lean), 18.5-24.9 (normal weight), 25-29.9 (overweight), 30-34.9 (obese I) and 35 (obese II/III), with 3-month mortality was investigated using Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses. Results In 3,160 patients on KFRT (mean age:65 years, male:61%), 99 patients were lean, 1,151 normal weight (reference), 1,160 overweight, 525 obese I, and 225 obese II/III. During follow-up of 3 months, 28%, 20%, 21%, 23%, and 27% of patients died in these categories, respectively. In the fully adjusted model, the HRs for 3-month mortality were 1.65 (95%CI:1.10,2.47), 1 (ref.), 1.07 (95%CI:0.89,1.28), 1.17 (95%CI:0.93,1.46) and 1.71 (95%CI:1.27,2.30), respectively. Results were similar among dialysis patients (N = 2,343) and among those living with a kidney transplant (N = 817) (pinteraction = 0.99), but differed by sex (pinteraction = 0.019). In males, the HRs for the association of aforementioned BMI categories with 3-month mortality were 2.07 (95% CI:1.22, 3.52), 1 (Ref.), 0.97 (95% CI: 0.78. 1.21), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.33) and 1.22 (95%CI:0.78, 1.91) respectively, and in females corresponding HRs were 1.34 (95% CI: 0.70, 2.57), 1 (Ref.), 1.31 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.85), 1.54 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.26) and 2.49 (95%CI:1.62, 3.84) respectively..

The types of messages that may be effective in alerting smokers to this risk and encouraging a quit attempt are unknown. The aim of this study was to test a series of messages to identify potentially effective communication approaches. METHODS: An online survey was completed by 1509 smokers across three countries (Australia: n = 604; New Zealand: n = 304; United Kingdom: n = 601) in April-May 2020. Respondents were randomly assigned to view just one of four quit messages, two of which explicitly referred to the coronavirus, one referred to risk of chest infection, and one encouraged cessation for financial reasons. Outcome variables included quit intentions, further information seeking, message perceptions, and health and financial concerns. RESULTS: All four messages were associated with significant differences in the proportions of respondents intending to quit within the following 2 wk (increase range: 11%-34%) and with substantial proportions of respondents electing to access additional information (range: 37%-50%). The differences in intentions were significantly larger for the two health-related messages that specifically mentioned the coronavirus. All messages were perceived favorably in terms of acceptability, believability, effectiveness, and personal relevance. Negligible differences in health and financial concerns were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom appear likely to be receptive to messages about their COVID-related risk. Such messages have the potential to increase quit intentions and prompt information-seeking behaviors.

Analysis of these outbreaks highlighted the main drivers of cholera including contaminated drinking water and food, inadequate sanitation and hygiene (including open defecation), and direct contact between households. The comparison between 2011C2015 and 2016C2020 showed a decreasing trend in the outbreaks that arose due to damaged water pipelines. Many Indians still struggle with open defecation, sanitation, and clean water access. These issues should be addressed critically. In addition, it is essential to interrupt cholera short-cycle transmission (mediated by households, stored drinking water and foodstuffs) during an outbreak. As cholera is associated with deprivation, socio-economic development is the only long-term solution.","output":"Cholera Outbreaks in India, 2011C2020: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been prevalent worldwide for almost a year. In early 2000, there was an outbreak of SARS-CoV, and in early 2010, a similar dissemination of infection by MERS-CoV occurred. However, no clear explanation for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and a massive increase in the number of infections has yet been proposed. The best solution to overcome this pandemic is the development of suitable and effective vaccines and therapeutics. Fortunately, for SARS-CoV-2, the genome sequence and protein structure have been published in a short period, making research and development for prevention and treatment relatively easy. In addition, intranasal drug delivery has proven to be an effective method of administration for treating viral lung diseases. In recent years, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems have been applied to intranasal drug delivery to overcome various limitations that occur during mucosal administration, and advances have been made to the stage where effective drug delivery is possible. This review describes the accumulated knowledge of the previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections and aims to help understand the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, it elucidates the achievements in developing COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics to date through existing approaches. Finally, the applicable nanotechnology approach is described in detail, and vaccines and therapeutic drugs developed based on nanomedicine, which are currently undergoing clinical trials, have presented the potential to become innovative alternatives for overcoming COVID-19.","output":"Application of Nanotechnology in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread around the world in 2020.

PATIENTS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study conducted on the pulmonary function of 101 convalescent COVID-19 patients before discharge. Multivariate analysis was used to establish a scoring system to evaluate the spirometric abnormality based on residual chest CT. RESULTS Lung consolidation area >25% and severe-type COVID-19 were two independent risk factors for severe pulmonary dysfunction. Besides, a scoring system was established. People scoring more than 12 points have more chances (17 times) to get severe pulmonary function impairment before discharge.

While ubiquitination of viral proteins can be used by the host as a defense mechanism by destroying the incoming pathogen, viruses have adapted to take advantage of this cellular process. The ubiquitin system can be hijacked by viruses to enhance various steps of the replication cycle and increase pathogenesis. Emerging viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), flaviviruses like Zika and dengue, as well as highly pathogenic viruses like Ebola and Nipah, have the ability to directly use the ubiquitination process to enhance their viral-replication cycle, and evade immune responses. Some of these mechanisms are conserved among different virus families, especially early during virus entry, providing an opportunity to develop broad-spectrum antivirals. Here, we discuss the mechanisms used by emergent viruses to exploit the host ubiquitin system, with the main focus on the role of ubiquitin in enhancing virus replication.","output":"The Role of the Host Ubiquitin System in Promoting Replication of Emergent Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: With the COVID-19 outbreak, South Korea has been making contact trace data public to help people self-check if they have been in contact with a person infected with the coronavirus. Despite its benefits in suppressing the spread of the virus, publicizing contact trace data raises concerns about individuals' privacy. In view of this tug-of-war between one's privacy and public safety, this work aims to deepen the understanding of privacy risks of contact trace data disclosure practices in South Korea. Method: In this study, publicly available contact trace data of 970 confirmed patients were collected from seven metropolitan cities in South Korea (20th JanC20th Apr 2020). Then, an ordinal scale of relative privacy risk levels was introduced for evaluation, and the assessment was performed on the personal information included in the contact trace data, such as demographics, significant places, sensitive information, social relationships, and routine behaviors. In addition, variance of privacy risk levels was examined across regions and over time to check for differences in policy implementation. Results: It was found that most of the contact trace data showed the gender and age of the patients. In addition, it disclosed significant places (home/work) ranging across different levels of privacy risks in over 70% of the cases. Inference on sensitive information (hobby, religion) was made possible, and 48.7% of the cases exposed the patient's social relationships. In terms of regional differences, a considerable discrepancy was found in the privacy risk for each category. Despite the recent release of government guidelines on data disclosure, its effects were still limited to a few factors (e.g., workplaces, routine behaviors). Discussion: Privacy risk assessment showed evidence of superfluous information disclosure in the current practice. This study discusses the role of identifiability in contact tracing to provide new directions for minimizing disclosure of privacy infringing information. Analysis of real-world data can offer potential stakeholders, such as researchers, service developers, and government officials with practical protocols/guidelines in publicizing information of patients and design implications for future systems (e.g., automatic privacy sensitivity checking) to strike a balance between one's privacy and the public benefits with data disclosure.","output":"Too Much Information: Assessing Privacy Risks of Contact Trace Data Disclosure on People With COVID-19 in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has generated fear, panic, distress, anxiety, and depression among many people in Bangladesh. In this cross-sectional study, we examined factors associated with different levels of psychological impact as a result of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. From April 1 to 30, 2020, we used a self-administered online questionnaire to collect data from 10,609 respondents. Using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on respondents, we categorized the levels of impact as normal, mild, moderate, or severe. Ordinal logistic regression was used to examine the associated factors. The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe psychological impact was 10.2%, 4.8%, and 45.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of reporting normal vs mild, moderate, or severe psychological impact were 5.9 times higher for people living in the Chittagong Division, 1.7 times higher for women with lower education levels, 3.0 times higher among those who were divorced or separated, 1.8 times higher for those working full time, and 2.4 times higher for those living in shared apartments. The odds of reporting a psychological impact were also higher among people who did not enforce protective measures inside the home, those in self-quarantine, those who did not wear face masks, and those who did not comply with World Health Organization precautionary measures. Increased psychological health risks due to COVID-19 were significantly higher among people who experienced chills, headache, cough, breathing difficulties, dizziness, and sore throat before data collection.

Medical students were often excluded from the initial phases of pandemic response, resulting in feelings of disengagement. This study aimed to determine if offering educational experiences on current events related to the COVID-19 pandemic could increase medical students understanding of, and engagement with, the pandemic. METHODS: In Fall 2020, an elective course reviewing several aspects of the COVID-19 response was implemented. Preclinical medical students attended a discussion-based seminar series given by expert faculty on a variety of topics including pathophysiology, vaccine development, telemedicine, and others. Upon course completion, students were asked to complete a survey quantifying their understanding of the overall COVID-19 response, understanding of various individual facets of the response, and feelings of personal engagement on a Likert scale from 1-5, with 5 representing the most understanding or engagement. The differences in pre-course and post-course mean scores were compared using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test for each question. RESULTS: A total of 65 students completed the course; 35 (54%) students filled out the final course survey. Results showed significant improvement in students perceived holistic understanding of the pandemic response (2.67 pre-course vs. 4.36 post-course; p < 0.001), and their feelings of personal engagement (3.06 pre-course vs. 4.33 post-course; p < 0.001). Students also reported significantly increased feelings of understanding for each individual facet of the pandemic response reviewed during the course (8 questions total, all p-values < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Preclinical medical student participation in a course reviewing COVID-19 pandemic response significantly increased feelings of engagement with and understanding of the medical fields response to the pandemic. Students showed improved understanding of each aspect of the pandemic response that was covered in the elective. Therefore, it appears that seminar- and discussion-based electives can be a useful tool for fostering preclinical student engagement in current events in medicine. DISCLOSURES: Prathit A.

The aim is to identify current patterns of NPS use and related harms in each country through recording the perspectives and lived experience of people who use drugs and people who provide harm reduction services in order to inform the harm reduction response. METHODOLOGY: The study involved desk-based research and semi-structured interviews/focus groups with 124 people who use drugs and 55 health and harm reduction service providers across the six countries. RESULTS: People who use drugs in all countries were aware of NPS, primarily synthetic cathinones and synthetic cannabinoids. NPS users generally reflected two groups: those with no prior history of illicit drug use (typically younger people) and those who used NPS on an occasional or regular basis due to the lack of availability of their preferred drug (primarily opiates). In many cases, these respondents reported they would not use NPS if traditional opiates were available. Common factors for choosing NPS included cost and accessibility. Respondents in most countries described NPS markets that use the DarkNet and social media for communication, secretive methods of payment and hidden collection points. A recurring theme was the role of punitive drug policies in driving NPS use and related harms. Respondents in all countries agreed that current harm reduction services were important but needed to be enhanced and expanded in the context of NPS. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified patterns and drivers of NPS use, risk behaviours and drug-related harms. It identified gaps in the current harm reduction response, particularly the needs of non-injectors and overdose response, as well as the harmful effects of punitive drug policies. These findings may inform and improve current harm reduction services to meet the needs of people who use NPS.","output":"New psychoactive substances in Eurasia: a qualitative study of people who use drugs and harm reduction services in six countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study aims to assess the acceptability of online classes among university students of Pakistan through the extension of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model.

The efforts of radiobiological research of these cancers are oriented towards the identification of biomarkers associated with radioresistance and radiosensitivity in order to modulate the treatment so that the therapeutic benefit is maximum. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs, miRs), small single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules are currently being extensively evaluated as potential biomarkers in numerous diseases, including cancer. The evaluation of the potential of miRNAs to modulate or predict radiosensitivity or radioresistance, to anticipate the risk of recurrence and metastasis, and to differentiate different tumor subtypes is based on multiple mechanisms by which mRNAs control proliferation and apoptosis and interact with cell cycle phases or act as oncogenes with the potential to influence invasion promotion or tumor suppression. A refinement of radiosensitivity based on miRNAs with clinical and radiobiological application in head and neck cancers can lead to a personalization of radiotherapy. Thus, a miRNA signature can anticipate the risk of toxicity associated with chemoradiation, the possibility of obtaining locoregional control after treatment, and the recurrence and distant metastasis risk. The potential of miRNAs as an intrinsic predictor of sensitivity to chemotherapy may also guide the therapeutic decision toward choosing an escalation or de-escalation of concurrent or sequential systemic treatment. The choice of the irradiated dose, the fractional dose, the fractionation scheme, and the refining of the dose-volume constraints depending on the radiosensitivity of each tissue type estimated on a case-by-case basis by miRNAs profile are possible concepts for the future radiotherapy and radiobiology of head and neck cancers.","output":"Micro-RNAs, the Cornerstones of the Future of Radiobiology in Head and Neck Cancers?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social distancing requirements resulted in an abrupt transition in the provision of most mental healthcare to telehealth;yet it was, at first, unclear whether patients' emotional expressions - of great import to the success of many psychodynamic therapies - could be facilitated using teletherapy.

This study sought to measure the association between COVID-19 severity and presence of delirium in both intensive care unit (ICU) and acute care patients by leveraging an existing hospital-wide systematic delirium screening protocol. The secondary analyses included measuring the association between age and presence of delirium, as well as the association between delirium and safety attendant use, restraint use, discharge home, and length of stay. METHODS: In this single center retrospective cohort study, we obtained electronic medical record (EMR) data using the institutional Epic Clarity database to identify all adults diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized for at least 48-h from February 1-July 15, 2020. COVID-19 severity was classified into four groups. These EMR data include twice-daily delirium screenings of all patients using the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (non-ICU) or CAM-ICU (ICU) per existing hospital-wide protocols. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 44 patients required ICU care and 17 met criteria for severe disease within 24-h of admission. Forty-three patients (43%) met criteria for delirium at any point in their hospitalization. Of patients with delirium, 24 (56%) were 65 years old or younger. After adjustment, patients meeting criteria for the two highest COVID-19 severity groups within 24-h of admission had 7.2 times the odds of having delirium compared to those in the lowest category [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 7.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9, 27.4; P = 0.003]. Patients > 65 years old had increased odds of delirium compared to those < 45 years old (aOR 8.7; 95% CI 2.2, 33.5; P = 0.003). Delirium was associated with increased odds of safety attendant use (aOR 4.5; 95% CI 1.0, 20.7; P = 0.050), decreased odds of discharge home (aOR 0.2; 95% CI 0.06, 0.6; P = 0.005), and increased length of stay (aOR 7.5; 95% CI 2.0, 13; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: While delirium is common in hospitalized patients of all ages with COVID-19, it is especially common in those with severe disease on hospital admission and those who are older. Patients with COVID-19 and delirium, compared to COVID-19 without delirium, are more likely to require safety attendants during hospitalization, less likely to be discharged home, and have a longer length of stay. Individuals with COVID-19, including younger patients, represent an important population to target for delirium screening and management as delirium is associated with important differences in both clinical care and disposition.","output":"COVID-19 severity and age increase the odds of delirium in hospitalized adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus causes some illnesses to include cold, COVID-19, MERS, and SARS.

RESULTS: The following five lessons are presented, which are based on practical application, increase of speed, and sustainability: (1) explore stakeholder opinions, (2) develop the mHealth app and trial simultaneously, (3) minimize complexity, (4) manage necessary resources, and (5) apply behavior change techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The five lessons developed may lead toward an agile research environment. Agility might be the key factor in the development and research process of a potentially sustainable and evidence-based mHealth intervention.","output":"Five Lessons Learned From Randomized Controlled Trials on Mobile Health Interventions: Consensus Procedure on Practical Recommendations for Sustainable Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic has seen a marked rise in medical disinformation across social media. A variety of claims have garnered considerable traction, including the assertion that COVID is a hoax or deliberately manufactured, that 5G frequency radiation causes coronavirus, and that the pandemic is a ruse by big pharmaceutical companies to profiteer off a vaccine. An estimated 30% of some populations subscribe some form of COVID medico-scientific conspiracy narratives, with detrimental impacts for themselves and others. Consequently, exposing the lack of veracity of these claims is of considerable importance. Previous work has demonstrated that historical medical and scientific conspiracies are highly unlikely to be sustainable. In this article, an expanded model for a hypothetical en masse COVID conspiracy is derived. Analysis suggests that even under ideal circumstances for conspirators, commonly encountered conspiratorial claims are highly unlikely to endure, and would quickly be exposed. This work also explores the spectrum of medico-scientific acceptance, motivations behind propagation of falsehoods, and the urgent need for the medical and scientific community to anticipate and counter the emergence of falsehoods.","output":"Medical disinformation and the unviable nature of COVID-19 conspiracy theories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Darshan truly appreciated how fulfilling it was to be a part of an national health service where anyone could receive treatment regardless of their economic or social background.

However, in Asian countries, mean body mass index (BMI) of T2DM patients is about 25 kg/m(2). Various data on patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery showed that control of T2DM after surgery occurs rapidly and somewhat independent to weight loss. We hypothesized that in non-obese patients with T2DM, the glycemic control would be achieved as a consequence of gastric bypass surgery. METHODS From September 2009, the 172 patients have had laparoscopic single anastomosis gastric bypass (LSAGB) surgery. Among them, 107 patients have been followed up more than 1 year. We analyzed the dataset of these patients. Values related to diabetes were measured before and 1, 2, and 3 years after the surgery. RESULTS The mean BMI decreased during the first year after the surgery but plateaued after that. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin level decreased continuously. The mean fasting and postglucose loading plasma glucose level also decreased. CONCLUSION After LSAGB surgery in non-obese T2DM patients, the control of T2DM was possible safely and effectively.

Moreover, we introduce two types of home quarantine, namely gradual and abrupt one. We compute the equilibria of the new model and derive its reproduction number. Using numerical simulations we analyze the effect of quarantine and testing on the epidemic dynamic. Given a constraint that limits the maximal number of simultaneous active cases, we demonstrate that the isolation rate, which enforces this constraint, decreases with the increasing testing rate. Our simulations show that massive testing allows to control the infection spread using a much lower isolation rate than in the case of indiscriminate quarantining. Finally, based on the effective reproduction number we suggest a strategy to manage the epidemic. It consists in introducing abrupt quarantine as well as relaxing the quarantine in such a way that the epidemic remains under control and further waves do not occur.

We aimed to determine the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects of Novaferon in vitro, and conducted a randomized, open-label, parallel group study to explore the antiviral effects of Novaferon for COVID-19. Methods In laboratory, the inhibition of Novaferon on viral replication in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, and on SARS-CoV-2 entry into healthy cells was determined. Antiviral effects of Novaferon were evaluated in COVID-19 patients with treatment of Novaferon, Novaferon plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir, or Lopinavir/Ritonavir. The primary endpoint was the SARS-CoV-2 clearance rates on day 6 of treatment, and the secondary endpoint was the time to the SARS-CoV-2 clearance in COVID-19 patients Results Novaferon inhibited the viral replication in infected cells (EC50=1.02 ng/ml), and protected healthy cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection (EC50=0.1 ng/ml). Results from the 89 enrolled COVID-19 patients showed that both Novaferon and Novaferon plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir groups had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 clearance rates on day 6 than the Lopinavir/Ritonavir group (50.0% vs.24.1%, p = 0.0400, and 60.0% vs.24.1%, p = 0.0053). Median time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance were 6 days, 6 days, and 9 days for three groups respectively, suggesting a 3-dayreduction of time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance in both Novaferon and Novaferon plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir groups compared with Lopinavir/Ritonavir group. Conclusions Novaferon exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in vitro and in COVID-19 patients. These data justified the further evaluation of Novaferon.

The currently published prediction models are not fully applicable to clinical use. OBJECTIVES: To identify predictive biomarkers of COVID-19 severity and to justify their threshold values for the stratification of the risk of deterioration that would require transferring to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: The study cohort (560 subjects) included all consecutive patients admitted to Dubai Mediclinic Parkview Hospital from February to May 2020 with COVID-19 confirmed by the PCR. The challenge of finding the cut-off thresholds was the unbalanced dataset (eg, the disproportion in the number of 72 patients admitted to ICU vs 488 non-severe cases). Therefore, we customised supervised machine learning (ML) algorithm in terms of threshold value used to predict worsening. RESULTS: With the default thresholds returned by the ML estimator, the performance of the models was low. It was improved by setting the cut-off level to the 25th percentile for lymphocyte count and the 75th percentile for other features. The study justified the following threshold values of the laboratory tests done on admission: lymphocyte count <2.5910(9)/L, and the upper levels for total bilirubin 11.9 mol/L, alanine aminotransferase 43 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 32 U/L, D-dimer 0.7 mg/L, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 39.9 s, creatine kinase 247 U/L, C reactive protein (CRP) 14.3 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase 246 U/L, troponin 0.037 ng/mL, ferritin 498 ng/mL and fibrinogen 446 mg/dL.

AIMS: We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed variations in stroke admissions, rate and timing of reperfusion treatments during the first wave COVID pandemic vs. the pre-pandemic timeframe depending on stroke network model adopted. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The systematic review followed registered protocol (PROSPERO-CRD42020211535), PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL until 9 October 2020 for studies reporting variations in ischemic stroke admissions, treatment rates, and timing in COVID (first wave) vs. control-period. Primary outcome was the weekly admission incidence rate ratio (IRR = admissions during COVID-period/admissions during control-period). Secondary outcomes were (i) changes in rate of reperfusion treatments and (ii) time metrics for pre- and in-hospital phase. Data were pooled using random-effects models, comparing mothership vs. drip&ship model. Overall, 29 studies were included in quantitative synthesis (n = 212,960). COVID-period was associated with a significant reduction in stroke admission rates (IRR = 0.69, 95%CI = 0.61C0.79), with higher relative presentation of large vessel occlusion (risk ratio (RR) = 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.24C2.12). Proportions of patients treated with endovascular treatment increased (RR = 1.14, 95%CI = 1.02C1.28). Intravenous thrombolysis decreased overall (IRR = 0.72, 95%CI = 0.54C0.96) but not in the mothership model (IRR = 0.81, 95%CI = 0.43C1.52). Onset-to-door time was longer for the drip&ship in COVID-period compared to the control-period (+32 min, 95%CI = 0C64). Door-to-scan was longer in COVID-period (+5 min, 95%CI = 2C7). Door-to-needle and door-to-groin were similar in COVID-period and control-period. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a 35% drop in stroke admissions during the first pandemic wave, proportions of patients receiving reperfusion and time-metrics were not inferior to control-period.

Although social isolation increased with the duration of quarantine, it was mitigated by frequent communication with close others. Other mitigating factors include adaptive but not maladaptive coping, and the perception and trust that ones government is dealing with the outbreak. Taking individual actions to avoid contracting the virus were associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally by essential workers.

Here we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) in typical and dyslexic readers while they listened to (a) a random sequence of syllables and (b) a series of tri-syllabic real words. The network topology of the phase synchronization of evoked cortical oscillations was investigated in four frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and beta) using minimum spanning tree graphs. We found that, compared to syllable tracking, word tracking triggered a shift toward a more integrated network topology in the theta band in both groups. Importantly, this change was significantly stronger in the dyslexic readers, who also showed increased reliance on a right frontal cluster of electrodes for word tracking. The current findings point towards an altered effect of word-level processing on the functional brain network organization that may be associated with less efficient phonological and reading skills in dyslexia.","output":"Altered brain network topology during speech tracking in developmental dyslexia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first case of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has quickly spread to all the corners of the world.

Prior to these, many Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) had embraced the concept of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and have either commenced or are in the process of implementing various models of health insurance in order to provide financial access to health care to their populations. While evidence of a relationship between experimentation with UHC and increased access to and utilisation of health care in LMICs is common, there is inadequate research evidence on the specific health financing model that is most appropriate for pursuing the objectives of UHC in these settings. Drawing on a synthesis of empirical and theoretical discourses on the feasibility of UHC in LMICs, this paper argues that the journey towards UHC is not a one size fits all process, but a long-term policy engagement that requires adaptation to the specific socio-cultural and political economy contexts of implementing countries.

Together, these proteins comprise a subset of a large superfamily of 2H phosphoesterase proteins that are distinguished by a pair of conserved His-x-Thr/Ser motifs encompassing catalytically important residues. We have used a vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system to produce recombinant viruses encoding ns2 proteins with single-amino-acid substitutions in, or adjacent to, these conserved motifs, namely, inf-ns2 H46A, inf-ns2 S48A, inf-ns2-S120A, and inf-ns2-H126R. All of the mutant viruses replicate in mouse 17 clone 1 fibroblast cells and mouse embryonic cells to the same extent as the parental wild-type recombinant virus, inf-MHV-A59.

We aimed to understand the effect of high vaccine coverage levels on the population health burden in the context of lower vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant, the impact of a third dose booster regime, and ongoing waning of vaccine-induced immunity. Originally scheduled for 5th February 2022, the Western Australian border was opened on 3rd March 2022, we also aimed to determine the impact of delaying border reopening on the COVID-19 health burden and whether the West Australian health system would be able to manage the resulting peak demand. MethodsAn agent-based model was used to evaluate changes in the COVID-19 health burden resulting from different border openings, at monthly intervals. We assumed immunity was derived from vaccination with the BNT162b2 Pfizer BioNTech vaccine and waned at observed rates from the UK. The model was calibrated against outbreaks in two other Australian states, Queensland and South Australia, both of which were in a similar situation to Western Australia with negligible COVID-19 transmission prior to Omicrons introduction. Age-specific infections generated by the model, together with recent UK data, permitted resulting outbreak health burden to be quantified, in particular peak ICU demand. ResultsOverall population immunity in Western Australia is shown to peak and then plateau for a period of 5 months, between February and June 2022, resulting in a similar health burden if the border is reopened prior to June 2022. For an opening date of 5th March 2022, hospitalisations are predicated to peak at 510 beds, 51 of which will be in ICU, with a total of 383 deaths. If the border reopened on 5th June 2022, hospitalisations are expected to peak with 750 beds required, 75 of which would be in ICU, and a total of 478 deaths. With a total surge capacity of 52 fully staffed ICU beds, West Australian hospitals are predicted to have adequate ICU capacity for future COVID-19 demands if border reopening occurs prior to May 2022. ConclusionsOur results show that with extremely high SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates in Western Australian, and documented vaccine-induced vaccine waning rates, the overall population immunity in Western Australia will be at its highest in the period of February 2022 to June 2022. Opening the Western Australian border prior to the end this period will result in the lowest health burden in comparison to opening in June 2022 or later. With a border reopening of 3rd March 2022 announced by the Western Australian government, our data for a 5th March 2022 opening date may be used to predict the progression of this resulting outbreak. These data show expected peak demand of 510 hospital beds, 51 of which will be in ICU, with a total of 383 deaths. With a surge capacity of 52 ICU beds, it is expected that the Western Australian hospital system will be able to handle the additional load during the peak of the wave.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Omicron disease burden in Australia following border reopening: a modelling analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article emphasizes the dynamics of adolescents who are consumers of psychoactive substances in times of confinement as a result of SARS-COV-2, known as Covid-19, especially those who use the airway to get high, since it is a risk factor in case of being infected.

To date, the results of provocation studies do not support the existence of a causal relationship between EMF and the reported symptoms. However, these studies suffer from various methodological limitations, including low statistical power due to an insufficient number of volunteers. PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: The objective of this paper is to present the motivations of EHS people who participated in co-creation workshops towards the development of a provocation protocol that would overcome the limitations of existing studies and improve EHS knowledge. RESULTS: In a first phase, participants were invited to discuss the reasons for (not) participating in such a provocation study in order to understand barriers and challenges. Among the drivers, the improvement of the knowledge and the sensitization of the medical profession, as well as the official recognition of EHS and its implications are of great importance. The participants also stress the interest of getting to know themselves better and see the study as a step in the development of therapeutic tools. Among the barriers, people emphasize fears about the project independence and results neutrality, as well as methodological choices. Some also highlight the consequences of the test on their health (suffering) and social aspects.

METHODS: This prospective controlled study included 53 patients with SAMs and 106 non-immunocompromised control group (CTRL). All participants received two doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine (28-day interval). Immunogenicity was assessed by anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG seroconversion (SC), anti-S1/S2 IgG geometric mean titre (GMT), factor increase GMT (FI-GMT), neutralizing antibodies (NAb) positivity, and median neutralizing activity after each vaccine dose (D0 and D28) and six weeks after the second dose (D69). Participants with pre-vaccination positive IgG serology and/or NAb and those with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 during the protocol were excluded from immunogenicity analysis. RESULTS: Patients and CTRL had comparable sex (P>0.99) and age (P=0.90). Immunogenicity of 37 patients and 79 CTRL-na?ve participants revealed at D69, a moderate but significantly lower SC (64.9% vs 91.1%, P<0.001), GMT [7.9 (95%CI 4.7C13.2) vs 24.7 (95%CI 30.0C30.5) UA/ml, P<0.001] and frequency of NAb (51.4% vs 77.2%, P<0.001) in SAMs compared with CTRL. Median neutralizing activity was comparable in both groups [57.2% (interquartile range (IQR) 43.4C83.4) vs 63.0% (IQR 40.3C80.7), P=0.808]. Immunosuppressives were less frequently used among NAb+ patients vs NAb- patients (73.7% vs 100%, P=0.046). Type of SAMs, disease status, other drugs or comorbidities did not influence immunogenicity. Vaccine-related adverse events were mild with similar frequencies in patients and CTRL (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Sinovac-CoronaVac is safe and has a moderate short-term immunogenicity in SAMs, but reduced compared with CTRL. We further identified that immunosuppression is associated with diminished NAb positivity.

Ophthalmologists detect cataract through visual screening using ophthalmoscope and slit lamps. Conventionally a patient has to visit an ophthalmologist for eye screening and treatment follows the course. Developing countries lack the proper health infrastructure and face huge scarcity of trained medical professionals as well as technicians. The condition is not very satisfactory with the rural and remote areas of developed nations. To bridge this barrier between the patient and the availability of resources, current work focuses on the development of portable low-cost, robust cataract screening and grading system. Similar works use fundus and retinal images which use costly imaging modules and image based detection algorithms which use much complex neural network models. Current work derives its benefit from the advancements in digital image processing techniques. A set of preprocessing has been done on the colored eye image and later texture information in form of mean intensity, uniformity, standard deviation and randomness has been calculated and mapped with the diagnostic opinion of doctor for cataract screening of over 200 patients. For different grades of cataract severity edge pixel count was calculated as per doctors opinion and later these data are used for calculating the thresholds using hybrid k-means algorithm, for giving a decision on the presence of cataract and grade its severity. Low value of uniformity and high value of other texture parameters confirm the presence of cataract as clouding in eye lens causes the uniformity function to take lower value due to presence of coarse texture. Higher the edge pixel count value, this confirms the presence of starting of cataract as solidified regions in lens are nonuniform. Lower value corresponds to fully solidified region or matured cataract. Proposed algorithm was initially developed on MATLAB, and tested on over 300 patients in an eye camp. The system has shown more than 98% accuracy in detection and grading of cataract. Later a cloud based system was developed with 3D printed image acquisition module to manifest an automated, portable and efficient cataract detection system for Tele-Ophthalmology. The proposed system uses a very simple and efficient technique by mapping the diagnostic opinion of the doctor as well, giving very promising results which suggest its potential use in teleophthalmology applications to reduce the cost of delivering eye care services and increasing its reach effectively. Developed system is simple in design and easy to operate and suitable for mass screening of cataracts. Due to non-invasive and non-mydriatic and mountable nature of device, in person screening is not required. Hence, social distancing norms are easy to follow and device is very useful in COVID-19 like situation.","output":"Development of portable and robust cataract detection and grading system by analyzing multiple texture features for Tele-Ophthalmology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the absence of valid medicine or vaccine for treating the pandemic Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, other control strategies like; quarantine, social distancing, self- isolation, sanitation and use of personal protective equipment are effective tool used to prevent and curtail the spread of the disease.

The dimension of the COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented risk especially for the more vulnerable populations. To manage patients with cancer adequately, maintaining the highest quality of care, a definition of value-based priorities is necessary to define which interventions can be safely postponed without affecting patients' outcome. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) has endorsed a tiered approach across three different levels of priority (high, medium, low) incorporating information on the value-based prioritisation and clinical cogency of the interventions that can be applied for different disease sites. Patients with gynaecological cancer are at particular risk of COVID-19 complications because of their age and prevalence of comorbidities. The definition of priority level should be based on tumour stage and histology, cancer-related symptoms or complications, aim (curative vs palliative) and magnitude of benefit of the oncological intervention, patients' general condition and preferences.

In addition, the patient demonstrated an evolving and persistent tachyarrhythmia consistent with neither the most likely postoperative complications nor typical COVID-19. DISCUSSION: The patient had negative preoperative testing for the virus and presented with profound oxygen desaturation and respiratory failure several days postoperatively. This raised concern for a complication of his arterial switch operation.

After initiating treatment for COVID-19, the patient's oxygen requirements and need for anti-arrhythmic agents improved.

Our understanding of what drives this individuality is vastly incomplete and will require an ecological perspective as microbiomes function as complex inter-connected communities. Here, we performed a parallel two-arm, exploratory randomized controlled trial in 31 adults with overweight and class-I obesity to characterize the effects of long-chain, complex arabinoxylan (n = 15) at high supplementation doses (female: 25 g/day; male: 35 g/day) on gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acid production as compared to microcrystalline cellulose (n = 16, non-fermentable control), and integrated the findings using an ecological framework. RESULTS: Arabinoxylan resulted in a global shift in fecal bacterial community composition, reduced &#945;-diversity, and the promotion of specific taxa, including operational taxonomic units related to Bifidobacterium longum, Blautia obeum, and Prevotella copri. Arabinoxylan further increased fecal propionate concentrations (p = 0.012, Friedman's test), an effect that showed two distinct groupings of temporal responses in participants. The two groups showed differences in compositional shifts of the microbiota (p &#8804; 0.025, PERMANOVA), and multiple linear regression (MLR) analyses revealed that the propionate response was predictable through shifts and, to a lesser degree, baseline composition of the microbiota. Principal components (PCs) derived from community data were better predictors in MLR models as compared to single taxa, indicating that arabinoxylan fermentation is the result of multi-species interactions within microbiomes. CONCLUSION: This study showed that long-chain arabinoxylan modulates both microbiota composition and the output of health-relevant SCFAs, providing information for a more targeted application of this fiber. Variation in propionate production was linked to both compositional shifts and baseline composition, with PCs derived from shifts of the global microbial community showing the strongest associations. These findings constitute a proof-of-concept for the merit of an ecological framework that considers features of the wider gut microbial community for the prediction of metabolic outcomes of dietary fiber fermentation. This provides a basis to personalize the use of dietary fiber in nutritional application and to stratify human populations by relevant gut microbiota features to account for the inconsistent health effects in human intervention studies.

OBJECTIVES The objective of our study was to recognize the barriers of applying to medical school among URMs in high school. METHODS To identify and assess the prevalence of barriers, surveys were distributed to participants of Med-Achieve, a mini-medical school program of diverse high school students in New York City during the 2019-2020 academic year. RESULTS Among students who will be first in their immediate family to attend college, 80.0% perceived a barrier to pursuing medical school.

This strategy has sparked some heated debates world-wide for its pros and cons, and no clear consensus is reached among experts. Without taking side in this matter, we tried to answer the following question, from a pure mathematical perspective: should we delay the second dose of the vaccine or not?. We show that the answer to this question depends tightly on the efficacy of the first and the second COVID-19 vaccine doses. In particular, if the first dose is more than 50% efficient, the optimal procedure to maximize the number of effectively vaccinated sub-population is to delay the second vaccine as much as possible (the maximum period between the two doses prescribed by the clinical recommendations). On the other hand, if the efficacy of the first dose is less than 50% and the efficacy of the second dose exceeds a certain threshold, then it would be optimal to administer the second dose as quickly as possible (while respecting the minimum period between the two does as prescribed by the clinical recommendations).

Between 1954 and 1961, 445 healthy infants were enrolled in the first ZLS cohort. Their physical, motor, cognitive, and social development and their environment were assessed comprehensively across childhood, adolescence, and into young adulthood. In the 1970s, two further cohorts were added to the ZLS and assessed with largely matched study protocols: Between 1974 and 1979, the second ZLS cohort included 265 infants (103 term-born and 162 preterm infants), and between 1970 and 2002, the third ZLS cohort included 327 children of participants of the first ZLS cohort.

A standardized, electronic, self-administered, Google Form data collection sheet was distributed. It included the E-learning acceptance measure (ElAM) containing three constructs, namely: tutor quality (TQ), perceived usefulness (PU), and facilitating conditions (FC). The sheet also inquired about the students' perceptions of the benefits, enablers, and barriers to e-learning. Descriptive, inferential statistics and multiple linear regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: Blackboard and Zoom were the most preferred Learning Management Systems (LMS) by our medical students. The mean score of ElAM was 102.82  24.102.

Recently, efforts have been afoot towards zero-shot quantization that does not require original unlabelled training samples of a given task. These best-published works heavily rely on the learned batch normalization (BN) parameters to infer the range of the activations for quantization. In particular, these methods are built upon either empirical estimation framework or the data distillation approach, for computing the range of the activations. However, the performance of such schemes severely degrades when presented with a network that does not accommodate BN layers. In this line of thought, we propose a generalized zero-shot quantization (GZSQ) framework that neither requires original data nor relies on BN layer statistics. We have utilized the data distillation approach and leveraged only the pre-trained weights of the model to estimate enriched data for range calibration of the activations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes the distribution of the pretrained weights to assist the process of zero-shot quantization. The proposed scheme has significantly outperformed the existing zero-shot works, e.g., an improvement of ~ 33% in classification accuracy for MobileNetV2 and several other models that are w&w/o BN layers, for a variety of tasks. We have also demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed work across multiple open-source quantization frameworks. Importantly, our work is the first attempt towards the post-training zero-shot quantization of futuristic unnormalized deep neural networks.","output":"A Generalized Zero-Shot Quantization of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks via Learned Weights Statistics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to an expected surge of COVID\\\\19 patients in need of mechanical ventilation, the intensive care capacity was doubled at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, in March 2020.

A training course and a theoretical test for non\\\\intensivist doctors were developed. The aims of this study were to gather validity evidence for the theoretical test and explore the effects of the course. METHODS: The 1\\\\day course was comprised of theoretical sessions and hands\\\\on training in ventilator use, hemodynamic monitoring, vascular access, and use of personal protective equipment. Validity evidence was gathered for the test by comparing answers from novices and experts in intensive care. Doctors who participated in the course completed the test before (pretest), after (posttest), and again within 8 weeks following the course (retention test). RESULTS: Fifty\\\\four non\\\\intensivist doctors from 15 different specialties with a wide range in clinical experience level completed the course.

We performed a meta-analysis of observational studies to analyze the association of vitamin D levels with the inflammatory markers in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and ClinicalTrial.gov for any relevant studies with comparison data reporting vitamin D levels and inflammatory markers in COVID-19 patients. A literature search was conducted from December 1, 2019, to January 14, 2022. Vitamin D deficiency was defined by each individual study and ranged from <9.9 ng/mL to <30 ng/mL. The inflammatory markers of interest were interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), fibrinogen and D-dimer. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random or fixed-effects models. Two independent investigators assessed study eligibility and synthesized the evidence. RESULTS: Thirty-two observational studies were included comprising of 7,771 patients ranging from 40-81 years of age with 57.1% being male. Meta-analysis showed that patients that were vitamin D sufficient (levels >30ng/mL) had statistically significant lower levels of IL-6, CRP, ferritin, LDH, fibrinogen, and D-dimer compared to vitamin D deficient group. With the highest mean difference found in ferritin (95.62; 95% CI, 33.14-158.10); P=0.003; I2=99%). No significant reductions were found in ESR (P=0.97). All inflammatory markers analyzed were higher than the normal healthy reference ranges in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that low vitamin D levels are associated with increased inflammatory marker levels. Vitamin D deficiency may potentially serve as an early identifier for COVID-19 patients at high risk of developing severe inflammatory conditions as well as thrombotic complications.

In the villages with relatively isolated access, the spread of Covid-19 is very low compared to the national average. This paper discusses how remoteness has become two sides of the coin during pandemic by examining at the data of health services in three rural areas in Provinsi Jawa Tengah, Indonesia. Data collected by in-depth interviews showed that although remoteness became a key factor in delaying the spread of Covid19, it also became a key factor in the deterioration of advanced health services in non-covid diseases throughout the pandemic. These findings confirmed the vulnerability of basic services in rural areas, even on Java Island as a center of growth in Indonesia. Using causal network analysis, the discussion revealed that the vulnerability stem from the territorial approach in health service provision making rural areas less resilient during pandemic.

SUBJECTS The study enrolled a total of 16 pediatric patients with unexpected cardiopulmonary deterioration who were admitted to the PICU. Ten bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and six transtracheal aspirate samples were analyzed. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS RNA libraries were prepared from specimens and analyzed using next-generation sequencing. One or more bacterial/viral pathogens were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or transtracheal aspirate specimens from 10 patients. Bacterial and viral coinfection was considered in four cases. Compared with the conventional culture and viral antigen test results, an additional six bacterial and four viral pathogens were identified by next-generation sequencing. Conversely, among 18 pathogens identified by the conventional methods, nine pathogens were detected by next-generation sequencing. Candidate pathogens (e.g., coxsackievirus A6 and Chlamydia trachomatis) were detected by next-generation sequencing in four of 10 patients in whom no causative pathogen had been identified by conventional methods.

To support this use, the GRADE-CERQual approach was developed to assess and communicate the confidence we have in findings from reviews of qualitative research. One component of this approach requires an appraisal of the methodological limitations of studies contributing data to a review finding. Diverse critical appraisal tools for qualitative research are currently being used. However, it is unclear which tool is most appropriate for informing a GRADE-CERQual assessment of confidence. METHODOLOGY We searched for tools that were explicitly intended for critically appraising the methodological quality of qualitative research. We searched the reference lists of existing methodological reviews for critical appraisal tools, and also conducted a systematic search in June 2016 for tools published in health science and social science databases. Two reviewers screened identified titles and abstracts, and then screened the full text of potentially relevant articles. One reviewer extracted data from each article and a second reviewer checked the extraction. We used a best-fit framework synthesis approach to code checklist criteria from each identified tool and to organise these into themes. RESULTS We identified 102 critical appraisal tools: 71 tools had previously been included in methodological reviews, and 31 tools were identified from our systematic search. Almost half of the tools were published after 2010. Few authors described how their tool was developed, or why a new tool was needed. After coding all criteria, we developed a framework that included 22 themes. None of the tools included all 22 themes. Some themes were included in up to 95 of the tools. CONCLUSION It is problematic that researchers continue to develop new tools without adequately examining the many tools that already exist.

Here we present a narrative review of an outbreak that occurred at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (RMAS) in JanuaryCMarch 2021, in the context of the circulating, highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7. METHODS: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed using a combination of reverse transcriptase PCR and Lateral Flow Devices (LFDs). Testing and isolation procedures were conducted in line with a pre-established symptom stratification system. Genomic sequencing was performed on 10 sample isolates. RESULTS: By the end of the outbreak, 185 cases (153 Officer Cadets, 32 permanent staff) had contracted confirmed COVID-19. This represented 15% of the total RMAS population. This resulted in 0 deaths and 0 hospitalisations, but due to necessary isolation procedures did represent an estimated 12 959 person-days of lost training. 9 of 10 (90%) of sequenced isolates had a reportable lineage. All of those reported were found to be the Alpha lineage B.1.1.7. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss the key lessons learnt from the after-action review by the Incident Management Team. These include the importance of multidisciplinary working, the utility of sync matrices to monitor outbreaks in real time, issues around Officer Cadets reporting symptoms, timing of high-risk training activities, infrastructure and use of LFDs.

The model showed that, although no death of children would result from the reopening of the schools in the three cities analysed, the risk of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and secondary cases among teachers, school staff and relatives of the children is not negligible. Although the epidemic hit different regions with different intensities, our model shows that, for regions where the incidence profile is similar to the cities analysed, the risk of reopening of schools is still too high. This in spite of the fact that incidences in these cities were declining in the period of the time considered. Therefore, although we cannot extend the result to the entire country, the overall conclusion is valid for regions with a declining incidence and it is even more valid for regions where incidence is increasing. We assumed a very conservative level of infection transmissibility of children of just 10% as that of adults. In spite of the very low level of transmissibility is assumed, the number of secondary cases caused by infected children among teachers, school staff and relatives varied from 2 to 85. It is, therefore, too soon to have any degree of confidence that reopening of schools before the advent of a vaccine is the right decision to take.

First, it reveals that the feelings of social isolation have substantially increased in France during this lockdown. Second, it explores the factors that help to explain these changes by developing a predictive model and reveals that living alone, being a woman, being young are factors that explain this increase in felling of social isolation. Third, the estimation of the effects of changes in feelings of social isolation on changes in the reported level of well-being of French respondents during lockdown shows that people who reported feeling more socially isolated than others has the lowest levels of well-being among the French population;and that the increase in peoples feelings of social isolation during lockdown is a factor that has a negative impact on their level of well-being.","output":"Isolation and well-being in the time of lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Black patients are overrepresented in the number of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US. Reasons for this disparity may be due to underlying comorbidities or sociodemographic factors that require further exploration. OBJECTIVE: To systematically determine patient characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used comparative groups of patients tested or treated for COVID-19 at the University of Michigan from March 10, 2020, to April 22, 2020, with an outcome update through July 28, 2020. A group of randomly selected untested individuals were included for comparison. Examined factors included race/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics. EXPOSURE: In-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, commercial antibody tests, nasopharynx or oropharynx PCR deployed by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and reverse transcriptionCPCR tests performed in external labs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were being tested for COVID-19, having test results positive for COVID-19 or being diagnosed with COVID-19, being hospitalized for COVID-19, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission for COVID-19, and COVID-19Crelated mortality (including inpatient and outpatient). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes and were aggregated into a comorbidity score. Associations with COVID-19 outcomes were examined using odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: Of 5698 patients tested for COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 47.4 [20.9] years; 2167 [38.0%] men; mean [SD] BMI, 30.0 [8.0]), most were non-Hispanic White (3740 patients [65.6%]) or non-Hispanic Black (1058 patients [18.6%]). The comparison group included 7168 individuals who were not tested (mean [SD] age, 43.1 [24.1] years; 3257 [45.4%] men; mean [SD] BMI, 28.5 [7.1]). Among 1139 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 492 (43.2%) were White and 442 (38.8%) were Black; 523 (45.9%) were hospitalized, 283 (24.7%) were admitted to the ICU, and 88 (7.7%) died. Adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity score, Black patients were more likely to be hospitalized compared with White patients (OR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.15-2.58]; P = .009). In addition to older age, male sex, and obesity, living in densely populated areas was associated with increased risk of hospitalization (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.01-1.19]; P = .02). In the overall population, higher risk of hospitalization was also observed in patients with preexisting type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.25-2.64]; P = .02) and kidney disease (OR, 2.87 [95% CI, 1.87-4.42]; P < .001). Compared with White patients, obesity was associated with higher risk of having test results positive for COVID-19 among Black patients (White: OR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.01-1.84]; P = .04. Black: OR, 3.11 [95% CI, 1.64-5.90]; P < .001; P for interaction = .02). Having any cancer was associated with higher risk of positive COVID-19 test results for Black patients (OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.19-2.78]; P = .005) but not White patients (OR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.84-1.40]; P = .53; P for interaction = .04). Overall comorbidity burden was associated with higher risk of hospitalization in White patients (OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.11-1.53]; P = .001) but not in Black patients (OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.83-1.17]; P = .88; P for interaction = .02), as was type 2 diabetes (White: OR, 2.59 [95% CI, 1.49-4.48]; P < .001; Black: OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.66-2.06]; P = .59; P for interaction = .046). No statistically significant racial differences were found in ICU admission and mortality based on adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that preexisting type 2 diabetes or kidney diseases and living in highCpopulation density areas were associated with higher risk for COVID-19 hospitalization.

SARS-CoV-2 activates the innate immune system, thereby activating the inflammatory mechanism, causing the release of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, it has been suggested that COVID-19 may penetrate the central nervous system, and release inflammatory cytokines in the brains, inducing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Several links connect COVID-19 with Alzheimers disease (AD), such as elevated oxidative stress, uncontrolled release of the inflammatory cytokines, and mitochondrial apoptosis. There are severe concerns that excessive immune cell activation in COVID-19 may aggravate the neurodegeneration and amyloid-beta pathology of AD. Here, we have collected the evidence, showing the links between the two diseases. The focus has been made to collect the information on the activation of the inflammation, its contributors, and shared therapeutic targets. Furthermore, we have given future perspectives, research gaps, and overlapping pathological bases of the two diseases. Lastly, we have given the short touch to the drugs that have equally shown rescuing effects against both diseases. Although there is limited information available regarding the exact links between COVID-19 and neuroinflammation, we have insight into the pathological contributors of the diseases.

COVID-19 has no confined treatment and, consequently, has high hospitalization and mortality rates. Moreover, people who contract COVID-19 present systemic inflammatory spillover. It is now known that COVID-19 pathogenesis is linked to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). COVID-19 invades host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptoras such, an individual's susceptibility to COVID-19 increases alongside the upregulation of this receptor. COVID-19 has also been associated with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, which leads to acute respiratory distress, cardiomyopathy, and shock. These outcomes are thought to result from imbalances in angiotensin (Ang) II and Ang-(1-7)/alamandine activity. ACE2, Ang-(1-7), and alamandine have potent anti-inflammatory properties, and some SARS-CoV-2 patients exhibit high levels of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7). This phenomenon could indicate a failing physiological response to prevent or reduce the severity of inflammation-mediated pulmonary injuries. Alamandine, which is another protective component of the RAS, has several health benefits owing to its antithrombogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic characteristics. Alamandine alleviates pulmonary fibrosis via the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor D (MrgD). Thus, a better understanding of this pathway could uncover novel pharmacological strategies for altering proinflammatory environments within the body. Following such strategies could inhibit fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection and, consequently, prevent COVID-19.","output":"Alamandine: Potential Protective Effects in SARS-CoV-2 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The shift from cure toward prevention in veterinary medicine involves the implementation of biosecurity. In cattle farming, the application of biosecurity measures has been described to a limited degree, yet no data on biosecurity on veal farms is available. A high degree of commingling of veal calves from multiple farms causes frequent disease outbreaks, and thereby high antimicrobial usage and increased risk of antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the current implementation of biosecurity on veal farms in Belgium. To this extent, a list of the most important calf diseases (n = 34) was created, and risk factors and related biosecurity measures for these diseases were determined and included in a questionnaire. Herd visits and face-to-face interviews were conducted on 20 randomly selected veal farms, comprising 8.3% of the target population. A categorical principal component and clustering analysis were performed to determine the influence of the veal companies on the farms biosecurity level. Awareness of biosecurity was very low among the farmers. All farms used an all-in, all-out production system with calves originating from multiple farms without quarantine. On average, farms were filled in 11.4 days (range 2C52). The degree of commingling for these farms was 1.24, meaning that, on average, 124 calves originated from 100 farms. Veterinarians wore farm-specific boots on eight farms (40%) and farm-specific clothes on six farms (30%), while technical advisors wore farm-specific boots on six farms (30%) and farm-specific clothes on four farms (20%). Disinfection footbaths were only used in five farms (25%) despite being present in all farms in the sample. Concerning internal biosecurity, none of the farmers isolated sick animals; only one farmer (5%) had a physically separated hospital pen, and only 11 farmers (55%) both cleaned and disinfected the stables after each production cycle. In most farms, animals were of comparable age. Healthy calves generally remained in the same compartment during the entire production cycle, limiting the risks associated with the movement of animals. No influence of the integrations on the biosecurity level could be determined. It can be concluded that a few biosecurity measures, such as all-in, all-out and compartmentation, are implemented relatively well, while other measures, such as good cleaning and disinfection and proper entrance measures for visitors and personnel can easily be improved. The improvement of measures regarding the introduction of animals of different origins will require more fundamental changes in the veal industry.","output":"Biosecurity practices in Belgian veal calf farming: Level of implementation, attitudes, strengths, weaknesses and constraints"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Keguan-1 (KG-1) plays a vital role in enhancing the curative effects, improving quality of life, and reducing the development of acute lung injury (ALI). OBJECTIVE: To unravel the protective effect and underlying mechanism of KG-1 against ALI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were intratracheally instilled with lipopolysaccharide to establish the ALI model. Then, mice in the KG-1 group received a dose of 5.04 g/kg for 12 h. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and pathological characteristics were determined to explore the effects of KG-1. Next, untargeted metabolomics was used to identify the differential metabolites and involved pathways for KG-1 anti-ALI. Network pharmacology was carried out to predict the putative active components and drug targets of KG-1 anti-ALI. RESULTS: KG-1 significantly improved the levels of TNF- (from 2295.92  529.87 pg/mL to 1167.64  318.91 pg/mL), IL-6 (from 4688.80  481.68 pg/mL to 3604.43  382.00 pg/mL), CXCL1 (from 4361.76  505.73 pg/mL to 2981.04  526.18 pg/mL), CXCL2 (from 5034.09  809.28 pg/mL to 2980.30  747.63 pg/mL), and impaired lung histological damage. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that KG-1 significantly regulated 12 different metabolites, which mainly related to lipid, amino acid, and vitamin metabolism. Network pharmacology showed that KG-1 exhibited anti-ALI effects through 17 potentially active components acting on seven putative drug targets to regulate four metabolites. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This work elucidated the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism by which KG-1 protects against ALI from the view of the metabolome, thus providing a scientific basis for the usage of KG-1.","output":"Metabolomics coupled with network pharmacology study on the protective effect of Keguan-1 granules in LPS-induced acute lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There is currently an unmet need for the treatment of women with central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA).

Methods: Ninety-one subjects (mean age = 70.29  7.70 years)healthy older adults (HCs, n = 23), patients with single-domain amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n = 23), patients with single-domain executive Parkinson's disease MCI (PD-MCI, n = 20), and patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (mild AD, n = 25)were enrolled in the study. All participants underwent cognitive evaluations performed using both traditional neuropsychological assessment tools, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Overall Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Smart Aging platform. We analyzed global scores on Smart Aging indices (i.e., accuracy, time, distance) as well as the Smart Aging total score, looking for differences between the four groups. Results: The findings revealed significant between-group differences in all the Smart Aging indices: accuracy (p < 0.001), time (p < 0.001), distance (p < 0.001), and total Smart Aging score (p < 0.001). The HCs outperformed the mild AD, aMCI, and PD-MCI patients in terms of accuracy, time, distance, and Smart Aging total score. In addition, the mild AD group was outperformed both by the HCs and by the aMCI and PD-MCI patients on accuracy and distance. No significant differences were found between aMCI and PD-MCI patients.

Objective: This study aimed to develop an age-structured compartment model to evaluate the impact of all diagnosed and all hospitalized on the epidemic trend of COVID-19, and explore innovative and effective releasing strategies for different age groups to prevent the second wave of COVID-19. Methods: Based on three types of COVID-19 data in New York City (NYC), we calibrated the model and estimated the unknown parameters using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Results: Compared with the current practice in NYC, we estimated that if all infected people were diagnosed from March 26, April 5 to April 15, 2020, respectively, then the number of new infections on April 22 was reduced by 98.02, 93.88, and 74.08%. If all confirmed cases were hospitalized from March 26, April 5, and April 15, 2020, respectively, then as of June 7, 2020, the total number of deaths in NYC was reduced by 67.24, 63.43, and 51.79%. When only the 0C17 age group in NYC was released from June 8, if the contact rate in this age group remained below 61% of the pre-pandemic level, then a second wave of COVID-19 could be prevented in NYC.

Conclusions: If all infected people were diagnosed in time, the daily number of new infections could be significantly reduced in NYC. If all confirmed cases were hospitalized in time, the total number of deaths could be significantly reduced in NYC.

The amount of available vaccines is often limited, and thus it is crucial to determine the allocation strategy. While mathematical modelling approaches have been used to find an optimal distribution of vaccines, there is an excessively large number of possible schemes to be simulated. Here, we propose an algorithm to find a near-optimal allocation scheme given an intervention objective such as minimization of new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths, where multiple vaccines are available. The proposed principle for allocating vaccines is to target subgroups with the largest reduction in the outcome of interest, such as new infections, due to vaccination that fully immunizes a single individual. We express the expected impact of vaccinating each subgroup in terms of the observed incidence of infection and force of infection. The proposed approach is firstly evaluated with a simulated epidemic and then applied to the epidemiological data on COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Our results reveal how the optimal allocation depends on the objective of infection control. In the case of COVID-19, if we wish to minimize deaths, the optimal allocation strategy is not efficient for minimizing other outcomes, such as infections. In simulated epidemics, an allocation strategy optimized for an outcome outperforms other strategies such as the allocation from young to old, from old to young, and at random. Our simulations clarify that the current policy in the Netherlands (i.e., allocation from old to young) was concordant with the allocation scheme that minimizes deaths. The proposed method provides an optimal allocation scheme, given routine surveillance data that reflect ongoing transmissions. The principle of allocation is useful for providing plausible simulation scenarios for complex models, which give a more robust basis to determine intervention strategies.","output":"Optimal vaccine allocation for COVID-19 in the Netherlands: a data-driven prioritization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The combined impact of variable surgeon prescribing preferences and low resident prescribing comfort level can lead to significant disparity in opioid prescribing patterns for the same surgery in the same academic surgical practice.

Career choice is a multi-factorial process that evolves over time; among all trainees, expressed interest in faculty research careers decreases over time in graduate school, but that trend is amplified in women and members of historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (Fuhrmann, Halme, OSullivan, & Lindstaedt, 2011; Gibbs, McGready, Bennett, & Griffin, 2014; C.

This work was designed to investigate how career interest changes over time among recent neuroscience PhD graduates, and whether differences in career interests are associated with social identity (i.e. gender and race/ethnicity), experiences in graduate school and postdoctoral training (e.g. relationship with advisor; feelings of belonging), and personal characteristics (e.g. confidence in ones potential to be an independent researcher). We report results from a survey of 1,479 PhD neuroscientists (including 16% underrepresented (UR) and 54% female scientists). We saw repeated evidence that individual preferences about careers in general, and academic careers specifically, predict current career interest. These statistically significant preferences mostly had medium to low effect size that varied by career type. These findings were mediated by social identity and experiences in graduate school and postdoctoral training. Our findings highlight the important influence of the advisor in shaping a trainees career path, and the ways in which academic culture is perceived as unwelcoming or incongruent with the values or priorities of certain groups.

However, they have formed beneficial relationships with faculty outside their PhD institutions that, particularly for UR women, are associated with increased interest in academia.

RESULTS The primary benefits of telemedicine were accessibility and cost and time savings. Primary limitations included the ability to perform a physical examination. Most patients expressed a willingness to participate in future remote visits if appropriate or necessitated by social circumstances. DISCUSSION Telemedicine is a disruptive process, and long-term adoption requires understanding patient perception of and satisfaction with telemedicine. Head and neck cancer patients were generally satisfied with telemedicine. The study elucidated patient perceived benefits and limitations of telemedicine.

This study assessed the longitudinal association between social frailty and the intrinsic capacity of community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: A total of 663 participants (56.7% women) aged 60 years from in Nagoya, Japan, were included in the study. The first measurement occurred in 2014, and annual follow-ups occurred until 2017. Social frailty was determined based on four items: financial difficulty, household status, social activity, and regular contact with others. A deficit score of 0 represented social robustness, 1 represented social prefrailty, and  2 represented social frailty. Intrinsic capacity was evaluated by the locomotion, cognition, psychological function, vitality, and sensory function domains. The longitudinal association was analyzed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: The prevalence of social prefrailty and social frailty at baseline was 31.2 and 6.3%, respectively. The social prefrailty group ( = ? 0.132, P < 0.001) and social frailty group ( = ? 0.258, P < 0.001) were associated with a greater reduction in the composite intrinsic capacity scores than the social robustness group, especially in the cognition, psychological function, and vitality domains. Men with social prefrailty/social frailty demonstrated a greater decrease in the psychological function domain score (? 0.512 vs. ? 0.278) than women. Additionally, the cognition domain score only decreased in men in the social prefrailty/social frailty group ( = ? 0.122, P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Social frailty was associated with intrinsic capacity and its subdomains longitudinally. Men with social frailty were more vulnerable than women to a decline in their psychological function and cognition domains. Therefore, the advanced management of social frailty is necessary to facilitate healthy aging.

There is an increase in the prevalence of elder abuse and difficulties in getting appropriate care and support. This has mandated legal measures to protect the rights of the senior citizens and provide them care and support by the family and other stakeholders. Consequent to being the signatory for the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, 2002, several countries, including India, have introduced legislation for the social protection of senior citizens. The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens(MWP) Act, 2007 is an important legislation in India to safeguard the elderly from exploitation and abuse. METHODS: This article critically evaluates the implementation of the MWP Act, 2007, and the related challenges in protecting senior citizens from abuse. The article will also highlight the proposed amendments in the Act to strengthen the effective implementation of legal protection for senior citizens and ensure their well-being and dignity. CONCLUSIONS: The MWP act is an important legal measure to ensure mainatinence and welfare of senior citizens and protect them from abuse and neglect.

Household contacts were then prospectively followed active symptom monitoring through the 21-day period and nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected at 3-7 days intervals. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data (when available) were collected. RESULTS: Assuming that all these secondary cases were infected by their index cases, the second infection rate in household context is 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.4%-44.4%), with 10.4% of secondary cases being asymptomatic. Multivariate analysis showed that household contacts with underlying medical conditions, a history of direct exposure to Wuhan and its surrounding areas, and shared vehicle with an index patient were associated with higher susceptibility. Household members without protective measures after illness onset of the index patient seem to increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median incubation period and serial interval within household were estimated to be 4.3 days (95% CI: 3.4-5.3 days) and 5.1 days (95% CI: 4.3-6.2 days), respectively.

This paper aims to dwell in the religious and social background of Kumbh Mela massive gathering, as well as the ritualistic practices that could potentially entail public health risks in the current situation. It also aims to identify possible preparatory and interventional measures to evade such risks. Recent Findings: In recent years, the increase in the number of people attending the Kumbh Mela has been phenomenal. Congregants are put up at the holy sites for several days. The sheer number of people assembling at the religious venues poses a great challenge to manage the crowds, to cater to the requirements of basic amenities, and to meet their healthcare needs. Some of the ritualistic practices could heighten the risk for transmission of respiratory pathogens. The COVID-19 pandemic has escalated over the past few months in India. The pandemic is expected to sustain its tempo in India throughout the foreseeable future. Organization of the forthcoming Kumbh Mela needs meticulous planning.

It induces the pathogenesis of many allergic diseases, such as airway hyperresponsiveness, glycoprotein hypersecretion and goblet cell hyperplasia. IL-13 also inhibits tumor immunosurveillance, which leads to carcinogenesis. In recent studies, elevated IL-13 serum levels have been shown in severe COVID-19 patients. Thus it is important to predict IL-13 inducing peptides or regions in a protein for designing safe protein therapeutics particularly immunotherapeutic. This paper describes a method developed for predicting, designing and scanning IL-13 inducing peptides. The dataset used in this study contain experimentally validated 313 IL-13 inducing peptides and 2908 non-inducing homo-sapiens peptides extracted from the immune epitope database (IEDB). We have extracted 95 key features using SVC-L1 technique from the originally generated 9165 features using Pfeature. Further, these key features were ranked based on their prediction ability, and top 10 features were used for building machine learning prediction models. In this study, we have deployed various machine learning techniques to develop models for predicting IL-13 inducing peptides. These models were trained, test and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation techniques; best model were evaluated on independent dataset. Our best model based on XGBoost achieves a maximum AUC of 0.83 and 0.80 on the training and independent dataset, respectively. Our analysis indicate that certain SARS-COV2 variants are more prone to induce IL-13 in COVID-19 patients. A standalone package as well as a web server named IL-13Pred has been developed for predicting IL-13 inducing peptides (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/il13pred/). Key Points Interleukin-13, an immunoregulatory cytokine plays an important role in increasing severity of COVID-19 and other diseases. IL-13Pred is a highly accurate in-silico method developed for predicting the IL-13 inducing peptides/ epitopes. IL-13 inducing peptides are reported in various SARS-CoV2 strains/variants proteins. This method can be used to detect IL-13 inducing peptides in vaccine candidates.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), which are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract, contain multiple types of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that express relevant immune checkpoint proteins. However, no data have been reported on the role of BDNF in GISTs. This study aimed to investigate the expression pattern and prognostic value of BDNF in GIST patients with different degrees of risk, as well as the relationship between BDNF expression and immune checkpoints. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrated that higher BDNF expression was more likely to be present in high-risk patients and suggested a poor prognosis. A similar phenomenon was demonstrated in plasma. Even more interesting was that a positive correlation was present between BDNF and PD-L1+ expression on TILs. Moreover, high BDNF expression levels in combination with a high PD-L1+ TIL count predict extremely poor survival. The combination of BDNF expression and TIL PD-L1+ expression as a single biomarker was a powerful significant independent predictor of prognosis. Taken together, BDNF expression may serve as a significant prognostic factor, as the combination of BDNF expression and the PD-L1+ TIL subset led to superior prediction of GIST prognosis. Furthermore, our research coupled a neurotrophin with immunity, which provides novel evidence of neural and immune regulation in a clinical study of GIST.","output":"BDNF expression in GISTs predicts poor prognosis when associated with PD-L1 positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Efavirenz is still widely used as the preferred first-line antiretroviral agent in the middle- and low- income countries, including Malaysia. The efavirenz population pharmacokinetic profile among HIV-positive smokers is still unknown. We aimed to assess the association of smoking with efavirenz and the differences in HIV clinical outcomes. METHODS A total of 154 stable HIV-positive patients on efavirenz in northern Malaysia were recruited with a sparse sampling for this multicentre prospective cohort study. The association between smoking and efavirenz pharmacokinetic parameters was determined using the non-linear mixed-effect model (NONMEM). A mixture model of clearance was adopted to describe the metaboliser status because genetic data is unavailable. The effect of smoking on HIV clinical markers (CD4, CD4/CD8 ratio and viral blips) for at least two years after the antiretroviral initiation was also investigated. RESULTS Our data were best fitted with a one-compartment mixture model with first-order absorption without lag time. Smoking significantly associated with higher clearance (CL/F) ( = 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07 to 1.91), while weight affected both CL/F and volume (V/F). From the mixture model, 20% of patients were in the slow clearance group, which mimic the genotype distribution of slow metaboliser. An efavirenz dose reduction is not recommended for smokers 60kg with normal metabolism rate. Smoking significantly associated with slower normalisation of CD4 and CD4/CD8 ratio.

A retrospective study design was used to explore the association between meteorological factors and childhood diarrhea in southwestern Ethiopia from 2010 to 2017. Mann Kendall trend test and Spearman's correlation were computed to test the association of childhood diarrhea and meteorological factors. The space-time permutation model was used to identify the risky periods, seasons with most likely clusters, and high childhood diarrhea. Similarly, a negative binomial regression model was fitted to determine the predictability of meteorological factors for childhood diarrhea. The highest childhood diarrhea morbidity was 92.60 per 1000 per under five children. The risk of childhood diarrhea increased by 16.66% (RR: 1.1666; 95% CI: 1.164-1.168) per increase in 1 C temperature.

METHODS: Questionnaire-based surveys were conducted online from February 18-25, 2020 with 1630 Chinese participants (aged 18-68 years). RESULTS: Around one-third (36.38%) of participants were poor sleepers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, higher perceived stress was significantly associated with higher anxiety levels, which, in turn, was associated with lower sleep quality. Self-esteem moderated the indirect effect of perceived stress on sleep quality through its moderation of the effect of perceived stress on anxiety. This indicated that the mediation effect of anxiety was stronger in those with low levels of self-esteem than in those with high levels of self-esteem.

We aimed to investigate the odds of developing severe COVID-19 in health and shift workers. METHODS: We included UK Biobank participants in employment or self-employed at baseline (2006C2010) and with linked COVID-19 data to 31st August 2020. Participants were grouped as neither a health worker nor shift worker (reference category) at baseline, health worker only, shift worker only, or both, and associations with severe COVID-19 investigated in logistic regressions. RESULTS: Of 235,685 participants (815% neither health nor shift worker, 14% health worker only, 169% shift worker only, and 03% both), there were 580 (025%) cases of severe COVID-19. The odds of severe COVID-19 was higher in health workers (adjusted odds ratio: 232 [95% CI: 133, 405]; shift workers (206 [172, 247]); and in health workers who worked shifts (756 [386, 1479]). Being both a health worker and a shift worker had a possible greater impact on the odds of severe COVID-19 in South Asian and Black and African Caribbean ethnicities compared to White individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Both health and shift work (measured at baseline, 2006C2010) were independently associated with over twice the odds of severe COVID-19 in 2020; the odds were over seven times higher in health workers who work shifts.

This prompted countries to accelerate the pace of immunization campaigns against COVID-19 to deploy the immunization umbrella to the largest possible number of target groups. In this paper, we share Oman's perspective on the impact of accelerating the administration of the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in one border governorate, Musandam, compared to another, Al-Buraimi, where measures were not implemented. Methods Daily admission data (10 April 2020C24 June 2021) and vaccination data (1 JanuaryC24 June 2021) were systematically collected. For each governorate, cumulative doses (first and second doses) and vaccination coverage were calculated daily. Results Within one month, first dose vaccination coverage increased from 20%C58% in Musandam reducing the incidence of hospital admission by 75% compared to Al-Buraimi where vaccination coverage plateaued at 20% and the incidence of hospital admission increased by 500% . Conclusions Given the peculiarity of geographical location and being the first line of access for imported cases, border regions should have priority for vaccine deployment as a preventive measure.

It has catastrophic impacts on daily lives, public health, and the global economy. The detection of coronavirus (COVID- 19) is now a critical task for medical specialists. Laboratory methods for detecting the virus such as Polymerase Chain Reaction, antigens, and antibodies have pros and cons represented in time required to obtain results, accuracy, cost and suitability of the test to phase of infection. The need for accurate, fast, and cheap auxiliary diagnostic tools has become a necessity as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Other medical investigations such as chest X-ray and Computerized Tomography scans are imaging techniques that play an important role in the diagnosis of COVID- 19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence techniques for processing radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this virus. However, Due to the small dataset available for COVID- 19, transfer learning from pre-trained convolution neural networks, CNNs can be used as a promising solution for diagnosis of coronavirus. Transfer learning becomes an effective mechanism by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks to domain-specific tasks. Hence, the main contribution of this paper is to exploit the pre-trained deep learning CNN architectures as a cornerstone to enhance and build up an automated tool for detection and diagnosis of COVID- 19 in chest X-Ray and Computerized Tomography images. The main idea is to make use of their convolutional neural network structure and its learned weights on large datasets such as ImageNet. Moreover, a modification to ResNet50 is proposed to classify the patients as COVID infected or not. This modification includes adding three new layers, named, 'Conv', 'Batch_Normaliz' and 'Activation_Relu' layers. These layers are injected in the ResNet50 architecture for accurate discrimination and robust feature extraction. Extensive experiments are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed model on COVID- 19 chest X-Ray and Computerized Tomography scan images. Experimental results approve that the proposed modification, injected layers, increases the diagnosis accuracy to 97.7% for Computerized Tomography dataset and 97.1% for X-Ray dataset which is superior compared to other approaches.","output":"Automatic prediction of COVID- 19 from chest images using modified ResNet50"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A proposed countermeasure to COVID-19 is a robust healthcare system that can respond and identify transmission paths using information technology.

Indeed, individuals carrying GSTP1 Val or GSTO1 Asp allele exhibited lower odds of long-COVID myalgia development, both independently and in combination. Furthermore, the combined presence of GSTP1 Ile and GSTO1 Ala alleles exhibited cumulative risk regarding long-COVID myalgia in carriers of the combined GPX1 LeuLeu/GPX3 CC genotype. Moreover, individuals carrying combined GSTM1-null/GPX1LeuLeu genotype were more prone to developing long-COVID brain fog, while this probability further enlarged if the Nrf2 A allele was also present.

Very few reports in the literature account for the occurrence of multiple thoracic aortic aneurysms in the same pediatric patient because of a genetic cause. We report a rare occurrence of severe thoracic aortic aneurysms (involving the ascending, arch and descending aortic segments) with severe aortic insufficiency in a 7-year-old female child secondary to the extremely rare and often lethal genetic disorder, cutis laxa. She was eventually identified as a carrier of a homozygous EFEMP2 (alias FBLN4) mutation.

Parents of the child were not known to be consanguineous. Significant symptomatic improvement in the patient could be discerned after timely intervention with the valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David V procedure) and a concomitant aortic arch replacement. This is a unique report with a successful outcome that highlights the occurrence of a rare hereditary aortopathy associated with a high morbidity and mortality, and the importance of an early diagnosis and timely management.

FFP2/3 respirator masks, which fit tightly and gap free, generally provide very good protection. In public transport, while shopping or in waiting rooms, they are therefore ideally suited to protect against direct and indirect infection. Unfortunately, these masks make it difficult to breathe and can be uncomfortable to wear in the long run. Therefore, these masks should be worn for a maximum of 3 x 75 minutes per day. These masks are therefore hardly suitable for schools or at work. The question therefore arises as to how people in closed rooms can be permanently protected from a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Large safety distances provide both self protection and protection of third parties, but they do not protect against indirect infection if the virus load in the room is high. Mouth and nose covers only offer protection of others against direct infection, but they do not protect the user against indirect infection. The same applies to faceshields and small protective walls. Indirect infections can be effectively prevented by free ventilation with windows or air conditioning systems that supply 100% outside air into the room, provided the air exchange rate is at minimum six times the room volume per hour. However, free ventilation by means of windows is rarely efficient enough, and in winter at the latest, it is no longer possible to open windows without wasting massive amounts of energy and endangering the health and well-being of people. The operation of air conditioning systems is also very energy-intensive during the cold season. Furthermore, most buildings do not have air conditioning systems. The question is therefore, how a largely safe protection against an indirect SARS-CoV-2 infection can be realized in closed rooms without wasting thermal energy and thus valuable resources. Technically, the problem can be solved with mobile disinfection devices or room air cleaners that separate the dangerous aerosol particles or inactivate the viruses by UV radiation or by contact with charge carriers. The potential of these devices is great and, since many German manufacturers produce these devices, they are also available. However, many of the devices offered do not provide effective protection because the volume flow is too small, the separation efficiency of the filters is too low and the performance of the UV and ionization unit is too weak. The Viromed Klinik Akut V 500 disinfection unit appears to meet the performance requirements and therefore the device is analyzed and evaluated in this study for its suitability to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Quantification of a Viromed Klinik Akut V 500 disinfection device to reduce the indirect risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by aerosol particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In March 2020, Qatar started reporting increased numbers of COVID-19 cases At that stage, containment measures were put in place The health authority in Qatar developed an emergency action plan to respond to the outbreak with the Primary Health Care as the main component of that response and suspended all non-urgent services including preventive health services The aim of the retrospective analysis to measure the Impact of COVID-19 on the preventive services provided in Qatar Methods: A retrospective data analysis was conducted for all the preventive services utilization volume across the 27 PHCC health centres from the 1st of January 2017 to the 31st of July 2020 Results: With 17,012 no-show appointments, well-baby and Immunization services utilization demonstrated a reduction of 40% in May and started to come back to volumes higher than expected in June The breast cancer and colorectal cancer screening programmes expected volumes demand has dropped by 100% in comparison to 2017 demand due to their respective appointments' cancelation Wellness services only met 20% of its projected utilization in April, however, the services picked up in June Conclusion: These findings will guide the public health policymakers to understand the effects COVID-19 on preventive services and the risk of having an increased number of outbreaks for childhood communicable disease, cancer cases with delayed diagnosis due to the screening services suspension In addition, the plan will address the increased number of sedately behaviour due to the service's reduced utilization of wellness services","output":"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the preventive services in Qatar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the studies on developing sensors and biosensorswith an obvious interdisciplinary characterhave drawn the attention of many researchers specializing in various fundamental, but also complex domains such as chemistry, biochemistry, physics, biophysics, biology, bio-pharma-medicine, and bioengineering.

The disease is acute, occurs predominantly in intensively reared animals and characterized by a short incubation period, anorexia and diarrhoea. Post-infection immunity and immune system and intestinal microbiome maturation make immunocompetent adults of different species resistant to clinical RV disease. RVs of groups A, B, C, E, H, I and J have been detected in sporadic, endemic or epidemic infections of various mammalian species, whereas RV strains of groups D, F and G are only found in poultry, such as chickens and turkeys. Recently identified novel RVs in sheltered dogs in Hungary and bats in Serbia are tentatively identified as group I and J, respectively. Historically, diagnosis of RV infections relied on conventional techniques such as isolation in cell culture, electron microscopy, electropherotyping and various serological tests. Presently, RT-PCR assays and molecular typing using sequencing or genomic hybridization techniques are used predominantly for RV diagnosis and classification. Because RVs are endemic in most animal populations and exhibit extreme genetic diversity due to frequent mutations and re-assortment events, available RV vaccines are only marginally efficient, and eradication of the pathogen remains a challenge. Thus, a better understanding of the historic and current prevalence and genetic diversity of animal RVs in different geographic regions, disease pathogenesis, available control strategies and zoonotic potential is needed.

The protein is a minor virion structural component that plays an important, not fully understood role in virus production. It was recently demonstrated that the protein forms ion channels. We investigated the importance of the hydrophobic domain of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) A59 E protein. Alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis was used to examine the effect of disruption of the domain on virus production in the context of the virus genome by using a MHV A59 infectious clone. Mutant viruses exhibited smaller plaque phenotypes, and virus production was significantly crippled. Analysis of recovered viruses suggested that the structure of the presumed alpha-helical structure and positioning of polar hydrophilic residues within the predicted transmembrane domain are important for virus production. Generation of viruses with restored wild-type helical pitch resulted in increased virus production, but some exhibited decreased virus release. Viruses with the restored helical pitch were more sensitive to treatment with the ion channel inhibitor hexamethylene amiloride than were the more crippled parental viruses with the single alanine insertions, suggesting that disruption of the transmembrane domain affects the functional activity of the protein.

All the motor and non-motor symptoms were investigated. The exercise of the PD patients was evaluated using the Physical Activity Scale of the Elderly (PASE)-leisure score. We classified patients into PD without PI (HY stage 1 C 2) and PD with PI (HY stage 2.5 C 3) groups. Multivariate linear regression was performed using backward elimination in each group to determine factors associated with PASE-leisure score. Results: A total of 233 patients were enrolled.

We conducted a real-life study to evaluate the performance of two RDTs, COVID-PRESTO and COVID-DUO, compared to the gold standard, RT-PCR. Methods RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2 was performed from nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected in adult patients visiting the infectious disease department at the hospital (Orleans, France). Fingertip whole blood samples taken at different time points after onset of the disease were tested with RDTs. The specificity and sensitivity of the rapid test kits compared to test of reference (RT-PCR) were calculated. Results Among 381 patients with symptoms of COVID-19 who went to the hospital for a diagnostic, 143 patients were RT-PCR negative. Results of test with RDTs were all negative for these patients, indicating a specificity of 100% for both RDTs. In the RT-PCR positive subgroup (n=238), 133 patients were tested with COVID-PRESTO and 129 patients were tested with COVID-DUO (24 patients tested with both). The further the onset of symptoms was from the date of collection, the greater the sensitivity. The sensitivity of COVID-PRESTO test ranged from 10.00% for patients having experienced their 1st symptoms from 0 to 5 days ago to 100% in patients where symptoms had occurred more than 15 days before the date of tests. For COVID-DUO test, the sensitivity ranged from 35.71% [0-5 days] to 100% (> 15 days). Conclusion COVID-PRESTO and DUO RDTs turned out to be very specific (none false positive) and to be sensitive enough after 15 days from onset of symptom.

Along with their cost-efficient solution processability and flexible substrate compatibility, PbS QDs are highly interesting for the quantum-size-effect tunability of their bandgaps, spectral sensitivities, and wide absorption ranges.

The aim and objectives of this knowledge-synthesis study were to identify the impact of the pandemic on children's and adolescent's mental health and to evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions employed during previous and the current pandemic to promote children's and adolescents' mental health. Methodology: We conducted the systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included experimental randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, observational studies, and qualitative studies. Results: Of the 5828 articles that we retrieved, 18 articles met the inclusion criteria. We thematically analyzed them and put the major findings under the thematic areas of impact of the pandemic on children's and adolescents' mental health. These studies reported that pandemics cause stress, worry, helplessness, and social and risky behavioral problems among children and adolescents (e.g., substance abuse, suicide, relationship problems, academic issues, and absenteeism from work). Interventions such as art-based programs, support services, and clinician-led mental health and psychosocial services effectively decrease mental health issues among children and adolescents. Conclusion: Children and adolescents are more likely to experience high rates of depression and anxiety during and after a pandemic. It is critical that future researchers explore effective mental health strategies that are tailored to the needs of children and adolescents. Explorations of effective channels regarding the development and delivery of evidenced-based, age-appropriate services are vital to lessen the effects and improve long-term capacities for mental health services for children and adolescents. Key Practitioner Message: The COVID-19 pandemic's physical restrictions and social distancing measures have affected each and every domain of life. Although the number of children and adolescents affected by the disease is small, the disease and the containment measures such as social distancing, school closure, and isolation have negatively impacted the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents. The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children and adolescents is of great concern. Anxiety, depression, disturbances in sleep and appetite, as well as impairment in social interactions are the most common presentations. It has been indicated that compared to adults, this pandemic may continue to have increased long term adverse consequences on children's and adolescents' mental health. As the pandemic continues, it is important to monitor the impact on children's and adolescents' mental health status and how to help them to improve their mental health outcomes in the time of the current or future pandemics.","output":"Mental Health of Children and Adolescents Amidst COVID-19 and Past Pandemics: A Rapid Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study presents a model of computer-aided intelligence capable of automatically detecting positive COVID-19 instances for use in regular medical applications.

Burden assessment included measurement of analgesia, cognitive functioning, basic activities of daily living, severity and frequency of comorbidities, and all-cause mortality. Costs accounted for healthcare resource utilization and related costs (year 2018). RESULTS Records of 13,317 patients were analyzed; 68.9 (14.7) years old, 71.3% (70.5-72.1%) women, 58.1% refractory to NSAID plus weak opioid and 41.9% to NSAID plus strong opioid, accounting for 10.7% (10.5-10.8%) of patients with chronic OA pain. Mean number of comorbidities was 2.9 (1.8) and its severity was 1.8 (1.7). Pain decreased by 0.9 points (12.2%) and cognitive declined by 2.3 points (9.1%, with 4.3% more patients with cognitive deficit) and dependency worsened by 0.4 points (0.5%, with 2.3% more patients with severe-to-total dependence) over a mean treatment period of 188.6 (185.4-191.8) days on NSAIDs followed by 400.6 (393.7-407.5) days on opioids. The adjusted mortality rate was higher in patients with OA taking NSAID plus strong opioids; hazard ratio 1.44 (1.26-1.65; p < 0.001). The 4-year healthcare cost was 7350/patient (7193-7507 or 1838/year) and was higher in those taking strong versus weak opioids; 9886 (9608-10,164, 2472/year) vs. 5519 (5349-5689, 1380/year), p < 0.001. Analgesia cost (16.0% of total cost, 70.2% opioids) was higher with strong versus weak opioids, 19.6% vs. 11.3%, p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS In routine clinical practice in Spain, patients with moderate-to-severe chronic OA pain refractory to standard analgesic treatment with NSAIDs plus opioids reported modest reductions in pain, while presenting a considerable burden of comorbidities, cognitive impairment, and dependency. Healthcare costs significantly increased for the NHS particularly with NSAIDs plus strong opioids.","output":"Disease Burden and Costs in Moderate-to-Severe Chronic Osteoarthritis Pain Refractory to Standard of Care: Ancillary Analysis of the OPIOIDS Real-World Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic that broke out in Israel in February 2020 prompted widespread public response, which included a deluge of humorous memes. The current article discusses the main meme cycles of the pandemic with the aim of uncovering the functions of the humorous meme, and particularly its singular language, which incorporates the universal and the particular, the global and the local, the hegemonic and the subversive. The memes are examined in their immediate context, as responses to news announcements, restrictions, and rumors relating to the pandemic, and from a comparative perspective, with emphasis on the various functions of disaster jokes and the use of folklore in response to previous epidemics, crises, or risks. Alongside the hybrid nature of the genre, these meme cycles demonstrate that COVID-19 is not just a threatening virus but a new reality that undermines our experience of time and space, evoking old beliefs and new, and threatening to change everyday practices. These narratives not only reflect the incongruities evoked by the virus, but also give vent to anxieties and aggressions brought on by the pandemic and convey a communal need to protect and foster group cohesion and a local sense of belonging.","output":"A pandemic of jokes?

However, these existing methods requires advantaged MR sequences which needs fine acquisition and huge cost consumption. To address this problem, we proposed a new method for generating synthetic CT using Patch Learning (SCG-PL). Global model of SCG-PL is transfer learning and patch model is semi-supervised classification. The advantages of our method can be summarized into two points. (1) Patch learning is a gradual learning process with gradually updating global model on remodeling patch model, so our SCG-PL method is gradually capable of generating synthetic CT. (2) Semi-supervised classification adopted in the process of patch learning, only small amount of labeled data is needed in SCG-PL, which greatly reduced the workload of radiologists. The experimental results indicate that proposed SCG-PL method can effectively generate synthetic CT image from challenging abdomen images using mDixon MR sequence data only.","output":"mDixon-Based Synthetic CT Generation via Patch Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chlorhexidine has been one of the most effective and popular antiseptic substances used in medicine for decades.

In particular, Europe and the Americas have been heavily affected by high infection and death rates. In contrast, much lower infection rates and mortality have been reported generally in Africa, particularly in the sub-Saharan region (with the exception of the Southern Africa region). There are different hypotheses for this African paradox, including less testing, the young age of the population, genetic disposition, and behavioral and epidemiological factors. In the present review, we address different immunological factors and their correlation with genetic factors, pre-existing immune status, and differences in cytokine induction patterns. We also focus on epidemiological factors, such as specific medication coverage, helminth distribution, and malaria endemics in the sub-Saharan region. An analysis combining different factors is presented that highlights the central role of the NF-B signaling pathway in the African paradox. Importantly, insights into the interplay of different factors with the underlying immune pathological mechanisms for COVID-19 can provide a better understanding of the disease and the development of new targets for more efficient treatment strategies.","output":"COVID-19: Mechanistic Model of the African Paradox Supports the Central Role of the NF-B Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been identified as the cause of a pandemic called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, vitamin D levels have been put into relation with both the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19. The results from different studies are, however, not conclusive, since several variables impact on this relationship. In this study, we investigated the impact of the stringent confinement during the MarchCApril 2020 lockdown on vitamin D levels and the relationship with the recorded sun exposure in the considered area (Milano, Italy). Furthermore, we investigated the eventual relationship between vitamin D levels and SARS-CoV-2 infection in different age groups throughout the pandemic, including the first and second wave, as well as the lockdown and between-lockdown periods. Taken together, our data suggest that 25-(OH)D levels are neither related with sun exposure nor with SARS-CoV-2 infection. ABSTRACT: Background. We investigated the changes in 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25-(OH)D] concentrations values, during the first and the second pandemic waves and the impact of the lockdown periods, with their different approaches to home confinement, among different age groups. Methods. Daily cloud-modified vitamin D UV dose (UVDVC), for the area of interest (Milano, Italy), was obtained. Single-center 25-(OH)D determinations from 40,996 individuals in a 2019 (pre-pandemic), 32,355 individuals from 1 January to 31 August 2020 (containing the first pandemic wave) and 27,684 individuals from 1 June to 30 November 2020 (containing the second wave) were compared to investigate both the effect of the lockdown on vitamin D status and the association between 25-(OH)D and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Results. No direct association was found between UVDVC, 25-(OH)D status and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The stringent confinement implemented during the first wave lockdown has not had any effect on 25-(OH)D status, although some peculiar time-restricted profile behaviors can be deduced, possibly due to vitamin D supplementation habits and features of those patients who presented to the hospital during the lockdown period. Conclusions. Although our data do not suggest any direct relationship between 25-(OH)D status, sun exposure, and SARS-CoV-2 infection, an indirect protective role cannot be excluded.","output":"Changes in 25-(OH) Vitamin D Levels during the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak: Lockdown-Related Effects and First-to-Second Wave DifferenceAn Observational Study from Northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The chapter discusses the issues of food safety and bioterrorism from the position of public health.

There are controversies as to whether a mediastinal negative result in PET-CT may spare the invasive staging of the mediastinum. The main endpoint is to evaluate the negative predictive value (NPV) of PET-CT in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) clinical stage IB-IIA without clinical nodal involvement. The secondary endpoint is to evaluate the prevalence of mediastinal and hilar nodal affection in this population. METHODS: We performed an observational descriptive study from January 2010 to January 2020, including 76 patients with clinical stage IB-IIA, who underwent pulmonary resection with systematic nodal sampling (pre-determined lymph node stations based on tumour location) for primary NSCLC. Clinically, nodal involvement was defined as any lymph node greater than 1 cm in the short axis on a CT or with metabolic uptake greater than 2.5 SUV on PET-CT. The prevalence of nodal metastases was recorded. RESULTS: Fifty six patients had clinical stage IB and 20 had clinical stage IIA. Mean tumour size was 3.74  0.5 cm. Lobectomy was the resection procedure most frequently performed. Of the 76 patients with clinical N0 by PET-CT who underwent surgical resection, 10 (13.1%) were upstaged to pN1 and none were upstaged to pN2. NPV of PET-CT for overall nodal metastasis was 87% (95% CI: 0.79C0.94). NPV of PET-CT for N2 metastasis was 100%. CONCLUSION: PET-CT might be an alternative to invasive mediastinal staging in patients with NSCLC clinical stage IB-IIA who are surgical candidates.

Typically, this type of intervention is imposed when an epidemiological indicator in a given population exceeds a certain threshold. Then, the nonpharmaceutical intervention is lifted when the levels of the indicator used have decreased sufficiently. What is the best indicator to use? In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework to try to answer this question. More specifically, the proposed framework permits to assess and compare different event-triggered controls based on epidemiological indicators. Our methodology consists of considering some outcomes that are consequences of the nonpharmaceutical interventions that a decision maker aims to make as low as possible. The peak demand for intensive care units (ICU) and the total number of days in lockdown are examples of such outcomes. If an epidemiological indicator is used to trigger the interventions, there is naturally a trade-off between the outcomes that can be seen as a curve parameterized by the trigger threshold to be used. The computation of these curves for a group of indicators then allows the selection of the best indicator the curve of which dominates the curves of the other indicators. This methodology is illustrated using indicators in the context of COVID-19 using deterministic compartmental models in discrete-time, although the framework can be adapted for a larger class of models.","output":"Assessment of event-triggered policies of nonpharmaceutical interventions based on epidemiological indicators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Since the start of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in December 2019, pharmacists worldwide are playing a key role adopting innovative strategies to minimize the adverse impact of the pandemic.

Methods A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and LILACS for studies published between December 1st, 2019 and May 20th, 2020 without language restriction. Studies that reported services provided by pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Two independent authors performed study selection and data extraction with a consensus process. The pharmacist's intervention identified in the included studies were described based on key domains in the DEPICT v.2. Results A total of 1,189 records were identified, of which 11 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Most of them were conducted in the United States of America (n=4) and China (n=4). The most common type of publication were letters (n=4) describing the workplace of the pharmacist in hospitals (n=8). These findings showed the different roles of pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as disease prevention and infection control, adequate storage and drug supply, patient care and support for healthcare professionals.

This is a scenario generally not much anticipated by previous theory, and in particular, there has been little attention paid to the question of extinction as a means to eradicate the virus; the prevailing view appears to be that this is unfeasible without a vaccine. We use a simple well-mixed stochastic SIR model as a basis for our considerations, and calculate a new result, using branching process theory, for the distribution of times to extinction. Surprisingly, the distribution is an extreme value distribution of the Gumbel type, and we show that the key parameter determining its mean and standard deviation is the expected rate of decline Re = {gamma}(1-Re) of infections, where {gamma} is the rate of recovery from infection and Re is the usual effective reproductive number. The result also reveals a critical threshold number of infected I? = 1/(1-Re), below which stochastic forces dominate and need be considered for accurate predictions. As this theory ignores migration between populations, we compare against a realistic spatial epidemic simulator and simple stochastic simulations of sub-divided populations with global migration, to find very comparable results to our simple predictions; in particular, we find global migration has the effect of a simple upwards rescaling of Re with the same Gumbel extinction time distribution we derive from our non-spatial model. Within the UK, using recent estimates of I0{approx}37000 infected and Re= 0.9, this model predicts a mean extinction time of 616{+/-}90 days or approximately ~2 years, but could be as short as 123{+/-}15 days, or roughly 4 months for Re = 0.4. Globally, the theory predicts extinction in less than 200 days, if the reproductive number is restricted to Re < 0.5. Overall, these results highlight the extreme sensitivity of extinction times when Re approaches 1 and the necessity of reducing the effective reproductive number significantly (Re<{approx}0.5) for relatively rapid extinction of an epidemic or pandemic.","output":"Stochastic extinction of epidemics: how long does would it take for Sars-Cov-2 to die out?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: the COVID-19 pandemic causes biological diagnostic problems that remain relevant in low-income countries in general and in Cameroon in particular.

METHODS: a cross-sectional and comparative study was carried out from April 27 to May 29, 2021 in the city of Douala in Cameroon. The samples consisted of nasopharyngeal swabs received at the molecular biology laboratory of the Douala Gyneco-obstetric and pediatric hospital, whatever their origin. The socio-demographic parameters (age, profession, football players, travelers, others), marital status, nationality), comorbidity and known status of COVID-19, were recorded on the collection sites. The main collection sites were the De?do Health District and the Douala Gyneco-Obstetric and Pediatric Hospital. We performed the diagnosis of COVID-19 using the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) BIOSYNEX(?) COVID-19 Ag BSS and RDT BIOSYNEX(?) COVID-19 Ag + BSS compared to each other and to the AmpliQuick(?) SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on each sample. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using Microsoft Excel and SPSS version 17 software. To determine the sensitivity of the two RDTs, the Bayesian latent class model was performed on the median with a 95% confidence interval with p<0.05 as the significant level. An ethical clearance was sought and obtained from the University of Douala Institutional Ethics Committee. RESULTS: a total of 1813 participants were included in our study, with a predominance of men (1226, 68.68 %) and the most represented age group was that of 31 to 40 years (568, 31.33 %). Most of the participants were married (888, 53.46%) and only a few had a known COVID-19 status (75, 5.47%). The two rapid tests on our study population show much closed COVID-19 prevalence values, respectively 2.03 for BIOSYNEX(?) COVID-19 Ag BSS and 2.17 for BIOSYNEX(?) COVID-19 Ag + BSS. RDT BIOSYNEX(?)

Trajectories of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) were analysed with respect to loneliness, physical activity levels and a number of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Findings 3,281 people completed the COVID-19 mental health questionnaire, all had at least one data point prior to 2020. In 2020, the adjusted PHQ-9 score for loneliness was 3.2. (95% CI: 3.0-3.4), an increase of one point on previous years and 2 points higher than people not rated lonely, whose score did not change in 2020 (1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3). PHQ-9 was 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4-2.8) in people with decreased physical activity, an increase of 0.5 on previous years. In contrast, PHQ-9 in 2020 for people whose physical activity had not decreased was 1.7 (95% CI: 1.6-1.8), similar to previous years. A similar relationship was observed for GAD-7 though the differences were smaller and the absolute burden of symptoms lower. Interpretation After accounting for pre-COVID-19 trends, we show that experiencing loneliness and decreased physical activity are risk factors for worsening mental health during the pandemic. Our findings highlight the need to examine policies which target these potentially modifiable risk factors.","output":"Loneliness, physical activity and mental health during Covid-19: a longitudinal analysis of depression and anxiety between 2015 and 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sinonasal malignancies (SNM) include malignant neoplasms of various histologies that originate from the paranasal sinuses or nasal cavity. This study reported the safety and efficacy of particle-beam radiation therapy (PBRT) for the treatment of sinonasal malignancies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: One-hundred-and-eleven patients with nonmetastatic sinonasal malignancies received definitive (82.9%) or salvage (31.5%) PBRT. The majority (85.6%) of patients presented with T3/4 disease, and only 19 (17.1%) had R0 or R1 resection. Seventy (63.1%) patients received carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT), 37 received proton radiotherapy (PRT) followed by CIRT boost, and 4 received PRT alone. Prognostic factors were analyzed using Cox regression for univariate and multiple regression. Toxicities were reported using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). RESULTS: The median follow-up was 20.2 months for the entire cohort. The 2-year local progression-free survival (LPFS), regional progression-free survival (RPFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were 83%, 97.2%, 85.9%, 66%, and 82%, respectively. Re-irradiation and large GTV were the significant factors for OS. Melanoma and sarcoma patients had significantly higher distant metastatic rate, and poorer OS and PFS. Late toxicity occurred in 22 (19.8%) patients, but only 4 (3.6%) patients experienced grades 3-4 late toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Particle-beam radiation therapy results in excellent local-regional control with extremely low serve toxicities for patients with SNM. Sarcoma and melanoma were featured with a greater risk of death from distant dissemination. Patients who underwent re-irradiation had significantly worse OS. PBRT is feasible and safe in the management of SNM.","output":"Particle beam radiation therapy for sinonasal malignancies: Single institutional experience at the Shanghai Proton and Heavy Ion Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Truncated human coronavirus HCoV-229E spike glycoproteins containing amino acids 407 to 547 bound to purified, soluble virus receptor, human aminopeptidase N (hAPN).

Self-compassion refers to feelings of concern an individual feel towards oneself. Both may serve as potential buffers in a hospital setting where caregivers attending to patients in critical condition experience emotional distress, which may lead to burnout. However, the unique contribution of compassion, both to self and others, to the decrease of burnout is unclear. METHODS: In the present study, we recruited 109 professional caregivers working in a hospitals intensive care and rehabilitative units. We explored a theoretically driven mediation model in which the relationship between compassion for self and others and burnout is mediated by different basic psychological needs, detailed in the self-determination theory. RESULTS: Results indicated that self-compassion and concern for others were associated with reduced levels of burnout. Each of these buffers against burnout was mediated by a unique psychological need, thereby supporting a three-layered model of (a) compassion and self-compassion, (b) basic psychological needs, and (c) burnout.

METHODS The use of curares (Atracurium, Cisatracurium and Rocuronium) was compared with the usual use levels in our hospital. Supply issues have been identified and investigated. The risk of medication errors was clearly established and considered. RESULTS Despite an increased demand, our hospital has not experienced any disruption in the supply of curare medications. But the risk of curare shortages has led to the registration of new pharmaceutical forms and dosages never used before. We also observed necessary switches between different curares. All of this has contributed to an increased risk of medication errors. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, the pharmaceutical management of curare medications has been particularly critical.

METHOD: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, the Spanish Official State Gazette and Eudralex. The websites of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and of the Ministry of Health, as well as the relevant UNE standards were also reviewed. RESULTS: The different types of face masks available on the market meet different regulatory requirements. Community masks are not considered medical devices or personal protective equipment and do not require marketing authorization. They do not carry a CE mark and need not comply with the general regulations applicable to consumer products. Surgical masks, for their part, must meet the quality criteria defined in UNE-EN standard 14683: 2019. According to Regulation (EU) 745/2017 they are class I devices, subject to an EU declaration of conformity, and must bear a CE mark. Filtering masks are considered category III personal protective equipment, regulated by Regulation (EU) 2016/425, and must also bear a CE mark. In spite the abundant regulations in place, market control instruments have detected counterfeit face masks, which means that public authorities and users should ask manufacturers or suppliers for additional information in case of doubt. CONCLUSIONS: The legal and quality requirements of the masks are sufficient for their safe use.

METHODS: Clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers were recruited across three English regions and tested monthly from March to November 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and nucleoprotein (N) antibodies using five different immunoassays. In positive individuals, antibody responses and long-term trends were modelled using mixed effects regression. FINDINGS: In total, 2246 individuals attended 12,247 visits and 264 were seropositive in &#8805; 2 assays. Most seroconversions occurred between March and April 2020. The assays showed > 85% agreement for ever-positivity, although this changed markedly over time. Antibodies were detected earlier with Abbott (N) but declined rapidly thereafter. With the EuroImmun (S) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) assays, responses increased for 4 weeks then fell until week 12-16 before stabilising. For Roche (N), responses increased until 8 weeks, stabilised, then declined, but most remained above the positive threshold. For Roche (S), responses continued to climb over the full 24 weeks, with no sero-reversions.

Although the peak sensitivity of RT-PCR can be high, the probability of detecting an infection will vary throughout the course of an infection. The effectiveness of routine asymptomatic testing will therefore depend on testing frequency and how PCR detection varies over time. METHODS: We fitted a Bayesian statistical model to a dataset of twice weekly PCR tests of UK healthcare workers performed by self-administered nasopharyngeal swab, regardless of symptoms. We jointly estimated times of infection and the probability of a positive PCR test over time following infection; we then compared asymptomatic testing strategies by calculating the probability that a symptomatic infection is detected before symptom onset and the probability that an asymptomatic infection is detected within 7 days of infection. RESULTS: We estimated that the probability that the PCR test detected infection peaked at 77% (54-88%) 4 days after infection, decreasing to 50% (38-65%) by 10 days after infection. Our results suggest a substantially higher probability of detecting infections 1-3 days after infection than previously published estimates. We estimated that testing every other day would detect 57% (33-76%) of symptomatic cases prior to onset and 94% (75-99%) of asymptomatic cases within 7 days if test results were returned within a day. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that routine asymptomatic testing can enable detection of a high proportion of infected individuals early in their infection, provided that the testing is frequent and the time from testing to notification of results is sufficiently fast.","output":"Estimating the effectiveness of routine asymptomatic PCR testing at different frequencies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the South African government employed various nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in order to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Here, we evaluated performance characteristics of TaqMan SARS-CoV-2 mutation panel genotyping molecular assay for detection of most common published SARS-CoV-2 variants using specific RT-PCR assays targeting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Methods & Materials A total of 150 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from March to July were included for this study. In addition, five controls comprised of synthetic RNA B.1.1.7_601443, B.1.351_678597, B.1.351_678597, P.1_792683, B.1.617.1_1662307 and MN908947.3-Wuhan-hu-1 from Twist bioscience and B.1.1.7 (England/204820464/2020) and B.1.351 (South Africa/KRISP-K005325/2020) from (Zeptometrix, NY, USA) were used for validation. RNA from all specimens were extracted using Omega Bio-Tek Mag-Bind Viral RNA Xpress Extraction Kit and tested for known SARS-CoV2 variants using ThermoFisher TaqMan SARS-CoV-2 mutation panel molecular assay on the Quant Studio 12K Flex. Nine representative samples have been compared with sequencing. Data were analyzed by genotype calling using QuantStudioTM design and analysis software v2.5 with the genotyping analysis module. Results All validation controls were tested in triplicate and repeated in singlet on three different days and all reported variants were matching as expected. Out of 150 SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens, 69 (46%) were B.1.617.2, 49 (32.7%) were B.1.1.7, P.1 and P.2 were 4 (2.7%) each and B.1.351 and B.1.427/B.1429 were 2 (1.3%) each. 3 (2%) were B.1.526, and 17 (11.3%) have mutation in D614G.

The disease is caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which infects the intestinal mucosal surface. Therefore, mucosal immunization through the oral route is an effective method of immunization. Lactic acid bacteria, which are acid resistant and bile-salt resistant and improve mucosal immunity, are ideal carriers for oral vaccines. The S1 glycoprotein of PEDV mediates binding of the virus with cell receptors and induces neutralizing antibodies against the virus. Therefore, we reversely screened the recombinant strain pPG-SD-S1/upp ATCC 393 expressing PEDV S1 glycoprotein by Lactobacillus casei deficient in upp genotype (upp ATCC 393). Mice were orally immunized three times with the recombinant bacteria that had been identified for expression, and the changes of anti-PEDV IgG and secreted immunoglobulin A levels were observed over 70 days. The results indicated that the antibody levels notably increased after oral administration of recombinant bacteria. The detection of extracellular cytokines on the 42nd day after immunization indicated high levels of humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. The above results demonstrate that pPG-SD-S1/upp ATCC 393 has great potential as an oral vaccine against PEDV.","output":"Evaluation of the Immunogenicity in Mice Orally Immunized with Recombinant Lactobacillus casei Expressing Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus S1 Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has developed into a pandemic, yet still has many unknowns.

Little is known about the dynamic changes in the patient immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and how different responses are correlated with disease severity and outcomes. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this prospective research. The demographic information, medical history, symptoms, signs and laboratory results were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients. The leukocytes, lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were longitudinally collected. RESULTS: Of the 74 patients included, 17 suffered from severe disease. The severe patients tended be older (65.29  12.33 years vs. 45.37  18.66 years) and had a greater degree of underlying disease (41.18% vs. 24.56%), lower baseline lymphocyte counts [0.64 (0.46C0.95)  10(9) vs. 1.27 (0.95C1.70)  10(9)], higher neutrophilClymphocyte ratios [NLRs; 3.76 (3.15C5.51) vs. 2.07 (1.48C2.93)] and lower baseline eosinophil counts [0 (0C0.01)  10(9) vs. 0.03 (0.01C0.06)  10(9)] than those in non-severe patients. The baseline helper T (Th) cells (335.47 vs. 666.46/l), suppressor T(Ts) cells (158 vs. 334/l), B cells (95 vs. 210/l) and natural killer (NK) cells (52 vs. 122/l) were significantly decreased in severe cases compared to that in non-severe cases. In addition, the baseline neutrophils were positively correlated with the severity of COVID-19, and the baseline lymphocytes were negatively correlated with the severity of COVID-19. The dynamic change of T cells, Th cells and IFN- in the severe cases were parallel to the amelioration of the disease.

However, their acceptance is only partial, with vaccine hesitancy and refusal representing a major health threat. Influenza vaccines have low compliance since repeated, annual vaccination is required. Influenza vaccines stimulate discussions both in the real world and online. Social media is currently a significant source of health and medical information. Elucidating the association between social media engagement and influenza vaccination is important and may be applicable to other vaccines, including ones against COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to characterize profiles of social media engagement regarding the influenza vaccine and their association with knowledge and compliance in order to support improvement of future web-associated vaccination campaigns. METHODS: A weblink to an online survey in Hebrew was disseminated over social media and messaging platforms. The survey answers were collected during April 2020. Anonymous and volunteer participants aged 21 years and over answered 30 questions related to sociodemographics; social media usage; influenza- and vaccine-related knowledge and behavior; health-related information searching, its reliability, and its influence; and COVID-19-related information searching. A univariate descriptive data analysis was performed, followed by multivariate analysis via building a decision tree to define the most important attributes associated with vaccination compliance. RESULTS: A total of 213 subjects responded to the survey, of whom 207 were included in the analysis; the majority of the respondents were female, were aged 21 to 40 years, had 1 to 2 children, lived in central Israel, were secular Israeli natives, had higher education, and had a salary close to the national average. Most respondents (128/207, 61.8%) were not vaccinated against influenza in 2019 and used social media. Participants that used social media were younger, secular, and living in high-density agglomerations and had lower influenza vaccination rates. The perceived influence and reliability of the information on social media about COVID-19 were generally similar to those perceptions about influenza. CONCLUSIONS: Using social media is negatively linked to compliance with seasonal influenza vaccination in this study. A high proportion of noncompliant individuals can lead to increased consumption of health care services and can, therefore, overload these health services. This is particularly crucial with a concomitant outbreak, such as COVID-19. Health care professionals should use improved and targeted health communication campaigns with the aid of experts in social media. Targeted communication, based on sociodemographic factors and personalized social media usage, might increase influenza vaccination rates and compliance with other vaccines as well.","output":"Social Media Engagement and Influenza Vaccination During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents as a newly recognized pneumonia that has brought about a global pandemic and is increasingly considered as a systemic illness.

A novel user interface (UI) displayed mirrored forms showing the scanned assessment forms with OMR results superimposed on the left and an editable web form on the right to improve ease of data validation. Crowdsourced participants validated the results of the OMR system. Overall error rate and time taken to validate were calculated. A subset of forms was validated by multiple participants to calculate agreement between participants. RESULTS: The OMR/OCR tools correctly extracted data from scanned forms fields with an average accuracy of 70% and median accuracy of 78% when the OMR/OCR results were compared with the results from crowd validation.

However, differences in risk of opioid-related adverse outcomes after an initial prescription are unknown. This study aims to determine the risk of opioid-related adverse events, defined as either chronic use or opioid overdose, following a first prescription of hydrocodone or oxycodone to opioid na?ve patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of multiple linked public health datasets in the state of Oregon. Adult patients ages 18 and older who a) received an initial prescription for oxycodone or hydrocodone between 2015C2017 and b) had no opioid prescriptions or opioid-related hospitalizations or emergency department visits in the year preceding the prescription were followed through the end of 2018. First-year chronic opioid use was defined as 6 opioid prescriptions (including index) and average 30 days uncovered between prescriptions. Fatal or non-fatal opioid overdose was indicated from insurance claims, hospital discharge data or vital records. RESULTS: After index prescription, 2.8% (n = 14,458) of individuals developed chronic use and 0.3% (n = 1,480) experienced overdose. After adjustment for patient and index prescription characteristics, patients receiving oxycodone had lower odds of developing chronic use relative to patients receiving hydrocodone (adjusted odds ratio = 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91C1.00) but a higher risk of overdose (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.65, 95% CI 1.45C1.87). Oxycodone monotherapy appears to greatly increase the hazard of opioid overdose (aHR 2.18, 95% CI 1.86C2.57) compared with hydrocodone with acetaminophen. Oxycodone combined with acetaminophen also shows a significant increase (aHR 1.26, 95% CI 1.06C1.50), but not to the same extent. CONCLUSIONS: Among previously opioid-na?ve patients, the risk of developing chronic use was slightly higher with hydrocodone, whereas the risk of overdose was higher after oxycodone, in combination with acetaminophen or monotherapy. With a goal of reducing overdose-related deaths, hydrocodone may be the favorable agent.","output":"Opioid-related overdose and chronic use following an initial prescription of hydrocodone versus oxycodone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the close relationship between the incidence of infectious diseases by epidemics and environmental conditions, this research explores the temperature, evaporation, precipitation and regional climate effects on the local transmission of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 inside 31 states and capital of Mexico since February 29 (national onset) to March 31, 2020. Statistical analysis was conducted to explore the association between the daily local COVID-19 confirmed positive cases (LCPC) and both climate characteristics and the daily weather reported by the regional meteorological stations. In this work, the local transmission ratio (LTR) was calculated with the regional LCPC divided by the number of the effective contagion days since regional onset in each state. The results showed a negative association between temperature (mean, max and min) and climate classification with both LCPC and LTR variables. The precipitation associated positively with LCPC and LTR. The associations between the climate classification with LCPC and LTR are statistically significant. The tropical climate (mean temperature around 25.95a?C and mean precipitation around 8.74a?mm) delayed the regional onset. However, the regional onset in dry climates emerged earlier as consequence of the lower temperatures and higher precipitations (20.57a?C and 20.87a?mm respectively) than the observed in the tropical climate. The fastest regional onsets were observed in tempered climates in states where the lowest temperatures and lowest precipitations were registered (19.65a?C and 8.48a?mm respectively). Meteorological factors influenced the trend on the regional outbreaks in Mexican's states likely by the host predisposition and susceptibility during the cold winter season. In Mexico, the climate characteristics played a crucial role on the local infection during the phase 1 being the tempered regions (as Michoacn, Jalisco, Puebla, etc.) more vulnerable than the dry (as Chihuahua, Durango or Zacatecas, etc.) or tropical areas (as Colima, Campeche, Morelos etc.).","output":"The temperature and regional climate effects on communitarian COVID-19 contagion in Mexico throughout phase 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ochratoxin A (OA) is a naturally occurring mycotoxin known to contaminate a variety of foods and beverages.

From 2017 to 2020, a total of 20 studies analyzed different individual- and structural-level approaches to increase PrEP adherence, including behavior change interventions, technology-based interventions (e.g., short message service messages and mobile applications), and alternate delivery strategies (e.g., pharmacy-based PrEP, integration with other services, and home delivery). Most published interventions involved men who have sex with men, although 3 assessed women (2 transgender, 1 cisgender). Randomized, controlled data support 3 behavioral change interventions and 1 technology-based intervention. Alternate delivery strategies seem promising, although more robust study designs are generally needed. In addition, data on the alignment of ongoing HIV risk and PrEP persistence (i.e., prevention-effective adherence) were limited.

This study aimed to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs providing gastroenterological services. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four HCWs at the gastroenterological service of Al-Manial University Hospital, the main hospital of the largest tertiary university hospitals complex in Egypt (Kasr Al-Ainy Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University) were tested using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal samples, and rapid serological IgM/IgG tests (RST). A questionnaire was used to collect demographic, occupational and clinical data. RESULTS: Of the 74 HCWs, 10 tested positive by RT-PCR (13.5%). In 9/74 (12.2%) HCWs, antibodies could be detected by RST: three with both IgM and IgG lines; six with IgM line only and none with IgG line only. Frequency of positive tests was more among subjects with minor symptoms compared to completely asymptomatic HCWs (50% vs 16.1%, respectively). Neither age, gender or occupation was a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Point prevalence of COVID-19 in gastroenterology HCWs is 13.5% by RT-PCR. Continued measures are warranted to assure HCWs safety and reduce transmission from healthcare settings to the community during COVID-19 pandemic.

Various problem areas in the German education system were identified that hinder the development of the teaching network. These problem areas were prioritized firstly according to the urgency of the solution from the point of view of the HiGHmed consortium and secondly according to existing competencies in the participating societies.

COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are often critically ill and show lung injury and hemolysis. Heme is a prosthetic moiety crucial for the function of a wide variety of heme-proteins, including hemoglobin and cytochromes. However, injury-derived free heme promotes adhesion molecule expression, leukocyte recruitment, vascular permeabilization, platelet activation, complement activation, thrombosis, and fibrosis. Heme can be degraded by the anti-inflammatory enzyme heme oxygenase (HO) generating biliverdin/bilirubin, iron/ferritin, and carbon monoxide. We therefore postulate that free heme contributes to many of the inflammatory phenomena witnessed in critically ill COVID-19 patients, whilst induction of HO-1 or harnessing heme may provide protection. HO-activity not only degrades injurious heme, but its effector molecules possess also potent salutary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Until a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 becomes available, we need to explore novel strategies to attenuate the pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic, and pro-fibrotic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 leading to morbidity and mortality.

Nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, blood, and urine were collected. Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging. RESULTS: In 95 samples that tested positive by both methods, the cycle threshold (Ct) of RT-PCR was highly correlated with the copy number of ddPCR (ORF1ab gene, R2a? =a? 0.83; N gene, R2a? =a? 0.87). Four (4/161) negative and 41 (41/67) single-gene positive samples tested by RT-PCR were positive according to ddPCR with viral loads ranging from 11.1 to 123.2 copies/test.

Additionally, we included a fifth dimension, called pro-health motivation (four questions). The questions composed an electronic questionnaire disseminated by social networks for an one-week period. Answers were quantitative values of subjective representations, obtained by a psychophysically constructed scale with verbal anchors ratio (CentiMax ? ). Mean time for total filling was 12 minutes (standard deviation = 1.6). RESULTS We obtained 277 complete responses to the form. One was excluded because it belonged to a participant under 18 years old. Reproducibility measures were significant for 22 of the 24 questions in our questionnaire (Cronbach's &#945; = 0.883).

A prospective cohort of 125 young people (12-25 years) with beginning mental health complaints will be on the platform and followed for a year, of which 10 participants will have an additional smart watch and 10 participants will be asked to provide feedback about the platform. Data will be collected at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months. Outcome measures are Psychological Distress assessed with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), positive mental health indicators measured by the Positive Health Instrument, stress biomarkers with a smart-watch, website journeys of visitors, and feedback of youth about the platform. It will be a mixed-method study design, containing qualitative and quantitative measures. ? Discussion: This trial will specifically address young people with emerging mental health complaints, and offers a new approach for treatment in the Netherlands. Considering the waiting lists in (Child and adolescent)-psychiatry and the increase in suicides among youth, early low-threshold and non-stigmatizing help to support young people with emerging psychiatric symptoms is of crucial importance. Moreover, this project aims to bridge the gap between child and adolescent and adult psychiatry.?

Structural equation modeling was used to study the relationship between the risk of in-store infection, emotions and in-shop behavior, based on data retrieved from 914 questionnaires. Results showed, that the perceived risk of becoming infected in a store causes an increase in arousal and, at the same time, a decrease in perceived pleasure during shopping. The rise in arousal led to an increase in consumers taking actions to decrease their risk of contagion, while an increase in noticeable pleasure lowered interest of following recommendations for pandemic behavior. The findings imply that through changes regarding in-store atmosphere, stationary shops can provide consumers with a sense of urgency and awareness of infection risk so that they may do their shopping more efficiently.","output":"The impact of emotions on shopping behavior during epidemic.

Mechanistic understanding of how these nucleoporins regulate RNA export requires analyses of the intrinsic and activated Dbp5 ATPase cycle. Here, kinetic and equilibrium analyses of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gle1-activated Dbp5 ATPase cycle are presented, indicating that Gle1 and ATP, but not ADP-Pi or ADP, binding to Dbp5 are thermodynamically coupled. As a result, Gle1 binds Dbp5-ATP > 100-fold more tightly than Dbp5 in other nucleotide states and Gle1 equilibrium binding of ATP to Dbp5 increases >150-fold via slowed ATP dissociation. Second, Gle1 accelerated Dbp5 ATPase activity by increasing the rate-limiting Pi release rate constant a??20-fold, which remains rate limiting. These data show that Gle1 activates Dbp5 by modulating ATP binding and Pi release. These Gle1 activities are expected to facilitate ATPase cycling, ensuring a pool of ATP bound Dbp5 at NPCs to engage RNA during export. This work provides a mechanism of Gle1-activation of Dbp5 and a framework to understand the joint roles of Gle1, Nup159, and other nucleoporins in regulating Dbp5 to mediate RNA export and other Dbp5 functions in gene expression.","output":"The nucleoporin Gle1 activates DEAD-box protein 5 (Dbp5) by promoting ATP binding and accelerating rate limiting phosphate release"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We evaluated measures to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) in Vancouver, Canada, where variants of concern (VOC) went from <1% VOC in February 2021 to >92% in mid-May. Canada has amongst the longest periods between vaccine doses worldwide, despite Vancouver having the highest P.1 variant rate outside Brazil. METHODS: With surveillance data since the pandemic began, we tracked laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, positivity rates, and vaccine uptake in all 25,558 HCWs in Vancouver Coastal Health, by occupation and subsector, and compared to the general population. Cox regression modelling adjusted for age and calendar-time calculated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 in fully vaccinated ( 7 days post-second dose), partially vaccinated infection (after 14 days) and unvaccinated HCWs; we also compared with unvaccinated community members of the same age-range. FINDINGS: Only 3.3% of our HCWs became infected, mirroring community rates, with peak positivity of 9.1%, compared to 11.8% in the community. As vaccine coverage increased, SARS-CoV-2 infections declined significantly in HCWs, despite a surge with predominantly VOC; unvaccinated HCWs had an infection rate of 1.3/10,000 person-days compared to 0.89 for HCWs post first dose, and 0.30 for fully vaccinated HCWs. VE compared to unvaccinated HCWs was 37.2% (95% CI: 16.6C52.7%) 14 days post-first dose, 79.2% (CI: 64.6C87.8%) 7 days post-second dose; one dose provided significant protection against infection until at least day 42. Compared with community infection rates, VE after one dose was 54.7% (CI: 44.8C62.9%); and 84.8% (CI: 75.2C90.7%) when fully vaccinated. INTERPRETATION: Rigorous droplet-contact precautions with N95s for aerosol-generating procedures are effective in preventing occupational infection in HCWs, with one dose of mRNA vaccination further reducing infection risk despite VOC and transmissibility concerns. Delaying second doses to allow more widespread vaccination against severe disease, with strict public health, occupational health and infection control measures, has been effective in protecting the healthcare workforce.","output":"Infection control, occupational and public health measures including mRNA-based vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infections to protect healthcare workers from variants of concern: A 14-month observational study using surveillance data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autoinflammatory disease can result from monogenic errors of immunity.

By custom single-cell RNA sequencing, we examine mosaicism with single-cell resolution. We find that JAK1 transcription was predominantly restricted to a single allele across different cells, introducing the concept of a mutational \\"transcriptotype\\" that differs from the genotype. Functionally, the mutation increases JAK1 activity and transactivates partnering JAKs, independent of its catalytic domain. S703I JAK1 is not only hypermorphic for cytokine signaling but also neomorphic, as it enables signaling cascades not canonically mediated by JAK1. Given these results, the patient was treated with tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor, leading to the rapid resolution of clinical disease.

The impacts of income shocks on mental health may differ across U.S. states during the pandemic, as states have different policy contexts that likely influence mental health. The present study uses survey data from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey (April-July 2020) to examine whether mental health outcomes vary across U.S. states and to what extent specific state-level contexts moderate the associations between household income shocks and depression (n = 582,440) and anxiety (n = 582,796). We find that the prevalence of depression and anxiety differs across states by household income shock status. For individuals, living in a state with supportive social policies - primarily those related to Medicaid, unemployment insurance, and suspended utility shut offs during the pandemic - weakens the association between household income shocks and mental health. Findings suggest that the lack of a strong federal response to the pandemic alongside the devolution of federal power to states over the past 40 years contributes to inequalities in mental health across states.

However, for a given fat mass, there is a large variability in the risk prediction of these cardiometabolic diseases. For example, some lean people unexpectedly have a risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease that is similar to the increased risk that is observed in most people who have obesity. What both of these phenotypes have in common is a very characteristic fat distribution. As a result, much focus has been given on the strong predictive power of increased visceral fat mass. However, an analysis of the causes of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, as well as comparisons to rare diseases such as lipodystrophy and studying genetically determined fat distribution in the general population, suggest that an impaired ability to expand subcutaneous fat in the lower part of the body is also important for predicting the incidence of these cardiometabolic diseases. This Review, first, addresses the identification of distinct fat distribution phenotypes and their risk of cardiometabolic diseases by discussing findings from published studies that have applied precise quantification of different fat depots. Second, this Review provides support for the theory that a lower amount of lower-body fat mass is equally important to a high amount of visceral fat mass as a determinant of cardiometabolic diseases. Third, this Review discusses the genetic and lifestyle-related causes of metabolically healthy and unhealthy fat distribution.

Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) in plasma were measured by ELISA, and intracellular activated caspase-3 fragment in different leukocytes was determined by flow cytometry.

Intracellular cleaved caspase-3 expression was also significantly higher in lymphocytes from SARS patients in acute phase than in convalescent stage. Lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia in SARS patients may be caused, in part, by enhanced vascular sequestration associated with increased sVCAM-1 levels. However, lymphopenia may be due to enhanced cell death.

T. chinensis can parasitize a wide range of species (e.g., Camellia spp., Ficus virens and Osmanthus fragrans), which obviously suppressed host growth by robbing nutrient and water through haustorium, causing considerable tree damage. During field visits to Dongguan (2286'N, 1397'E) and Guangzhou (2319'N, 11331'E), Guangdong Province, in April-July 2021, the typical phytoplasma-suspected symptom manifested as stunting, leaflet, leaf chlorosis and witches'-broom were observed in almost 36% of T. chinensis plants. Leaf samples were collected from six randomly collected plants with symptoms and six symptomless plants (Fig 1). Among them, half of T. chinensis plants parasitized on the host Elaeocarpus sylvestris, the other half on the O. fragrans. No apparent symptoms were observed on both two host plants. Total DNA was extracted from 0.5 g fresh leaf of T. chinensis plants with and without symptoms, as well as two host plants E. sylvestris and O. fragrans, using the CTAB method (Doyle et al., 1990). Nested polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed on DNA extracts of all tested plants with primer pairs of P1/P7 and R16mF2/R16mR1 for 16S rRNA gene (Lee et al., 1993) and rp(v)F1/rpR1 for rp gene (Lee et al., 1998). All amplicons were obtained from symptomatic samples of T. chinensis and host plant E. sylvestris, whereas no such products resulted from DNAs of symptomless plants and O. fragrans. The amplicons were purified and sequenced by Sanger method (Rui Biotech, Guangzhou, China). The amplicon of 16S rRNA and rp genes is 1346 bp and 938 bp, respectively. BLAST comparison of the 16S rRNA (accession no. OL412744) and rp (accession no.

In this study, we included 32 patients treated in March and April 2020, who had more than 3 days of mechanical ventilation, either in the regular ICU with ICU ventilators (Hamilton S1), or in the temporary emergency ICU with anesthetic ventilators (Aisys, GE). The data acquired during regular clinical treatment was collected from the Patient Data Management Systems. Available ventilation parameters (pressures and volumes: PEEP, P(peak) , P(insp) , V(tidal) ), monitored parameters EtCO(2), SpO(2) , derived compliance C, and resistance R were processed and analyzed. A sub-analysis was performed to compare closed-loop ventilation (INTELLiVENT-ASV) to other ventilation modes. The results showed no major differences in the compared parameters, except for P(insp) . PEEP was reduced over time in the with Hamilton treated patients. This is most likely attributed to changing clinical protocol as more clinical experience and literature became available. A comparison of compliance between the 2 ventilators could not be made due to variances in the measurement of compliance. Closed loop ventilation could be used in 79% of the time, resulting in more stable EtCO(2) .

Data were analyzed from November 2020 to October 2021. EXPOSURES: When children were aged 1.5, 4, 8, 10, 12, and 13 years, mothers reported whether a family member experienced hunger because the family had run out of food or money to buy food in the past 12 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify differential exposure to food insecurity from 1.5 to 13 years according to logit functions of age. At 15 years of age, adolescents completed validated questionnaires assessing externalizing, internalizing, substance use, and social adjustment problems. Associations between trajectories of food insecurity and outcomes were assessed using linear regressions. RESULTS: A total of 2032 individuals were included in the analyses of trajectories of food insecurity (1026 [50.5%] male) and 1441 in the analysis of the association with outcomes at 15 years of age (752 [52.2%] female). Two trajectories of food insecurity were identified between 1.5 and 13 years of age: high risk (73 children [3.6%]) and low risk (1959 children [96.4%]). At 5 months, the high-risk and low-risk groups differed in household characteristics including income insufficiency (58 [80.6%] vs 405 [21.0%]), single parenthood (21 [29.2%] vs 135 [6.9%]), and parental history of depression (mothers: 30 [43.5%] vs 411 [21.7%]; fathers: 12 [32.4%] vs 209 [13.5%]). The high-risk trajectory from 1.5 to 13 years of age was associated with cannabis use (, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.12-0.81), peer bullying (, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.08-0.77), and dropout potential (, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.03-0.68) at 15 years of age after adjustment for sex, household income insufficiency, and parental mental health. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, few children experienced a persistent high risk of food insecurity, which was associated with psychosocial problems later in adolescence after adjustment for confounders including low income. Early identification of risk for food insecurity may guide the delivery of tailored interventions to improve functioning in adolescence.","output":"Longitudinal Trajectories of Food Insecurity in Childhood and Their Associations With Mental Health and Functioning in Adolescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of metabolically stable radiolabeled gastrin analogues with suitable pharmacokinetics is a topic of recent research activity.

The agent causing CCHF is a Nairovirus. The virus is typically transmitted to humans through tick bites. CCHF is a life-threatening disease observed endemically over a wide geographical regions in the world, and there is limited information about pulmonary findings in CCHF patients. PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the pulmonary findings belonging to a large CCHF patient cohort and to determine if there is any relationship between laboratory findings and disease severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 165 patients who were diagnosed with CCHF and examined through chest X-ray (CXR) due to respiratory symptoms at their first examination and/or during their hospitalization were included in this study. In addition to demographical and laboratory findings of the patients, chest X-rays were also examined. RESULTS: Of the 165 patients examined, 96 were male (58.2%) and 69 were female (41.8%). The mean age was 51.64  17.95 years (4C81 years). Single and/or multiple pathological findings were detected in 93 patients (56.4%) as a result of chest X-ray during their first examination. On chest X-ray, consolidation in 74 patients (44.8%), pleural effusion in 64 patients (39.8%), ground glass opacity in 49 patients (29.7%), and atelectasis in 30 patients (18.2%) were detected.

An impressive positive trajectory of advances in patient care and research faced sudden global disruptions by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and by an international movement protesting racial, socioeconomic, and health disparities. The disruptions revealed obstacles and fragility within the pediatric neurology research mission. However, renewed commitment offers unique opportunities for the pediatric neurology research community to enhance and prioritize research directions for the coming decades. METHODS: The Research Committee of the Child Neurology Society evaluated the challenges and opportunities facing the pediatric neurology research field, including reviewing published literature, synthesizing publically available data, and conducting a survey of pediatric neurologists. RESULTS: We identified three priority domains for the research mission: funding levels, active guidance, and reducing disparities. Funding levels: to increase funding to match the burden of pediatric neurological disease; to tailor funding mechanisms and strategies to support clinical trial efforts unique to pediatric neurology; and to support investigators across their career trajectory. Active guidance: to optimize infrastructure and strategies, to leverage novel therapeutics, enhance data collection, and improve inclusion of children in clinical trials. Reducing disparities: to reduce health disparities in children with neurological disease, to develop proactive measures to enhance workforce diversity and inclusion, and increase avenues to balance work-life obligations for investigators. CONCLUSIONS: In this uniquely challenging epoch, the pediatric neurology research community has a timely and important mission to re-engage the public and government, advancing the health of children with neurological conditions.","output":"Pediatric Neurology Research in the Twenty-First Century: Status, Challenges, and Future Directions Post-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against herpes simplex virus (HSV)-coded glycoproteins gB, gC, gD and gE were employed in an in vitro model of neuroinvasiveness using sensory neurons from rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells.

The effects of 30 MAbs on viral replication of the encephalitis-derived HSV-1 strain 2762 and its less neuroinvasive variant 2762p11 were assayed in this model. One MAb reactive with gD gave a nine-fold reduction of the virus yields of both strains. One MAb directed against gB gave an enhanced virus yield of strain 2762, but not of the 2762p11 variant. Another gB-reactive MAb decreased the virus yield of strain 2762p11, but not of 2762 after neuritic infection. The findings indicate that an alteration of gB has occurred during the passage of the strain 2762. Mutants of the same strain were derived by infecting hybridomas producing MAb reactive with gB, gC, gD and gE, respectively. The gB hybridoma mutant showed a significantly lower neuroinvasiveness in the DRG model, and was non-virulent after snout infection of mice.

Almost all of the models used to explain BCIS are based on studies related to hip arthroplasty. BCIS induced by bone cement implantation in superficial wounds has not been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 37-year-old man with chronic osteomyelitis of the left tibia (Cierny - Mader type II), who developed BCIS after covering the infected bone surface with antibiotic-loaded bone cement. BCIS presented as acute massive pulmonary exudation and hypoxemia. Early application of awake prone positioning effectively improved oxygenation and lung injury, and prevented the need for a more advanced means of respiratory support. The patient was discharged without any clinical complications on postoperative day 15. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: We assessed the cause of acute respiratory events in this patient using Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale, and BCIS was finally considered. Despite the lack of driving force (e.g., increased intramedullary pressure), the bone cement monomer may be absorbed into circulation through the wound surface due to its penetrability. Subsequent immune-mediated amplification resulted in pulmonary exudation and hypoxemia. As a pathophysiologically change-oriented strategy, effective drainage after awake prone positioning significantly improved clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Bone cement monomer absorbed through the wound should be of concern, and pathophysiological change-oriented management should be emphasized in BCIS.","output":"Bone cement implantation syndrome induced by antibiotic-loaded bone cement covering the infected bone surface: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Vaccine efficacy among previously exposed, but currently uninfected women, i.e., those who have serological evidence of a prior human papillomavirus (HPV) infection without corresponding detectable HPV DNA, remains incompletely defined.

METHODS Searches were conducted on 08/16/20 on MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus and CENTRAL. RCTs of L1-based prophylactic bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccines, reporting serotype-specific clinical efficacy endpoints in the HPV16/18 seropositive, DNA-negative populations were included. Relative risks (RRs) of 6-month PI (6mPI), 12-month PI (12mPI), CIN1+ and CIN2+ were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS A total of 1,727 citations were reviewed. 8 studies, with a total of 9,569 SPDN participants, met all eligibility criteria. The RR of 6mPI (RR=0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.08-0.61; p=0.018), 12mPI (RR=0.20; 95% CI=0.05-0.80; p=0.035), CIN1+ (RR=0.13; 95% CI=0.05-0.30; p=0.003) and CIN2+ (RR=0.15; 95% CI=0.04-0.59; p=0.022) was significantly reduced in the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated group.

The patterns of aetiological pathogens differ by region and country. Special attention must be paid to CAP in Southeast Asia (SEA), a region facing rapid demographic transition. Estimates burden and aetiological patterns of CAP are essential for the clinical and public health management. The purposes of the study are to determine the incidence, aetiological pathogens, clinical pictures and risk factors of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the Vietnamese adult population. METHODS: A prospective surveillance for hospitalised adult CAP was conducted in Khanh Hoa Province, Central Vietnam. All adults aged 15 years with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) admitted to a provincial hospital from September 2009 to August 2010 were enrolled in the study. Patients were classified into CAP and non-pneumonic LRTI (NPLRTI) according to the radiological findings. Bacterial pathogens were identified from sputum samples by the conventional culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; 13 respiratory viruses were identified from nasopharyngeal specimens by PCR. RESULTS: Of all 367 LRTI episodes examined, 174 (47%) were CAP. Older age, the presence of underlying respiratory conditions, and higher index score of smoking were associated with CAP. The one-year estimated incidence of hospitalised adult CAP in our study population was 0.81 per 1,000 person years. The incidence increased considerably with age and was highest among the elderly. The case fatality proportion of hospitalised CAP patients was 9.8%. Among 286 sputum samples tested for bacterial PCR, 79 (28%) were positive for H. influenzae, and 65 (23%) were positive for S. pneumoniae. Among 357 samples tested for viral PCR, 73 (21%) were positive for respiratory viruses; influenza A (n = 32, 9%) was the most common.

The two mRNA vaccines approved to date show efficacy even after only one dose, when non-NAbs and moderate T helper 1 cell responses are detectable, but almost no NAbs. After a single dose, the adenovirus vaccines elicit polyfunctional antibodies that are capable of mediating virus neutralization and of driving other antibody-dependent effector functions, as well as potent T cell responses. These data suggest that protection may require low levels of NAbs and might involve other immune effector mechanisms including non-NAbs, T cells and innate immune mechanisms.

However, these shields produce artifact on computed tomography (CT) that prevents acquisition of high-quality images. To address this limitation, we designed and tested a novel CT-compatible applicator with movable shields, called MDA(3). METHODS AND MATERIALS Fifteen patients with stage IB1-IIB cervical cancer requiring definitive radiation therapy were enrolled in a prospective pilot study to evaluate image quality with the MDA(3). Image quality was assessed by comparing an initial scan obtained with the shields shifted to minimize shield artifact to a second scan obtained with the shields in treatment position. The 2 scans were then compared by a radiation oncologist blinded to the image source. In addition, image quality was assessed by analysis of Hounsfield values in the normal tissues. RESULTS The MDA(3) was successfully employed for intracavitary brachytherapy in 15 patients. CT images obtained with the shields shifted were superior to CT images obtained with the shields in treatment position in every case as evaluated by the radiation oncologist (P < .0001). The presence of the shields in the treatment position significantly increased the mean Hounsfield values within the bladder (P = .002) and rectum (P = .001) due to high-density image artifact.

Core temperature in the preoperative room and PACU was measured by a tympanic membrane thermometer and in the operation room, a nasopharyngeal temperature probe was recorded. The rate of perioperative hypothermia, defined as a reduction in body temperature to < 36 C was recorded as the primary outcome. Intraoperative anesthetic dosage, recovery time, adverse events, thermal comfort and satisfaction score were measured as secondary outcome. RESULTS The incidence of intraoperative and postoperative hypothermia was significantly lower in Group LH and Group H than Group L (18.75 and 15.62% vs 44.44%, P<0.001; 4.69 and 4.69% vs 20.63%, P<.05).

To investigate the link between self-touch and disembodiment in healthy participants, we studied the effect of self-touch versus touch produced by another person (other-touch) on experimentally induced disembodiment. In a mixed reality paradigm, across two experiments, participants could see their own body and surroundings with a controllable visual delay and either stroked their own hand with a paintbrush or were stroked with it by the experimenter. Experiment 1 first assessed the sensitivity to temporal multimodal mismatches and delay-induced changes in the sense of body ownership in three conditions, namely self-touch, other-touch and hidden-self-touch (visually occluding the touching hand). In a second block, we compared phenomenological and physiological (threat response) measures of disembodiment between the self-touch and other-touch conditions. Experiment 2 roughly replicated the first block of Experiment 1 but included a condition in which participants performed the self-touch gesture without touching their hand. Such experiment attempted to control for the potential role of efferent signals. Our results show that increasing visual delay generally enhances the feeling of disembodiment, yet the decrease of body ownership is less pronounced during self-touch. For sensitivity to delay between conditions, however, diverging findings are discussed.

RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS In the included papers, a common understanding of which QIs to use in P-EMS did not exist. Fifteen papers used only a single QI. The most widely used QIs were 'Adherence to medical protocols', 'Provision of advanced interventions', 'Response time' and 'Adverse events'. CONCLUSION The review demonstrated a lack of shared understanding of which QIs to use in P-EMS. Moreover, papers using only one QI dominated the literature, thus increasing the risk of a narrow perspective in quality measurement. Future quality measurement in P-EMS should rely on a set of consensus-based QIs, ensuring a comprehensive approach to quality measurement.","output":"Quality measurement in physician-staffed emergency medical services: a systematic literature review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) offers excellent and lasting oncologic control.

Through content analysis, the article focuses on Twitter behaviours during a pandemic crisis period (March 23 to April 23, 2020). The study that analyses up to 14 (first listed MEPs) Twitter accounts and a total N of 2101 tweets looks at clarifying if the COVID-19 pandemic has promoted or discouraged the growth of a European Public Sphere. The results show that audience involvement depended on certain online conducts of the MEP rather than on his or her constant activity. Those behaviours produced as well that the COVID-19 debate was mostly restricted to the political elite, who neither allow European civil society to take part in the discussion or communicate to the general public with the aim of shaping a European Public Sphere.

The incidence of venous thrombosis is approximately 20% in COVID-19 patients with cancer. It has been suggested that thrombus formation has been suggested to correlate with severe clinical manifestations, mortality, and sequelae. In this review, we primarily elaborate on the pathophysiological mechanisms of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients with cancer, emphasize the role of microparticles (MPs) and phosphatidylserine (PS) in coagulation, and propose an antithrombotic strategy. The coagulation mechanisms of COVID-19 and cancer synergistically amplify the coagulation cascade, and collectively promotes pulmonary microvascular occlusion. During systemic coagulation, the virus activates immune cells to release abundant proinflammatory cytokines, referred to as cytokine storm, resulting in the apoptosis of tumor and blood cells and subsequent MPs release. Additionally, we highlight that tumor cells contribute to MPs and coagulation by apoptosis owing to insufficient blood supply. A positive feedback loop of cytokines storm and MPs storm promotes microvascular coagulation storm, leading to microthrombi formation and inadequate blood perfusion. Microthrombi-damaged endothelial cells (ECs), tumor, and blood cells further aggravate the apoptosis of the cells and facilitate MPs storm. PS, especially on MPs, plays a pivotal role in the blood coagulation process, contributing to clot initiation, amplification, and propagation. Since coagulation is a common pathway of COVID-19 and cancer, and associated with mortality, patients would benefit from antithrombotic therapy. The above results lead us to assert that early stage antithrombotic therapy is optimal. This strategy is likely to maintain blood flow patency contributing to viral clearance, attenuating the formation of cytokines and MPs storm, maintaining oxygen saturation, and avoiding the progress of the disease.","output":"The Central Role of Extracellular Vesicles in the Mechanisms of Thrombosis in COVID-19 Patients With Cancer and Therapeutic Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Suicidal ideation is prevalent in patients with obsessiveCcompulsive disorder (OCD); but, during COVID\\\\19, it may be increased.

The popular high-end cardiac health monitoring systems such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography scan (CT scan), and echocardiography (Echo) are highly expensive and do not support long-term continuous monitoring of patients without disrupting their activities of daily living (ADL). In this paper, the continuous and non-invasive cardiac health monitoring using unobtrusive sensors is explored aiming to provide a feasible and low-cost alternative to foresee possible cardiac anomalies in an early stage. It is learned that cardiac health monitoring based on sole usage of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals may not provide powerful insights as ECG provides shallow information on various cardiac activities in the form of electrical impulses only. Hence, a novel low-cost, non-invasive seismocardiogram (SCG) signal along with ECG signals are jointly investigated for the robust cardiac health monitoring. For this purpose, the in-laboratory data collection model is designed for simultaneous acquisition of ECG and SCG signals followed by mechanisms for the automatic delineation of relevant feature points in acquired ECG and SCG signals. In addition, separate feature points based novel approach is adopted to distinguish between normal and abnormal morphology in each ECG and SCG cardiac cycle. Finally, a combined analysis of ECG and SCG is carried out by designing a Na?ve Bayes conditional probability model. Experiments on Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved licensed ECG/SCG signals acquired from real subjects containing 12,000 cardiac cycles show that the proposed feature point delineation mechanisms and abnormal morphology detection methods consistently perform well and give promising results. In addition, experimental results show that the combined analysis of ECG and SCG signals provide more reliable cardiac health monitoring compared to the standalone use of ECG and SCG.","output":"On the Design of an Efficient Cardiac Health Monitoring System Through Combined Analysis of ECG and SCG Signals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has forced countries to introduce severe restrictive measures to contain its spread. In particular, physical distancing and restriction of movement have important consequences on human behaviour and potentially also on illicit drug use and supply. These changes can be associated with additional risks for users due to reduced supplies, limited prevention and harm reduction activities. Furthermore, there have been limitations in the amount of data about drug use which can be collected due to restrictions. To goal of this study was to obtain information about potential changes in illicit drug use impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Wastewater samples were collected in seven cities in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy at the beginning of lockdowns (March-May 2020). Using previously established and validated methods, levels of amphetamine (AMP), methamphetamine (METH), MDMA, benzoylecgonine (BE, the main metabolite of cocaine) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH, main metabolite of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) were measured and compared with findings from previous years. Important differences in levels of consumed drugs were observed across the considered countries. Whilst for some substances and locations, marked decreases in consumption could be observed (e.g., 50% decrease in MDMA levels compared to previous years). In some cases, similar or even higher levels compared to previous years could be found. Changes in weekly patterns were also observed, however these were not clearly defined for all locations and/or substances. Findings confirm that the current situation is highly heterogeneous and that it remains very difficult to explain and/or predict the effect that the present pandemic has on illicit drug use and availability. However, given the current difficulty in obtaining data due to restrictions, wastewater analysis can provide relevant information about the situation at the local level, which would be hard to obtain otherwise.","output":"Changes in drug use in European cities during early COVID-19 lockdowns - A snapshot from wastewater analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The social restrictions during the COVID-19 crisis led to many therapists providing therapy remotely, despite some therapists concerns regarding its efficacy, technical challenges and their ability to build a strong therapeutic relationship online.

Aspects of the therapeutic relationship (e.g. working alliance, real relationship), experienced anxiety and professional self-doubt, attitudes towards and intention of video therapy use in the future were assessed. Although therapists reported some anxiety and self-doubt, most felt that online sessions had a sufficient working alliance and a strong real relationship. Therapists with more online therapy experience, lower levels of self-doubt and anxiety, and those who experienced a strong online real relationship during the pandemic, or thought their patients viewed it positively, tended to be more accepting of video therapy. Therapists were largely undecided as to whether they planned to use video therapy in the future; however, those with prior video therapy experience were more likely to endorse future utilization. Training is needed, especially for therapists with less online therapy experience, in order to foster a better experience and to support effective use of online therapy in the future.","output":"Grappling with our therapeutic relationship and professional self-doubt during COVID-19: will we use video therapy again?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Broadband connectivity is a key metric in today's economy.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of combined use of oral Azithromycin (AZT) plus Echinacea compared to exclusive use of AZT in children with recurrent tonsillitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective comparative study including three groups of children with recurrent tonsillitis. Group 1: (100 patients) had no prophylactic treatment. Group 2 (100 patients) received [60 mg/kg] prophylactic dose of AZT divided as (10 mg/kg/day) over 6 consecutive days every month for 6 consecutive months. Group 3 (100 patients) received AZT as in group 2 plus commercially available Echinacea in a dose of 5 ml oral suspension; 3 times daily for 10 consecutive days every month for 6 consecutive months. Number of tonsillitis attacks and severity of tonsillitis symptoms were assessed and compared in different groups. RESULTS: Group 2 and group 3 had significant less number of tonsillitis attacks and severity of assessed symptoms during 6 months of prophylactic treatment with significant better results in group 3 (i.e. AZT plus Echinacea) compared to group 2 (I.e. AZT alone). However; there was no significant difference in patients with any prophylaxis.

Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop a questionnaire to investigate the importance attributed to smell, taste and flavour and socio-cultural differences among individuals. METHODS: Cross-cultural adaptation of the questionnaire was executed by two professional translators and one bilingual investigator and pre-tested on a pilot group of 25 subjects with normal smell and taste abilities. The final version of the questionnaire was sent by e-mail to 850 healthy subjects. The Google form consisted of three parts: The importance of olfaction developed by Croy et al. in 2010, The importance of taste and flavour developed by our team and a section to collect demographic data. The questions were classified into association, application, consequence and aggravation. Statistical differences were assessed using t-test with p  0.05. Correlations were calculated using Spearmans test. Internal consistency was assessed using the Cronbachs Alpha, while test-retest reliability was analysed by calculating the Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC2k). RESULTS: The questionnaire received a non-response rate of 10.7%. Calculation of Cronbachs alpha showed good internal reliability (a = 0.87). Test-retest evaluation was satisfactory for all subscales, with an overall ICC2k = 0.84 (CI 0.79-0.89). Statistical analysis showed that smell, taste and flavour appeared to be more important for women when compared to men (p < 0.001). No statistical differences were seen between individuals with various educational background (p > 0.05), and the importance of smell (r = 0.16; p < 0.01), taste and flavour (r = 0.08; p < 0.05) did not decline with age. CONCLUSIONS: The development of this original test provides an overview into the importance of smell, taste and flavour among individuals.

This study investigated growth patterns and evaluated factors associated with suboptimal growth in adolescents with perinatally-acquired HIV infection. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included HIV-infected adolescents, aged 13 to 18 years, with at least 5 years of ART follow-up at a large HIV clinic in the Gauteng Province, South Africa. Weight-for-age Z-scores (WAZ), height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) and body mass index (BMI)-for-age Z-scores were calculated using World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards. Growth velocity graphs were generated utilising the mean height change calculated at 6-monthly intervals, using all available data after ART initiation, to calculate the annual change. Other collected data included WHO HIV disease staging, CD4%, HIV viral loads (VLs), ART regimens and tuberculosis co-infection. RESULTS: Included were 288 children with a median age of 6.5 years (IQR 4.2;8.6 years) at ART initiation, and 51.7% were male. At baseline the majority of children had severe disease (92% WHO stages 3&4) and were started on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens (79.2%). The median CD4% was 13.5% (IQR 7.9;18.9) and median HIV viral load log 5.0 (IQR 4.4;5.5). Baseline stunting (HAZ <-2) was prevalent (55.9%), with a median HAZ of -2.2 (IQR -3.1;-1.3). The median WAZ was -1.5 (IQR -2.5;-0.8), with 29.2% being underweight-for-age (WAZ <-2). The peak height velocity (PHV) in adolescents with baseline stage 3 disease was higher than for those with stage 4 disease. Being older at ART start (p<0.001) and baseline stunting (p<0.001) were associated with poorer growth, resulting in a lower HAZ at study exit, with boys more significantly affected than girls (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal growth in adolescents with perinatally-acquired HIV infection is a significant health concern, especially in children who started ART later in terms of age and who had baseline stunting and is more pronounced in boys than in girls.","output":"Growth and the pubertal growth spurt in South African adolescents living with perinatally-acquired HIV infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work aims to present an advanced prototype of cost-effective wearable air quality monitoring equipment suitable for different use cases due to its small size, easy handling, and smartphone compatibility.

Lithium chloride, a widely prescribed drug for bipolar mood disorder, has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties. Using an intragastric infection model, the effects of LiCl on K. pneumoniae infections were examined. Providing mice with drinking water containing LiCl immediately after infection protected them from K. pneumoniae-induced death and liver injuries, such as necrosis of liver tissues, as well as increasing blood levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, in a dose-dependent manner. LiCl administered as late as 24 h postinfection still provided protection. Monitoring of the LiCl concentrations in the sera of K. pneumoniae-infected mice showed that approximately 0.33 mM LiCl was the most effective dose for protecting mice against infections, which is lower than the clinically toxic dose of LiCl. Surveys of bacterial counts and cytokine expression levels in LiCl-treated mice revealed that both were effectively inhibited in blood and liver tissues. Using in vitro assays, we found that LiCl (5 M to 1 mM) did not directly interfere with the growth of K. pneumoniae but made K. pneumoniae cells lose the mucoid phenotype and become more susceptible to macrophage killing. Furthermore, low doses of LiCl also partially enhanced the bactericidal activity of macrophages.

METHODS This study aimed to assess patients who underwent segmentectomy or wedge resection with curative intent for clinically node-negative non-small cell lung cancer presenting as a solid predominant tumour (consolidation tumour ratio >50%) with a whole size 3 cm and [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose accumulation weaker than that of the mediastinum tissue (Deauville score, 1 or 2) on positron emission tomography/computed tomography. The cumulative incidence of recurrence (CIR) was compared using the Gray method, and the predictive factor of CIR was analysed using the Fine and Gray method. RESULTS Of 140 patients included in this study, 93 (66.4%) underwent segmentectomy and 47 (33.6%) underwent wedge resection. No significant difference in the clinical stage was found between the 2 groups. The CIR was higher with wedge resection than with segmentectomy (P = 0.004). Recurrence after wedge resection was noted in 4 (8.5%) patients, 2 of whom had a recurrent site containing lung parenchyma of the preserved lobe and hilum lymph node, which would have been resected if segmentectomy had been performed. In the multivariable analysis for CIR using inverse probability of treatment weighting and the procedure, wedge resection was a significantly worse predictive factor (hazard ratio, 12.280; P = 0.025).

We also compare the impact of COVID-19 to past influenza waves and analyze the vaccination effect on excess mortality. Methods: We forecast the baseline mortality from official data on deaths in Germany. Distributing a part of excess mortality into the near future, we lower the baseline simulating the pre-dying effect. From there, we compare the excess mortality to official COVID-19 deaths. From the observed mortality deficit, we estimate the percentage of infected individuals and then estimate the age-dependent IFRs. Results: In the first wave, we find an overall excess mortality of ca. 8 000. For the second wave, the overall excess mortality adds up to ca. 56 000. We find, that the pre-dying effect explains the difference between the official COVID-19 deaths and excess mortality in the second half of the waves to a high degree. Attributing the whole excess mortality to COVID-19, we find that the IFRs are significantly higher in the second wave. In the third wave, we find an excess mortality in mid-age bands which cannot be explained by the official COVID-19 deaths. For the senior band 80+, we find results in favor of a strong and positive vaccination effect for the third COVID-19 wave. Conclusions: We conclude that in the first and second COVID-19 waves, the COVID-19 deaths explain almost all excess mortality when the pre-dying effect is taken into account. In the third wave in 2021, the excess mortality is not very pronounced for the 80+ age band, probably due to vaccination. The partially unvaccinated 40-80 age group experiences a pronounced excess mortality in the third wave while there are too few official COVID-19 deaths to explain the excess. The no-vaccination scenario for the 80+ age band results in a similarly high excess mortality as for the more younger age bands, suggesting a very positive vaccination effect on reduction of COVID-19 deaths.","output":"Excess mortality analysis for Germany for all three COVID-19 waves in 2020 - 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with an until then unknown, infectious agent posed unprecedented challenges to health care systems and unmasked their vulnerability and limitations worldwide. Patients with long-term immunomodulatory/suppressive therapies, as well as their physicians, were and are concerned about balancing the risk of infection and disease-modifying effects. Over the last few months, the knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 has been growing tremendously, as well as the first experiences of infections in MS patients. This review summarizes the currently still limited knowledge about SARS-Cov-2 immunology and the commonly agreed mode of action of approved drugs in immune-mediated diseases of the central nervous system (MS and NMOSD). Specifically, we discuss whether immunosuppressive/-modulatory drugs may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and, on the other hand, may decrease the severity of a COVID-19 disease course. At present, it can be recommended in general that none of those therapies with a definite indication needs to be stopped per se. A possibly increased risk of infection for most medications is accompanied by the possibility to reduce the severity of COVID-19.

SETTING Accredited public health departments in the United States. PARTICIPANTS Leadership from 214 unique state, local, Tribal, and Army installation health departments that had been accredited for 1 year by PHAB. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Improved utilization of resources, increased competitiveness for funding opportunities, and new funding resulting from accreditation. RESULTS One year following accreditation, 57% of all responding health departments reported improved utilization of resources whereas less than half reported improved competitiveness for funding (39%) and new funding (23%) as a result of accreditation. Health departments reporting new funding as a result of accreditation, compared with those that did not report new funding, were also more likely to report other outcomes from accreditation, including improved staff competencies, increased health department capacity to address health priorities and provide high-quality programs and services, increased use of evidence-based practices, new opportunities for external partnerships and collaboration, improved understanding of the health department's role among governing entities and policy makers, and improved credibility. Accredited local health departments (LHDs) with annual budgets less than $10 million reported new funding more often than LHDs with larger annual budgets.

Medical conditions, such as coronary heart disease, mental health issues, and substance use disorder, may be identified later, leading to increases in patient morbidity and mortality. METHODS: The National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) data were used to assess 911 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) activations during 2018-2020. For specific activation types, the percentage of total activations was calculated per week and joinpoint analysis was used to identify changes over time. RESULTS: Since March 2020, the number of 911 emergency medical services (EMS) activations has decreased, while the percentages of on-scene death, cardiac arrest, and opioid use/overdose EMS activations were higher than pre-pandemic levels. During the early pandemic period, percentages of total EMS activations increased for on-scene death (from 1.3% to 2.4% during weeks 11-15), cardiac arrest (from 1.3% to 2.2% during weeks 11-15), and opioid use/overdose (from 0.6% to 1.1% during weeks 8-18); the percentages then declined, but remained above pre-pandemic levels through calendar week 52. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has indirect consequences, such as relative increases in EMS activations for cardiac events and opioid use/overdose, possibly linked to disruptions is healthcare access and health-seeking behaviors.

Recent media reports have scrutinized the safety and quality of military healthcare, including surgical complications, infection rates, clinician competence, and a reluctance of leaders to investigate operational processes. Military leaders have aggressively committed to a continuous cycle of process improvement and a culture of safety with the goal to transform the Military Health System into a high-reliability organization. The cornerstone of patient safety is effective clinician communication. Military surgical teams are particularly susceptible to communication error because of potential barriers created by military rank, clinical specialty, and military culture. With an operations tempo requiring the military to continually deploy small, agile surgical teams, effective interpersonal communication among these team members is vital to providing life-saving care on the battlefield. METHODS: The purpose of our exploratory, prospective, cross-sectional study was to examine the association between social distance and interpersonal communication in a military surgical setting. Using social network analysis to map the relationships and structure of interpersonal relations, we developed six networks (interaction frequency, close working relationship, socialization, advice-seeking, advice-giving, and speaking-up/voice) and two models that represented communication effectiveness ratings for each participant. We used the geodesic or network distance as a predictor of team member network position and assessed the relationship of distance to pairwise communication effectiveness with permutation-based quadratic assignment procedures. We hypothesized that the shorter the network geodesic distance between two individuals, the smaller the difference between their communication effectiveness. RESULTS: We administered a network survey to 50 surgical teams comprised of 45 multidisciplinary clinicians with 522 dyadic relationships. There were significant and positive correlations between differences in communication effectiveness and geodesic distances across all five networks for both general (r = 0.819-0.894, P < 0.001 for all correlations) and task-specific (r = 0.729-0.834, P < 0.001 for all correlations) communication. This suggests that a closer network ties between individuals is associated with smaller differences in communication effectiveness. In the quadratic assignment procedures regression model, geodesic distance predicted task-specific communication (? = 0.056-0.163, P < 0.001 for all networks). Interaction frequency, socialization, and advice-giving had the largest effect on task-specific communication difference. We did not uncover authority gradients that affect speaking-up patterns among surgical clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: The findings have important implications for safety and quality. Stronger connections in the interaction frequency, close working relationship, socialization, and advice networks were associated with smaller differences in communication effectiveness. The ability of team members to communicate clinical information effectively is essential to building a culture of safety and is vital to progress towards high-reliability. The military faces distinct communication challenges because of policies to rotate personnel, the presence of a clear rank structure, and antifraternization regulations. Despite these challenges, overall communication effectiveness in military teams will likely improve by maintaining team consistency, fostering team cohesion, and allowing for frequent interaction both inside and outside of the work environment.","output":"Military Surgical Team Communication: Implications for Safety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic is causing a health crisis One of the effective methods against the virus is wearing a face mask This paper introduces face mask detection that can be used by the authorities to make mitigation, evaluation, prevention, and action planning against COVID-19 The face mask recognition in this study is developed with a machine learning algorithm through the image classification method: MobileNetV2 The steps for building the model are collecting the data, pre-processing, split the data, testing the model, and implement the model The built model can detect people who are wearing a face mask and not wearing it at an accuracy of 96,85 percent After the model implemented in 25 cities from various source of image, the percentage of people wearing face mask in the cities has a strong correlation to the vigilance index of COVID-19 which is 0,62 ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Face Mask Detection Using MobileNetV2 in the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, expressions and identities of girls, women, boys, men and gender diverse people.

Although artificial neural network (ANN) prediction models have been reported and are superior to traditional models, the ANN prediction model for PTE is lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aim to train and validate an ANN model to anticipate the risks of PTE. METHODS: The training cohort was TBI patients registered at West China Hospital. We used a 5-fold cross-validation approach to train and test the ANN model to avoid overfitting; 21 independent variables were used as input neurons in the ANN models, using a back-propagation algorithm to minimize the loss function. Finally, we obtained sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each ANN model from the 5 rounds of cross-validation and compared the accuracy with a nomogram prediction model built in our previous work based on the same population. In addition, we evaluated the performance of the model using patients registered at Chengdu Shang Jin Nan Fu Hospital (testing cohort 1) and Sichuan Provincial Peoples Hospital (testing cohort 2) between January 1, 2013, and March 1, 2015. RESULTS: For the training cohort, we enrolled 1301 TBI patients from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2017. The prevalence of PTE was 12.8% (166/1301, 95% CI 10.9%-14.6%). Of the TBI patients registered in testing cohort 1, PTE prevalence was 10.5% (44/421, 95% CI 7.5%-13.4%). Of the TBI patients registered in testing cohort 2, PTE prevalence was 6.1% (25/413, 95% CI 3.7%-8.4%). The results of the ANN model show that, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the training cohort was 0.907 (95% CI 0.889-0.924), testing cohort 1 was 0.867 (95% CI 0.842-0.893), and testing cohort 2 was 0.859 (95% CI 0.826-0.890). Second, the average accuracy of the training cohort was 0.557 (95% CI 0.510-0.620), with 0.470 (95% CI 0.414-0.526) in testing cohort 1 and 0.344 (95% CI 0.287-0.401) in testing cohort 2. In addition, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values and negative predictors in the training cohort (testing cohort 1 and testing cohort 2) were 0.80 (0.83 and 0.80), 0.86 (0.80 and 0.84), 91% (85% and 78%), and 86% (80% and 83%), respectively. When calibrating this ANN model, Brier scored 0.121 in testing cohort 1 and 0.127 in testing cohort 2. Compared with the nomogram model, the ANN prediction model had a higher accuracy (P=.01).

One factor that is being explored throughout patient care is the idea of diet and the role it has on patient outcomes. But the effects of diet following neurotrauma need to be carefully explored in animal models to ensure that they have beneficial effects. The ketogenic diet provides sufficient daily caloric requirements while being potentially neuroprotective and analgesic. In this study, animals were fed a high fat, low carbohydrate diet that led to a high concentration of blood ketone levels that was sustained for as long as the animals were on the diet. Mice fed a ketogenic diet had significantly lower levels of tyrosine and tryptophan but the levels of other monoamines within the spinal cord remained similar to control mice. Mice were fed a standard or ketogenic diet for 7 days before, and 28 days following the injury. Our results show that mice hemisected over the T10-11 vertebrae showed no beneficial effects of being on a ketogenic diet over a 28 day recovery period. Similarly, ligation of the common peroneal and tibial nerve showed no differences between mice fed normal or ketogenic diets. Tests included von Frey, open field, and ladder-rung crossing. We add to existing literature showing protective effects of the ketogenic diet in forelimb injuries by focusing on neurotrauma in the hindlimbs.

The UK Intensive Care Society has published recommendations for prone positioning in awake patients with COVID-19 but it remains unknown whether it is beneficial in those patients prior to requiring respiratory support, and whether there is applicability for patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Published studies are limited by their retrospective nature, inclusion of minimal time-points for physiological assessment and lack of information on tolerability. This prospective study aimed to assess the tolerability and physiological effects of prone positioning in non-ventilated patients with or without COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This interventional case-control study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04589936) is currently being conducted at a tertiary hospital, with the aim of recruiting 56 patients with pneumonia. Inclusion criteria include those able to provide informed consent and rotate independently through a cycle of supine, lateral (for a duration of 15 minutes) and prone position (for as long as tolerable). The tolerability of each position was qualitatively assessed using a questionnaire and visual analogue scores (VAS). Continuous assessment of oxygenation, respiratory rate, end tidal carbon dioxide and pulse rate will be performed throughout the cycle of position changes. Thirtytwo of these patients will be proned for a longer duration, using a non-invasive positional sensor which will correlate body positions with the tolerability and physiological effects. Statistical analysis of ordinal VAS data was performed using a non-parametric Freidman test and demographic data presented as median (range). Results: The progress of participant recruitment is summarized in figure 1. To date, 73 patients with pneumonia were identified, 22 of whom were approached, of which eleven patients (eight COVID-19 and three non-COVID-19 pneumonia) underwent proning (6 female, 5 male;age, 67 [25-88] years;body mass index, 27.3 [22.8-32.0] kg/m2). There were no significant differences between different positions in the VAS for breathlessness (p=0.41), although the VAS for discomfort worsened between the supine (median score 2) and prone (score 5) position with a trend towards significance (p=0.100). Conclusion: Whilst awake prone positioning is recommended in national guidance, our prospective study to date highlights the challenge in recruiting patients who are suitable and are successfully able to self-prone. Our qualitative data suggests some patients experience discomfort in the prone position. Further detailed characterisation of physiological variables with ongoing recruitment will help inform the feasibility of performing prone positioning in hospitalised patients with pneumonia.","output":"Prone positioning to improve oxygenation in COVID-19 patients outside critical care (prone-COVID study)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maternal opioid use disorder increased > 4-fold from 1999 to 2014 and is associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes. Women with opioid use disorder are at 2 to 3 times greater risk for unintended pregnancy than the general population and may face additional barriers to accessing and effectively using contraception compared to women without opioid use disorder, particularly highly effective long-acting reversible contraception. Additionally, women with opioid use disorder tend to use less effective forms of contraception such as condoms alone. Barriers to contraceptive access include patient misconceptions or knowledge gaps regarding reproductive health and family planning, cost, intimate partner violence, fear of criminalization, difficulty accessing care, comorbid health conditions, and health care provider misconceptions or practice limitations. Strategies that may assist women with opioid use disorder in achieving their family planning goals include colocation of family planning services within opioid treatment facilities, optimization of patient care services to minimize the need for costly and/or time consuming follow-up, increasing provider education and awareness of best practices in family planning and opioid use disorder treatment, and providing patient-centered family planning education and counseling.

In both cases, no knowledge of the post-change distribution is assumed other than that it has bounded support. For the case where the pre-change distribution is known, we derive a test that asymptotically minimizes the worst-case detection delay over all post-change distributions, as the false alarm rate goes to zero.

Recent studies showed the presence of persistent exertional dyspnea or fatigue at one- to three-months follow-up after COVID-19(1,2). However, little is known regarding the mechanisms behind the possible cardiac-related symptoms post COVID-19 at mid- and long- term follow-up. Purpose: We investigated the presence of persistent dyspnea one year after the acute phase of COVID-19 in patients without previous cardiovascular or pulmonary disease. Secondly, we analyzed the potential subclinical cardiac dysfunction in these patients, assessed by echocardiography. Methods: 310 COVID-19 patients were prospectively included between March and April 2020. 143 patients continued the follow-up at 6 months and one year.Patients with a previous history of cardiovascular or respiratory disease were excluded from the analysis.The follow-up consisted in clinical evaluation, and spirometry at 6 and 12 months, chest computed tomography and comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) including speckle tracking and myocardial work analysis at one-year follow-up. Results: 66 patients (mean age 49.64  10.66 years, 37 (67.3%) males)were included in the final analysis.In these patients, TTE parameters were in the normal range, with a mean left ventricle ejection fraction of 56.98  4.64%, mean global longitudinal strain (GLS) of -20.90  2.37%, global constructive work (GCW) of 2381.45 463.68mmHg% and global work index (GWI) of 2132.49 419.22.Type 1 diastolic dysfunction was observed in 11(16.7%) patients.One (1.5%) patient had type 2 diastolic dysfunction. A normal respiratory pattern was reported in 31(47%) patients at 6 months spirometry evaluation, while 19(28.8%) patients presented pulmonary restriction patterns.23 (34.8%) patients reported exertional dyspnea at one year follow-up. No significant differences regarding clinical, laboratory or imaging findings at baseline were found between patients with and without dyspnea. TTE showed that GLS, GCW and GWI were different between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (-19.97  2.14 vs. -20.90  2.37, p = 0.039;2183.14  2483.14  422.42, p = 0.024;1960.06  396.21 vs 2221.17  407.99, p = 0.030).(Figure 1) Multivariable analysis showed that GCW, GWI and normal respiratory pattern at 6 months were inversely associated with persistent dyspnea (p = 0.038, OR 0.998, 95% CI 0.996-1.000;p = 0.042, OR 0.998, 95% CI 0.996-1.000;p = 0.020, OR 0.195, 95% CI 0.049-0.773, respectively).(Figure.2) Conclusion: Persistent exertional dyspnea one year after COVID-19 infection was present in more than a third of apparently healthy patients. GCW and GWI were independently associated with symptoms, suggesting a decrease in myocardial performance in this population.

APPROACH Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), charge storage capacity (CSC), charge injection limit (CIL), and voltage transient (VT) impedance were measured bench-top before and after implant and in vivo. Coated Pt-Ir and uncoated Pt electrode arrays were implanted into cochlea of normal hearing rats and stimulated for ~4 hours/day, 5 days/week for 5 weeks. Neural function was monitored using electrically-evoked auditory brainstem responses. After explant, the electrode surfaces were assessed, and cochleae examined histologically. MAIN RESULTS When measured on bench-top before and after stimulation, Pt-Ir coated electrodes had significantly lower VT impedance (p < 0.001) and significantly higher CSC (p < 0.001) and CIL (p < 0.001) compared to uncoated Pt electrodes. In vivo, the CSC and CIL of Pt-Ir were significantly higher than Pt throughout the implantation period (p = 0.047 and p < 0.001, respectively); however, the VT impedance (p = 0.3) was not. There was no difference in foreign body response between material cohorts, although cochleae implanted with coated electrodes contained small deposits of Pt-Ir. There was no evidence of increased neural loss or loss of neural function in either group. Surface examination revealed no Pt corrosion on any electrodes. SIGNIFICANCE Electrodeposited Pt-Ir electrodes demonstrated significant improvements in electrochemical performance on the bench-top and in vivo compared to uncoated Pt. Neural function and tissue response to Pt-Ir electrodes were not different from uncoated Pt, despite small deposits of Pt-Ir in the tissue capsule.

Demolition can cause lead dust spread, and childhood lead exposure can have negative effects on cognition, growth, and development. Previous studies show an association between exposure to multiple demolitions and elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) in children, but St Louis City does not monitor the effects of demolitions on children's blood lead levels. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to measure the association between exposure to demolitions and EBLLs in children younger than 6 years in St Louis City from 2017 to 2020. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS We analyzed blood lead testing data for children 0 to 72 months of age (n = 22 192) and proximity to demolitions. Exposure was the presence of demolitions within 400 ft of a child's address in the 33 days before their first lead test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE We used logistic regression to test the association between proximity to demolition and EBLLs (5 g/dL). RESULTS The percentage of children living in proximity to 1 or more demolitions was slightly higher among those with EBLLs (n = 21; 1.3%) than among those without EBLLs (n = 250; 1.2%). However, after adjusting for age, sex, year home was built, season, neighborhood socioeconomic percentile, and neighborhood racial composition, the odds of EBLLs were not significantly different for children exposed to 1 or more demolitions (OR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.5-1.25) compared with exposed to zero demolitions. CONCLUSIONS Although this study found no association between exposure to demolitions and EBLLs, results should be interpreted with caution, given numerous limitations. Given the consequences of childhood lead exposure, it is recommended that St Louis City conduct a similar analysis on demolitions conducted after 2020 using systematically collected demolition dates. Targeted testing or soil and air monitoring could also be informative.","output":"An Observational Study of the Association Between Exposure to Vacant Building Demolitions and Elevated Blood Lead Levels in Children Under Six in St Louis City."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The ideal SARs-CoV-2 testing method would be accurate and also be patient-performed to reduce exposure to healthcare workers. The aim of this study was to compare patient-performed testing based on a morning saliva sample with the current standard testing method, healthcare worker-collected sampling via a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). METHODS: This was a prospective single center study which recruited 217 asymptomatic adult male participants in a COVID-19 quarantine center who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 8-10 days prior isolation. Paired NPS and saliva specimens were collected and processed within 5 hours of sample collection. Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting Envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes was performed and the results were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 160 of the 217 (74%) participants tested positive for Covid-19 based on saliva, NPS, or both testing methods. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher in saliva compared to NPS testing (93.1%, 149/160 vs 52.5%, 84/160, p<0.001). The concordance between the two tests was 45.6% (virus was detected in both saliva and NPS in 73/160), while 47.5% were discordant (87/160 tested positive for one while negative for the other). The Ct values for E and RdRp genes were significantly lower in saliva specimens compared to NP swab specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that saliva is a better alternative specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Taking into consideration, the simplicity of specimen collection, shortage of PPE and the transmissibility of the virus, saliva could enable self-collection for an accurate SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing.","output":"Comparing nasopharyngeal swab and early morning saliva for the identification of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis has caused severe psychological distress Governments have been trying to fight the outbreak, inter alia, by enacting various restrictions to maintain social distancing However, compliance with restrictions depends upon different interpersonal variables The present study focused on the relationship between attachment patterns, fear of COVID-19, and adherence to COVID-19 guidelines Participants completed the ECR measure to assess their adult attachment style, in addition to a COVID-19 fear and guidelines compliance questionnaire We suggest that anxious attachment patterns may be related to heightened fear of COVID-19 Although fear and guideline adherence were positively correlated, secure attachment patterns were correlated to higher adherence than insecure attachment patterns","output":"Policymakers as safe havens: The relationship between adult attachment style, COVID-19 fear, and regulation compliance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lineage B.1.617+, also known as G/452R.V3, is a recently described SARS-CoV-2 variant under investigation (VUI) firstly identified in October 2020 in India.

Pulmonary embolism as well as microembolisation of vital organs may be direct causes of death in COVID-19 positive individuals. If patients at high risk of developing thrombosis may be identified early, more effective prophylactic treatment could be applied. Objectives To test whether Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) indicates hypercoagulopathy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and whether patients with severe disease have a more pronounced hypercoagulopathy compared with less severely ill patients. Methods COVID-19 positive patients over 18 years admitted to St Gorans Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden were eligible for inclusion. Patients were divided into two groups depending on care level: 1) regular wards or 2) wards with specialized ventilation support. ROTEM was taken as soon after admission to hospital as possible (median day 1 after hospitalization). The data were compared with healthy controls. Results The ROTEM variables Maximum Clot Firmness (EXTEM-MCF and FIBTEM-MCF) were significantly higher in both groups of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (p<0.001) and higher in severely ill patients compared with patients at regular wards (p<0.05).

Although individuals may self-identify with a given race and ethnic group, as multidimensional beings exposed to differential life influencing factors that contribute to disease risk, additional social determinants of health (SDOH) should be explored to understand the relationship of race or ethnicity to health. Potential health effects of structural racism, defined as the structures, policies, practices, and norms resulting in differential access to goods, services, and opportunities of society by race, have been largely ignored in medical research. The Womens Health Initiative (WHI) was expected to enroll a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of older women at 40 U.S. clinical centers between 1993 and 1998; yet, key information on the racial and ethnic make-up of the WHI cohort of 161,808 women was limited until a 2020C2021 Task Force was charged by the WHI Steering Committee to better characterize the WHI cohort and develop recommendations for WHI investigators who want to include race and/or ethnicity in papers and presentations. As the lessons learned are of relevance to most cohorts, the essence of the WHI Race and Ethnicity Language and Data Interpretation Guide is presented in this paper. Recommendations from the WHI Race and Ethnicity Language and Data Interpretation Guide include: Studies should be designed to include all populations and researchers should actively, purposefully and with cultural-relevance, commit to recruiting a diverse sample; Researchers should collect robust data on race, ethnicity and SDOH variables that may intersect with participant identities, such as immigration status, country of origin, acculturation, current residence and neighborhood, religion; Authors should use appropriate terminology, based on a participants self-identified race and ethnicity, and provide clear rationale, including a conceptual framework, for including race and ethnicity in the analytic plan; Researchers should employ appropriate analytical methods, including mixed-methods, to study the relationship of these sociocultural variables to health; Authors should address how representative study participants are of the population to which results might apply, such as by age, race and ethnicity.

However, little evidence exists whether having a history of cancer plays a significant role in these observations. Patients with hematologic malignancy (HM) might have worse prognosis among all cancer patients but the reason remains unclear. Our objective is to evaluate outcomes and severity of COVID-19 in patients with Hematological Malignancy (HM) versus Solid-tumors (ST) in different clinical settings and also compare these outcomes within the group of patients with hematological malignancies. Methods: This retrospective study examines risk factors and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with a history of cancer and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between March 1 st, 2020, and December 31 st, 2020, at Rush University Medical Center, one of the largest COVID-19 tertiary care hospitals in Chicago. Baseline characteristics, malignancy type and types of cancer treatment within the last 30 days were recorded. Measures of COVID-19 severity included hospital admission versus outpatient care, use of oxygen, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation. The primary outcome was death. Statistical analysis was conducted using optimal discriminant analysis, a non-parametric exact machine-learning algorithm which identifies the relationship between independent and dependent variables that maximizes model predictive accuracy adjusted to remove the effect of chance. Analysis was performed separately for each attribute using the entire sample (training analysis), then one-sample jackknife analysis was conducted to estimate cross-generalizability of findings using the model to classify an independent random sample. Results: 378 total patients with a history of cancer tested positive for COVID-19 within the time frame of the study. Of these, 294 (78%) patients had ST malignancy and 84 (22%) patients had HM. Characteristics and outcomes are summarized in Table 1. ST patients were marginally older than HM patients (p<0.025). A significantly greater proportion of HM patients were male (p<0.0023). HM and ST patients did not differ with respect to percentage receiving active cancer treatment (p<0.81). Compared to ST patients, more HM patients had received corticosteroids in the 30 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis (p<0.017), had higher rates of hospitalization (p<0.0013) and ICU requirement (p<0.0001) with a significantly longer length of ICU stay (p<0.0036). Compared to ST patients, HM patients also required oxygen (p<0.002) and mechanical ventilation (p<0.0005) more often and had a 3.88-fold statistically higher death rate (OR 3.88 [95% CI 1.62-9.29] p<0.003). Patients with HM are categorized by disease subtype and summarized in Table 2. The case fatality rate from COVID-19 was 33.3% for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms/myelodysplastic syndromes (MPN/MDS), 21.4% for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 13.6% for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 10.5% for patients with plasma cell neoplasms, and 4.5% for patients with acute leukemia. When looking at outcomes, CLL had the highest percentage of patients requiring hospital admission, oxygen, and ICU admission, and MPN/MDS had the highest percentage of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: Patients with hematologic malignancies had more severe COVID-19 illness and hospitalization rates and a 3.88-fold higher rate of death than patients with solid tumors. The comparable proportion of patients on anti-cancer therapy despite differences in survival suggests that being on anti-cancer therapy is less important than the underlying diagnosis of HM versus ST as a determinant of poor outcomes. Clinicians should closely monitor and initiate early COVID-19 treatments for all patients with HM and COVID-19. Because HM are highly heterogenous group of cancers, it is important to look at subtypes in greater detail. Numerous patient-level, disease-specific, and therapy-related factors may impact outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with HM, and we are currently analyzing additional data to better understand the factors which make this disease group more susceptible to severe infection.

Themes included (1) an emphasis on the nuance of connection as an aging LGBT+ adult; (2) a rich discussion of experiences with and expectations for quality of services as this group ages; (3) the realities of planning for future living arrangements as a member of this population; and (4) a clearer understanding of the two sides of advocacy for this group, as a personal responsibility and a call for allyship. Based on insights shared by participants, implications are discussed for improved and more visible engagement of this community within our heath and humans service sectors. We also affirm the need for greater attention from researchers and policy makers in respect to the whole health needs of this group. As a society and as professionals, we need to respond to these needs in better support of equity in the aging process for LGBT+ older adults.","output":"As we age: listening to the voice of LGBTQ older adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, two cases of attempted murder were opened against people who had tested positive for COVID-19 and had not remained in quarantine.

The causal relationships between aging and an enhanced susceptibility of suffering from a broad spectrum of diseases need to be better understood. However, one specific shared feature seems to be of capital relevance for most of these conditions: the low-grade chronic inflammatory state inherently associated with aging, i.e., inflammaging. Here, we review the molecular and cellular mechanisms that link aging and inflammaging, focusing on the role of the innate immunity and more concretely on the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, as well as how the chronic activation of this inflammasome has a detrimental effect on different age-related disorders.","output":"The NLRP3 Inflammasome as a Critical Actor in the Inflammaging Process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Through food intake, humans obtain a variety of nutrients that are essential for growth, cellular function, tissue development, energy, and immune defense. A special interaction between nutrients and gut-associated lymphoid tissue occurs in the intestinal tract. Enterocytes of the intestinal barrier act as sensors for antigens from nutrients and the intestinal microbiota, which they deliver to the underlying immune system of the lamina propria, triggering an immune response. Studies investigating the mechanism of influence of nutrition on immunological outcomes have highlighted an important role of macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, fatty acids) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, antioxidants, probiotics) in modulating immune homeostasis. Nutrients exert their role in innate immunity and inflammation by regulating the expression of TLRs, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, thus interfering with immune cell crosstalk and signaling. Chemical substrates derived from nutrient metabolism may act as cofactors or blockers of enzymatic activity, influencing molecular pathways and chemical reactions associated with microbial killing, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Immune cell function appears to be influenced by certain nutrients that form parts of the cell membrane structure and are involved in energy production and prevention of cytotoxicity. Nutrients also contribute to the initiation and regulation of adaptive immune responses by modulating B and T lymphocyte differentiation, proliferation and activation, and antibody production. The purpose of this review is to present the available data from the field of nutritional immunology to elucidate the complex and dynamic relationship between nutrients and the immune system, the delineation of which will lead to optimized nutritional regimens for disease prevention and patient care.","output":"The Influence of Nutritional Factors on Immunological Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Aside from the reverse transcription-PCR tests for the diagnosis of the COVID-19 in routine clinical care and population-scale screening, there is an urgent need to increase the number and the efficiency for full viral genome sequencing to detect the variants of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 variants assessment should be easily, rapidly, and routinely available in any academic hospital. Materials and Methods: SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequencing was performed retrospectively in a single laboratory (LPCE, Louis Pasteur Hospital, Nice, France) in 103 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. An automated workflow used the Ion Ampliseq SARS-CoV-2 panel on the Genexus Sequencer. The analyses were made from nasopharyngeal swab (NSP) (n = 64) and/or saliva (n = 39) samples. All samples were collected in the metropolitan area of the Nice city (France) from September 2020 to March 2021. Results: The mean turnaround time between RNA extraction and result reports was 30 h for each run of 15 samples. A strong correlation was noted for the results obtained between NSP and saliva paired samples, regardless of low viral load and high (>28) Ct values. After repeated sequencing runs, complete failure of obtaining a valid sequencing result was observed in 4% of samples. Besides the European strain (B.1.160), various variants were identified, including one variant of concern (B.1.1.7), and different variants under monitoring. Discussion: Our data highlight the current feasibility of developing the SARS-CoV-2 next-generation sequencing approach in a single hospital center. Moreover, these data showed that using the Ion Ampliseq SARS-CoV-2 Assay, the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing is rapid and efficient not only in NSP but also in saliva samples with a low viral load.

Interest has recently increased because SARS viruses use one RAS component (ACE2) as a target-cell receptor. The occurrence of RAS in the basal ganglia suggests that the system may be targeted to improve the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. RAS-related data led to the hypothesis that RAS receptors may interact with each other. The aim of this paper was to find heteromers formed by Mas and angiotensin receptors and to address their functionality in neurons and microglia. Novel interactions were discovered by using resonance energy transfer techniques. The functionality of individual and interacting receptors was assayed by measuring levels of the second messengers cAMP and Ca(2+) in transfected human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T) and primary cultures of striatal cells. Receptor complex expression was assayed by in situ proximity ligation assay. Functionality and expression were assayed in parallel in primary cultures of microglia treated or not with lipopolysaccharide and interferon- (IFN-). The proximity ligation assay was used to assess heteromer expression in parkinsonian and dyskinetic conditions. Complexes formed by Mas and the angiotensin AT(1) or AT(2) receptors were identified in both a heterologous expression system and in neural primary cultures. In the heterologous system, we showed that the three receptorsMasR, AT(1)R, and AT(2)Rcan interact to form heterotrimers. The expression of receptor dimers (AT(1)R-MasR or AT(2)R-MasR) was higher in microglia than in neurons and was differentially affected upon microglial activation with lipopolysaccharide and IFN-. In all cases, agonist-induced signaling was reduced upon coactivation, and in some cases just by coexpression. Also, the blockade of signaling of two receptors in a complex by the action of a given (selective) receptor antagonist (cross-antagonism) was often observed. Differential expression of the complexes was observed in the striatum under parkinsonian conditions and especially in animals rendered dyskinetic by levodopa treatment. The negative modulation of calcium mobilization (mediated by AT(1)R activation), the multiplicity of possibilities on RAS affecting the MAPK pathway, and the disbalanced expression of heteromers in dyskinesia yield new insight into the operation of the RAS system, how it becomes unbalanced, and how a disbalanced RAS can be rebalanced. Furthermore, RAS components in activated microglia warrant attention in drug-development approaches to address neurodegeneration.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of HBOT on COVID-19 patients using a prospective randomized controlled design.Methods: Thirty-one severe COVID-19 inpatients, suffering from respiratory insufficiency in addition to at least one other risk factor, were randomized to HBOT or a control arms in a 2:1 ratio. Patients underwent baseline evaluations which included symptoms questionnaire, vital signs and blood tests. The HBOT arm patients underwent eight HBOT sessions twice daily. The evaluation was repeated on day 5, the day after the last HBOT session.Results: Compared to the control group, one day following the last HBOT session, there was a significant increase in room air saturation in the HBOT patients (F=15269, p=0001), significant improvement in the NEWS severity score (F=16379, p=0001) and a decreased respiratory rate (F=15269, p=0001). There was a significant decrease in CRP and LDH in the HBOT group compared to the control group (CRP: F=5322, p=0032, LDH: F=5599, p=0027) and a significantly higher proportion developed COVID-19 IgG antibodies compared to the control group (p<0001).Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time in a prospective randomized clinical trial, that HBOT is a safe therapeutic modality that can improve oxygenation, attenuate inflammation and improve the clinical status of severely ill COVID-19 patients.

Due to the absence of relevant research, the internal logic of this phenomenon is not clear. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study systematically explored whether and why public health emergencies stimulate consumers' preference for saving (vs. spending). We conducted two online surveys and used methods including stepwise regression analysis and bootstrapping to test the hypotheses. The first survey, with 1,511 participants from China in February 2020, indicates that the severity of emergencies has a significant positive impact on the populations' willingness to save (vs. spend). Risk perception plays a mediating role between the severity of emergencies and consumers' saving (vs. spending) willingness. Materialism plays a moderating role between risk perception and an individual's saving (vs. spending) willingness, individuals who are more materialistic have a lower saving (vs. spending) willingness when they perceive the risks of the pandemic. To verify the duration of the above effects, we conducted a follow-up survey consisted of 466 instances in August 2020. It is noteworthy that the above effects are not significant during the post-pandemic period. Thus, spending behavior in public health emergencies can be motived by reducing risk perception and increasing materialism.

A linear regression model trained on historical data was used to estimate anticipated transplantation volume. RESULTS. All UNOS regions reported a decrease in total waitlist additions and transplant surgeries. The largest decreases in total transplants were identified in regions 1, 2, 6, and 9, with regions 2, 7, 8, and 9 noting the largest decrease in waitlist additions. Six of the 11 regions noted increases in waitlist deaths, with UNOS regions 9, 1, and 2, all located within the Northeast, noting the highest percent increase in waitlist deaths at 170%, 89%, and 54%, respectively.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the first year's survey data to better understand the implementation of a novel curriculum across all programs in the state. Materials and Methods: Program surveys were sent 6 months after curriculum publication to all 18 health education programs in Arizona to assess the 6 Ds of curriculum implementation: Degree of implementation, Difficulty of implementation, Delivery methods, Faculty Development, Didactic dissonance and Discussion Opportunities. Results: Responses from all program types (14/18 programs) indicated that there was widespread implementation of the curriculum, with 71% reporting that all ten Core Components had been included in the past academic year. The majority of programs did not find the Components difficult to implement and had implemented them through lectures. Seventy-seven percent of programs did not have a process to ensure clinical rotation supervisors are teaching content consistent with the curriculum, 77% reported not addressing student's didactic dissonance, and 77% of programs did not report asking students about their interactions with industry representatives. Conclusion: In < 1 year after creation of the Arizona Pain and Addiction Curriculum, all program types reported wide implementation with little difficulty. This may represent a first step toward the transformation of pain and addiction education, and occurred statewide, across program types.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is unique among viral RNAs in its vast potential to form stable RNA structures and yet, as much as 97% of its 30 kilobases have not been structurally explored in the context of a viral infection. Our limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 genomic architecture is a fundamental limitation to both our mechanistic understanding of coronavirus life cycle and the development of COVID-19 RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we apply a novel long amplicon strategy to determine for the first time the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome probed in infected cells. In addition to the conserved structural motifs at the viral termini, we report new structural features like a conformationally flexible programmed ribosomal frameshifting pseudoknot, and a host of novel RNA structures, each of which highlights the importance of studying viral structures in their native genomic context. Our in-depth structural analysis reveals extensive networks of well-folded RNA structures throughout Orf1ab and reveals new aspects of SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture that distinguish it from other single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. Evolutionary analysis of RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 shows that several features of its genomic structure are conserved across beta coronaviruses and we pinpoint individual regions of well-folded RNA structure that merit downstream functional analysis. The native, complete secondary structure of SAR-CoV-2 presented here is a roadmap that will facilitate focused studies on mechanisms of replication, translation and packaging, and guide the identification of new RNA drug targets against COVID-19.","output":"Comprehensive in-vivo secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome reveals novel regulatory motifs and mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this paper is to introduce an improved strategy for controlling COVID-19 and other pandemic episodes as an environmental disinfection culture for public places.

However, data on the role of RSV in young infant deaths in developing countries are limited. METHODS: We conducted a community-based mortality surveillance from August 2018CMarch 2020 for infants 6 months in Karachi, Pakistan. We tested (reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction) nasopharyngeal swabs from deceased infants for presence of RSV. We performed verbal autopsies and calculated odds of RSV-associated mortality with 95% CIs and used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate associations. RESULTS: We collected 490 nasopharyngeal specimens from 1280 eligible infant deaths. There were 377/490 (76.9%) live births and 14/377 (3.7%; 95% CI: 1.8C5.6) were RSV positive. Most deaths occurred in neonates (254/377; 67.4%), males (226/377; 59.9%), and respiratory illnesses (206/377; 54.6%).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to collate and categorize the dermatologic findings reported in patients with COVID-19 and identify specific lesions that may facilitate diagnosis and prognostication. METHODS: An evidence-based review of the PubMed database was conducted on 14 May, 2020 using the search terms \\"Covid-19 skin,\\" \\"Covid-19 rash,\\" \\"Covid-19 exanthem,\\" and \\"Covid-19 chilblains.\\" Peer-reviewed publications containing original COVID-19 patient cases and a discussion of the associated cutaneous findings were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The literature search identified 115 records, of which 34 publications describing 996 patients with dermatologic conditions were included. Case reports (n = 15), case series (n = 13), and observational prospective studies (n = 4) were the most common publication types. Acral lesions resembling pseudo-chilblains were the most frequent lesion identified (40.4% of cases), appearing in young adults (mean age, 23.2 years) after the onset of extracutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (55/100 patients). Erythematous maculopapular rashes affected 21.3% of patients, most frequently impacting middle-aged adults (mean age, 53.2 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (110/187 patients). Vesicular rashes affected 13.0% of patients, appearing in middle-aged adults (mean age, 48.3 years) after the onset of other symptoms (52/84 patients). Urticarial rashes affected 10.9% of patients, appearing in adults (mean age, 38.3 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (46/78 patients). Vascular rashes resembling livedo or purpura were uncommon (4% of cases), appearing in elderly patients (mean age, 77.5 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (18/29 patients). Erythema multiforme-like eruptions, although infrequent (3.7% of cases), affected mostly children (mean age, 12.2 years). CONCLUSIONS: Vesicular rashes may suggest an initial diagnosis of COVID-19, acral lesions may be most appropriate for epidemiological uses, and vascular rashes may be a useful prognostic marker for severe disease.

Decisional aids (DAs) are tools frequently used in SDM for improving knowledge sharing and facilitating the decision process. The use and outcomes of decisional aids in surgery, however, have not been investigated. This study investigates whether SDM in surgery benefits any type of surgical patient compared with non-SDM treatment using patient-defined outcomes, such as an increase in knowledge and decisional satisfaction, as well as decreased decisional regret and anxiety. METHODS The search strategy was developed with a medical librarian to address the question of whether SDM in surgery benefits any type of surgical patient compared with non-SDM treatment using patient-defined outcomes. Seven databases (Medline [Ovid], Embase [Ovid], Cochrane [Wiley], Africa-Wide [EBSCO], Global Health [Ovid], Global Index Medicus (WHO), Web of Science [Clarivate Analytics]) were searched from inception until September 9th, 2019, with no language restriction. A two-person title and abstract screen was performed, followed by a full-text publication review. A DerSimonian-Laird random effects model was used for the meta-analysis, with heterogeneity established. Mean and standard deviation were collected for all study outcomes. Study eligibility was determined with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Bias Risk Assessment Tool. RESULTS In total, 6060 studies were retrieved. After duplicates were removed, 5303 titles and abstracts were screened, and of 356 full texts reviewed, 42 studies were included in the analysis. Heterogeneity was high in three of six variables (surgery chosen, decisional conflict, and knowledge gained), moderate in two (decisional anxiety and decisional satisfaction), and low in one (decisional regret). For all except the rates of surgical intervention, the results for decisional conflict, knowledge gained, decisional satisfaction, and decisional anxiety were significant at a 95% confidence interval. Decisional conflict decreased in 20/24 of the papers that recorded it; rates of choosing surgery decreased in 8 of the 11; and patient knowledge increased in 19 of the 22 that recorded it. The majority of papers had risk of bias, however, with the evidence of generally low quality. CONCLUSION The results suggest that SDM in surgery is associated with greater quality of patient satisfaction and value agreement, leading to decreased conflict and anxiety, and increased knowledge and translation. This data is useful in guiding the development of SDM protocols for use in surgical disciplines.

Disease progression (17/75, 22.7% vs. 10/75, 13.3%, p = 0.13), 14-day all-cause death (9/75, 12.0% vs. 10/75, 13.3%, p = 0.8), and need for mechanical ventilation (8/75, 10.7% vs. 4/75, 5.3%, p = 0.22) were similar, while immunomodulatory therapies were required more frequently among patients receiving FVP (10/75, 13.3% vs. 1/75, 1.3%, p < 0.01). The use of favipiravir was not retained as a protective factor against disease progression in multivatiate analysis.

Given the disease's lack of understanding, patients report poor adherence to medication and mistrust of medical services. This study aims to describe the recruitment characteristics and non-adherence associated factors of fibromyalgia patients to an RCT. METHODS: We performed a retrospective longitudinal analysis with data from our ongoing RCT. We investigated characteristics of subjects recruited, consented, and randomized. Adherence was studied using survival analysis techniques, and its associated factors were identified using Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: 524 subjects were contacted, 269 were eligible, 61 consented and 40 subjects were randomized. Thirty-eight percent were non-adherent to the protocol with a median of visits of five. The recruitment survey reported that 90% would likely participate in RCTs, 52% had previous participation, and 19% were aware of RCTs by their physicians. Some barriers were investigator-related (staff's friendliness and receiving the results of their trial participation) and center-related (privacy-confidentiality issues and the institution's reputation), without difference between adherent and non-adherent participants. We report significant factors for non-adherence as VAS anxiety score of 5 or more (5.3 HR, p = 0.01), Body Mass Index (BMI) (0.91 HR, p = 0.041) and Quality of Life (QoL) C Personal development subdomain (0.89 HR, p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: Recruitment and adherence of fibromyalgia patients is a challenge; however, they seem eager to participate in RCTs. We recommend creating a comfortable, friendly and trusting environment to increase the recruitment rate. Higher anxiety, lower BMI and lower quality of life were associated with a higher attrition rate.","output":"Recruitment characteristics and non-adherence associated factors of fibromyalgia patients in a randomized clinical trial: A retrospective survival analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Indonesian New Exporters (INE) program is a model for export development through training from upstream to downstream.

Materials and Methods A convolutional Siamese neural network-based algorithm was trained to output a measure of pulmonary disease severity on anterior-posterior CXRs (pulmonary x-ray severity (PXS) score), using weakly-supervised pretraining on ~160,000 images from CheXpert and transfer learning on 314 CXRs from patients with COVID-19. The algorithm was evaluated on internal and external test sets from different hospitals, containing 154 and 113 CXRs respectively. The PXS score was correlated with a radiographic severity score independently assigned by two thoracic radiologists and one in-training radiologist. For 92 internal test set patients with follow-up CXRs, the change in PXS score was compared to radiologist assessments of change. The association between PXS score and subsequent intubation or death was assessed. Results The PXS score correlated with the radiographic pulmonary disease severity score assigned to CXRs in the COVID-19 internal and external test sets ({rho}=0.84 and {rho}=0.78 respectively). The direction of change in PXS score in follow-up CXRs agreed with radiologist assessment ({rho}=0.74). In patients not intubated on the admission CXR, the PXS score predicted subsequent intubation or death within three days of hospital admission (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve=0.80 (95%CI 0.75-0.85)).

In Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) regular drug intake guarantees height improvement and, consequently, self-esteem of children. We conducted a survey to evaluate adherence to daily therapy and changes of height standard deviations in children with GHD during a pandemic-associated lockdown. METHODS 30 children (17 boys and 13 girls) with aged between 7 and 18 years were examined during the observational period. Adherence to therapy (self-reported and also confirmed with a standardized questionnaire), height and growth velocity during treatment were analyzed. RESULTS All of our patients reported a moderate to high level of adherence during the period of sanitary emergency (N=2 Morisky 7; N=28 Morisky 8). Adherence assessed by the Morisky Scale was in agreement in all cases with the self-reported one. Analysis of our data confirmed an improvement of the patients' height standard deviations, which could be related to the good adherence to growth hormone therapy during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS We can hypothesize that limitations during the lockdown period have positively influenced adherence to therapy and, consequently, height standard deviations of children with GHD in substitution therapy. The evaluation of adherence carried out by our interview showed an increased regularity in hormonal administration due to various factors, such as the greatest amount of time spent indoors. The increased adherence is coherent with the results of our auxological evaluations, which showed an increase in percentiles and standard deviations of height, compared to chronological age.","output":"GH Therapy in children and adolescents with Growth Hormone Deficiency during the first phase of COVID-19 lockdown: a survey in an Italian center."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug repurposing is also termed as drug repositioning or therapeutic switching This method is applied to identify the novel therapeutic agents from the existing FDA approved clinically used drug molecules It is considered as an efficient approach to develop drug candidates with new pharmacological activities or therapeutic properties As the drug discovery is a costly, time-consuming, laborious, and highly risk process, the novel approach of drug repositioning is employed to increases the success rate of drug development This strategy is more advantageous over traditional drug discovery process in terms of reducing duration of drug development, low-cost, highly efficient and minimum risk of failure In addition to this, World health organization declared Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as pandemic globally on February 11, 2020 Currently, there is an urgent need to develop suitable therapeutic agents for the prevention of the outbreak of COVID-19 So, various investigations were carried out to design novel drug molecules by utilizing different approaches of drug repurposing to identify drug substances for treatment of COVID-19, which can act as significant inhibitors against viral proteins It has been reported that COVID-19 can infect human respiratory system by entering into the alveoli of lung via respiratory tract So, the infection occurs due to specific interaction or binding of spike protein with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor Hence, drug repurposing strategy is utilized to identify suitable drugs by virtual screening of drug libraries This approach helps to determine the binding interaction of drug candidates with target protein of coronavirus by using computational tools such as molecular similarity and homology modeling etc For predicting the drug-receptor interactions and binding affinity, molecular docking study and binding free energy calculations are also performed The methodologies involved in drug repurposing can be categorized into three groups such as drug-oriented, target-oriented and disease or therapy-oriented depending on the information available related to quality and quantity of the physico-chemical, biological, pharmacological, toxicological and pharmacokinetic property of drug molecules This review focuses on drug repurposing strategy applied for existing drugs including Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Ribavirin, Baraticinib, Tocilizumab, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Prulifloxacin, Carfilzomib, Bictegravir, Nelfinavir, Tegobuvir and Glucocorticoids etc to determine their effectiveness toward the treatment of COVID-19","output":"Drug Repurposing Strategy (DRS): Emerging Approach to Identify Potential Therapeutics for Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People with intellectual disability have unmet health needs and experience health inequalities.

TB is strongly associated with poverty and this risk is largely mediated by undernutrition in India. COVID-19 response related lockdown has resulted in an economic crisis which may double levels of poverty, has exacerbated food insecurity, and disrupted TB services. These developments may have serious implications for TB progression and transmission in India. The nutritional status of a population is a strong determinant of the TB incidence, and undernutrition in adults alone accounts for 32C44% of TB incidence in India. A systematic review has shown that a 14% increase in TB incidence can occur per one unit decrease in body mass index (BMI), across the BMI range of 18.5C30 kg/m2. We believe that one unit decrease in BMI (corresponding to a 2C3 kg weight loss) may result in the poor in India as a result of the lockdown and its aftermath. This may result in an increase in estimated (uncertainty interval) incident TB by 185 610 (180 230, 190 990) cases. A 59% reduction in TB case detection between end March and May 2020, may result in an estimated (uncertainty interval) additional 87 711 (59 998, 120 630) TB deaths [19.5% increase (14.5, 24.7)] in 2020. Disadvantaged social groups and those living in states with higher levels of poverty, under-nutrition,and migrant workers are at particular risk. We suggest enhanced rations including pulses through the public distribution system and direct cash transfers to the poor pending restoration of livelihoods. TB services should be resumed immediately with enhanced efforts at case detection including active case finding. To prevent deaths among TB detected within the national TB programme, systemic identification, referral and management of severe disease at notification should be considered.","output":"The potential impact of the COVID-19 response related lockdown on TB incidence and mortality in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe COVID\\\\19 causes cytokine release syndrome and is associated with high mortality.

Many studies have found associations between SN and indicators of poor health outcomes, such as smoking, low socioeconomic status and obesity. However, less is known about the prevalence of this organism and more specifically about other oral site-specific locations that may harbor this organism. METHODS Using an existing patient repository (n = 47) of DNA isolated from saliva and other oral sites (n = 235), including the dorsum of the tongue, lower lingual incisor, upper buccal molar and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), molecular screening for SN was performed. Screening results were analyzed for associations between demographic variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity) and clinical information (body mass index or BMI, presence of orthodontic brackets, primary/mixed/permanent dentition). RESULTS qPCR screening revealed a total of n = 62/235 sites or 26.3% harboring SN with saliva and GCF (either alone or in combination with one or more sites) most often observed (Saliva, n = 23/27 or 85.18%, GCF, n = 14/27 or 51%).

With improved instruments and surgical techniques, many surgeons have recently begun using single-access laparoscopic surgery (SALS) to minimize scars and pain. Since 2011, most reports of SALS for rectal cancer have shown comparable pathologic outcomes to those of conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS). However, SALS is said to be superior to CLS in reducing complications, producing less discomfort, and faster recovery rates. This study aimed to compare the technical feasibility and early postoperative outcomes of these approaches. METHODS From January 2011 to January 2014, 78 cases of adenocarcinoma of the rectum and anal canal were enrolled in the study. Anterior, low anterior, intersphincteric, and abdominoperineal resections were performed. Data collected included technical feasibility and outcomes of operation, such as morbidity, mortality, severity of pain, analgesic usage, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS SALS was performed on 35 patients, and CLS was performed in 36 cases. Demographic data, including age, sex, BMI, ASA classification and clinical staging, were similar between the groups.

A major challenge in establishing wastewater surveillance programs, especially in remote areas, is the need for a well-equipped laboratory for sample analysis. Currently, no options exist for rapid, sensitive, mobile, and easy-to-use wastewater tests for SARS-CoV-2. The performance of the GeneXpert System, which offers cartridge-based, rapid molecular clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2 in a portable platform, was evaluated using wastewater as the input. The GeneXpert demonstrated a SARS-CoV-2 limit of detection in wastewater below 32 copies/mL with a sample processing time of less than an hour. Using wastewater samples collected from multiple sites across Canada during February and March 2021, a high overall agreement (97.8%) was observed between the GeneXpert assay and laboratory-developed tests regarding the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, with the use of centrifugal filters the detection threshold of the GeneXpert system was improved to <10 copies/mL in wastewater. Finally, to support on-site wastewater surveillance, GeneXpert testing was implemented in Yellowknife, a remote community in Northern Canada where its use successfully alerted public health authorities to undetected transmission of COVID-19. The identification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater triggered clinical testing of recent travelers and identification of new COVID-19 cases/clusters. Taken together, these results suggest the GeneXpert is a viable option for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in locations that do not have access to established testing laboratories.","output":"A sensitive and rapid wastewater test for SARS-COV-2 and its use for the early detection of a cluster of cases in a remote community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Efficient and early triage of hospitalized Covid-19 patients to detect those with higher risk of severe disease is essential for appropriate case management. METHODS: We trained, validated, and externally tested a machine-learning model to early identify patients who will die or require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from clinical and laboratory features obtained at admission. A development cohort with 918 Covid-19 patients was used for training and internal validation, and 352 patients from another hospital were used for external testing. Performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: A total of 363 of 918 (39.5%) and 128 of 352 (36.4%) Covid-19 patients from the development and external testing cohort, respectively, required mechanical ventilation or died during hospitalization. In the development cohort, the model obtained an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.87) for predicting severity of disease progression. Variables ranked according to their contribution to the model were the peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index and lymphocytes. In the external testing cohort, the model performed an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.85). This model is deployed in an open source calculator, in which Covid-19 patients at admission are individually stratified as being at high or non-high risk for severe disease progression.

Due to its high inter-person contagiousness, COVID-19 is rapidly spreading across the world. Positive patients are often suffering from different symptoms that can vary from mild to severe including cough, fever, sore throat, and body aches. In more dire cases, infected patients can experience severe symptoms that can cause breathing difficulties which lead to stern organ failure and die. The medical corps all over the world are overloaded because of the exponentially myriad number of contagions. Therefore, screening for the disease becomes overwrought with the limited tools of test. Additionally, test results may take a long time to acquire, leaving behind a higher potential for the prevalence of the virus among other individuals by the patients. To reduce the chances of infection, we suggest a prediction model that distinguishes the infected COVID-19 cases based on clinical symptoms and features. This model can be helpful for citizens to catch their infection without the need for visiting the hospital. Also, it helps the medical staff in triaging patients in case of a deficiency of medical amenities.

Then, a classification phase is conducted using an AdaBoost classifier. The proposed model is evaluated using two different datasets. To maximize results, we performed a natural selection of hyper-parameters of the classifier using the genetic algorithm.

DESIGN: Observational, prospective study. SETTING: Single-center study. PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-two consecutive COVID-19 survivors admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Seven days of actigraphy for sleep and circadian rest-activity pattern assessment; validated questionnaires; respiratory tests at the 3-month follow-up. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cohort included 172 patients, mostly males (67.4%) with a median (25thC75th percentile) age of 61.0 years (52.8C67.0 yr). The median number of days at the ICU was 11.0 (6.00C24.0), and 51.7% of the patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). According to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 60.5% presented poor sleep quality 3 months after hospital discharge, which was further confirmed by actigraphy. Female sex was associated with an increased score in the PSQI (p < 0.05) and IMV during ICU stay was able to predict a higher fragmentation of the rest-activity rhythm at the 3-month follow-up (p < 0.001). Furthermore, compromised mental health measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was associated with poor sleep quality (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of considering sleep and circadian health after hospital discharge. Within this context, IMV during the ICU stay could aid in predicting an increased fragmentation of the rest-activity rhythm at the 3-month follow-up.

Because of heterogeneity in outcome measures, we qualitatively synthesized findings within categories of strategies. RESULTS From 5,716 potentially relevant citations, 74 studies met inclusion criteria. Strategies included reducing demand for health care services (18 studies), optimizing use of existing resources (50), augmenting existing resources (5), implementing crisis standards of care (5), and multiple categories (4). The evidence was sufficient to form conclusions on 2 strategies, although the strength of evidence was rated as low. First, as a strategy to reduce demand for health care services, points of dispensing can be used to efficiently distribute biological countermeasures after a bioterrorism attack or influenza pandemic, and their organization influences speed of distribution. Second, as a strategy to optimize use of existing resources, commonly used field triage systems do not perform consistently during actual mass casualty events. The number of high-quality studies addressing other strategies was insufficient to support conclusions about their effectiveness because of differences in study context, comparison groups, and outcome measures. Our literature search may have missed key resource management and allocation strategies because of their extreme heterogeneity. Interrater reliability was not assessed for quality assessments or strength of evidence ratings. Publication bias is likely, given the large number of studies reporting positive findings. CONCLUSION The current evidence base is inadequate to inform providers and policymakers about the most effective strategies for managing or allocating scarce resources during mass casualty events. Consensus on methodological standards that encompass a range of study designs is needed to guide future research and strengthen the evidence base. Evidentiary standards should be developed to promote consensus interpretations of the evidence supporting individual strategies.","output":"Systematic review of strategies to manage and allocate scarce resources during mass casualty events."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, US hospitals have canceled elective surgeries. This decline in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) revenue may place financial strain on hospitals. Our goal was to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on the public interest in elective TJA. METHODS: The Google Search Volume Index (GSVI) identified the terms \\"knee replacement,\\" \\"hip replacement,\\" and \\"orthopedic surgeon\\" as the most common to describe TJA. The term \\"elective surgery cancellation\\" was also analyzed. Weekly GSVI data were extracted between 04-01-2015 and 04-04-2020. Time series analysis was conducted and state GSVI values were compared with COVID-19 prevalence and unemployment claims. RESULTS: The relative public interest in elective TJA has sharply declined since the WHO declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Between 03-01-2020 and 03-29-2020, the popularity of searches for \\"knee replacement\\", \\"hip replacement,\\" and \\"orthopedic surgeon\\" dropped by 62.1%, 52.1%, and 44.3%, respectively. A concurrent spike was observed for the term \\"elective surgery cancellation.\\" California, New Hampshire, Maine, and Nevada showed a low relative rate for TJA searches, and the highest increase in unemployment claims. CONCLUSION: The onset of COVID-19 correlates with declining relative popularity of searches related to elective TJA. Higher volume of COVID-19 cases in certain states may correspond with lower relative search popularity, although this correlation remains unclear. These results portend the possibility of a decline in elective TJA case volume, further straining hospitals. Further research is required to inform stakeholders how best to proceed and determine any sustained effects from the current diminished relative interest in TJA.

The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily among humans and more continues to be detected over time as to how it spreads. The effect that this crisis will have on the mental health of the population, both in the short and long term, is unknown. In the acute phase, fears of possible exposure to infection, loss of employment, and financial strain are likely to increase psychological distress in the wider population. In the long run, grief and trauma are likely to appear as financial and social impacts become ingrained, the risk of depression and suicide may increase. Lack of hugs, handshakes, free movement and isolation have made it impossible for people to socialize and behave normally with each other. Anxiety, fear, insecurity and lack of self-confidence are some of the main problems that people faced during quarantine and that they may face after the release of the measures. The purpose of this paper is to prove how much the Pandemic and the situation with COVID-19 have affected the mental health of the population in the city of Prizren and Gjakova. Quantitative study method was used for the realization of this work. This paper is based on the data extracted from the questionnaire completed together with the citizens of the municipalities of Prizren and Gjakova.

Live-attenuated cold-adapted HPIV3 vaccines have been evaluated in infants but a suitable interval for administration of a second dose of vaccine has not been defined. METHODS: HPIV3-seronegative children between the ages of 6 and 36 months were randomized 2:1 in a blinded study to receive two doses of 10(5) TCID(50) (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of live-attenuated, recombinant cold-passaged human PIV3 vaccine (rHPIV3cp45) or placebo 6 months apart. Serum antibody levels were assessed prior to and approximately 4-6 weeks after each dose. Vaccine virus infectivity, defined as detection of vaccine-HPIV3 in nasal wash and/or a  4-fold rise in serum antibody titer, and reactogenicity were assessed on days 3, 7, and 14 following immunization. RESULTS: Forty HPIV3-seronegative children (median age 13 months; range 6-35 months) were enrolled; 27 (68%) received vaccine and 13 (32%) received placebo. Infectivity was detected in 25 (96%) of 26 evaluable vaccinees following dose 1 and 9 of 26 subject (35%) following dose 2. Among those who shed virus, the median duration of viral shedding was 12 days (range, 6-15 days) after dose 1 and 6 days (range 3-8 days) after dose 2, with a mean peak log(10) viral titer of 3.4 PFU/mL (SD: 1.0) after dose 1 compared to1.5 PFU/mL (SD: 0.92) after dose 2. Overall, reactogenicity was mild, with no difference in rates of fever and upper respiratory infection symptoms between vaccine and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: rHPIV3cp45 was immunogenic and well-tolerated in seronegative young children. A second dose administered 6 months after the initial dose was restricted in those previously infected with vaccine virus; however, the second dose boosted antibody responses and induced antibody responses in two previously uninfected children.","output":"Safety and Infectivity of Two Doses of Live -Attenuated Recombinant Cold-Passaged Human Parainfluenza Type 3 Virus Vaccine rHPIV3cp45 in HPIV3-Seronegative Young Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using digitalized whole slide images (WSI) in routine histopathology practice is a revolutionary technology.

In wild-type cells, total amino-acid levels decrease during aging, but much less so in pka1 mutants. Two amino acids strongly change as a function of age: glutamine decreases, especially in wild-type cells, while aspartate increases, especially in pka1 mutants. Supplementation of glutamine is sufficient to extend the chronological lifespan of wild-type but not of pka1 cells. Supplementation of aspartate, on the other hand, shortens the lifespan of pka1 but not of wild-type cells.

Upon intravitreal injection in minipigs, pigG6.31 showed first-order clearance from the ocular compartments with vitreal elimination rates consistent with other molecules of this size. Application of the surrogate molecule in an in vivo evaluation in minipigs of a prototype of the port delivery (PD) platform indicated continuous ocular delivery from the implant, with release kinetics consistent with both the results from in vitro release studies and the efficacy observed in human clinical studies of the PD system with ranibizumab (PDS).

Thus, decision-makers are planning to increase the capacity of regional or country-wide health systems by adding new hospitals. However, during LAD processes, the decision-makers face imprecision due to the inherited uncertainty of main parameters that must be paid attention to make decisions applicable.

METHODS: We studied 82 children who were enrolled in a birth cohort study of inner-city children with at least 1 parent with allergy or asthma. We cultured cord blood monocytes and assessed IFNG and CCL5 mRNA production at 24 hours after inoculation with respiratory syncytial virus.

RESULTS: Respiratory tract infection was reported for 88% of subjects, and respiratory tract viruses were recovered in 74% of symptomatic children. We observed a wide range of antiviral responses in cord blood monocytes across the population. Furthermore, a decrease in production of IFNG (but not CCL5) mRNA in response to respiratory syncytial virus infection of monocytes was associated with a significant increase in the frequency of upper respiratory tract infections (r = ?0.42, P < .001) and the prevalence of ear and sinus infections, pneumonias, and respiratory-related hospitalizations.

METHODS: The relevant data were extracted from the electronic medical records with an implemented Caprini score and were retrospectively evaluated. The score was calculated twice: by the physician upon admission and by the investigator at discharge (death). The final assessment considered additional risk factors that occurred during inpatient treatment. Besides the original Caprini score (a version of 2005), the modified version added the elevation of D-dimer and specific scores for COVID-19 as follows: 2 points for asymptomatic, 3 points for symptomatic, and 5 points for symptomatic infection with positive D-dimer. Cases were evaluated retrospectively. The primary endpoint was symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) detected during inpatient treatment and confirmed by appropriate imaging testing or autopsy. The secondary endpoints included those observed during hospitalization (admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), a requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), death, bleeding), and those assessed at 6-month follow-up (symptomatic VTE, bleeding, death). The association of eight different versions of the Caprini score with VTE events was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 168 patients (83 males and 85 females at the age of 58.312.7 years old) were admitted to the hospital between 30 April and 29 May, 2020, and were discharged or died to the time of data analysis. The original Caprini score varied between 2-12 (5.41.8) at the admission and between 2-15 (5.92.5) at discharge or death. The maximal score was observed with modification including specific COVID-19 points of 5-20 (10.03.0). Patients received prophylactic (enoxaparin 40 mg once daily: 2.4%), intermediate (enoxaparin 80 mg once daily: 76.8%), or therapeutic (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily: 20.8%) anticoagulation. Despite this, symptomatic VTE was detected in 11 (6.5%) inpatients. Out of the 168 individuals, 28 (16.7%) admitted to the ICU, 8 (4.8%) required IMV, and 8 (4.8%) died. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was detected in two (1.2%) cases. The Caprini score of all eight versions demonstrated a significant association with inpatient VTE frequency. The highest predictability was observed for the original scale when assessed at discharge (death). Only symptomatic VTE was reported after discharge with a cumulative incidence of 7.1%. This did not affect the predictability of the Caprini score. Extended antithrombotic treatment was prescribed to 49 (29%) patients with a cumulative incidence of bleeding of 1.8% at 6 months.

Efforts to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication enzymes and better understand the mechanisms underlying viral RNA synthesis have largely relied on biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories, limiting throughput and accessibility. Recently, replicon systems have been proposed that involve ~30 kb RNA-based replicons or large plasmids that express the viral structural and non-structural proteins (nsp) in addition to a positive-sense reporter RNA. Unfortunately, these assays are not user-friendly due to plasmid instability or a poor signal to background ratio. We here present a simple mini-genome assay consisting of a ~2.5 kb-long negative-sense, nanoluciferase-encoding sub-genomic reporter RNA that is expressed from a plasmid, and amplified and transcribed by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase core proteins nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12. We show that expression of nsp7, 8 and 12 is sufficient to obtain robust positive- and negative-sense RNA synthesis in cell culture, that addition of other nsps modulates expression levels, and that replication of the reporter RNA can be inhibited by active site mutations in nsp12 or the SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibitor remdesivir. The mini-genome assay provides a signal that is 170-fold above background on average, providing excellent sensitivity for high-throughput screens, while the use of small plasmids facilitates site-directed mutagenesis for fundamental analyses of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis. Importance statement The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it essential to better understand the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2, and to search for compounds that can block the activity of key SARS-CoV-2 replication enzymes. However, studies with live SARS-CoV-2 require biosafety level 3 facilities, while existing replicon systems depend on long positive-sense subgenomes that are often difficult to manipulate or produce a high background signal, limiting drug-screens and a rapid analysis of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations during the COVID-19 pandemic. To make it easier to study emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutants and screen for inhibitors, we developed a simple mini-replicon that produces a minimal background signal, that can be used in any tissue culture lab, and that only requires four small plasmids to work.","output":"A SARS-CoV-2 mini-genome assay based on negative-sense RNA to study replication inhibitors and emerging mutations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modern Bayesian approaches and workflows emphasize in how simulation is important in the context of model developing.

Knockdown of circ_0081534 repressed NPC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT, and triggered NPC cell apoptosis. Also, circ_0081534 silencing decreased NPC cell growth in xenograft models. Circ_0081534 functioned as a miR-874-3p sponge, and downregulation of miR-874-3p alleviated the suppressive effects of circ_0081534 silencing on NPC cell malignant phenotypes.

Most education and counselling was stopped during lockdown and the Great4Diabetes WhatsApp Chatbot was innovated to fill this gap. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the implementation of the Chatbot in Cape Town, South Africa, between May and October 2021. METHODS: Convergent mixed methods evaluated implementation outcomes: acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, cost, coverage, effects and sustainability. Quantitative data was derived from the Chatbot and analysed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Qualitative data was collected from key informants in the health services, Aviro Health and Stellenbosch University and analysed using the framework method, assisted by Atlas-ti. The Chatbot provided users with 16 voice messages and graphics, in English, Afrikaans or Xhosa. Messages focused on coronavirus and self-management of type-2 diabetes. Users had to reply to a question after each message to receive the next message and give brief feedback at the end of the programme. RESULTS: The Chatbot was adopted by the Metro Health Services to assist people with diabetes who had restricted health care during lockdown and yet were more at risk of hospitalisation and death from coronavirus. The Chatbot was disseminated via healthcare workers in primary care facilities and local non-profit organisation as well as via local media and television. Two technical glitches interrupted the dissemination, but did not substantially affect user behaviour. Minor changes were made to the Chatbot to improve its utility for users. Many patients had access to a smartphone and were able to use the Chatbot via WhatsApp. Overall 8158 people connected with the Chatbot and 4577 (56.1%) proceeded to listen to the messages, with 12.6% of them listening to all 16 messages, mostly within 32 days. Incremental set-up costs were $5295 and operational costs over 6-months were $17304. More than 90% of users that listened to each message found them useful. Of the 533 that completed the whole programme 71.1% said they changed their self-management \\"a lot\\" and 87.6% were more confident. Most users changed their lifestyle in terms of diet (76.1%) and physical activity (53.6%). Healthcare workers also saw the benefits to patients and recommended the service continue. Sustainability of the Chatbot will depend on the future policy of the provincial Department of Health towards mHealth and willingness to contract with Aviro Health. There is potential to go to scale and include other languages and chronic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The Chatbot shows great potential to complement traditional health care approaches for people with diabetes and assist with more comprehensive patient education. Further research is needed to fully explore the patient's experience of the Chatbot and to evaluate the effectiveness in our context.

The accuracy of component deliveries and their quality affect the ultimate competitiveness of the entire automotive industry. The creation of strategic partnerships and stable supplierCcustomer relationships is currently a necessity. The aim of the article is to design the model for optimizing the ratio of the company suppliers in the Slovak automotive industry. The basis for designing the model was the results of our own research focused on the quality and timeliness of component deliveries from various suppliers. Supply chain members work with multiple subcontractors, using multiple subcontractors to supply the same components. We analyzed the overall quality of delivered components at a certain stage of the supply chain. The quality of the supplied components was the sum of all items from all suppliers. The aim of the proposed model is to determine the optimal percentage of individual suppliers of a particular part so as to minimize the overall risk associated with the supply and inventory of a particular part for the customer. Research methodology was focused on identification of the key performance indicators and key risk indicators of components deliveries by different suppliers. Those indicators provide a basis for the effective results of further research. We designed and used an algorithm for preparing and evaluating the model for optimizing the ratio of the company suppliers in the Slovak automotive industry. This research used modeling methods, simulations, and optimization models. The proposed model was verified in the specific conditions of the automotive supply chain. Deliveries from two subcontractors were simulated. Based on the results of the simulations, the optimal supply ratio of the two subcontractors was determined for a specific component of a member of the supply chain at a higher level. The results of the research can be useful for different suppliers in the Slovak automotive industry. By partially modifying the model and adapting it for different conditions in other industries, the model of optimizing the distribution of supply from individual suppliers can be used for other supply chains.","output":"Model for Optimizing the Ratios of the Company Suppliers in Slovak Automotive Industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine technology was rapidly and widely adopted during the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) response, and its efficacy in orthopedic surgery is still undetermined. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of new patient orthopedic surgery ambulatory encounters performed using telemedicine during the early phase of the COVID-19 crisis. Failure of the telemedicine encounter was assessed in this study by 2 separate criteria: (1) an unplanned visit to the emergency department (ED) within 6 weeks of the telemedicine encounter and (2) a planned subsequent in-person encounter for inability to formulate a complete diagnosis virtually. The authors retrospectively identified all new patient orthopedic surgery ambulatory encounters performed using telemedicine in the orthopedic surgery department of an academic tertiary care center during the first 6 weeks of the COVID-19 response, from March 16, 2020, to April 26, 2020. The study cohort included 298 new patients treated by 41 providers. The mean age of the 298 patients was 48 years, and 59% were women. Two hundred encounters were performed with video, and 98 were performed with telephone only. Three (1%) patients presented to the ED within 6 weeks of their new patient telemedicine encounter, and 8 (3%) patients presented for a planned in-person encounter. The authors concluded that new patient orthopedic surgery ambulatory encounters performed using telemedicine were able to effectively direct patients to a variety of treatments and dispositions, with a low rate of unplanned presentation to the ED or need for supplementary in-person assessment.

We assume a Watts-Strogatz small-world network which allows to distinguish contacts within clustered cliques and unclustered, random contacts in the population, which have been shown to be crucial in sustaining the epidemic. In contrast to other works, which use coarse-grained network structures from anonymized data, like cell phone data, we consider the contacts of individual agents explicitly. We show that NPIs drastically reduced random contacts in the transmission network, increased network clustering, and resulted in a change from an exponential to a constant regime of newcases. In this regime, the disease spreads like a wave with a finite wave speed that depends on the number of contacts in a nonlinear fashion, which we can predict by mean field theory. Our analysis indicates that besides the well-known transitionbetween exponential increase and exponential decrease in the number of new cases, NPIs can induce a transition to another, previously unappreciated regime of constant new cases.","output":"Inferring the effect of interventions on COVID-19 transmission networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is one of the most critical pandemics during human civilization.

This study's primary objective was to identify peer-reviewed studies that report Canadian-specific cost data for treating overactive bladder (OAB) based on the Canadian Urological Association (CUA) guidelines. A secondary objective was to identify studies that report cost data from other healthcare jurisdictions that could be generalizable to the Canadian context. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of the published peer-reviewed literature. We included studies from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, excluding the U.S., published in English since January 2009. RESULTS From 165 abstracts identified in our initial search, 18 studies were ultimately included for analysis. This included one Canadian-based study reporting costs in Canadian dollars, all related to second-line treatments. The other studies were primarily from Europe, reporting costs in Euros or U.K. pounds. There were no studies reporting costs for first-line treatments. Gaps in costs for select second-line and third-line treatments recommended by the CUA were also identified. CONCLUSIONS Canadian-specific cost data for OAB treatments published in the peer-reviewed literature is limited to a single study reporting costs for only a few second-line treatments sourced from a single province over 10 years ago.

Demographic and epidemiological transitions around the world have resulted in shifts in the causes and distribution of child death and diseases, and many children are living with short-term and long-term chronic illnesses and disabilities. These changes, plus global threats such as pandemics, transnational and national security issues, and climate change, mean that regular monitoring of child health and wellbeing is essential if we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. This Health Policy describes the three-phased process undertaken by the Child Health Accountability Tracking technical advisory group (CHAT) to develop a core set of indicators on child health and wellbeing for global monitoring purposes, and presents CHAT's research recommendations to address data gaps. CHAT reached consensus on 20 core indicators specific to the health sector, which include 11 impact-level indicators and nine outcome-level indicators that cover the topics of: acute conditions and prevention; health promotion and child development; and chronic conditions, disabilities, injuries, and violence against children. An additional six indicators (three impact and three outcome) that capture information on child health issues such as malaria and HIV are recommended; however, these indicators are only relevant to high-burden regions. CHAT's four research priorities will require investments in health information systems and measurement activities. These investments will help to increase data on children aged 5-9 years; develop standard metadata and data collection processes to enable cross-country comparisons and progress assessments over time; reach a global consensus on essential interventions and associated indicators for monitoring emerging priority areas such as child development, chronic conditions, disabilities, and injuries; and implement strategies to increase the uptake of data on child health to improve evidence-based planning, programming, and advocacy efforts.","output":"Measuring and monitoring child health and wellbeing: recommendations for tracking progress with a core set of indicators in the Sustainable Development Goals era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, studies have documented increased and decreased cigarette smoking among adults.

Adults in 30 large U.S. cities who smoked cigarettes daily completed an online survey between 14 July and 30 November 2020. The analytic sample (N = 2768) was 54.0% male and 68.3% white with 23.7% reporting increasing and 11.3% decreasing smoking (6% reported both). Younger age, a diagnosis of COVID-19, and greater pandemic-related stress were associated with greater odds of both increased and decreased smoking. Increased smoking also was associated with heavier nicotine dependence, greater desire to quit, and greater perceived susceptibility and lower perceived seriousness of COVID-19 for people who smoke, while pandemic-related job-loss, lower nicotine dependence, and greater self-efficacy were associated with decreased smoking. Among respondents who had not contracted COVID-19 (n = 2418), correlates were similar with the addition of greater perceived personal susceptibility to COVID-19 associated with both increased and decreased smoking, while greater perceived personal seriousness of COVID-19 was associated with increased smoking.

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play an important role in critical cellular processes, failure of any one or more processes can lead to the development of multiple cancers. This study aimed to explore pivotal biomarkers and corresponding mechanisms to predict the prognosis of patients with ICC. METHODS: The transcriptomic and clinical information of patients were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Bioinformatic methods were used to identify survival-related and differentially-expressed biomarkers. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression levels of key biomarkers in independent real-world cohorts. Subsequently, a prognostic signature was constructed that effectively distinguished patients in the high- and low-risk groups. Independent prognosis analysis was used to verify the signatures independent predictive capabilities, and two nomograms were developed to predict survival. RESULTS: PIWIL4 and SUPT5H were identified and considered as pivotal biomarkers, and the same expression trends of upregulation in ICC were also validated via qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in the separate real-world sample cohorts.

Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated the colocalization, throughout infection, of replicase cleavage products containing different key enzymes for SARS-CoV replication. Electron microscopy revealed the early formation and accumulation of typical double-membrane vesicles, which probably carry the viral replication complex. The vesicles appear to be fragile, and their preservation was significantly improved by using cryofixation protocols and freeze substitution methods. In immunoelectron microscopy, the virus-induced vesicles could be labeled with replicase-specific antibodies. Opposite to what was described for mouse hepatitis virus, we did not observe the late relocalization of specific replicase subunits to the presumed site of virus assembly, which was labeled using an antiserum against the viral membrane protein. This conclusion was further supported using organelle-specific marker proteins and electron microscopy. Similar morphological studies and labeling experiments argued against the previously proposed involvement of the autophagic pathway as the source for the vesicles with which the replicase is associated and instead suggested the endoplasmic reticulum to be the most likely donor of the membranes that carry the SARS-CoV replication complex.","output":"Ultrastructure and origin of membrane vesicles associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus replication complex."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New York City (NYC) emerged as a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epicenter in March 2020, but there is limited information regarding potentially unrecognized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections before the first reported case.

METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective survey on educational and personal impact during the first COVID-19 wave was administered anonymously to all surgical residents in Flanders. A quantitative comparison of performed surgeries during this period and the same period a year earlier was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 193 surgical residents (46%) completed the survey. 63% of residents were no longer admitted to multidisciplinary oncologic meetings and 107 (55%) residents had no longer any scientific theoretical meetings at all. Almost one in two residents (46%) indicated more than 50% reduction in time in the operating theater and one in three (31%) residents were involved in care for COVID-19 positive surgical patients. Seventy-eight percent of the residents experienced a negative impact on their surgical training and 41% experienced a negative influence on their private situation. Performed surgical cases during the COVID-19 period were on average 40% less for second, third- and fourth-year residents. CONCLUSION: Surgical residents perceived a high negative impact on personal and professional lives during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Flanders. Education and training programs were cancelled and volume of performed surgeries decreased tremendously. Policymakers and surgical program coordinators should ensure surgical education during further evolution of this and future pandemics.","output":"Impact of the first COVID-19 wave on surgical training in Flanders: are we losing competence?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of COVID-19 has become a significant and troubling aspect of society in 2020.

In this case, it is useful to ask, can we utilize this knowledge in one country to model the outbreak in another? To answer this, we propose the task of cross-lingual transfer learning for epidemiological alignment.

In an effort to reduce viral transmission, conserve resources, and in accordance with institutional and state mandates, all elective procedures and surgeries were postponed during the initial outbreak. Guidelines for case selection are limited and management for pediatric catheterization laboratories during this crisis is unprecedented. OBJECTIVES To report the protocols and case selection of a high-volume pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory in the epicenter of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS All pediatric cardiac catheterization procedures from March 16, 2020 through May 10, 2020 were reviewed. Changes to case selection and periprocedural workflow are described. Data were collected on COVID-19 testing status and primary procedure type, and all procedures were classified by urgency. RESULTS There were 52 catheterizations performed on 50 patients. Endomyocardial biopsies were the most common procedure (n = 27; 52%). Interventional and diagnostic procedures represented 27% (n = 14) and 21% (n = 11) of cases, respectively. Two emergent procedures (3.8%) were performed on patients with positive COVID-19 testing. Most cases were performed on patients with negative COVID-19 testing (n = 33; 94%). CONCLUSIONS Adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic in a high-volume pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory can be safely and effectively managed by prioritizing emergent and urgent cases and modifying workflow operations. The experience of this center may assist other pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratories in adapting to similar practice changes as the pandemic continues to evolve.","output":"Non-Elective Pediatric Cardiac Catheterization During COVID-19 Pandemic: A New York Center Experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current therapeutic development in ALS relies on individual randomized clinical trials to test a specific investigational product in a single patient population.

In view of the essential role of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in animal and human lung pathobiology, we investigated the role of DPP4 in stress-related lung injury in mice. Eight-week-old male mice were randomly divided into a non-stress group and a 2-week immobilization stress group. Non-stress control mice were left undisturbed. The mice subjected to immobilized stress were randomly assigned to the vehicle or the DPP4 inhibitor anagliptin for 2 weeks. Chronic stress reduced subcutaneous and inguinal adipose volumes and increased blood DPP4 levels. The stressed mice showed increased levels in the lungs of genes and/or proteins related to oxidative stress (p67(phox), p47(phox), p22(phox) and gp91(phox)), inflammation (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and intracellular adhesion molecule-1), apoptosis (caspase-3, -8, -9), senescence (p16(INK4A), p21, and p53) and proteolysis (matrix metalloproteinase-2 to -9, cathepsin S/K, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and -2), and reduced levels of eNOS, Sirt1, and Bcl-2 proteins; and these effects were reversed by genetic and pharmacological inhibitions of DPP4. We then exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro to hydrogen peroxide; anagliptin treatment was also observed to mitigate oxidative and inflammatory molecules in this setting. Anagliptin can improve lung injury in stressed mice, possibly by mitigating vascular inflammation, oxidative stress production, and proteolysis.

METHODS: We studied 618 161 people with T2D followed between March and December 2020 from 1744 UK general practices registered with the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We focused on six health checks: haemoglobin A1c, serum creatinine, cholesterol, urinary albumin excretion, blood pressure and body mass index assessment. Regression models compared observed rates in April 2020 and between March and December 2020 with trend-adjusted expected rates derived from 10-year historical data. RESULTS: In April 2020, in English practices, rates of performing health checks were reduced by 76%C88% when compared with 10-year historical trends, with older people from deprived areas experiencing the greatest reductions. Between May and December 2020, the reduced rates recovered gradually but overall remained 28%C47% lower, with similar findings in other UK nations. Extrapolated to the UK population, there were ~7.4 million fewer care processes undertaken MarchCDecember 2020. In England, rates for new medication fell during April with reductions varying from 10% (95% CI: 4% to 16%) for antiplatelet agents to 60% (95% CI: 58% to 62%) for antidiabetic medications. Overall, between March and December 2020, the rate of prescribing new diabetes medications fell by 19% (95% CI: 15% to 22%) and new antihypertensive medication prescribing fell by 22% (95% CI: 18% to 26%), but prescribing of new lipid-lowering or antiplatelet therapy was unchanged. Similar trends were observed across the UK, except for a reduction in new lipid-lowering therapy prescribing in the other UK nations (reduction: 16% (95% CI: 10% to 21%)). Extrapolated to the UK population, between March and December 2020, there were ~31 800 fewer people with T2D prescribed a new type of diabetes medication and ~14 600 fewer prescribed a new type of antihypertensive medication.

Studies using this technique have shown that schizophrenia is characterized by a lower level of fractional anisotropy of the tissue compartment (FAt) and higher free-water fractional volume (FW). It is unknown, however, whether such abnormalities are an expression of pre-existing (genetic) risk for schizophrenia or a manifestation of the illness. To investigate the contribution of familial risk factors to white matter abnormalities, we used the free-water imaging technique to assess FAt and FW in a large cohort of 471 participants including 161 patients with schizophrenia, 182 non-psychotic siblings, and 128 healthy controls. In this sample, patients did not show significant differences in FAt as compared to controls, but did exhibit a higher level of FW relative to both controls and siblings in the left uncinate fasciculus, superior corona radiata and fornix / stria terminalis. This increase in FW was found to be related to, though not solely explained by, ventricular enlargement. Siblings did not show significant FW abnormalities. However, siblings did show a higher level of FAt as compared to controls and patients, in line with results of a previous study on the same data using conventional DTI. Taken together, our findings suggest that extracellular free-water accumulation in patients is likely a manifestation of established disease rather than an expression of familial risk for schizophrenia and that super-normal levels of FAt in unaffected siblings may reflect a compensatory process.","output":"Diffusion MRI derived free-water imaging measures in patients with schizophrenia and their non-psychotic siblings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2A oligopeptide sequences (2As) mediate a cotranslational recoding event termed ribosome skipping.

Eosinopenia has been identified as a potential biomarker of sepsis in the past decade. However, its clinical application progress is slow and its recognition is low. Recent studies have again focused on the potential association between Eosinopenia and severe infections. This study analyzed the efficacy of Eosinopenia as a biomarker for diagnosis of sepsis and its correlation with pathophysiology of sepsis. METHOD: The protocol for this meta-analysis is available in PROSPERO (CRD42020197664). We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials CENTRAL databases to identify studies that met the inclusion criteria. Two authors performed data extraction independently. The pooled outcomes were calculated by TP (true positive), FP (false positive), FN (false negative), TN (true negative) by using bivariate meta-analysis model in STATA 14.0 software. Meanwhile, possible mechanisms of sepsis induced Eosinopenia was also analyzed. RESULTS: Seven studies were included in the present study with a total number of 3842 subjects. The incidence of Eosinopenia based on the enrolled studies varied from 23.2 to 92.7%. For diagnosis of sepsis, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio and diagnostic odds ratio of Eosinopenia were 0.66 (95%CI [0.53C0.77]), 0.68 (95%CI [0.56C0.79]), 2.09 (95%CI [1.44C3.02]), 0.49 (95%CI [0.34C0.71]) and 4.23 (95%CI [2.15C8.31]), respectively. The area under the summary receiver operator characteristic curve (SROC) was 0.73 (95%CI [0.68C0.76]). Meta-regression analysis revealed that no single parameter accounted for the heterogeneity of pooled outcomes. For each subgroup of different eosinopenia cutoff values (50, 40, 25, 100), the sensitivity was 0.61, 0.79, 0.57, 0.54, and the specificity was 0.61, 0.75, 0.83, 0.51, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that Eosinopenia has a high incidence in sepsis but has no superiority in comparison with conventional biomarkers for diagnosis of sepsis. However, eosinopenia can still be used in clinical diagnosis for sepsis as a simple, convenient, fast and inexpensive biomarker. Therefore, further large clinical trials are still needed to re-evaluate eosinopenia as a biomarker of sepsis.

Concerns about the male fertility consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection have started to emerge, since epidemiologic studies observed that this coronavirus affects male patients more frequently and with increased severity, possibly because of the hormone-regulated expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. A disturbance in fertility is also expected based on studies of the previous SARS-CoV infection, which targets the same ACE2 receptor when entering the host cells. In addition, bioinformatics analyses reveal the abundant expression of ACE2 receptor in the male reproductive tissues, particularly in the testis. It has been proposed that pharmacological intervention favoring the angiotensin-(1C7)/ACE2/Mas receptor pathway and increasing ACE2 expression and activity could greatly prevent inflammatory lesions in this area.

To mitigate the risks and capitalise on opportunities for positive change, we must understand how the impact has been mediated by sociodemographics, mental disorders, personality traits, life circumstances and the coping measures people choose to take. METHODS Data were collected from 376,987 members of the general public, predominantly in the UK, between late December 2019 and May 2020. Interaction models examined differences in sociodemographic distributions of mood and anxiety for 233,268 people in January vs. 109,749 in May. Factor analysis of a comprehensive instrument determined the dimensionality of self-perceived pandemic-driven change in wellbeing, outlook and behaviour for 74,830 participants in May. Linear modelling identified demographic, contextual, clinical, and trait predictors of pandemic impact. Topic modelling distilled prevalent advice from free-text responses. RESULTS Anxiety, depression and insomnia changed markedly in demographically-mediated ways. Untoward changes were larger for older adults. Benefits were greater for younger adults. Social connectedness was negatively affected across most mental and neurological conditions. There were disorder-specific changes in other domains, e.g., heightened conflict at home for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and heightened anxiety for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psychiatric symptoms, personality traits, occupational variables and living conditions were amongst the strongest predictors of pandemic impact.

We aimed to determine whether a frequently used biologic mesh (Strattice(TM)) is more resistant to bacterial colonization than macroporous synthetic mesh (Parietex(TM) Progrip(TM)) after inoculation with two common pathogens. METHODS Rats (n = 48) were implanted subcutaneously with Strattice(TM) or Progrip(TM). Meshes were inoculated with sterile saline or a suspension containing 10(6) colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli prior to wound closure (n = 8 per subgroup). Meshes were explanted at 4 weeks and underwent microbiologic and histologic analyses. RESULTS Progrip(TM) demonstrated superior bacterial clearance compared to Strattice(TM) (E. coli, 88 vs. 17% clearance, p = 0.03; S. aureus, 75 vs. 50%, p = 0.61; combined bacterial strains, 81 vs. 36%, p = 0.02; respectively).

Messages apply different promotional strategies to motivate behavior change, likely yielding divergent reactions from partisan audiences. The Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) suggests that perceived threat for a negative outcome should impact perceived need for the advocated health behavior, which should be more appealing to an audience if perceived it to be efficacious and feasible. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the interactive effects of Tweet source, message emotional appeal, and audience political affiliation on US adults' perceptions of COVID-19 threat and social distancing efficacy during early months of the pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: This online survey experiment applies the EPPM to assess US adults' reactions to tweets encouraging social distancing. The experiment tests 3 emotional appeals (fear, humor, and neutral) and 2 sources (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] and celebrity) on adults' emotional reactions and perceptions of COVID-19 threat and social distancing efficacy. PARTICIPANTS: The final sample included 415 US adults (242 Democrat and 173 Republican) recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were adapted from the EPPM and include perceived susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19, and response efficacy and self-efficacy regarding social distancing. Each was measured through the survey on a 7-point response scale. RESULTS: Humor and fear appeal messages evoked less fear and guilt responses than a neutral tweet from the CDC. Fear and guilt emotions predicted greater perceived threat, while hope and pride predicted efficacy constructs in relationships moderated by political ideology. CONCLUSIONS: Public health messages targeting a bipartisan audience through social media may increase perceived threat by inducing fear of COVID-19 infection. EPPM theory suggests boosting efficacy is also critical to message acceptance and behavior change; thus, inducing feelings of hope and pride in addition to fear may be particularly effective.","output":"Experimental Effects of Tweets Encouraging Social Distancing: Effects of Source, Emotional Appeal, and Political Ideology on Emotion, Threat, and Efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY Hydroxychloroquine is being investigated for a potential prophylactic effect in SARS-CoV-2 infection, but its mechanism of action is poorly understood Circulating leukocytes from the blood of COVID-19 patients show increased responses to Toll-Like Receptor ligands, suggestive of innate immune reprogramming By analyzing interferon responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors conditioned with heat-killed Candida the trained innate immunity can be modeled in vitro In this model hydroxychloroquine inhibits the responsiveness of these innate immune cells to virus-like stimuli and interferons This is associated with suppression of histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation of inflammation-related genes, changes in the cellular lipidome, and decreased expression of interferon-stimulated genes Our findings indicate that hydroxychloroquine inhibits trained immunity in vitro, which may not be beneficial for the antiviral innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients","output":"Hydroxychloroquine inhibits the trained innate immune response to interferons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work aimed to evaluate the adjuvant treatment to surgical debridement using topical applications of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ATCC 10241 cultures in complicated diabetic foot ulcers as compared to diabetic foot ulcers receiving surgical wound debridement. A randomised controlled trial was performed involving 22 outpatients with complicated diabetic foot ulcers that either received surgical debridement (SuDe, n = 12) or surgical debridement plus topical applications of L. plantarum cultures (SuDe + Lp, n = 10) every week during a 12 week treatment period. Compared to patients receiving SuDe, patients treated with SuDe + Lp exhibited significantly increased fibroplasia and angiogenesis, as determined by Massons trichrome staining and the study of CD34 cells, -smooth muscle actin to semi-quantify vascular area, number of vessels and endothelial cells. In addition, a promotion of the polarisation of macrophages from M1 (CD68) to M2 (CD163) phenotype was observed in SuDe + Lp patients with remarkable differences in the tissue localisation. Bacterial counts were significantly diminished in the SuDe + Lp group compared to the SuDe group. Ex vivo assays, using polymorphonuclears isolated from peripheral blood of patients with diabetes and healthy individuals and challenged with Staphylococcus aureus demonstrated that the addition of L. plantarum supernatants significantly improved the phagocytosis of these cells. L. plantarum-secreted components increased the neutrophils bactericidal activity and regulated the netosis induced by S. aureus. At day 49, the average wound area reduction with SuDe + Lp was 73.5% compared with 45.8% for SuDe (p < 0.05). More patients progressed to closure with SuDe + Lp compared with SuDe treatment, indicating the ability of L. plantarum to accelerate the healing. At day 60, 60% of patients treated with SuDe + Lp achieved 100% of wound area reduction compared with 40% for SuDe. We propose that SuDe + Lp could be an effective adjuvant to surgical debridement when SuDe is not satisfactory for patients with complicated diabetic foot ulcers.

Self-management of diabetes is therefore of paramount importance. The purpose of this study is to compare self-management of diabetes pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: 679 participants with diabetes completed an online structured questionnaire survey. Various exposure variables (demographics, duration, treatment and complications of diabetes, self-isolation, etc.) were analysed to examine associations with the following outcome variables: (i) fluctuation of blood glucose levels, (ii) access to diabetes medicine, (iii) access to healthy diet, (iv) physical activity. Adjusted multiple regression analysis ascertained significant associations for each outcome variable against exposure variables. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis showed that self-isolation was significantly associated with greater fluctuation in blood glucose levels (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.2C2.6, p = 0.005), reduced access to diabetes medicine (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.1C3.1, p = 0.02) and reduced access to healthy diet (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 2.0C4.6, p < 0.001).

METHODS Physical and haematological information was obtained from clinical records. White blood cell counts, and percentages of neutrophilic granulocytes and neutrophilic lymphocytes were measured. The service department of the hospital provided information about daily use of protective materials. Differences in clinical symptoms between probable and suspected SARS cases were tested by Fisher's exact test. Non-linear mixed modelling was used to test for differences between the haematological patterns for probable and suspected cases. Risk factors for dying among probable SARS cases were tested by logistic regression. RESULTS The SARS outbreak started with a patient from Beijing on 15 April 2003, and spread quickly among the healthcare workers and in-patients in the hospital. In total 90 probable and 21 suspected cases were reported, with 17 deaths among them (case fatality rate 15%). Haematological patterns were significantly different between probable and suspected cases, whereas the percentages with certain clinical symptoms showed no apparent difference. Death of probable SARS cases was only significantly associated with high age and use of a respiratory machine (mainly for the most severe cases), whereas e.g. co-morbidity and steroid treatment showed no impact in multivariate analysis. Stringent control measures, including distribution of huge numbers of protective materials, started on 20 April, which soon lead to a strong decrease in the incidence of new cases. After the last SARS case left the hospital on 6 June, protective materials were dispensed at substantially lower rates, but not to zero, as was the case during the first days of the outbreak. CONCLUSION The working definition of probable SARS used during the epidemic appeared to have been fairly accurate. Many valuable lessons were learned regarding prevention of hospital spread of infection, especially the need to have sufficient protective supplies available and to implement these rigidly and at an early stage of an (threatening) epidemic.","output":"The SARS outbreak in a general hospital in Tianjin, China: clinical aspects and risk factors for disease outcome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This contribution provides insights into the methodology of a pan-European population-based online survey, performed without external funding during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, we searched related studies on COVID-19 published before March 31, 2020 through Google Scholar. We evaluated the risk of bias of included studies, and synthesized the results using a qualitative synthesis. Results Six studies met our inclusion criteria. Five studies on SARS showed an overall risk of death of 7.2% to 20.0%. One study of SARS patients who used macrolides, quinolones or beta lactamases showed that the mean duration of hospital stay was 14.2, 13.8 and 16.2 days, respectively, and their average duration of fever was 14.3, 14.0 and 16.2 days, respectively. One cohort study on MERS indicated that macrolide therapy was not associated with a significant reduction in 90-day mortality (adjusted OR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.47-1.51, P=0.56) and improvement in MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted HR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.47-1.64, P=0.68).

When the PLC fails to perform properly, as frequently observed in virus-infected or tumor cells, structurally unstable MHC I peptide complexes are generated, which are prone to disintegrate instead of presenting Ags to cytotoxic T cells. In this study we show that a second quality control checkpoint dependent on the serine protease proprotein convertase 7 (PC7) can rescue unstable MHC I, whereas the related convertase furin is completely dispensable. Cells with a malfunctioning PLC and silenced for PC7 have substantially reduced MHC I surface levels caused by high instability and significantly delayed surface accumulation of these molecules. Instead of acquiring stability along the secretory route, MHC I appears to get largely routed to lysosomes for degradation in these cells. Moreover, mass spectrometry analysis provides evidence that lack of PLC quality control and/or loss of PC7 expression alters the MHC I-presented peptide profile. Finally, using exogenously applied peptide precursors, we show that liberation of MHC I epitopes may directly require PC7.

METHODS Three ventilators (Impact 731, Hamilton T1, and CareFusion Revel) were tested at pediatric (50 and 100 mL) and adult (250-750 mL) tidal VTs at 0 and 20 cm H?O positive end expiratory pressure and at inspired oxygen of 0.21 and 1.0. Airway pressure, volume, and flow were measured at sea level as well as at 8,000, 16,000, and 22,000 ft (corresponding to barometric pressures of 760, 564, 412, and 321 mm Hg) using a calibrated pneumotachograph connected to a training test lung in an altitude chamber. Set VT and delivered VT as well as changes in VT at each altitude were compared by t test. RESULTS The T1 delivered VT within 10% of set VT at 8,000 ft. The mean VT was less than set VT at sea level as a result of circuit compressible volume with the Revel and the 731. Changes in VT varied widely among the devices at sea level and at altitude.

Few comparison studies between the two techniques exist. The aim was to determine whether the uniportal technique had more favourable postoperative outcomes than the multiport technique. METHODS All VATS lobectomies undertaken at a single university hospital during August 2012 to December 2013 were studied. Patients with preoperative opiate use or chronic pain were excluded. Patients were divided into those with uniportal and multiport approaches for analysis. All continuous data were assessed for normality, and analysed with the Mann-Whitney U-tests or t-tests as appropriate. Categorical data were analysed by Fisher's exact or (2) test for trend as appropriate. RESULTS One hundred and twenty-nine VATS lobectomies were completed. Six were excluded and data were incomplete for 13, leaving 110 (15 uniportal, 95 multiport) for analysis. The demographics of the two groups were similar. There was no significant difference in the Thoracoscore or American Society of Anesthesiologists grades. The median morphine use in the first 24 postoperative hours was 19 mg in the uniportal group and 23 mg in the multiport group, P = 0.84. The median visual analogue pain score in the first 24 h was 0 in the uniportal group and 0 in the multiport group, P = 0.65. There was no difference in the duration of patient-controlled analgesia (P = 0.97), chest drain duration (P = 0.67) or hospital length of stay (P = 0.54). There was no inpatient mortality and no unplanned admission to critical care in either group. CONCLUSIONS Uniportal VATS lobectomy is safe, and there is no appreciable negative impact on the hospital stay or morbidity. Patient-reported pain and morphine use in the first 24 h was low with either technique.

This study aims to investigate the effects of various parameters such as stay-at-home restrictions, work hours, vaccination and social distance on the containment of pandemics such as COVID-19. MethodsTo achieve this, we developed an agent-based model based on a time-dynamic graph with stochastic transmission events. The graph is constructed from a real-world social network. The graphs edges have been categorized into three categories: home, workplaces, and social environment. The conditions needed to mitigate the spread of wild-type (WT) COVID-19 and the delta variant have been analyzed. Our purposeful agent-based model has carefully executed tens of thousands of individual-based simulations. We propose simple relationships for the trade-offs between effective reproduction number (Re), transmission rate, work hours, vaccination, and stay at home restrictions. ResultsFor the WT, it has been found that a 13% increase in vaccination impacts the reproduction number, like the magnitude of decreasing nine hours of work to four and a single day of stay-at-home order. For the delta, 16% vaccination has the same effect. Also, since we can keep track of household and non-household infections, we observed that the change in household transmission rate does not significantly alter the Re. Household infections are not limited by transmission rate due to the high frequency of connections. For COVID-19s specifications, the Re depends on the non-household transmissions rate. ConclusionsVaccination and transmission reduction are almost interchangeable.

Methods based in spatial analysis were applied to a database of over 40,000 licensed venues. Point pattern analysis and spatial autocorrelation methods were used to identify spatially significant venue clusters. Space-time cube and emerging-hot-spot methods were used to explore clusters over time.

It is suggested that excessive immune response in patients with COVID-19 could mimic this syndrome. Some COVID-19 autopsy studies have revealed the presence of haemophagocytosis images in bone marrow, raising the possibility, along with HScore parameters, of sHLH. AIM: Our objective is to ascertain the existence of sHLH in some patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We report the autopsy histological findings of 16 patients with COVID-19, focusing on the presence of haemophagocytosis in bone marrow, obtained from rib squeeze and integrating these findings with HScore parameters. CD68 immunohistochemical stains were used to highlight histiocytes and haemophagocytic cells. Clinical evolution and laboratory parameters of patients were collected from electronic clinical records. RESULTS: Eleven patients (68.7%) displayed moderate histiocytic hyperplasia with haemophagocytosis (HHH) in bone marrow, three patients (18.7%) displayed severe HHH and the remainder were mild. All HScore parameters were collected in 10 patients (62.5%). Among the patients in which all parameters were evaluable, eight patients (80%) had an HScore >169. sHLH was not clinically suspected in any case. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the recommendation of some authors to use the HScore in patients with severe COVID-19 in order to identify those who could benefit from immunosuppressive therapies. The presence of haemophagocytosis in bone marrow tissue, despite not being a specific finding, has proved to be a very useful tool in our study to identify these patients.","output":"Secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in COVID-19: correlation of the autopsy findings of bone marrow haemophagocytosis with HScore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review weighs the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 against the side effects of school closures on physical and mental health, education, and well-being of those affected by the school closures.

In addition, SARS-CoV-2 can infect the testes, potentially affecting testosterone production, as well as having a negative influence on the reproductive potential. Our aim was to review the current concepts of the possible influence of testosterone levels on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in men and to present the available data on the impact of COVID-19 on the structure and function of the testis. Based on the analysis of 72 articles using the MEDLINE database (PubMed), it can be concluded that testosterone is involved in the co-regulation of the synthesis of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 and transmembrane serine protease-2, facilitating the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into target cells and promoting easier infection in men. On the other hand, low testosterone levels increase the risk of cardiopulmonary complications. Hypogonadism appears to be an important unfavorable prognostic factor for the disease. Orchitis is a reported complication of COVID-19. Damage to testicular tissue is possible due to direct invasion by a virus, a secondary autoimmune reaction, hyperthermia and thrombosis of testicular microvessels.

METHODS: Per MDA implementation unit, we collated data on the pre-control distribution of microfilariae (mf) prevalence and the history of control. Next, we predicted trends in infection and morbidity over time using the ONCHOSIM simulation model. DALY estimates were calculated using disability weights from the Global Burden of Disease Study. RESULTS: In 1990, prior to MDA implementation, the total population at risk was 79.8 million with 26.0 million (32.5%) mf-positive individuals, of whom 17.5 million (21.9%) had some form of onchocercal skin or eye disease (2.5 million DALYs lost).

To this effect, the present study aims to analyse the sociodemographic profile of the victims of the particular case of domestic violence that report the incident to the police and to evaluate the spatialCtemporal distribution of these reports. METHODS: Using the data from a database containing the police-reported incidents of domestic violence in Girona in the period 2012C2018, the risk of a police-reported incident was estimated by adjusting the two-part Hurdle model. RESULTS: The risk of reporting incidents of domestic violence to the police is higher in the less deprived areas of the city, and the spatial distribution of these police reports corroborate this finding. Nevertheless, those areas with the greatest socio-economic deprivation were also the ones where there were less police reports filed. Also the prediction of less police reports in the census tract with the highest percentage of the population with an insufficient educational level coincides with the largest number of police reports made by women with a medium and university level education (56.1%) compared with 9.5% of police reports made by women with insufficient schooling.

Among the recruited participants, 10 (25.6%) required ECMO (ICU-ECMO group) and 29 (74.4%) did not have ECMO support (ICU group). Immunological parameters were assessed both at ICU admission and on a daily basis for 7 consecutive days. RESULTS: The absolute lymphocyte count increased significantly in the ICU-ECMO group compared to the ICU group in which it remained relatively stable: ? for the time variable was 127.1 [95% CI 68.9 - 185.3], p < 0.001 and for the interaction term -141.36 [-208.95 - -73.77], p < 0.001. On the other hand, globally, no significant differences were observed over time for the lymphocyte percentage, although it was higher in the ICU patients. Neutrophil counts were overall higher in the ICU-ECMO group (? -4,275.38 [-6,845.21 - 1,705.55], p = 0.001). In regard to neutrophil percentage, a significant decrease over time was reported (? -1.76 [-3.16 - -0.36], p = 0.014), namely in the ICU-ECMO group (? for the interaction 2.09 [0.45 - 3.73], p = 0.013).

Many IDRs interact with nucleic acids and proteins. Annotation of these interactions is supported by computational predictors, but to date, only one tool that predicts interactions with nucleic acids was released, and recent assessments demonstrate that current predictors offer modest levels of accuracy. We have developed DeepDISOBind, an innovative deep multi-task architecture that accurately predicts deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-, ribonucleic acid (RNA)- and protein-binding IDRs from protein sequences. DeepDISOBind relies on an information-rich sequence profile that is processed by an innovative multi-task deep neural network, where subsequent layers are gradually specialized to predict interactions with specific partner types. The common input layer links to a layer that differentiates protein- and nucleic acid-binding, which further links to layers that discriminate between DNA and RNA interactions. Empirical tests show that this multi-task design provides statistically significant gains in predictive quality across the three partner types when compared to a single-task design and a representative selection of the existing methods that cover both disorder- and structure-trained tools. Analysis of the predictions on the human proteome reveals that DeepDISOBind predictions can be encoded into protein-level propensities that accurately predict DNA- and RNA-binding proteins and protein hubs.

We, as the EMERGE (EMErging RheumatoloGists and rEsearchers) group of PReS (Pediatric Rheumatology European Society) analyzed how the pandemic has affected pediatric rheumatology practice. METHODS: An online survey was developed to assess changes in pediatric rheumatology practice due to the pandemic. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: From 70 countries, 493 pediatric rheumatologists (80.3% in pediatric rheumatology practice for &#8805;5 years) responded to the survey. Around 70% disagreed that the pandemic led to reduced prescription of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, conventional synthetic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Almost half were more likely to taper corticosteroids faster. One-fifth hesitated to switch the major immunosuppressant during a flare. Patients encountering difficulties obtaining hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab due to shortages were noted by 192 (38.9%) and 44 (8.9%), respectively. Twenty to 30% indicated that their patients had experienced a flare or delay in diagnosis/intervention due to postponed appointments.53% mentioned use of phone calls/smartphone applications while 47% shifted towards video consultations for patient care. Respondents indicated an increased number of patients with Kawasaki disease (30%), macrophage activation syndrome (15.6%), unusual vasculitic rashes (31.4%), and hyperinflammation (33.5%) during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: This is the largest survey to date addressing changes in pediatric rheumatology practice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary changes were due to delays in clinic appointments, increase in use of virtual technologies, and concerns about the use of immunosuppressive therapies.

Design: Cross-sectional analysis of a healthcare system surveillance program that included asymptomatic clinical (COVID-19 facing and non-COVID-19 facing), and non-clinical HCWs. A convenience sample of asymptomatic community residents (CR) was also tested. Proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs are reported. Proportional trend across HCW categories was tested using Chi Square trend test. Logistic regression model-based likelihood estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs with varying job functions and across different hospitals are reported as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and CI. Setting: Healthcare system comprising one tertiary care academic medical center and six large community hospitals across Greater Houston and a community sample. Participants: 2,872 self-reported asymptomatic adult (> 18 years) HCWs and CRs. Exposure: Clinical HCWs in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units, non-Clinical HCWs, and CRs. Job categories of Nursing, Providers, Allied Health, Support, and Administration / Research. Seven hospitals in the healthcare system. Main Outcomes: Positive reverse transcriptase polymerized chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 Results: Among 2,872 asymptomatic HCWs and CRs, 3.9% (CI: 3.2 - 4.7) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Mean (SD) age was 40.9 (11.7) years and 73% were females. Among COVID-19 facing HCWs 5.4% (CI: 4.5 - 6.5) were positive, whereas 0.6% (CI: 0.2 - 1.7%) of non COVID-19 facing HCWs and none of the non-clinical HCWs or CRs were positive (Ptrend < 0.001). Among COVID-19 facing HCWs, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was similar for all job categories (p = 0.74). However, significant differences in positivity were observed across hospitals. Conclusions and Relevance: Asymptomatic HCWs with COVID-19 patient exposure had a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 positive testing than those not routinely exposed to COVID-19 patients and those not engaged in patient care. Among HCWs with routine COVID-19 exposure, all job types had relatively similar infection rates. These data can inform hospital surveillance and infection control practices for patient-facing job classifications and suggest that general environmental exposure within hospitals is not a significant source of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic healthcare workers in greater Houston: a cross-sectional analysis of surveillance data from a large healthcare system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Limited data are available on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We examined the clinical features and outcomes of 190 patients treated with ECMO within 14 days of ICU admission, using data from a multicenter cohort study of 5122 critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to 68 hospitals across the United States. To estimate the effect of ECMO on mortality, we emulated a target trial of ECMO receipt versus no ECMO receipt within 7 days of ICU admission among mechanically ventilated patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 < 100). Patients were followed until hospital discharge, death, or a minimum of 60 days. We adjusted for confounding using a multivariable Cox model. RESULTS: Among the 190 patients treated with ECMO, the median age was 49 years (IQR 41-58), 137 (72.1%) were men, and the median PaO2/FiO2 prior to ECMO initiation was 72 (IQR 61-90). At 60 days, 63 patients (33.2%) had died, 94 (49.5%) were discharged, and 33 (17.4%) remained hospitalized. Among the 1297 patients eligible for the target trial emulation, 45 of the 130 (34.6%) who received ECMO died, and 553 of the 1167 (47.4%) who did not receive ECMO died. In the primary analysis, patients who received ECMO had lower mortality than those who did not (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.41-0.74).

Objectives To describe disease severity and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnancy across Washington State including pregnancy complications and outcomes, hospitalization, and case fatality. Study Design Pregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1 and June 30, 2020 were identified in a multi-center retrospective cohort study from 35 sites in Washington State. Sites captured 61% of annual state deliveries. Case fatality rates in pregnancy were compared to COVID-19 fatality rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State using rate ratios and rate differences. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared by trimester of infection and disease severity at the time of delivery. Results The principal study findings were: 1) among 240 pregnant patients in Washington State with SARS-CoV-2 infections, 1 in 11 developed severe or critical disease, 1 in 10 were hospitalized for COVID-19, and 1 in 80 died; 2) the COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate was 3.5-fold higher than in similarly-aged adults in Washington State [10.0% vs. 2.8%; rate ratio (RR) 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-5.3]; 3) pregnant patients hospitalized for a respiratory concern were more likely to have a comorbidity or underlying conditions including asthma, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease, and Class III obesity; 4) three maternal deaths (1.3%) were attributed to COVID-19 for a maternal mortality rate of 1,250/100,000 pregnancies (95%CI 257-3,653); 5) the COVID-19 case fatality in pregnancy was a significant 13.6-fold (95%CI 2.7-43.6) higher in pregnant patients compared to similarly aged individuals in Washington State with an absolute difference in mortality rate of 1.2% (95%CI -0.3-2.6); and 6) preterm birth was significantly higher among women with severe/critical COVID-19 at delivery than for women who had recovered from COVID-19 (45.4% severe/critical COVID-19 vs. 5.2% mild COVID-19, p<0.001). Conclusions COVID-19 hospitalization and case fatality rates in pregnant patients were significantly higher compared to similarly aged adults in Washington State.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison of national surveys. PARTICIPANTS: Participants in: 2016 American Community Survey, the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the 2016 National Health Interview Survey, the 1999-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health. METHODS: We estimated VI and blindness prevalence rates and confidence intervals for each survey measure and age-group using the Clopper-Pearson method. We then estimated weighted self-reported VI and blindness prevalence rates across survey measures by age-group using inverse variance weighting, fitted trend lines to age-group estimates, and used the trend-line equations to estimate the number of U.S. persons with VI and blindness in 2016. We compared these self-report estimates to those generated from NHANES physical evaluations of presenting VI and blindness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The variability of prevalence estimates of VI and blindness RESULTS: Survey response estimates of blindness varied between 0.1% and 5.6% for age-groups <65 years and between 0.6% to 16.6% for ages >=65. Estimates of VI varied between 1.6% and 24.8% for age-groups <65 years and between 2.2% and 26.6% for age-groups >=65. For summarized survey results and NHANES physical evaluation, prevalence rates for VI increased significantly with age-group. Blindness prevalence increased significantly with age-group for summarized survey responses but not for NHANES physical examination. Based on extrapolations of NHANES physical examination data to all ages, we estimated that in 2016, 23.4 million persons in the U.S. (7.2%) had VI or blindness, an evaluated visual acuity of 20/40 or worse in the better-seeing eye before correction; based on weighted self-reported surveys, we estimated 24.8 million persons (7.7%) had presenting VI or blindness.

In this paper, we describe the discovery of a novel non-covalent small-molecule inhibitor, MCULE-5948770040, that binds to and inhibits the SARS-Cov-2 main protease (Mpro) by employing a scalable high throughput virtual screening (HTVS) framework and a targeted compound library of over 6.5 million molecules that could be readily ordered and purchased. Our HTVS framework leverages the U.S. supercomputing infrastructure achieving nearly 91% resource utilization and nearly 126 million docking calculations per hour. Downstream biochemical assays validate this Mpro inhibitor with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 2.9  M [95% CI 2.2, 4.0]. Further, using room-temperature X-ray crystallography, we show that MCULE-5948770040 binds to a cleft in the primary binding site of Mpro forming stable hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. We then used multiple s-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and machine learning (ML) techniques to elucidate how the bound ligand alters the conformational states accessed by Mpro, involving motions both proximal and distal to the binding site. Together, our results demonstrate how MCULE-5948770040 inhibits Mpro and offers a springboard for further therapeutic design.","output":"High Throughput Virtual Screening and Validation of a SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Non-Covalent Inhibitor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the time of writing, the world population is suffering from more than 10,000 registered COVID-19 disease epidemic induced deaths since the outbreak of the Corona virus more than three months ago now officially known as SARS-CoV-2. Since, tremendous efforts have been made worldwide to counter-steer and control the epidemic by now labelled as pandemic. In this contribution, we provide an overview on the potential for computer audition (CA), i.e., the usage of speech and sound analysis by artificial intelligence to help in this scenario. We first survey which types of related or contextually significant phenomena can be automatically assessed from speech or sound. These include the automatic recognition and monitoring of breathing, dry and wet coughing or sneezing sounds, speech under cold, eating behaviour, sleepiness, or pain to name but a few. Then, we consider potential use-cases for exploitation. These include risk assessment and diagnosis based on symptom histograms and their development over time, as well as monitoring of spread, social distancing and its effects, treatment and recovery, and patient wellbeing. We quickly guide further through challenges that need to be faced for real-life usage. We come to the conclusion that CA appears ready for implementation of (pre-)diagnosis and monitoring tools, and more generally provides rich and significant, yet so far untapped potential in the fight against COVID-19 spread.","output":"COVID-19 and Computer Audition: An Overview on What Speech&Sound Analysis Could Contribute in the SARS-CoV-2 Corona Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In attempts to control the spread of the Covid-19 virus, many governments have resorted to imposing national lockdowns on their citizens. Previous research has demonstrated the passage of time becomes distorted for many people during these lockdowns. To date, research has only examined how time was experienced early in initial lockdowns. The current study examined whether distortions to the passage of time were also present later into the global pandemic. An online questionnaire was used to collect passage of time judgments for the day, week and 8 month period since the first UK lockdown. In addition, measures of affect, social satisfaction, task-load, compliance and health status were also recorded. The results show that over 80% of people reported experiencing distortion to the passage of time during the second English lockdown in comparison with normal. Depression, satisfaction with social interaction and shielding status were found to be significant predictors of temporal distortion. A slower passage of time was associated with greater depression, shielding and greater dissatisfaction with social interactions. Feeling like it was longer than 8 months since the UK's first lockdown was associated with greater depression, increased dissatisfaction with social interaction and greater change of life as a result of lockdown. The results suggest that distortions to the passage of time are an enduring feature of lockdown life and that different factors predict temporal experience during different points in lockdown.","output":"Distortions to the passage of time during England's second national lockdown: A role for depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To measure the awareness of COVID-19 infection among the general population following the outbreak in China. METHODS This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out during January and February 2020 amongst the general population of Karachi, Pakistan. A pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire was used among 399 young adult participants. The questionnaire was developed keeping in view of the already published study on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the available literature on COVID-19. It included sociodemographic information, assessment of knowledge, beliefs regarding coronavirus and the perception of precautionary measures taken by an individual. Chi-square test was used for categorical variables and p<0.05 was used as statistically significant. RESULTS There were more females 299 (75%) than male participants 100 (25%). The mean age was 20.9 2.30 years and 232 (58%) had graduate degrees. There is lack of knowledge and awareness about coronavirus as 226 (56.6%) participants claimed that coronavirus is actually the most dangerous virus in the world, and 171 (43%) did know that the common flu virus is potentially more lethal than coronavirus. Although a large majority of participants correctly identified sources of transmission, measures and precautions to be taken for coronavirus, their knowledge for symptom identification was deficient. The most pursued platform for information for coronavirus was found to be social media, followed by television and print media.

Our hypothesis is that generalized OA is another facet of the metabolic syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical ethical review board of our institution approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to the study. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the knee were obtained in 42 patients who had been diagnosed with generalized OA at multiple joint sites. Another 27 MR images of the knee were obtained from a matched normal (non-OA) reference population. Vessel wall thickness of the popliteal artery was quantitatively measured by dedicated software. Linear regression models were used to investigate the association between vessel wall thickness and generalized OA. Adjustments were made for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Confidence intervals (CI) were computed at the 95% level and a significance level of  = 0.05 was used. RESULTS: Patients in the generalized OA population had a significant higher average vessel wall thickness than persons from the normal reference population (p  ), even when correction was made for sex, age, and BMI. The average vessel wall thickness of the popliteal artery was 1.09 mm in patients with generalized OA, and 0.96 mm in the matched normal reference population.

Rainfall-induced wetting can alter the content and composition of soil DOM. However, conventional methods commonly used to extract DOM from soils involve air- or oven-drying followed by extraction with water, and the results vary considerably in terms of indexes used. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the variation in DOM content and composition of soil gravity water and capillary water during wetting, and establish a better method to obtain real soil DOM information. Following simulated rainfall (50 mm h-1, 0-24 h), gravity water and capillary water in fresh soil samples were separated using a high-speed refrigerated centrifuge. Additionally, DOM in dried soil samples was extracted using various soil/water ratios after drying by different methods. The DOM data obtained by conventional methods were compared with capillary water data. The results showed that DOM degradation occurred mainly in capillary water close to the surface of soil particles. Among the six fluorescent components of DOM identified, a tryptophan-like component (Ex/Em = 295/335 nm and 230/335 nm) was possibly derived from terrestrial plants, and a tyrosine-like component (Ex/Em = 265/305 nm) was likely derived from microbial secretion. Except for little variation in the fluorescence index, dissolved organic carbon concentrations in capillary water were double those in dried soil extracted by conventional methods. The humification index and spectral slope ratio of DOM extracted by conventional methods also markedly varied, and no clear patterns were observed for the variation in specific UV absorbance at 254 nm. These findings allow real information to be obtained regarding soil DOM during wetting, and better selection of the extraction method and indexes when studying soil DOM.","output":"Variation in the content and fluorescent composition of dissolved organic matter in soil water during rainfall-induced wetting and extract of dried soil."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated disease it causes, COVID-19, have caused unprecedented social disruption.

MethodsMVP participants were examined for an association between the incidence or severity of COVID-19 and the presence of a MUC5B rs35705950-T allele. Comorbidities and clinical events were extracted from the electronic health records (EHR). The analysis was performed within each ancestry group in the MVP, adjusting for sex, age, age2, and first twenty principal components followed by a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. We then pursued replication and performed a meta-analysis with the trans-ethnic summary statistics from the HGI.

During the current pandemic, a high index of suspicion should be maintained to ensure that care is not compromised. A review of the management of patients with suspected parathyroid carcinoma during the COVID-19 pandemic is presented. METHOD: In our tertiary referral centre for Endocrine surgery, 4 presentations of parathyroid cancer were reviewed. Their investigations, surgical management and post-operative outcomes are described with a brief literature review of parathyroid cancer. RESULTS: Of the four cases of parathyroid carcinoma described, all presented with severe hypercalcaemia and significantly raised PTH levels.

The International Farm Comparison Network (IFCN) Farm Simulation Approach and Technology Impact Policy Impact Calculations (TIPICAL) model was used considering with Corona (WC) and without Corona (WOC). The Integrated Dairy Research Network (IDRN) database (January 2019 to July 2020) was used for simulation of IFCN two typical farms. The milk price is decreased by 17% and feed price is increased by 3.7% due to COVID-19 in March which was used as the base for farm simulation. This resulted in a decrease in milk yield by 7.9% and 8.9% for small household and family farms, respectively. The cost of milk production increased by 19.10% and 10.9% for household and family farms, respectively. This has an overall negative impact on farm income which accounted for national economic loss from dairy farms in Bangladesh to 4.43 million USD/day (36.84 crore BDT). This loss has been fluctuated from April onward and was higher in June (3.83 million USD/day) due to a combination of COVID-19, flood, and seasonality effect on lowering milk production. At the same time, the farmers' response to the resilience capacity (liquidity, operating profit margin, and financial performance) to combat COVID-19-induced situation has been declined substantially. Based on this, we conclude that the government might take a strategy to support farmers by providing financial support for increasing the operating capital and decreasing the cost of milk production.

Mental health presentations are an increasing part of the paediatric caseload and there is growing evidence that paediatric trainees feel ill-equipped to manage these patients. Equally CAMHS trainees reported they required greater access to seeing children under 5, assessing development and physical health. Only 33% of trainees we surveyed felt that their current training programme enabled them to achieve their curriculum requirements in paediatrics or mental health respectively.ObjectivesWe developed the concept of Thinking Together, to tackle this training gap. The scheme involves pairing paediatric and CAMHS trainees to share clinical encounters to foster a joint way of learning and working together, coming together to look at how we can link training to optimise patient care. CAMHS services are increasingly stretched, raising referral thresholds and making the need for closer working together across disciplines paramount.MethodsA pilot was launched in March 2016 where 30 trainees from CAMHS and Paediatrics were paired for a period of 6 months, attending at least two clinical encounters in each setting. Trainees were encouraged to explore a variety of learning possibilities, including clinics, referral meetings and signposting their partner to other relevant clinical opportunities.In 2018 we extended the scheme in a second phase pilot to four centres across the UK. Feedback from participants involved was equally positive but there were logistical challenges. We reflected on feedback from the initial and second phase pilot and adapted the programme in 2019/2020. We aimed to consolidate the scheme in one centre and include workshops, which allowed focus on a topic relevant to both specialties, in addition to a forum for debrief discussions on challenging cases.ResultsPrior to participating in Thinking Together, 70% stated they had no experience of working in a jointly delivered paediatric/mental health clinic. 93% of participants felt that their patients benefitted from access to jointly delivered clinics. Feedback was very positive and identified that the scheme met training gaps for both specialties. Th adapted version of Thinking Together that we rolled out in 2019C2020 was also met with positive feedback and proved to be particularly beneficial during the pandemic, when trainee pairs could still participate in Thinking Together via virtual workshops.ConclusionsCovid has clearly brought challenges to every aspect of our lives but this is a training model that has been able to adapt in this unprecedented time, by means of virtual workshops and the enthusiasm of the participants to continue to pursue learning opportunities, including joining referral meetings remotely. Thinking Together has evolved into a successful model that we would like to embed in everyday practice.","output":"Taking thinking together forward: a scheme linking paediatric and CAMHS trainees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This research examines how patient experience is affected by various generational cohorts perceived ease of use and usefulness of healthcare patient portals and how this experience, in turn, shapes cohort technology use.

Currently, a method to simultaneously diagnose the seven known types human coronaviruses remains lacking and is urgently needed. In this work, we successfully developed a portable microfluidic system for the rapid, accurate, and simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV, middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2, and four other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. The disk-like microfluidic platform integrated with loop-mediated isothermal amplification provides highly accurate, sensitive, and specific results with a wide linear range within 40 min. The diagnostic tool achieved 100% consistency with the gold standard polymerase chain reaction in detecting 54 real clinical samples.

However, it has not yet been used to measure the absorption and recovery capacities of a river subject to varying levels of pollution due to natural and anthropic sources of contamination within the basin. Fast worldwide population growth and climate change are contributing to an increased degradation status in surface water bodies and to a decreased efficiency of their natural self-purification processes. Decision-makers are, therefore, more and more encouraged to implement alternative management strategies focussed on improving the system resilience to current and future perturbations. To this end, a novel Water Resilience Index (WRI), based on different quality parameters, was developed, and it is here proposed to estimate the ability of the river Bacchiglione, located in Northeast Italy, absorb continuous and unpredictable changes due to potential effects of point sources of pollution, that is, urban and industrial wastewater, and still maintain its vital functions. This new index is integrated in a mathematical model, which represents the river as an influence diagram where the nodes are the gauged stations and the arcs are the fluvial reaches among the stations, to identify the river reaches in need of resilience improvement. In addition, in order to simplify the analytical procedure and lower the costs and times of the monitoring activities, a principal component analysis is also used, as it is able to reduce the number of the water quality parameters to be collected from the sampling stations, distributed along the main river, and thus to calculate a minimum WRI. The good agreement between the results obtained by both the original and minimum WRI shows the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. This approach could be applied to all basins with the same issues, and not just in the Italian case study here analysed, as it might be a valid tool to plan interventions and mitigation actions, protecting the resource from pollution risks and achieving environmental quality and Sustainable Development Goals both in the water bodies and their surrounding territories. In addition, this strategy could be integrated in the existing models supporting local decision-makers and administrators, aiming at increasing the resilience of urban and rural areas to pollution phenomena and facilitating the development of effective policies to reduce the impacts of global change on water quality.

Population-level effects of COVID-19 on patients with ESKD in the United States are uncertain. METHODS: We identified patients with ESKD from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data during epidemiologic weeks 3-27 of 2017-2020 and corresponding weeks of 2017-2019, stratifying them by kidney replacement therapy. Outcomes comprised hospitalization for COVID-19, all-cause death, and hospitalization for reasons other than COVID-19. We estimated adjusted relative rates (ARRs) of death and non-COVID-19 hospitalization during epidemiologic weeks 13-27 of 2020 (March 22 to July 4) versus corresponding weeks in 2017-2019. RESULTS: Among patients on dialysis, the rate of COVID-19 hospitalization peaked between March 22 and April 25 2020. Non-Hispanic Black race and Hispanic ethnicity associated with higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalization, whereas peritoneal dialysis was associated with lower rates. During weeks 13-27, ARRs of death in 2020 versus 2017-2019 were 1.17 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.16 to 1.19) and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.24 to 1.36) among patients undergoing dialysis or with a functioning transplant, respectively. Excess mortality was higher among non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients. Among patients on dialysis, the rate of non-COVID-19 hospitalization during weeks 13-27 in 2020 was 17% lower versus hospitalization rates for corresponding weeks in 2017-2019. CONCLUSIONS: During the first half of 2020, the clinical outcomes of patients with ESKD were greatly affected by COVID-19, and racial and ethnic disparities were apparent.

National analyses have demonstrated changes in mortality rates for most age groups and causes of death, and with deprived populations most affected. The aims here were to establish whether similar changes have occurred across different parts of the UK (countries, cities), and to examine cause-specific trends in more detail. DESIGN: Population-based trend analysis. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Whole populations of countries and selected cities of the UK. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: European age-standardised mortality rates (calculated by cause of death, country, city, year (1981C2017), age group, sex andfor all countries and Scottish citiesdeprivation quintiles); changes in rates between 5-year periods; summary measures of both relative (relative index of inequality) and absolute (slope index of inequality) inequalities. RESULTS: Changes in mortality from around 2011/2013 were observed throughout the UK for all adult age groups. For example, all-age female rates decreased by approximately 4%C6% during the 1980s and 1990s, approximately 7%C9% during the 2000s, but by <1% between 2011/2013 and 2015/2017. Equivalent figures for men were 4%C7%, 8%C12% and 1%C3%, respectively. This later period saw increased mortality among the most deprived populations, something observed in all countries and cities analysed, and for most causes of death: absolute and relative inequalities therefore increased. Although similar trends were seen across all parts of the UK, particular issues apply in Scotland, for example, higher and increasing drug-related mortality (with the highest rates observed in Dundee and Glasgow). CONCLUSIONS: The study presents further evidence of changing mortality in the UK. The timing, geography and socioeconomic gradients associated with the changes appear to support suggestions that they may result, at least in part, from UK Government austerity measures which have disproportionately affected the poorest.","output":"Changing mortality trends in countries and cities of the UK: a population-based trend analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Google Trends data are an efficient source for analysing internet search behaviour and providing valuable insights into community dynamics and health-related problems. In this article, we aimed to evaluate if Google Trends data could help monitor the COVID-19 vaccination trend over time and if the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines modified the interest of pregnant women in vaccination. Data related to Google internet searches and the number of vaccine doses administered in Italy were used. We found moderate to strong correlations between search volumes of vaccine-related terms and the number of vaccines administered. In particular, a model based on Google Trends with a 3-week lag showed the best performance in fitting the number of COVID-19 vaccinations over time. We also observed that the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines affected the search interest for the argument vaccination in pregnancy both quantitatively and qualitatively. There was a significant increase in the search interest after the launch of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy.

However, little is known about social mixing patterns in these populations. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional social contact survey among internally displaced people (IDP) living in Digaale, a permanent IDP camp in Somaliland. We included questions on household demographics, shelter quality, crowding, travel frequency, health status, and recent diagnosis of pneumonia, and assessed anthropometric status in children. We calculated age-standardised social contact matrices to assess population mixing, and conducted regression analysis on risk factors for recent self-reported pneumonia. Results We found crowded households with high proportions of recent self-reported pneumonia (46% in children). 20% of children younger than five are stunted, and crude death rates are high in all age groups. ARI risk factors are common, but we did not find any significant associations with self-reported pneumonia. Participants reported around 10 direct contacts per day. Social contact patterns are assortative by age, and physical contact rates are very high (78%). Conclusions ARI risk factors are very common in this population, while the large degree of contacts that involve physical touch could further increase transmission. Such IDP settings potentially present a perfect storm of risk factors for ARIs and their transmission, and innovative approaches to address such risks are urgently needed.","output":"Social contacts and other risk factors for respiratory infections among internally displaced people in Somaliland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food insecurity is a major social determinant of health affecting more than 10% of Americans.

The authors carried out conceptual theoretical debates to situate the covid-19 pandemic as a disaster associated with the contemporary way of life present in the urbanization process of cities. In moments of intense environmental change, such as the dystopian scenario represented by the advent of COVID-19, the more daily life is reconstituted at the confluence between the local and the global, the more individuals suffer, develop fears, and are challenged to develop survival strategies. Thus, subjectivity is more than a consequence of the pandemic disaster, it is conceptualized as a transformative potential - a dynamic continuum - expanding its scope as a perspective for action facing disaster.

Conclusions At present, there are significant knowledge gaps regarding the short and long-term impacts of COVID-19 on PWA and their caregivers. It is crucial that different stakeholders be sensitive and flexible when addressing the psychosocial and rehabilitation needs of PWA to mitigate the negative effects during and after the COVID-19 era.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Speakers With Aphasia: What Is Currently Known and Missing?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The monoclonal-antibody combination AZD7442 is composed of tixagevimab and cilgavimab, two neutralizing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that have an extended half-life and have been shown to have prophylactic and therapeutic effects in animal models. Pharmacokinetic data in humans indicate that AZD7442 has an extended half-life of approximately 90 days. METHODS: In an ongoing phase 3 trial, we enrolled adults (18 years of age) who had an increased risk of an inadequate response to vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), an increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, or both. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single dose (two consecutive intramuscular injections, one containing tixagevimab and the other containing cilgavimab) of either 300 mg of AZD7442 or saline placebo, and they were followed for up to 183 days in the primary analysis. The primary safety end point was the incidence of adverse events after a single dose of AZD7442. The primary efficacy end point was symptomatic Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by means of reverse-transcriptaseCpolymerase-chain-reaction assay) occurring after administration of AZD7442 or placebo and on or before day 183. RESULTS: A total of 5197 participants underwent randomization and received one dose of AZD7442 or placebo (3460 in the AZD7442 group and 1737 in the placebo group). The primary analysis was conducted after 30% of the participants had become aware of their randomized assignment. In total, 1221 of 3461 participants (35.3%) in the AZD7442 group and 593 of 1736 participants (34.2%) in the placebo group reported having at least one adverse event, most of which were mild or moderate in severity. Symptomatic Covid-19 occurred in 8 of 3441 participants (0.2%) in the AZD7442 group and in 17 of 1731 participants (1.0%) in the placebo group (relative risk reduction, 76.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 46.0 to 90.0; P<0.001); extended follow-up at a median of 6 months showed a relative risk reduction of 82.8% (95% CI, 65.8 to 91.4).

The superiority of this approach is demonstrated with fluorescence signals from a chip-based, optofluidic single particle sensor. The technique is more accurate than simple peak-finding algorithms and several orders of magnitude faster than existing CWT methods, allowing for real-time data analysis during sensing for the first time. Performance is further increased by applying a custom wavelet to multi-peak signals as demonstrated using amplification-free detection of single bacterial DNAs. A 4x increase in detection rate, a 6x improved error rate, and the ability for extraction of experimental parameters are demonstrated. This cluster-based CWT analysis will enable high-performance, real-time sensing when signal-to-noise is hardware limited, for instance with low-cost sensors in point of care environments.","output":"Fast custom wavelet analysis technique for single molecule detection and identification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance The dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmissibility are yet to be fully understood. Better understanding of the transmission dynamics is important for the development and evaluation of effective control policies. Objective To delineate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and evaluate the transmission risk at different exposure window periods before and after symptom onset. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective case-ascertained study in Taiwan included laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their contacts. The study period was from January 15 to March 18, 2020. All close contacts were quarantined at home for 14 days after their last exposure to the index case. During the quarantine period, any relevant symptoms (fever, cough, or other respiratory symptoms) of contacts triggered a COVID-19 test. The final follow-up date was April 2, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases only) for different exposure time windows of the index cases and for different exposure settings (such as household, family, and health care). Results We enrolled 100 confirmed patients, with a median age of 44 years (range, 11-88 years), including 56 men and 44 women. Among their 2761 close contacts, there were 22 paired index-secondary cases. The overall secondary clinical attack rate was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.0%). The attack rate was higher among the 1818 contacts whose exposure to index cases started within 5 days of symptom onset (1.0% [95% CI, 0.6%-1.6%]) compared with those who were exposed later (0 cases from 852 contacts; 95% CI, 0%-0.4%). The 299 contacts with exclusive presymptomatic exposures were also at risk (attack rate, 0.7% [95% CI, 0.2%-2.4%]).

The aim of this statement is to outline the profiles of the medical legal liability, with a focus on the figure of the vaccinating physician, in criminal, civil, and disciplinary terms, based on the Italian legislation in force. The vaccinating doctor responds for his work in the field of vaccination in the same way as any other health service should perform (diagnostic, therapeutic, etc.). Helpful in this context is the adoption of the L. 76/2021; it was developed to find a balance between safeguarding the person privacy and greater guarantees for the doctor. This law introduces a criminal shield that can put a limit to litigation, curbing the phenomenon of so-called defensive medicine. The climate of uncertainty and fear of legal repercussions for the doctors, and the constant updating and redefinition of the indications of operability in the vaccination campaigns, underline the need to focus on the knowledge of the responsibilities and the safeguard of the vaccinating doctors.

Notably, the lagging period between the change point of effluent residual chlorine and the change points of COD and ammonia concentration coincided with a period in which there was a deficiency in local medical resources. In addition, the diurnal behavior of effluents from designated hospitals has varied significantly at different stages of the pandemic development. The effluent ammonia peaks shifted from daytime to nighttime after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting a high workload of the designated hospitals in fighting the rapidly emerging pandemic.

Although Ghana did not record (and is yet to) any case, and several health workers have received numerous training schemes, there is no record of any study that assessed preparedness of healthcare workers (HCWS) regarding EVD and any emergency prone disease in Ghana. We therefore conducted a hospital based cross sectional study involving 101 HCWs from two facilities in Kumasi, Ghana to assess the level of preparedness of HCWs to respond to any possible EVD. METHODS: We administered a face-to-face questionnaire using an adapted WHO (2015) and CDC (2014) Checklist for Ebola Preparedness and assessed overall knowledge gaps, and preparedness of the Ghanaian HCWs in selected health facilities of the Ashanti Region of Ghana from October to December 2015. RESULTS: A total 92 (91.09%) HCWs indicated they were not adequately trained to handle an EVD suspected case. Only 25.74% (n = 26) considered their facilities sufficiently equipped to handle and manage EVD patients. When asked which disinfectant to use after attending to and caring for a suspected patient with EVD, only 8.91% (n = 9) could correctly identify the right disinfectant ((2) = 28.52, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates poor knowledge and ill preparedness and unwillingness of many HCWs to attend to EVD.

Despite a global pandemic, there is a paucity of data on mechanisms of high morbidity and mortality. Studies have shown that patients are at risk of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease leading to increased mortality. We present a case of new-onset heart failure, who was found to have thrombus in transit with bilateral pulmonary embolism. Case: A 63-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and diabetes presented with bilateral lower extremity swelling for two weeks. She noticed that her legs are getting puffier and during this time, she gained about 15 pounds as well. She also complained of shortness of breath, which was exertional in nature and gradually progressed to dyspnea at rest. She otherwise denied any chest pain, palpitations, cough, runny nose, or loss of sense of taste or smell. She did not travel anywhere prior to the presentation, neither had any sick contacts. She was admitted for heart failure exacerbation and an initial transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% with global hypokinesis. She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for cardiogenic shock with suspected cardio-renal syndrome, and hence diuretics were held. Over the next three days, her kidney function worsened and a repeat TTE was performed which revealed a cord-like structure in the right atrium (Figure 1) extending from inferior vena cava (IVC), a dilated right ventricle, and elevated right ventricular systolic pressure at 50mmHg. A venous Doppler ultrasound of the legs revealed acute deep venous thrombosis of the left popliteal vein all the way up to her IVC. Because of the significant clot burden, thrombocytopenia, and hypoxemia she was tested for COVID-19, which resulted positive. She also had a lung perfusion scan which revealed a high probability for acute pulmonary embolism. She was started on full-dose anticoagulation with heparin and with improvement in her kidney function was eventually transitioned to enoxaparin at discharge. Discussion: This case highlights the hypercoagulable states in COVID-19 and its related complications. It not only calls attention to thromboembolic causes of hypoxemia in COVID-19 but also demonstrates the important diagnostic utility of an echocardiogram and the therapeutic role of anticoagulation. Early diagnosis by keeping a high index of suspicion and prompt treatment is vital to avoid adverse outcomes and increased mortality.","output":"Thrombus in transit: A case of extensive thrombosis secondary to coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a study on how to effectively reduce the dimensions of the $k$-means clustering problem, so that provably accurate approximations are obtained.

As trainees they receive tuition on how to work swiftly to meet them efficiently. But despite the prominent role of time pressure, its effects on the translation process are still scarcely researched. Studies point to the higher occurrence of errors under stringent time constraints. Most of these studies use key-logging or eye-tracking techniques to identify the problems encountered. But no attempt has yet been made to measure the physiological effects of time pressure in English-to-Spanish translation and their interplay with trainees psychological state. The present study researches the influence of time pressure on translation by exploring trainees physiological response (i.e., salivary cortisol) and psychological traits (i.e., self-esteem and anxiety). 33 Spanish translation trainees translated 3 English literary texts under different time pressure conditions: Text 1 (no time limit), Text 2 (10 minutes), Text 3 (5 minutes). Regression analysis results showed that higher cortisol levels during preparation predicted higher number of meaning errors in Text 1 and lower number of translated words in Text 2 and 3. Besides, higher trait anxiety emerged as predictor of lower number of translated words, but higher accuracy under extreme time constraints and in the absence of time pressure. Higher self-esteem correlated with lower levels of anxiety and lower levels of cortisol during preparation and recovery, suggesting that it may act as a protective factor against stress. And yet, the regression analysis showed that higher self-esteem predicted lower meaning and total accuracy under extreme time pressure. Besides, in our correlation analysis self-esteem was positively related to the number of translated words in Text 2 and 3. Results suggest that even if self-esteem could be a protective factor against stress, it may also have a negative effect on task performance mediated by overconfidence.","output":"The influence of time pressure on translation trainees performance: Testing the relationship between self-esteem, salivary cortisol and subjective stress response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected the mental health of individuals due to severe changes in their normal life routines. These changes might give rise to stress-induced factors and result in developing maladaptive behaviors. Therefore, the present study tested an explorative sequential mediation model regarding the COVID-19 pandemic as a global natural experiment and hypothesized that fear and depression would be serial mediators of the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and emotional eating. An online cross-sectional survey with convenience sampling was adopted. A total of 362 participants were recruited from Turkey, and each completed a battery of demographic questions and psychometric scales. The standardized instruments used to test the models constructs were the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R21. The model was tested using a bootstrapping method utilizing IBM AMOS 24 software. Results showed that emotional eating was positively associated with intolerance of uncertainty, fear of COVID-19, and depression. Moreover, fear of COVID-19 had positive correlation with intolerance of uncertainty and depression. Significant negative association was also found between age and intolerance of uncertainty. In addition, females significantly reported higher levels of emotional eating and fear of COVID-19 than males. The studys hypothesized sequential mediation model was further supported. It is concluded that depression most likely developed by fear was triggered by intolerance of uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic and leading to emotional eating. The study is significant because it advances theories of emotional eating with an investigation examining some of its underlying mechanisms. Also, it is one of a few research studies highlighting to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic-related cognitions and emotions are associated with maladaptive behaviors in the case of emotional eating.","output":"The Mediating Effects of Fear of COVID-19 and Depression on the Association Between Intolerance of Uncertainty and Emotional Eating During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe authors explore the ways work-based learning (WBL) can help degree apprentices cross the gaps between the workplace and the classroom, arguing that problem-based learning allows them to become aware of the overlaps in skills required to succeed between the two sites of learning.Design/methodology/approachThis case study of a self-managed learning module uses a workshop methodology to understand the ways 61 undergraduate business management apprentices in the UK navigate the boundaries between work and learning and develop skills across both domains.FindingsThe authors' findings suggest that degree apprentices do not always perceive the two sites as overlapping in terms of what skills are required and how learning takes place.

However, there is conflicting evidence over whether this effect differs between minority groups and limited investigation into other moderators. AIMS: To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the group density effect in psychosis and examine moderators. METHOD: Four databases were systematically searched. A narrative review was conducted and a three-level meta-analysis was performed. The potential moderating effect of crudely and specifically defined minority groups was assessed. Country, time, area size and whether studies used clinical or non-clinical outcomes were also tested as moderators. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies were included in the narrative review and ten in the meta-analysis. A 10 percentage-point decrease in own-group density was associated with a 20% increase in psychosis risk (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.09?1.32, P < 0.001). This was moderated by crudely defined minority groups (F(6,68) = 6.86, P < 0.001), with the strongest associations observed in Black populations, followed by a White Other sample.

The majority of respondents with a medical condition was worried about their current health state due to the pandemic (53%) vs (63%), respectively. Respondents experienced postponed/cancelled care (26%) and were concerned about the availability of medication (32%) for both countries. Productivity losses due to the COVID-19 restrictions were calculated in absenteeism (36%) and presenteeism (30%) for Belgium, and (19%) and (35%) for the Netherlands. Most concerns and productivity losses were reported by respondents with children < 12 years, respondents aged 18C35 and respondents with an (expected) COVID-19 infection.

Cannabidiol (CBD) has anxiolytic and antidepressant properties and may be capable of reducing emotional exhaustion and burnout symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of CBD therapy for the reduction of emotional exhaustion and burnout symptoms among frontline health care professionals working with patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective open-label single-site randomized clinical trial used a 1:1 block randomization design to examine emotional exhaustion and burnout symptoms among frontline health care professionals (physicians, nurses, and physical therapists) working with patients with COVID-19 at the Ribeir?o Preto Medical School University Hospital in S?o Paulo, Brazil. Participants were enrolled between June 12 and November 12, 2020. A total of 214 health care professionals were recruited and assessed for eligibility, and 120 participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio by a researcher who was not directly involved with data collection. INTERVENTIONS: Cannabidiol, 300 mg (150 mg twice per day), plus standard care or standard care alone for 28 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was emotional exhaustion and burnout symptoms, which were assessed for 28 days using the emotional exhaustion subscale of the Brazilian version of the Maslach Burnout InventoryCHuman Services Survey for Medical Personnel. RESULTS: A total of 120 participants were randomized to receive either CBD, 300 mg, plus standard care (treatment arm; n = 61) or standard care alone (control arm; n = 59) for 28 days. Of those, 118 participants (59 participants in each arm; 79 women [66.9%]; mean age, 33.6 years [95% CI, 32.3-34.9 years]) received the intervention and were included in the efficacy analysis. In the treatment arm, scores on the emotional exhaustion subscale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory significantly decreased at day 14 (mean difference, 4.14 points; 95% CI, 1.47-6.80 points; partial eta squared [(p)(2)] = 0.08), day 21 (mean difference, 4.34 points; 95% CI, 0.94-7.73 points; (p)(2) = 0.05), and day 28 (mean difference, 4.01 points; 95% CI, 0.43-7.59 points; (p)(2) = 0.04). However, 5 participants, all of whom were in the treatment group, experienced serious adverse events: 4 cases of elevated liver enzymes (1 critical and 3 mild, with the mild elevations reported at the final 28-day assessment) and 1 case of severe pharmacodermia. In 2 of those cases (1 with critical elevation of liver enzymes and 1 with severe pharmacodermia), CBD therapy was discontinued, and the participants had a full recovery. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, CBD therapy reduced symptoms of burnout and emotional exhaustion among health care professionals working with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is necessary to balance the benefits of CBD therapy with potential undesired or adverse effects. Future double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm the present findings.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created unprecedented barriers for breastfeeding mothers to obtain various types of support: emotional, instrumental, informational, and appraisal. However, no research has evaluated the influence the pandemic has had on breastfeeding supports. The purpose of this study was to explore perceptions of social support among breastfeeding mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional phenomenological approach was taken utilizing semistructured interviews (March-June 2020) with currently breastfeeding mothers (n = 29). Data were analyzed through a process of immersion and crystallization. Results: Mothers are still able to obtain each type of support, however, support has been negatively influenced by the pandemic. Mothers reported experiencing increased stress and isolation and had an immense desire to receive in-person support from peers, family, childcare providers, and lactation specialists. Furthermore, mothers of multiple children felt if they did not already have breastfeeding knowledge from previous experiences they would be unsuccessful in breastfeeding due to their current lack of support. Conversely, a majority of mothers felt the pandemic had positively influenced their breastfeeding journeys due to concerns of formula shortages and extended maternity leaves. Finally, mothers were concerned about safely expressing breast milk on their return to work. Conclusion: Mother's ability to obtain breastfeeding support has been negatively impacted by the pandemic due to the inability to engage with individuals in-person and the lack of access to childcare. First-time mothers may be at higher risk of early breastfeeding cessation due to lack of support. However, breastfeeding journeys have also been positively influenced by allowing mothers more time at home with their child. Resources are needed to support expressing breast milk in the workplace during COVID-19.","output":"Social Support During COVID-19: Perspectives of Breastfeeding Mothers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Background. Rhinoviruses (RH) are responsible for acute respiratory illnesses, mainly in the upper respiratory tract. Population and methods.  3,152 children aged under 16 years, admitted to the Paediatrics department of the University Hospital Centre of Poitiers from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 1995 with ear, nose and throat (ENT) and/or respiratory symptoms were systematically investigated. One hundred and forty-five RH strains were isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions of 87 boys and 58 girls (mean age: 20.3 months). Among these, 92 (63.4%) were less than 1 year of age. Bacteriological investigations were done for 29 patients when a concomitant bacterial infection was suspected. Results. RH infection rate was maximum before 1 year of age (median age: 6.5 months) and decreased with age. RH were isolated throughout the 3 years, with a first peak from February to April, and a second one in autumn. The main symptoms were sibilants (27.6%) and cough (24.1%). Sibilants were more frequently associated in children under 12 months of age (P = 0.01). Sometimes, ophthalmologic or digestive symptoms were present. Three children with respiratory distress were transferred to the reanimation ward. In addition, a RH strain was isolated from a child who died of sudden infant death. Thirty-four children (23.4%) were co-infected by one or several viruses; the most frequently detected were the respiratory syncytial virus (41.2%) and the adenoviruses (35.3%). Twenty-nine children were infected by two viruses and five by three. Associated bacterial infections were diagnosed in 23 children, especially conjunctivitis due to Haemophilus influenzae (21.7%). Among these children, eight had a multiple viral infection. Conclusion. RH have a limited pathogenicity but can be associated with serious illnesses among infants and childen.","output":"Infections  rhinovirus chez des enfants hospitaliss: tude sur une priode de 3 ans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fermatean fuzzy set theory is emerging as a novel mathematical tool to handle uncertainties in different domains of real world. Fermatean fuzzy sets were presented in order that uncertain information from quite general real-world decision-making situations could be mathematically tractable. To that purpose, these sets are more flexible and reliable than intuitionistic and Pythagorean fuzzy sets. This paper presents a novel hybrid model, namely, the Fermatean fuzzy bipolar soft set (FFBSS, in short) model as a general extension of two powerful existing models, that is, fuzzy bipolar soft set and Pythagorean fuzzy bipolar soft set models. Some fundamental properties of the proposed FFBSS model, namely, subset-hood, equal FFBSSs, relative null and relative absolute FFBSSs, restricted intersection and union, extended intersection and union, AND operation and OR operation are investigated along with numerical examples. In addition, certain basic operations, including Fermatean fuzzy weighted average and score function of FFBSSs are proposed. Furthermore, two applications of FFBSS are explored to deal with different multiattribute decision-making situations, that is, selection of best surgeon robot and analysis of most affected country due to COVID-19 (CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 stands for its year of emergence, that is, 2019).

ACE2 is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and is responsible for degrading angiotensin II and thereby counteracting its pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic effects mediated through the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). As AT1R is directly blocked by angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), these agents may offer a safe, low-cost solution for reducing COVID-19 respiratory outcomes. METHODS AND DISCUSSION: CLARITY is a pragmatic, adaptive, two-arm, multi-centre, comparative effectiveness phase III randomised controlled trial that examines whether ARBs reduce COVID-19 severity among high-risk patients. Recruiting in India and Australia, the trial will compare treatment with a maximum tolerated daily dose of an ARB to standard of care. Treatment allocation is blinded in India but open-label in Australia due to interruptions to placebo supply in the latter. The primary endpoint is a 7-point ordinal scale of clinical states, ranging from no limitation of activities (category 1) to death (category 7), assessed on day 14. Secondary outcomes include the 7-point scale assessed at day 28 and 28- and 90-day mortality.

The first drug that has shown promise in reducing COVID-19 mortality in severely-ill patients is dexamethasone, a cheap, well-known anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, approved for the treatment of inflammatory conditions including respiratory diseases such as asthma and tuberculosis. However, about 80% of COVID-19 patients requiring oxygenation, and about 67% of patients on ventilators, are not responsive to dexamethasone therapy mainly. Additionally, using higher doses of dexamethasone for prolonged periods of time can lead to severe side effects and some patients may develop corticosteroid resistance leading to treatment failure. In order to increase the therapeutic efficacy of dexamethasone in COVID-19 patients, while minimizing dexamethasone-related complications that could result from using higher doses of the drug, we applied a chemocentric informatics approach to identify combination therapies. Our results indicated that combining dexamethasone with fast long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonists (LABAs), such as formoterol and salmeterol, can ease respiratory symptoms hastily, until dexamethasone's anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects kick in. Our studies demonstrated that LABAs and dexamethasone (or other glucocorticoids) exert synergistic effects that will augment both anti-inflammatory and fibronectin-mediated anticoagulant effects. We also propose other alternatives to LABAs that are supported by sound systems biology evidence, such as nitric oxide. Other drugs such as sevoflurane and treprostinil interact with the SARS-CoV-2 interactome and deserve further exploration. Moreover, our chemocentric informatics approach provides systems biology evidence that combination therapies for COVID-19 will have higher chances of perturbing the SARS-CoV-2 human interactome, which may negatively impact COVID-19 disease pathways.","output":"Chemocentric Informatics Analysis: Dexamethasone Versus Combination Therapy for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Approximately one-third of women Veterans Health Administration (VHA) users have substance use disorders (SUD).

METHODS: Design: We conducted a secondary analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted with VHA interdisciplinary womens SUD providers at VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. Participants: Using purposive and snowball sampling we interviewed 17 VHA providers from psychology, social work, womens health, primary care, and psychiatry. Approach: Our analytic approach was content analysis of provider perceptions of identifying hazardous substance use in women Veterans. RESULTS: Providers noted limitations across an array of existing identification methodologies employed to identify women with hazardous substance use and believed these limitations were abated through trusting provider-patient communication. Providers emphasized the need to have a process in place to respond to hazardous use when identified. Provider level factors, including provider bias, and patient level factors such as how they self-identify, may impact identification of women Veterans with hazardous substance use.

The discovery of crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease has made the in silico identification of its inhibitors possible. Based on its critical role in viral replication, the viral protease can prove to be a promising target for antiviral drug therapy. We have systematically screened an in-house library of 15,754 natural and synthetic compounds, established at International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences, University of Karachi. The in silico search for potential viral protease inhibitors resulted in nine top ranked ligands (compounds 1C9) against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB ID: 6LU7) based on docking scores, and predictive binding energies. The in silico studies were updated via carrying out the docking, and predictive binding energy estimation, with a recently reported crystal structure of main protease (PDB ID: 6Y2F) at a better resolution i.e., 1.95 ?. Compound 2 (molecular bank code AAA396) was found to have highest negative binding energy of ?71.63 kcal/mol for 6LU7. While compound 3 (molecular bank code AAD146) exhibited highest negative binding energy of -81.92 kcal/mol for 6Y2F. The stability of the compounds- in complex with viral protease was analyzed by Molecular Dynamics simulation studies, and was found to be stable over the course of 20 ns simulation time.

A review of the published literature reveals a strong focus on the stressors that originate within the practicum environment, rather than the students life outside the university and practice setting. This article reports on an Australian study, completed before the COVID-19 pandemic, of the university experiences of undergraduate women nurse students with family responsibilities. The findings reveal the importance of factors outside the university on the women students practicum experience and their ability to engage and achieve. Methods: : The study was qualitative, guided by Gadamers hermeneutic philosophy. Twenty-nine women students with family responsibilities (partners and children) were interviewed at two stages of their degree journey. Over 50 hours of data were thematically analysed. Findings: The themes family pressure and practicum poverty describe the impact of domestic work, family finances and practicum organisation on student stress, wellbeing, achievement, thoughts of attrition, and family tension. These findings are particularly pertinent to Australia and other developed nations where the nurse student demographic continues to age. An interpretation of these findings against the recent impact of COVID-19 on nurse education and womens life choices reveals the likelihood that these difficulties have intensified for women students with family responsibilities since the pandemic began. Conclusions: and Recommendations: Many developed nations, including Australia, are increasingly reliant on older women nurse students to maintain the future graduate nursing workforce. This change in nurse student demographic to the mature-age student requires a revision of the organisation of the nursing practicum. Recommendations to nurse education to improve practicum accessibility for women students who have family responsibilities include the application of a flexible and collaborative approach to practicum organisation and communication. Wider recommendations to Government include a revision of the way the nursing student is financially supported during the practicum. Further research that explores the practicum experience for women nurse students during and following the COVID-19 pandemic is also recommended.","output":"Nursing Practicum Equity for a Changing Nurse Student Demographic: a Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a very wide range of disease severity: from completely asymptomatic to fatal, and the reasons for that are not well understood; however, there are some data that show vitamin D may have a protective effect. METHODS: To retrieve the vitamin D levels data, the authors analyzed the vitamin D European population data compiled by 2019 European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) statement on vitamin D status published in the European Journal of Endocrinology. For the data set to be used for analysis, only recently published data that included general adult population of both genders aged 40-65 years or wider and must have included the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. RESULTS: There were data sets from 10 countries that fitted the criteria and were analyzed. Severe vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D less than 25a?nmol/L (10a?ng/dL). Pearson correlation analysis between death rate per million of population from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency showed a strong correlation with ra?= 0.79, pa?= 0.007. Over time, correlation strengthened, and r coefficient asymptotically increased. After adjusting for countries' age structure and per capita health expenditures, multiple linear regression analysis showed that higher prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased mortality. Each 1% increase in prevalence increased deaths by 55 per million (95% confidence interval, CI 8-102), pa?= 0.03.

However, there is uncertainty about what the \\"new normal\\" in mental health care will be like in post-COVID-19 times. To what extent will the experiences gained during the pandemic influence a sustainable adoption and implementation of online mental health care treatment in the future? OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we aim to formulate expectations with regard to the sustainability of online mental health care after COVID-19. METHODS: In an interview study, 11 mental health care professionals were asked about their experiences and expectations for the future. Participants were recruited from a mental health care organization in the Netherlands. The interviews took place between April 7-30, 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in the Netherlands. The data were analyzed using a thematic coding method. RESULTS: From the interviews, we learn that the new normal in mental health care will most likely consist of more blended treatments. Due to skill enhancement and (unexpected) positive experiences with online treatment, an increase in adoption is likely to take place. However, not all experiences promise a successful and sustainable upscaling of online treatment in the future. Mental health care professionals are learning that not all clients are able to benefit from this type of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Sustainable upscaling of online mental health care requires customized solutions, investments in technology, and flexibility of mental health care providers. Online treatment could work for those who are open to it, but many factors influence whether it will work in specific situations. There is work to be done before online treatment is inherently part of mental health care.","output":"Integration of Online Treatment Into the \\"New Normal\\" in Mental Health Care in Post-COVID-19 Times: Exploratory Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. METHODS: We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). FINDINGS: Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5). INTERPRETATION: Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19.

The mutated envelopes were tested for intracellular maturation and for functions, including ability to elicit syncytium formation and ability to mediate cell-to-cell transmission of the virus. Three major phenotypes, defining three functionally distinct regions, were identified. (i) Mutations causing defects in intracellular maturation of the envelope precursor are mostly distributed in the central portion of the TM ectodomain, containing the immunosuppressive peptide. This region, which includes vicinal cysteines thought to form an intramolecular disulfide bridge, is probably essential for correct folding of the protein. (ii) Mutations resulting in reduced syncytium-forming ability despite correct intracellular maturation are clustered in the amino-terminal part of the TM ectodomain, within the leucine zipper-like motif. Similar motifs with a propensity to form coiled-coil structures have been implicated in the fusion process driven by other viral envelope proteins, and HTLV-1 may thus conform to this general rule for viral fusion. (iii) Mutants with increased syncytium-forming ability define a region immediately amino-terminal to the membrane-spanning domain. Surprisingly, these mutants exhibited severe defects in infectivity, despite competence for fusion. Existence of this phenotype indicates that capacity for cell-to-cell fusion is not sufficient to ensure viral entry, even in cell-to-cell transmission. The ectodomain of the TM glycoprotein thus may be involved in postfusion events required for full infectivity of HTLV-1, which perhaps represents a unique feature of this poorly infectious retrovirus.","output":"The ectodomain of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 TM glycoprotein is involved in postfusion events."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a light on the vulnerability of people living with pre-existing immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) and taking a biologic therapy The present study aims to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the medical consultations, biologic treatment modifications and access to treatment-specific information for IMID patients taking a biologic therapy specifically Methods: This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted online on the Carenity platform from April 2, 2020 to May 26, 2020 It includes adult patients from France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Germany and the United States living with lupus, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, Crohns disease, or ulcerative colitis and taking a biologic therapy Results: 721 IMID patients taking a biologic treatment completed the survey Since the start of the epidemic, 8% of patients stopped taking their biologic therapy and 4% took it less frequently 55% of patients discussed COVID-19 and their biologic therapy with the doctor treating them for their illness Among these patients, only 8% were proactively contacted by their physicians Patients more frequently modified their biologic treatment intake after a discussion with their healthcare professional about COVID-19 and biologics (22% vs 16%, **p&lt;0 05) 74% consulted at least one source in addition to their healthcare professional to learn about biologics in the context of COVID-19 In our study, people who had consulted their doctors and discussed COVID-19 and their biologic were more prone to being confronted with contradictory opinions (32% vs 26%, *p&lt;0 1) Conclusions: Our study highlighted the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the access to treatment-specific information and biologics modifications for IMID patients taking a biologic therapy Several IMID patients discontinued their treatment and only a few discussed COVID-19 and biologics with their doctors, generally not at the doctors initiative","output":"PMU109 IMPACT of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases Taking a Biologic Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Climate change and obesity were considered threats to our planet long before the onset of COVID-19.

Furthermore, COVID-19 has a more detrimental effect if acquired by an obese individual, with a higher chance of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. This leads to higher GHG emissions and negative repercussions on the climate. A tri-directional relationship exists between obesity, climate change, and COVID-19.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a member of the Alphacoronavirus family, induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and significant IFN-I production after infection. However, how TGEV evades the IFN-I antiviral response despite the marked induction of endogenous IFN-I has remained unclear. Inositol-requiring enzyme 1  (IRE1), a highly conserved ER stress sensor with both kinase and RNase activities, is involved in the IFN response. In this study, IRE1 facilitated TGEV replication via downmodulating the host microRNA (miR) miR-30a-5p abundance. miR-30a-5p normally enhances IFN-I antiviral activity by directly targeting the negative regulators of Janus family kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), the suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1 (SOCS1), and SOCS3. Furthermore, TGEV infection increased SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression, which dampened the IFN-I antiviral response and facilitated TGEV replication. Importantly, compared with mock infection, TGEV infection in vivo resulted in decreased miR-30a-5p levels and significantly elevated SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression in the piglet ileum. Taken together, our data reveal a new strategy used by TGEV to escape the IFN-I response by engaging the IRE1-miR-30a-5p/SOCS1/3 axis, thus improving our understanding of how TGEV escapes host innate immune defenses.IMPORTANCE Type I interferons (IFN-I) play essential roles in restricting viral infections. Coronavirus infection induces ER stress and the interferon response, which reflects different adaptive cellular processes. An understanding of how coronavirus-elicited ER stress is actively involved in viral replication and manipulates the host IFN-I response has remained elusive. Here, TGEV inhibited host miR-30a-5p via the ER stress sensor IRE1, which led to the increased expression of negative regulators of JAK-STAT signaling cascades, namely, SOCS1 and SOCS3. Increased SOCS1 or SOCS3 expression impaired the IFN-I antiviral response, promoting TGEV replication. These findings enhance our understanding of the strategies used by coronaviruses to antagonize IFN-I innate immunity via IRE1-mediated manipulation of the miR-30a-5p/SOCS axis, highlighting the crucial role of IRE1 in innate antiviral resistance and the potential of IRE1 as a novel target against coronavirus infection.","output":"The Coronavirus Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus Evades the Type I Interferon Response through IRE1-Mediated Manipulation of the MicroRNA miR-30a-5p/SOCS1/3 Axis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the need for urgent improvements in access to health care for rural, remote, and underserviced communities. The Renfrew County Virtual Triage and Assessment Centre (VTAC) was designed to provide access to COVID-19 testing and assessment with a family physician. The goal was to protect emergency departments and 911 paramedics while ensuring that nobody was left at home, suffering in silence. Residents were encouraged to call their own family physician for any urgent health needs. If they did not have a family physician or could not access their usual primary care provider, then they could call VTAC. This study reports on the output of a service model offering access to assessment and COVID-19 testing through a blend of virtual and in-person care options by a multidisciplinary team. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of VTAC to provide access to COVID-19 assessment and testing across rural, remote, and underserviced communities. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the data derived from the cases handled by VTAC between March 27, 2020 (launch day), and September 30, 2020. RESULTS: Residents from all 19 census subdivisions and municipalities of Renfrew County accessed VTAC. A total of 10,086 family physician assessments were completed (average 64 per day). Of these, 8535 (84.6%) assessments were to unique patient users. Thirty physicians provided care. Using digital equipment setup in the patients home, 31 patients were monitored remotely.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Decision-analysis for elective colonic resection after acute diverticulitis is predicated on future risk estimates of disease recurrence and complication rates. Quality of life alone is rarely countenanced as sufficient to warrant the supposed risk of intervention. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy for prior diverticulitis over 18 months were studied at baseline (preoperative) and again subsequently (3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively) regarding quality of life and bowel symptomatology [gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI)]. All patients also had enquiry made into urinary and sexual function at the same time points (men underwent international prostate symptom severity and international index of erectile function, respectively, whereas for women the urinary dysfunction index and a modified questionnaire for the evaluation of sexual function were used). RESULTS Forty-six patients (mean age 58.3, 26 men) were studied, 45 of whom had their surgery completed laparoscopically. Quality of life significantly improved in the group overall, with 36 patients having an increase in their GIQLI >10 points (23 patients >20 points). This improvement was evident by 3 months and maintained thereafter. The improvement was due to increments in gastrointestinal symptomatology subdomain and was most significant in those with lowest preoperative scoring. Five patients' GIQLI score deteriorated without obvious predictive event. Not one of the patients presented evident alteration in urinary and sexual functioning postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Significant improvement in quality of life and social functioning accrues from elective sigmoid resection in the majority of patients.

DESIGN: A qualitative study consisting of semistructured interviews. SETTING: The study was conducted in Cape Town and Johannesburg, SA. PARTICIPANTS: Forty health professionals who had regular contact with pregnant or postnatal women were interviewed between February 2020 and February 2021. RESULTS: Analysis of the interviews revealed six themes. Health professionals in the private sector reported frequent contact with industry representatives with over two-thirds reporting exposure to industry representatives to present products, provide training or sponsor educational activities. Participants held strong opinions regarding the equivalency of breastfeeding to commercial milk formula citing information from industry representatives and product packaging. Health professionals were very knowledgeable on so-called formulas for special medical purposes and these were valued as solutions to infant feeding challenges. Of the 40 health professionals interviewed, less than half (19) had ever heard of the SA regulation related to marketing of breast milk substitutes (R991). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates clearly that health professionals, particularly in the private sector, are exposed to and promote the use of commercial milk formula among SA women. The findings of this study should be used to catalyse policy responses, social movements, consumer and professional association action to strengthen monitoring and enforcement of the Code regulations in order to protect breastfeeding and support the optimal health and well-being of the population.","output":"They push their products through me: health professionals perspectives on and exposure to marketing of commercial milk formula in Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa C a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergency departments (EDs) are the primary driver for hospital admissions in the United States (US), and that trend is likely to continue through the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.

A multicenter, prospective, population-based study was carried out that included women (n = 1320) who were pregnant during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Barcelona (Spain) compared against a pre-pandemic cohort (n = 345). Maternal well-being was assessed using the validated World Health Organization Well-Being Index Questionnaire (WHO-5 Index). Pregnant women attended during the COVID-19 pandemic showed worst WHO-5 well-being scores (median (IQR) of 56 (36C72) for the pandemic cohort vs. 64 (52C76) for the pre-pandemic cohort p < 0.001), with 42.8% of women presenting a poor well-being score vs. 28% for the pre-pandemic cohort (p < 0.001).

The mechanisms of direct SARS-CoV-2 cardiomyocyte infection include viral invasion via ACE2-Spike glycoprotein-binding. In DM patients, the impact of glycation of ACE2 on cardiomyocyte invasion by SARS-CoV-2 can be of high importance. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cardiomyocytes from heart autopsy of DM cases compared to Non-DM; to investigate the role of DM in SARS-COV-2 entry in cardiomyocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated consecutive autopsy cases, deceased for COVID-19, from Italy between Apr 30, 2020 and Jan 18, 2021. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 in cardiomyocytes, expression of ACE2 (total and glycosylated form), and transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2) protein. In order to study the role of diabetes on cardiomyocyte alterations, independently of COVID-19, we investigated ACE2, glycosylated ACE2, and TMPRSS2 proteins in cardiomyocytes from DM and Non-DM explanted-hearts. Finally, to investigate the effects of DM on ACE2 protein modification, an in vitro glycation study of recombinant human ACE2 (hACE2) was performed to evaluate the effects on binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The authors included cardiac tissue from 97 autopsies. DM was diagnosed in 37 patients (38%). Fourth-seven out of 97 autopsies (48%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cardiomyocytes. Thirty out of 37 DM autopsy cases (81%) and 17 out of 60 Non-DM autopsy cases (28%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cardiomyocytes. Total ACE2, glycosylated ACE2, and TMPRSS2 protein expressions were higher in cardiomyocytes from autopsied and explanted hearts of DM than Non-DM. In vitro exposure of monomeric hACE2 to 120 mM glucose for 12 days led to non-enzymatic glycation of four lysine residues in the neck domain affecting the protein oligomerization. CONCLUSIONS: The upregulation of ACE2 expression (total and glycosylated forms) in DM cardiomyocytes, along with non-enzymatic glycation, could increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection in DM patients by favouring the cellular entry of SARS-CoV2.","output":"Glycated ACE2 receptor in diabetes: open door for SARS-COV-2 entry in cardiomyocyte"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the ongoing coronavirus, journals and the media have extensively covered the impacts on doctors, nurses, physician assistants, and other healthcare workers.

Consecutive patients admitted to a high-volume intensive care unit (ICU) in London with severe COVID-19 pneumonitis were included if hs-TnT concentration at admission was known. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis performed, with cohorts classified a priori by multiples of the upper limit of normal (ULN). 277 patients were admitted during a 7-week period in 2020; 176 were included (90% received invasive ventilation). hs-TnT at admission was 16.5 (9.0 to 49.3) ng/L, 56% had concentrations >ULN. 56 patients (31.8%) died during the index admission. Admission hs-TnT level was lower in survivors (12.0 (8.0-27.8) vs 28.5 (14.0 to 81.0) ng/L, p = 0.001). Univariate predictors of mortality were age, APACHE-II Score and admission hs-TnT (HR 1.73, p = 0.007). By multivariate regression, only age (HR 1.33, CI: 1.16.to 1.51, p < 0.01) and admission hs-TnT (HR 1.94, CI: 1.22 to 3.10, p = 0.006) remained predictive. Survival was significantly lower when admission hs-TnT was >ULN (log-rank p-value<0.001). Peak hs-TnT was higher in those who died but was not predictive of death after adjustment for other factors. In conclusion, in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis, the hs-TnT level at admission is a powerful independent predictor of the likelihood of surviving to discharge from ICU. In most cases, hs-TnT elevation does not represent major myocardial injury but acts as a sensitive integrated biomarker of global stress.

This approach permitted subcellular information to be extracted from the bioinorganic interface between a single bacterium and Cu/Cu5Zn5Al1Sn surfaces after complete contact killing. Early stages of interaction between individual bacteria and the metal/alloy surfaces include cell leakage of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) from the bacterium and changes in the metal/alloy surface composition upon adherence of bacteria. Three key observations responsible for Cu-induced contact killing include cell membrane damage, formation of nanosized copper-containing particles within the bacteria cell, and intracellular copper redox reactions. Direct evidence of cell membrane damage was observed upon contact with both Cu metal and Cu5Zn5Al1Sn surfaces. Cell membrane damage permits copper to enter into the cell interior through two possible routes, as small fragmentized Cu(2)O particles from the corrosion product layer and/or as released copper ions. This results in the presence of intracellular copper oxide nanoparticles inside the cell. The nanosized particles consist primarily of CuO with smaller amounts of Cu(2)O. The existence of two oxidation states of copper suggests that intracellular redox reactions play an important role. The nanoparticle formation can be regarded as a detoxification process of copper, which immobilizes copper ions via transformation processes within the bacteria into poorly soluble or even insoluble nanosized Cu structures. Similarly, the formation of primarily Cu(II) oxide nanoparticles could be a possible way for the bacteria to deactivate the toxic effects induced by copper ions via conversion of Cu(I) to Cu(II).","output":"High-Resolution Microscopical Studies of Contact Killing Mechanisms on Copper-Based Surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetic foot syndrome (DFS) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus.

PATIENT CONCERNS Here we describe the anesthetic management of a 67-year-old man with a massive intrathoracic goiter causing severe tracheal obstruction with positional symptoms. The patient presented with progressive dyspnea that was aggravated in the supine position and was scheduled for total thyroidectomy. DIAGNOSIS Preoperative computed tomography showed a large goiter extending into the thoracic cavity, with diffuse segmental tracheal narrowing for 6 cm. The diameter at the narrowest portion of the trachea was 4.29 mm. INTERVENTIONS Before the induction of general anesthesia, we applied extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in preparation for potential difficulties in securing the airway during general anesthesia. Subsequently, anesthesia was successfully induced and maintained. OUTCOMES After the surgical procedure, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and chest radiography showed resolution of the tracheal narrowing. ECMO was weaned 2 hours after the surgery, and the patient was extubated on the first postoperative day. He was discharged without any complication. CONCLUSION The findings from this case suggest that the use of ECMO before the induction of general anesthesia is a safe method for maintaining oxygenation in patients with severe tracheal obstruction.","output":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for the anesthetic management of a patient with a massive intrathoracic goiter causing severe tracheal obstruction with positional symptoms: A case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 a pandemic.

In Poland, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for FD is offered by the National Health Fund only at selected hospital infusion centers. Patients with FB are considered at a high risk of developing complications from COVID-19. Some patients omitted infusions due to fear of infection or outbreaks in hospitals. Lack of alternative infusion sites hampered the situation. OBJECTIVES To analyze the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on FD patients, especially their fears and expectations, the Polish FD Collaborative Group collaborated on a survey project. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between September and November 2020, we distributed a customized survey exploring expectations and fears among FD subjects. RESULTS Fifty-five individuals (35 receiving ongoing ERT) from different FD centers completed the study. The median age was 40 years [IQR 25; 50], and gender distribution was almost equal (27 F; 28 M). One-fourth of FD patients reported severe disability limiting transportation for infusions that, in the opinion of the other 25% of responders, consumed >4 h. Forty-four (80%) of all would prefer home infusions performed by a nurse (n = 37, 67.3%) or by a trained non-medical person (n = 7, 12.7%), while 8 (14.5%) patients would choose a local hospital. As expected, transportation time (in one direction) was longer in those preferring home infusions (89.4 63 vs 36.2 67 min; p = 0.02). Also, those with more severe FD manifestation would prefer home infusions to treatment in FD centers (p = 0.03). The vast majority of respondents (n = 46; 83%) would not change their preferences after pandemic termination.

This resulted in unprecedented reductions in anthropogenic activity, and reduced emissions of certain air pollutants, namely oxides of nitrogen. The UK lockdown was enforced on 23/03/2020, which led to restrictions on movement, social interaction, and non-essential businesses and services. This study employed an ensemble of measurement and modelling techniques to investigate changes in air quality, atmospheric composition and boundary layer reactivity in the South East of the UK post-lockdown. The techniques employed included in-situ gas- and particle-phase monitoring within central and local authority air quality monitoring networks, remote sensing by long path Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy and Sentinel-5P's TROPOMI, and detailed 0-D chemical box modelling. Findings showed that de-trended NO(2) concentrations decreased by an average of 14C38% when compared to the mean of the same period over the preceding 5-years. We found that de-trended particulate matter concentrations had been influenced by interregional pollution episodes, and de-trended ozone concentrations had increased across most sites, by up to 15%, such that total O(x) levels were roughly preserved. 0-D chemical box model simulations showed the observed increases in ozone concentrations during lockdown under the hydrocarbon-limited ozone production regime, where total NO(x) decreased proportionally greater than total non-methane hydrocarbons, which led to an increase in total hydroxyl, peroxy and organic peroxy radicals.

Previously, the use of telemedicine in orthopedic practices was minimal for a variety of reasons, one being the inability to perform a physical exam in a specialty reliant on direct patient contact for diagnosis and treatment. PURPOSE To evaluate the administration of a novel virtual physical exam for evaluation of spine patients in the telehealth setting. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING Prospective consecutive cohort at a large academic spine center. METHODS A prospective cohort of 52 patients consented to participating in a novel virtual physical exam protocol during routine telemedicine visits at a large, tertiary orthopedic spine practice. Participants were asked to perform a series of carefully designed physical maneuvers using readily available household objects to allow their provider to better assess sensory and motor function in the telemedicine setting. Patients were then asked to complete a short satisfaction survey. RESULTS In total, 52 patients completed the physical exam and survey. Males and females were distributed evenly among the cohort at 50%. The average age was 52.1 +/- 15.5 years. The average score for ease of understanding the exam (1 = easiest, 5 = hardest) was 1.1 while the average score for ease of performance was 1.5.

OBJECTIVE: In this pilot study, we aimed to explore the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on residency training experience, and to delineate the perceived barriers to the successful implementation of web-based medical education. METHODS: A 19-item survey was compiled and distributed electronically using Qualtrics. This anonymous survey included information on the training level of each resident, their participation in formal didactics before and during the pandemic, and their perception of the ease and limitations of virtual didactics. The residents opinions on specific educational resources were assessed, and the effectiveness of new delivery methods on resident engagement and learning was examined. RESULTS: Thirty anesthesiology residents were surveyed, 19 of whom agreed to participate in the pilot study. One participant with incomplete responses was excluded, yielding a final cohort of 18 respondents. Most residents (56%, 10/18) reported that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected their residency training. The time spent on didactic training and independent studies was, nevertheless, not affected by the pandemic for 90% (16/18) of respondents. Nonetheless, 72% (13/18) of residents were less engaged during virtual lectures in comparison to in-person didactics. Important limitations included distraction from the physical environment (67%, 12/18), internet instability (67%, 12/18), less obligation to participate (44%, 8/18), technical difficulty and unmuted microphones (33%, 6/18, each), and people speaking over each other (28%, 5/18). Despite these limitations, most residents stated that they would like to keep a combination of virtual didactics including live Zoom lectures (56%, 10/18), prerecorded web didactics (56%, 10/18), and virtual ground rounds via Zoom (50%, 9/18) as the new normal. CONCLUSIONS: Despite important limitations listed in this report, anesthesia residents would like to keep a combination of virtual lectures and presentations as the new normal after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Perception of Web-Based Didactic Activities During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Anesthesia Residents: Pilot Questionnaire Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AbstractOne of the modern global trends is the accelerated formation of a blue economy based on transport and logistics, resource and raw materials, and other opportunities of the seas and oceans, which occupy more than 70% of the Earths surface.

On the March 23, 2020 the Greek government imposed a national quarantine to contain the spread of the pandemic. The impact of such conditions on sexual function and relationship quality of couples is unknown. AIM: To investigate sexual function and relationship quality of couples during the quarantine. METHODS: An online anonymous survey was conducted one month post-impose of the quarantine, between the April 21 and the May 3, 2020. Adult respondents in a relationship completed a questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, structured inquiries regarding sexual activity and quality of relationship, anxiety level, and mood during the quarantine, as well as the IIEF and FSFI indices. OUTCOMES: Sexual function was assessed using the Greek versions of the FSFI and IIEF for females and males respectively. Sexual activity using 5 statements regarding frequency of sexual thoughts, masturbation, and intercourse, quality of intercourse and general estimation of the level of sexual function. Participants graded their level of agreement. Relationship quality was assessed using 5 questions regarding communication, company, understanding, tension and general estimation of companionship. Participants graded their level of agreement. Two additional statements were used in order to evaluate mood and the level of anxiety. RESULTS: A sum of 299 adult heterosexual participants in a relationship participated. Little or no negative impact on sexual function was reported. Increased anxiety and deficient mood were reported only for those with no access to their partner. Being in a steady relationship and living with their partner, but only for couples without children, resulted in satisfaction by sexual activity and enhanced emotional security. CONCLUSION: Sexual function and relationship quality appeared as not affected by the quarantine and by the measures of social distancing. Sotiropoulou P, Ferenidou F, Owens D, et al.

The purpose of present study was to evaluate the relationship between heater type and temperature factors in the bedroom and incidence of the common cold among children in Japan. METHODS In this prospective cohort study, we distributed baseline questionnaires and temperature loggers in December 2019 and administered follow-up questionnaires in March 2020. We recruited children under age 15 years. We performed Poisson regression analysis and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Of 297 participants, air conditioners were the most prevalent (n=105, 35%), followed by gas or kerosene heaters (n=50, 17%) and floor heaters (n=31, 10%). Air-conditioners were associated with higher incidence of all events related to the common cold, especially having a fever (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR)=1.84, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.41-2.40). Contrary, gas or kerosene and floor heaters showed a lower incidence rate of some events related to the common cold, such as school or nursery school absence (aIRR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.37-0.82 and aIRR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.23-0.67, respectively). Whereas bedroom temperature did not show a positive association, children who always felt cold showed a higher incidence of some events related to the common cold.

The logistics network involves several suppliers and retailers-3PLs alliances, a distribution graph consisting of several nodes and arcs as well as multiple customers. Retailers-3PLs purchase the same goods from suppliers and sell to customers after shipping via the network; they also consider environmental issues to reduce pollutants and emissions fines. The proposed nonlinear programming (NLP) model aims to find the best flow and price of goods under cooperation conditions among retailers-3PLs by analyzing their risk levels. Controlling uncertainty in the models is accomplished by Mulvey's robust approach. In a general coalition, fair profit distribution methods are applied to share the profits among retailers-3PLs under different risk situations. We conduct a numerical analysis to present the application of our proposed model and find whether coalitions and cooperation between retailers-3PLs reduce costs and increase profits. Finally, we report the sensitivity analysis results regarding the penalties imposed for pollutant emissions, along with suggestions for future research.

METHODS We reviewed our technique of bipolar circumcision and related procedures in 54 cases over a 22-month period at our day procedure center. Bipolar diathermy cutting and hemostasis was performed using bipolar forceps with a Valleylab machine set at 15. Sleeve circumcision was used. A dorsal slit was made, followed by frenulum release and ventral slit, and was completed with bilateral circumferential cutting. Frenuloplasties released the frenulum. Preputioplasties used multiple 2-3 mm longitudinal cuts to release the constriction, with frenulum left intact. All wounds were closed with interrupted 4/0 Vicryl Rapide?. RESULTS A total of 54 nonemergency bipolar circumcision procedures were carried out from November 2010-August 2012 (42 circumcisions, eight frenuloplasties, and four preputioplasties). Patients were aged 18-72 years (mean, 34 years). There was minimal to no intraoperative bleeding in all cases, allowing for precise dissection. All patients were requested to attend outpatient reviews; three frenuloplasty and two circumcision patients failed to return. Of the remaining 49, mean interval to review was 49 days, with a range of 9-121 days. Two circumcision patients reported mild bleeding with nocturnal erections within a week postoperatively, but they did not require medical attention. Two others presented to family practitioners with possible wound infections which resolved with oral antibiotics. All 49 patients had well-healed wounds. CONCLUSION The bipolar diathermy technique is a simple procedure, easily taught, and reproducible. It is associated with minimal bleeding, is safe and efficient, uses routine operating equipment and is universally applicable to circumcision/frenuloplasty/preputioplasty.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of CLABSIs and CAUTIs in 78 US 12 months before COVID-19 and 6 months during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: During the 2 study periods, there were 795,022 central-line days and 817,267 urinary catheter days. Compared to the period before the COVID-19 pandemic, CLABSI rates increased by 51.0% during the pandemic period from 0.56 to 0.85 per 1,000 line days (P < .001) and by 62.9% from 1.00 to 1.64 per 10,000 patient days (P < .001). Hospitals with monthly COVID-19 patients representing >10% of admissions had a National Health Safety Network (NHSN) device standardized infection ratio for CLABSI that was 2.38 times higher than hospitals with <5% prevalence during the pandemic period (P = .004).

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCF) have not yet been discussed. This study evaluated the effect of the Covid-19 pandemics first wave on VCF in the elderly. METHOD: A retrospective cohort of elderly patients diagnosed with VCF between 2018-19 (Pre-Covid-19 pandemic) to 2020. RESULTS: The cohort included 172 patients above 65 years with VCF during 2018-2020. Patients age and gender were similar between the two study groups. We found a higher proportion of high-energy VCF during 2020 (10.5% vs 6.7%). Incidence of recurrent fractures was 7.5 times higher during 2020 (5.3% vs .7%, P =.06), and significantly higher rates of Ankylosing Spondylitis or Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis in 2020 (7.9% vs 1.5%, P=.04).

Physical distancing is a frequently advocated control measure, but the proximity-based transmission it is intended to control is challenging to incorporate into generalized, ventilation-based models. We utilize a size-dependent aerosol release model with turbulent dispersion to assess the impact of direct, near-field transport in conjunction with changes in ventilation, exposure duration, exhalation/inhalation rates, and masks. We demonstrate this model on indoor and outdoor scenarios to estimate the relative impacts on infection risk. The model can be expressed as a product of six multiplicative factors that may be used to identify opportunities for risk reduction. The additive nature of the short-range (proximity) and long-range (background) transmission components of the aerosol transport factor implies that they must be minimized simultaneously. Indoor simulations showed that close physical distances attenuated the impact of most other risk reduction factors. Increasing ventilation resulted in a 17-fold risk decrease at further physical distances but only a 6-fold decrease at shorter distances. Distance, emission rate, and duration also had large impacts on risk (11-65-fold), while air direction and inhalation rate had lower risk impacts (3-4-fold range). Surgical mask and respirator models predicted higher maximum risk impacts (33- and 280-fold, respectively) than cloth masks (4-fold). Most simulations showed decreasing risk at distances > 1-2 m (3-6 ft). The risk benefit of maintaining 2-m distance vs. 1 m depended substantially on the environmental turbulence and ventilation rate. Outdoors, long-range transmission was negligible and short-range transmission was the primary determinant of risk. Temporary passing events increased risk by up to 50 times at very slow walking speeds and close passing distances, but the relative risks outdoors were still much lower than indoors. The current model assumes turbulent dispersion typical of a given room size and ventilation rate. However, calm environments or confined airflows may increase transmission risks beyond levels predicted with this turbulent model.","output":"Modeling the impacts of physical distancing and other exposure determinants on aerosol transmission."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary surfactant is a lipid/protein complex synthesized by the alveolar epithelium and secreted into the airspaces, where it coats and protects the large respiratory air-liquid interface.

RESULTS: Of women SARS-CoV-2 positive, 82.1% had a BMI >25.0 and had a higher prevalence of diabetes (26/106 [24.5%] vs. 13/103[12.6%]; p=0.03), but not of preeclampsia (21/106 [19.8%] vs. 11/105 [10.4%]; p=0.08) as compared to controls. The prevalence of APCPO was not significantly different between SARS-CoV-2 positive women (19/106 [17.9%]) and controls (9/103 [8.7%]; p=0.06. No differences in the prevalence of SGA fetuses (12/106 [11.3%] vs. 6/103 [5.8%]; p=0.17), fetuses with abnormal Doppler evaluation (8/106 [7.5%] vs. 2/103 [1.9%]; p=0.08), and with abnormal BPP (4/106 [3.7%] vs. 0/103 [0%] between SARS-CoV-2 positive woman and controls were documented. Two fetal deaths and a higher rate of preterm delivery &#8804; 35 weeks of gestation (22/106 vs. 9/103; OR, 2.37 [1.14-4.91] p=0.01) were observed in women SARS-CoV-2 positive as compared to controls. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in abnormal ultrasound and Doppler findings were documented between pregnant women SARS-CoV-2 positive and controls. Nevertheless, preterm delivery &#8804; 35 weeks was more frequently observed among women SARS-CoV-2 positive. This article is protected by copyright.

Italy was the second country after China to face the outbreak of COVID-19 in the first few months of 2020 and the northern part of the country was hit first and most heavily. Following the JD-R theory, an online survey was administered to investigate which specific risk and protective factors predicted depression in a heterogeneous sample of workers. The analyses (analysis of variance, correlations, multiple linear regressions) were run in the total sample and in the sample split by possibility of remote working. The sample consists of 301 workers in northern Italy, 65.1% being women, and a mean age of 42 years. Depression levels were higher in women and in those who were not able to work remotely. In the total sample, emotional exhaustion at work, sleepCwake cycle problems, and longing for touch were significant predictors of depression. The sample split by the possibility of remote working also showed interesting differences. The results show the importance of monitoring the mental health of workers from professional contexts that are currently less widely studied than the healthcare sector, with particular interest in the possibility of remote working.","output":"Mental Health Outcomes in Northern Italian Workers during the COVID-19 Outbreak: The Role of Demands and Resources in Predicting Depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of international travel in spreading infections. Travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFR) are at higher risk of acquiring infections than other travellers, therefore improving the travel health behaviour of these travellers is important. Ethnic Chinese are one of the largest migrant groups in many countries, yet there have been no published studies regarding this population as VFR travellers. We present findings of a study of Australian Chinese VFR travellers relevant to the pandemic response. METHODS: In 2013, five focus groups were conducted with Australian Chinese VFR travellers, exploring topics such as vaccines, face masks, outbreaks and travel health seeking behaviour. Participants were aged 18 years or older and had travelled to China for VFR purposes in the preceding 18 months. Sessions were recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Participants viewed VFR travel as low risk, and underestimated the risks associated with travelling during an outbreak. However, they were generally willing to receive pre-travel vaccination specifically for an outbreak, but not otherwise. Attitudes towards face masks and other infection control measures were mixed. Multiple factors influenced their travel health behaviour, including low risk awareness, misconceptions, and cultural barriers to seeking health care. CONCLUSION: Our research found that Chinese VFR travellers undertake suboptimal precautions related to VFR travel, associated with an underestimation of risks. While they share many characteristics with other VFR travellers, unique cultural health beliefs should be taken into account when developing risk communication and educational interventions as part of a pandemic response.","output":"Travel health seeking behaviours, masks, vaccines and outbreak awareness of Australian Chinese travellers visiting friends and relatives - Implications for control of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess clinical characteristics and outcomes of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in western India. Out of 86 PLHIV with COVID-19 illness, 19.7% had severe/critical illness and 6 (6.9%) individuals died. Median (interquartile range) age was 51 (47-56) years and 77.6% were male. Eighty-five PLHIV were on antiretroviral treatment with 98% having a viral load <200 copies/mL. Hypertension (HTN) (38.3%) and diabetes mellitus (17.4%) were commonest comorbidities. Fifty-eight percent PLHIV were hospitalized while 6.9% individuals needed intensive care. Presence of medical comorbidity was significantly associated with severe/critical COVID-19, whereas HTN was significantly associated with mortality. Recovery from COVID-19 was documented in 93% PLHIV.

In the psychiatric clinic of the University Medical Center G?ttingen, students' ratings concerning the learning effect and their substantive assessment for both forms of teaching were comparatively evaluated to determine the quality of this process. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall, 350 students who had visited classroom teaching (winter semester, WS18/19 to WS19/20) vs. digital teaching (SS20) assessed their form of teaching post hoc, within a standardized survey. They rated the individual learning effect in seven psychiatric subjects and did a substantive assessment on eight dimensions. In addition, they rated their expenditure of time. RESULTS: For digital teaching, the individual learning effect was rated as either being equivalent or superior (subjects: psychotherapy, schizophrenia). Despite a significantly heightened expenditure of time, digital teaching was substantively assessed as being equivalent to classroom teaching or superior (dimensions: independent processing of learning goals, overall format of lecture). Concerning their anticipated preparation for the professional practice, students rated digital teaching as being inferior to classroom teaching. CONCLUSION: A pandemic-driven conversion from classroom to digital teaching did not result in a loss of quality on the dimensions measured in this comparative evaluation. With a view to professional practice, digital teaching should complement classroom teaching and be part of future curricula.","output":"[Implementation of digital teaching in psychiatry as consequence of COVID-19: a comparative evaluation with classroom teaching]./ Einfhrung digitaler Lehre im Fach Psychiatrie als Reaktion auf COVID-19: eine vergleichende Evaluation zur Pr?senzlehre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Each year, many of Muslims including children and adolescents fast in Ramadan This year, the month of Ramadan is in the period of the outbreak of COVID-19, and due to its spread, fighting this disease has brought about a new challenge for all Muslims in the world Given the lack of studies on this issue, as well as the direct effect of fasting on the body and soul in the period of COVID-19 pandemic, this study intends to reflect the positive results of fasting in a mini-review Therefore, online databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, EMBASE and Magiran were screened using the key words including: \\"Fasting\\", \\"Ramadan\\", \\"COVID-19\\", \\"Coronavirus\\", \\"Obesity\\", \\"Mental health\\", \\"Muslim\\" for the latest information These keywords were searched from November 2001 to November 2020 in Persian and English languages This study revealed that fasting by reducing obesity can help people to control their diabetes and cardiac diseases which are among the underlying diseases of COVID-19 In addition, fasting has an effective role in reducing violence and social problems Interestingly, avoiding eating and drinking will reduce the contact of infected hands with mouth and reduces infection through swallowing","output":"The effects of fasting in Ramadan on the risk factors of COVID-19 in adolescents: a brief review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could cause a severe acute respiratory infectious disease, showing a high mortality rate of 12-45% among cases who required intensive care unit admission.

All patients were diagnosed based on positive results of the novel coronavirus-real-time RT-PCR with chest computed tomography (CT) findings. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were enrolled in this study. The median age was 66 years (range 16-92 years). For all, 50 (54%) were males. The most common underlying disease was hypertension in 32 (36%). Any comorbidity was seen in 60 (67%). The mortality rate was 4 (6%). In terms of clinical symptoms on an initial visit, fever and cough were confirmed in 66 (72%) and 37 (40%). Forty-three (47%) had no respiratory symptoms. As for radiological findings by chest CT scan, ground-glass opacities (GGO)s, peripheral distribution, bilateral lung involvements were seen in 88 (96%), 76 (83%) and 78 (85%), respectively. CONCLUSION: It is difficult to diagnose as COVID-19 pneumonia due to poor respiratory symptoms. Chest CT findings typically show GGO, peripheral and bilateral shadows.

METHODS: Volume of emergency stroke code activations, patient characteristics, stroke severity, reperfusion rates, treatment times, and outcomes from February 1 to April 30, 2020, were compared against the same time period in 2019. Demographic data were provided by each participating institution. RESULTS: There was a 17.3% decrease in stroke code activations across LAC in 2020 compared to 2019 (1,786 vs. 2,159, respectively, &#967;2 goodness of fit test p < 0.0001) across 9 participating comprehensive stroke centers. Patients who did not receive any reperfusion therapy decreased by 16.6% in 2020 (1,527) compared to 2019 (1,832). Patients who received only intravenous thrombolytic (IVT) therapy decreased by 31.8% (107 vs. 157). Patients who received only mechanical thrombectomy (MT) increased by 3% (102 vs. 99). Patients who received both IVT and MT decreased by 31.8% (45 vs. 66). Recanalization treatment times in 2020 were comparable to 2019. CSCs serving a higher proportion of Latinx populations in the eastern parts of LAC experienced a higher incidence of MT in 2020 compared to 2019. Mild increase in stroke severity was seen in 2020 compared to 2019 (8.95 vs. 8.23, p = 0.046).

In the beginning, people suffered due to the absence of efficacious drugs required to treat severely ill patients. Nevertheless, still, there are no established therapeutic molecules against the SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, repurposing of the drugs started against SARS-CoV-2, due to which several drugs were approved for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This paper reviewed the treatment regime for COVID-19 through drug repurposing from December 8, 2019 (the day when WHO recognized COVID-19 as a pandemic) until today. We have reviewed all the clinical trials from RECOVERY trials, ACTT-1 and ACTT-2 study group, and other major clinical trial platforms published in highly reputed journals such as NEJM, Lancet, etc. In addition to single-molecule therapy, several combination therapies were also evaluated to understand the treatment of COVID-19 from these significant clinical trials. To date, several lessons have been learned on the therapeutic outcomes for COVID-19. The paper also outlines the experiences gained during the repurposing of therapeutic molecules (hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir/ lopinavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, ivermectin, dexamethasone, camostatmesylate, and heparin), immunotherapeutic molecules (tocilizumab, mavrilimumab, baricitinib, and interferons), combination therapy, and convalescent plasma therapy to treat COVID-19 patients. We summarized that anti-viral therapeutic (remdesivir) and immunotherapeutic (tocilizumab, dexamethasone, and baricitinib) therapy showed some beneficial outcomes. Until March 2021, 4952 clinical trials have been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov toward the drug and vaccine development for COVID-19. More than 100 countries have participated in contributing to these clinical trials. Other than the registered clinical trials (medium to large-size), several small-size clinical trials have also been conducted from time to time to evaluate the treatment of COVID-19. Four molecules showed beneficial therapeutic to treat COVID-19 patients. The short-term repurposing of the existing drug may provide a successful outcome for COVID-19 patients. Therefore, more clinical trials can be initiated using potential anti-viral molecules by evaluating in different phases of clinical trials.","output":"The Drug Repurposing for COVID-19 Clinical Trials Provide Very Effective Therapeutic Combinations: Lessons Learned From Major Clinical Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly throughout the world since the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were observed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has been suspected that infected persons who remain asymptomatic play a significant role in the ongoing pandemic, but their relative number and effect have been uncertain. The authors sought to review and synthesize the available evidence on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asymptomatic persons seem to account for approximately 40% to 45% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and they can transmit the virus to others for an extended period, perhaps longer than 14 days. Asymptomatic infection may be associated with subclinical lung abnormalities, as detected by computed tomography. Because of the high risk for silent spread by asymptomatic persons, it is imperative that testing programs include those without symptoms. To supplement conventional diagnostic testing, which is constrained by capacity, cost, and its one-off nature, innovative tactics for public health surveillance, such as crowdsourcing digital wearable data and monitoring sewage sludge, might be helpful.","output":"Prevalence of Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation is recognised as a treatment option for patients with propionic acidemia (PA) and those with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) without renal impairment. In patients with MMA and moderate-to-severe renal impairment, combined liverCkidney transplantation is indicated. However, clinical experience of these transplantation options in patients with PA and MMA remains limited and fragmented. We undertook an overview of post-transplantation outcomes in patients with PA and MMA using the current available evidence. METHODS: A literature search identified publications on the use of transplantation in patients with PA and MMA. Publications were considered if they presented adequate demographic and outcome data from patients with PA or MMA. Publications that did not report any specific outcomes for patients or provided insufficient data were excluded. RESULTS: Seventy publications were identified of which 38 were full papers. A total of 373 patients underwent liver/kidney/combined liverCkidney transplantation for PA or MMA. The most typical reason for transplantation was recurrent metabolic decompensation. A total of 27 post-transplant deaths were reported in patients with PA [14.0% (27/194)]. For patients with MMA, 18 post-transplant deaths were reported [11% (18/167)]. A total of 62 complications were reported in 115 patients with PA (54%) with cardiomyopathy (n = 12), hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT; n = 14) and viral infections (n = 12) being the most commonly reported. A total of 52 complications were reported in 106 patients with MMA (49%) with viral infections (n = 14) and renal failure/impairment (n = 10) being the most commonly reported. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation and combined liverCkidney transplantation appears to benefit some patients with PA or MMA, respectively, but this approach does not provide complete correction of the metabolic defect and some patients remain at risk from disease-related and transplantation-related complications, including death. Thus, all treatment avenues should be exhausted before consideration of organ transplantation and the benefits of this approach must be weighed against the risk of perioperative complications on an individual basis.","output":"Post-transplantation Outcomes in Patients with PA or MMA: A Review of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, online classes in India as in other parts of the world, became a prioritised source for learning.

We conducted a bench study to verify the performance of an alternative, easily applicable airway device that allows better visualization of trackways during Trachway-assisted intubation and prevents the detrimental effects of apnea-related hypoxia. We conducted a bench study to thoroughly evaluate the oral-secretion-elimination ability of a newly designed oxygen delivery device (ODD) to improve vocal-cord visualization using the three commonly used ETT sizes (i.e., 7, 7.5, and 8 mm). Moreover, we measured the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) under different, continuous oxygen-flow supplies (1-10 L/min) during intubation. Each condition was analyzed for a 2 min video-stylet-intubation period. The supplemental oxygen flow and FiO2 fraction achieved using our ODD were higher, and smaller ETTs exhibited better secretion elimination. The ODD, which can be easily coupled with Trachway stylets, enabled high-quality visualization during oxygen flows of 6-8 L/min, and higher FiO2 fractions were achieved at higher oxygen flow rates. The use of the ODD improved the visualization of the airways during video stylet-assisted intubations using the additional FiO2 supply.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multifaceted, dynamic methodology, iteratively gathering cognitive, emotional and social insights, was used to support and conduct in-depth, immersion interviews across the USA with 59 HCPs in-office and in roundtable discussions, and 20 patient-support partner dyads in-home. RESULTS: Patients were aged >18 years, primarily female, and all were diagnosed with CRPS (limited to type 1 in this patient cohort). Results show that the current state of CRPS treatment may fall short in multiple key areas. In some cases, poor awareness of CRPS causes delayed diagnoses impacting the opportunity for early treatment, resulting in long-term poor health outcomes. Consequently, the CRPS patient journey may be characterized by clinical frustration of physicians and disappointment for some patients. The poor treatment experiences and outcomes for some patients and HCPs may build the perception of a non-collaborative relationship. HCPs and patients agree that an effective treatment would be one that addresses CRPS rather than its symptoms, and the availability of such an option would transform the treatment experience. CONCLUSION: CRPS leads to cognitive, social and emotional burdens for patients and their caregivers. There is an unmet need for improved CRPS disease awareness and successful therapeutic options to aid in earlier diagnoses, effective treatment and better outcomes for HCPs, patients, and their caregivers.","output":"Complex Regional Pain Syndrome: A Comprehensive Qualitative Research Study on Unmet Needs in the Patient Journey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the 19(th )century, appropriate lymphadenectomy has been considered a cornerstone of oncologic surgery and one of the most important prognostic factors. This approach can be applied to any surgery for gastrointestinal cancer. During surgery for colon and rectal cancer, an adequate portion of the mesentery is removed together with the segment of bowel affected by the disease. The adequate number of lymph nodes to be removed is standardized and reported by several guidelines. It is mandatory to determine the appropriate extent of lymphadenectomy and to balance its oncological benefits with the increased morbidity associated with its execution in cancer patients. Our review focuses on the concept of complete mesenteric excision (CME) with central vascular ligation (CVL), a radical lymphadenectomy for colorectal cancer that has gained increasing interest in recent years. The aim of this study was to evaluate the evolution of this approach over the years, its potential oncologic benefits and potential risks, and the improvements offered by laparoscopic techniques. Theoretical advantages of CME are improved local-relapse rates due to complete removal of the intact mesocolic fascia and improved distance recurrence rates due to ligation of vessels at their origin (CVL) which guarantees removal of a larger number of lymph nodes. The development and worldwide diffusion of laparoscopic techniques minimized postoperative trauma in oncologic surgery, providing the same oncologic results as open surgery. This has been widely applied to colorectal cancer surgery; however, CME entails a technical complexity that can limit its wide minimally-invasive application. This review analyzes results of these procedures in terms of oncological outcomes, technical feasibility and complexity, especially within the context of minimally invasive surgery.","output":"Complete mesocolic excision and central vascular ligation in colorectal cancer in the era of minimally invasive surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Latin America, with its culturally and ethnically diverse populations, its burgeoning economies, high levels of violence, growing political instability, and its striking levels of inequality, is a region that is difficult to define and to understand.

We aimed to assess physicians attitude among different medical specialties towards this sudden and unexpected shift of traditional face-to-face meetings into webinars, and to suggest future recommendations. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, internet-based survey study using a 25-item questionnaire, from November 1 and November 15, 2020. The survey was created and distributed to physicians from different medical and surgical specialties and from different countries via several social media platforms, using a snowball technique. RESULTS: A total of 326 physicians responded; 165 (50.6%) were females, mean age of responders was 38.7  7.5 years. The majority of responses (93.2%) came from Arab countries.

In terms of the school's overall response to COVID-19, 73.1% students thought it was effective. The majority (83%) of students believed that social distancing in school can minimize the development of COVID-19. In general, students felt that clinical education suffered after transitioning to online but responded more positively about adjustments to other online curricular components. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted dental education. Our findings indicate that students are experiencing increased levels of stress and feel their clinical education has suffered. Most students appear comfortable with technology adaptations for didactic curriculum and favor masks, social distancing, and liberal use of sanitizers.","output":"In an era of uncertainty: Impact of COVID-19 on dental education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Several risk factors including unhealthy lifestyle, genetic background, obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, smoking, age, etc. contribute to the development of coronary atherosclerosis and subsequent coronary artery disease. Inflammation plays an important role in coronary artery disease development and progression. Pro-inflammatory signals promote the degradation of tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway resulting in the formation of several immunomodulatory metabolites. An unbalanced kynurenic pathway has been implicated in the pathomechanisms of various diseases including CAD. Significant improvements in detection methods in the last decades may allow simultaneous measurement of multiple metabolites of the kynurenine pathway and such a thorough analysis of the kynurenine pathway may be a valuable tool for risk stratification and determination of CAD prognosis. Nevertheless, imbalance in the activities of different branches of the kynurenine pathway may require careful interpretation. In this review, we aim to summarize clinical evidence supporting a possible use of kynurenine pathway metabolites as clinical biomarkers in various manifestations of CAD.","output":"Kynurenine Pathway Metabolites as Potential Clinical Biomarkers in Coronary Artery Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The general medical impacts of coronavirus (COVID-19) are increasingly appreciated. However, its impact on neurocognitive, psychiatric health and quality of life (QoL) in survivors after the acute phase is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate neurocognitive function, psychiatric symptoms and QoL in COVID-19 survivors shortly after hospital discharge. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 survivors followed up for 2 months after discharge. A battery of standardized instruments evaluating neurocognitive function, psychiatric morbidity and QoL (mental and physical components) was administered by telephone. RESULTS: Of the 229 screened patients, 179 were included in the final analysis. Amongst survivors, the prevalence of moderately impaired immediate verbal memory and learning was 38%, delayed verbal memory (11.8%), verbal fluency (34.6%) and working memory (executive function) (6.1%), respectively. Moreover, 58.7% of patients had neurocognitive impairment in at least one function. Rates of positive screening for anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were 29.6%, 26.8% and 25.1%, respectively. In addition, 39.1% of the patients had psychiatric morbidity. Low QoL for physical and mental components was detected in 44.1% and 39.1% of patients respectively. Delirium and psychiatric morbidity were associated with neurocognitive impairment, and female gender was related with psychiatric morbidity. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized COVID-19 survivors showed a considerable prevalence of neurocognitive impairment, psychiatric morbidity and poor QoL in the short term.

A common mechanism of host recognition by viruses is to utilize a portion of the host cell as a receptor. Bacteriophage Sf6, which infects Shigella flexneri, uses lipopolysaccharide as a primary receptor and then requires interaction with a secondary receptor, a role that can be fulfilled by either outer membrane proteins (Omp) A or C. Our previous work showed that specific residues in the loops of OmpA mediate Sf6 infection. To better understand Sf6 interactions with OmpA loop variants, we determined the kinetics of these interactions through the use of biolayer interferometry, an optical biosensing technique that yields data similar to surface plasmon resonance. Here, we successfully tethered whole Sf6 virions, determined the binding constant of Sf6 to OmpA to be 36 nM. Additionally, we showed that Sf6 bound to five variant OmpAs and the resulting kinetic parameters varied only slightly. Based on these data, we propose a model in which Sf6: Omp receptor recognition is not solely based on kinetics, but likely also on the ability of an Omp to induce a conformational change that results in productive infection.","output":"Kinetic Analysis of Bacteriophage Sf6 Binding to Outer Membrane Protein A Using Whole Virions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Ryan White Program (RWP) in Miami-Dade County, Florida made several modifications to keep HIV care accessible during the COVID-19 Pandemic, including expanding telehealth services, increasing access to HIV medications, and waiving required lab tests for service recertification.

We aimed to assess how that had affected our cohort of bariatric patients waiting for surgery. METHODS: A review of electronic records and a structured phone interview with each patient were conducted. Changes in severity of obesity were analyzed using the Obesity Surgery Score (OSS) and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the validated EQ-5D questionnaire. Other miscellaneous questions about behavior modifications and surgical risk perception were also analyzed. RESULTS: All 51 patients fully answered the questionnaires. Mean age was 47 years and mean time on waiting list 91 days. Mean BMI increased during LD (42.7 vs 43.2; p < 0.001). Both OSS (2.84 vs 3; p = 0.011) and EQ-5D (69 vs 64; p < 0.001) mildly worsened during LD, mainly due to psychosocial issues. Twenty-seven patients (53%) thought that perioperative risks were higher under the current circumstances but they were as willing to undergo surgery as those who believed that the risks had not increased (74% vs 87%, p = 0.2).

Their lifespan is close to the populations level but their quality of life has sharply declined due to depression and substance use. Mental health disorders are widespread among an aging population with HIV. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to build a decision analytic model to evaluate medical interventions with and without mental health treatment using primary data of 139 older adults with HIV and health outcomes from the literature. METHODS: We tracked the progression of depression and cumulative deaths among older adults with HIV using a Markov model with 50 annual cycles through three health states. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses addressed uncertainty in estimating the parameters and around the models assumptions. RESULTS: An integrated medical and behavioral care system is cost effective at a willingness to pay of $50,000 per QALY compared with medical care only. The incremental cost was $516,452 and the incremental effectiveness was 38.8 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,316 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate and efficacious referrals to integrated medical + behavioral services, either in the same facility or connected to their primary care doctor, are instrumental to reverse loses in quality of life and avoid premature death. If mental health is left unattended, HIV would progress, causing declines in quality of life and ultimately triggering premature death.

However, methodologies for rigorous and inclusive data gathering and integrative analysis of biomedical, cultural, and social factors are limited. In this paper, we propose a digital strategy for large-scale qualitative health research, using play (as a state of being, a communication mode or context, and a set of imaginative, expressive, and game-like activities) as a research method for recursive learning and action planning. Our proposal builds on Gregory Bateson's cybernetic approach to knowledge production. Using chronic pain as an example, we show how pragmatic, structural and cultural constraints that define the relationship of patients to the healthcare system can give rise to conflicted messaging that impedes inclusive health research. We then review existing literature to illustrate how different types of play including games, chatbots, virtual worlds, and creative art making can contribute to research in chronic pain. Inspired by Frederick Steier's application of Bateson's theory to designing a science museum, we propose DiSPORA (Digital Strategy for Play-Oriented Research and Action), a virtual citizen science laboratory which provides a framework for delivering health information, tools for play-based experimentation, and data collection capacity, but is flexible in allowing participants to choose the mode and the extent of their interaction.

The current study aimed to provide policymakers, academics, and researchers with a snapshot of global SDGs-related research activity. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional descriptive bibliometric study. SciVerse Scopus was used to retrieve SDGs-related research publications for the period from 2015 to 2019. RESULTS: In total, 18,696 documents were found. The Sustainability journal ranked first (n = 1008; 5.4%) in the number of SDGs-related publications. The World Health Organization was the most active institution in publishing SDGs-related documents (n = 581; 1.3%). Most of the retrieved documents belonged to SDG 17 (partnership) followed by SDG 13 (climate action), and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), while SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) had the least number of publications. The European region (n = 9756; 52.2%) had the highest research contribution while the Eastern Mediterranean region (n = 1052; 5.6%) had the least contribution. After exclusion of SDG 17, the SDG 3 (good health and well-being) was the top researched SDG for the African region, the Eastern Mediterranean regions, and the South-Eastern Asian region. For the region of the Americas, European region, and the Western Pacific region, the SDG 13 (climate action) was the most researched. The SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) was the least researched in the African region, the region of the Americas, the European region, and the South-East Asian region. In the Eastern Mediterranean region, SDG 10 (reduced inequality) was the least researched while in the Western Pacific region, SDG 5 (gender inequality) was the least researched. The most researched targets of SDG 3 were targets 7 (sexual and reproductive health services) and 8 (universal health coverage) while the least researched targets were 5 (substance use disorders) and 9 (death from hazardous materials). International research collaboration within SDG 3 between high- and low-income countries was inadequate.

Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted prospectively on a total of 48 patients with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and a negative RT-PCR assay that was presented to the Diagnostic Radiology Department of Capital Hospital, Islamabad from July 2020 to December 2020. These patients were included via non-probability consecutive sampling, had a positive history of contact with a known COVID-19 patient and/or any two of the following signs and symptoms; fever, cough, malaise, body aches, arthralgia, new-onset loss of taste and smell, and dyspnea or oxygen saturation less than 85%. A detailed history was sought after informed consent and all these patients underwent non-contrast HRCT chest scans that were reported by an experienced consultant radiologist. The scans showing positive features for COVID-19 pneumonia were assessed for the nature and distribution of the disease. Results Amongst 48 suspects with negative RT-PCR assay, 38 (79.2%) showed ground-glass opacities, a hallmark feature of COVID-19 pneumonia. A total of 22 (57.89%) of these 38 patients had ground-glass opacities with a crazy-paving pattern, nine (23.68%) mixed ground-glass opacities with consolidation, and seven (18.42%) had pure ground-glass opacities. Among these 79.2% suspects, ground-glass opacities were multifocal in 37 (97.37%), bilateral in 35 (92.10%), peripheral in 36 (94.74%), and dorsally located in 32 (81.6%) cases.

Hence, the aim of this study was to screen the cisplatin resistance-related genes of esophageal cancer using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology and Brunello iBar library. Of note, we identified ERCC8 as a novel cisplatin-resistant gene by high-throughput sequencing and cisplatin resistance assays. Based on KEGG and GO analysis, we hypothesized that the mechanism of ERCC8 involvement in cisplatin resistance is through binding to damaged DNA to perform nucleotide excision repair, contributing to the restoration of basic DNA functions and cellular life activities in ESCA. In addition, Cell proliferation and wound healing assay confirmed that ERCC8 had little effect on the proliferation and migration of esophageal cancer cells in vitro. Survival analysis showed that ERCC8 expression was not associated with OS, DSS, or FPI in patients with ESCA. Immuno-infiltration analysis indicated that increased ERCC8 expression is associated with NK cells, macrophages, T helper cells, Th1 cells, and Th2 cells.

This study aimed to validate the VENUSS prognostic model in a large multi-institutional European cohort of patients with histopathologically proven papRCC after curative surgery for non-metastatic disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 980 patients undergoing partial or radical nephrectomy for sporadic, unilateral and non-metastatic papRCC between 1987 and 2020 were included from 7 European tertiary institutions. The primary outcome was the prediction of DR by VENUSS score and VENUSS risk groups. Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, Cox-regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used in statistical methods. The Concordance (C) Index was calculated to assess model's discriminatory power. RESULTS: The median age was 64 (IQR:55-70) years and 82.6 % (n = 809) of patients were male. Median VENUSS score was 2 (IQR: 0-4), and 62.9 % (n = 617), 23.9 % (n = 234) and 13.2 % (n = 129) of patients was classified into low, intermediate and high risk according to the VENUSS model, respectively. At a median follow-up of 48 (IQR:23-88) months, the disease recurred in 6.6%, 18.8% and 63.8%, and the 5-year recurrence-free survival was 93.8%, 80.7% and 26.7% in low, intermediate and high-risk groups, respectively. (P < 0.001) Each increase in VENUSS score had 1.52-fold (95%CI:1.45-1.60, P < 0.001) DR risk. Compared with the VENUSS low risk, the intermediate risk had a 2.91-fold increased DR risk (95%CI:1.90-4.46, P < 0.001) and 17.9-fold (95%CI:12.25-26.25, P < 0.001) in high risk, while it was 6.07-fold greater in high risk vs. intermediate risk (95%CI:4.17-8.83, P < 0.001).

IAIs are now widely performed and recommended as the initial or only treatment of oligoarticular JIA and ancillary treatment of actively inflamed joints in other varieties of JIA. However, the performance of the procedure is currently not guided by standardized recommendations, and several practice variations are observed. METHODS This worldwide survey of pediatric rheumatologists (with 48.5% response from Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization [PRINTO and Pediatric Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group [PRCSG] members) captures the differences in pre-procedural, procedural and post-procedural protocols and practices observed across the globe and asks the necessity of developing consensus in this area of Pediatric Rheumatology. RESULTS This worldwide survey of Pediatric Rheumatologists had a response rate of just under 50% and the views of about 42% who routinely performed the procedure. It captured the differences in IAI protocols and practices observed across the globe. Significant variations in practice were noted in use of Local anesthesia, choice, and dose of therapeutic agent for the intraarticular injection and use of ultrasound to guide injections. While some practice variations may be explained by institutional protocols in different parts of the world, the clinical implications of these are largely unknown and beg the need for further studies.

Similar coronavirus epidemics over the past years affected healthcare workers significantly. Aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) presented a unique risk to ear, nose and throat (ENT) Surgeons. We introduce various methods of reducing risk in ENT AGPs. RECOMMENDATIONS: During trachesostomies we advocate the adoption of a specialist checklist based on ENT UK guidelines. We also advise the use of a clear drape to create a clear barrier between the patient and staff. For ear surgery we advise suturing 2 microscope pieces together end-to-end so that a clear drape can sperate the patient from surgeon. During nasal and sinus surgery, we advise attaching a clear drape to the sterile camera drape used in rigid nasal endoscopy to create a barrier between patient and surgeon. DISCUSSION: Our recommendations will create an extra barrier between the patient and the rest of healthcare team. This should reduce the risks to theatre staff from AGPs.

METHODS: This prospective data analysis was based on chart reviews for laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs over a 1-mo period. The NEWS2, CRB-65, qSOFA, and SIRS were calculated from the first recorded vital signs upon admission to ICU and assessed for predicting mortality. RESULTS: Total of 140 patients aged between 18 and 95 y were included in the analysis of whom majority were >60 y (47.8%), with evidence of pre-existing comorbidities (67.1%). The most common symptom at presentation was dyspnea (86.4%). Based upon the receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (AUC), the best discriminatory power to predict ICU mortality was for the CRB-65 (AUC: 0.720 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.630-0.811]) followed closely by NEWS2 (AUC: 0.712 [95% CI: 0.622-0.803]). Additionally, a multivariate Cox regression model showed Glasgow Coma Scale score at time of admission (P < 0.001; adjusted hazard ratio = 0.808 [95% CI: 0.715-0.911]) to be the only significant predictor of ICU mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CRB-65 and NEWS2 scores assessed at the time of ICU admission offer only a fair discriminatory value for predicting mortality. Further evaluation after adding laboratory markers such as C-reactive protein and D-dimer may yield a more useful prediction model. Much of the earlier data is from developed countries and uses scoring at time of hospital admission. This study was from a developing country, with the scores assessed at time of ICU admission, rather than the emergency department as with existing data from developed countries, for patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 disease. Because the scores showed some utility for predicting ICU mortality even when measured at time of ICU admission, their use in allocation of limited ICU resources in a developing country merits further research.","output":"Early Warning Scores at Time of ICU Admission to Predict Mortality in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk from nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from virus laden aerosols. This study aimed to: 1) quantify the degree of protection from virus aerosol provided by different types of mask (surgical, N95, fit-tested N95) and personal protective equipment (PPE); 2) determine if the use of a portable HEPA filter can enhance the effectiveness of PPE; 3) determine the effectiveness of a decontamination shower to remove virus aerosol contamination of a HCW. Methods: Virus aerosol exposure experiments were conducted using bacteriophage PhiX174 (10^8 copies/mL). A HCW wearing PPE (mask, gloves, gown, faceshield) was exposed to nebulised viruses for 40mins in a sealed clinical room. After exiting, the HCW doffed PPE. Virus exposure was quantified via skin swabs applied to the face and nostrils, forearms, neck, and forehead. Experiments were performed with and without the presence of a portable HEPA filter (set to 470m3/hr). Findings: Swabs quantified significant virus exposure under the surgical and N95 mask. Only the fit-tested N95 resulted in lower virus counts compared to no mask control (p=0.027). Nasal swabs demonstrated very high virus exposure, which was not mitigated by the surgical or N95 masks, although there was a trend for the fit-tested N95 mask to reduce virus counts (p=0.058). The addition of HEPA filtration substantially reduced virus counts from all swab sites, and to near zero levels when combined with a fit-tested N95 mask, gloves, gown and faces shield. Virus counts were substantially reduced to near zero levels following a shower. Interpretation: These data demonstrate that quantitatively fit tested N95 masks combined with a HEPA filter can offer protection against high virus aerosol loads at close range and for prolonged periods of time. Skin contamination from virus aerosol can be effectively by removed by showering.

We also define four different protocols for robust evaluation of semantic segmentation and classification algorithms. Finally, we benchmark the defined protocols and report the results using popular deep learning models as a part of this study. Results: For semantic segmentation, Mask-RCNN performs the best among all the models with a DICE score of 0.43.

Contemparaneous laboratory diagnosis has not been available previously. Objectives: To assess the proportion of influenza-like illness (ILI) attributable to influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and picornavirus infection during the winter season. To compare the influenza PCR data with serology of paired blood samples. Study design: Combined nose and throat swabs, from patients with ILI attending 15 general practices across Scotland, were submitted to the laboratory in virus PCR sample solution (VPSS). The extracted nucleic acid was tested using a multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Serological analysis was performed on paired serum samples using complement fixation assays. The rate of influenza virus positivity was compared with reports of ILI obtained from the SSGP network. Results: Of 240 samples received at the laboratory, 132 (55%) were PCR positive for influenza A virus. There were nine (3.8%) picornavirus and three (1.2%) RSV PCR positives, two (0.8%) were dual influenza A/picornavirus infections. Ninety four (39.2%) were negative for all viruses tested. Results on paired sera from 89 patients showed a rising titre to influenza A in 48 of the 57 PCR positive samples (84.2%). One PCR negative patient displayed a significant rising titre to influenza A. Virological data paralleled the SSGP data but was available at least a week earlier. Conclusions: Influenza A infection was detected in the majority of patients with ILI; picornavirus infection was also shown to be an important cause of illness.

A feco-oral transmission route is suspected, and clinical or asymptomatic infected horses appear to be responsible for direct and indirect transmission of ECoV. A presumptive clinical diagnosis of ECoV infection may be suggested by clinical presentation and hematological abnormalities such as leukopenia due to lymphopenia and/or neutropenia. Confirmation of ECoV infection is provided by specific ECoV nucleic acid detection in feces by quantitative PCR or demonstration of coronavirus antigen by immunohistochemistry or electron microscopy in intestinal biopsy material obtained ante- or postmortem. The disease is generally self-limiting and horses typically recover with symptomatic supportive care. Complications associated with disruption of the gastrointestinal barrier have been reported in some infected horses and include endotoxemia, septicemia, and hyperammonemia-associated encephalopathy.

The aim of this study was to investigate prevalence, incidence and outcomes across a range of specific CVDs among homeless individuals. METHODS AND RESULTS : Using linked UK primary care electronic health records (EHRs) and validated phenotypes, we identified homeless individuals aged 16 years between 1998 and 2019, and age- and sex-matched housed controls in a 1:5 ratio. For 12 CVDs (stable angina; unstable angina; myocardial infarction; sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest; unheralded coronary death; heart failure; transient ischaemic attack; ischaemic stroke; subarachnoid haemorrhage; intracerebral haemorrhage; peripheral arterial disease; abdominal aortic aneurysm), we estimated prevalence, incidence, and 1-year mortality post-diagnosis, comparing homeless and housed groups. We identified 8492 homeless individuals (32 134 matched housed individuals). Comorbidities and risk factors were more prevalent in homeless people, e.g. smoking: 78.1% vs. 48.3% and atrial fibrillation: 9.9% vs. 8.6%, P < 0.001. CVD prevalence (11.6% vs. 6.5%), incidence (14.7 vs. 8.1 per 1000 person-years), and 1-year mortality risk [adjusted hazard ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29C2.08, P < 0.001] were higher, and onset was earlier (difference 4.6, 95% CI 2.8C6.3 years, P < 0.001), in homeless, compared with housed people. Homeless individuals had higher CVD incidence in all three arterial territories than housed people. CONCLUSION : CVD in homeless individuals has high prevalence, incidence, and 1-year mortality risk post-diagnosis with earlier onset, and high burden of risk factors.

In order to assure uniform levels of safety and reduce the social and economic impact of medium to high earthquakes costly seismic intervention plans have been proposed. But their application, in order to define which building should primarily be retrofitted, requires adequate vulnerability assessment methodologies, able to model the effective non-linear response and to identify the relevant failure modes of the structure. In the case of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings, due to the lack of application of capacity design principles and the aging effects due to exposition to an aggressive environment, existing structures can exhibit premature failures with a reduction of available strength and ductility. In the last couple of decades some state-of-the-art simplified models aiming at capturing the complex interaction between shear and flexural damage mechanisms as well as behavior of rebar corrosion have been proposed in specialized literature and, in some cases, implemented in regulatory building codes and guidelines.

Many surgeons use clinical predictors to guide selective use of upper gastrointestinal imaging (UGI). The appropriate practice remains undefined. STUDY DESIGN A review of patients who underwent primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between January 2002 and December 2008 was conducted. All underwent routine UGI studies on postoperative day 1. Actual gastrojejunal leak within 7 days of surgery (actual leak [AL], radiologic leaks), operative reports, patient charts, and postoperative vital signs were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS There were 2,099 operations. Eight ALs (0.43%) occurred without associated mortality. UGI was positive in 7 AL patients and falsely positive in 6 patients. The AL patients underwent laparoscopy on postoperative days 1 and 3 (n = 5 and n = 1, respectively), laparotomy on postoperative day 3 (n = 1), and peritoneal drainage (n = 1). False-positive UGIs prompted laparoscopy (n = 3) and close observation (n = 3). Pulse was 100 to 120 beats per minute in 2 patients and fever (>38.5C) was present in 0 AL patients. AL patients had osteogenesis imperfecta (n = 1), macronodular cirrhosis (n = 1), positive bubble test (n = 3), and concomitant splenectomy (n = 1). No jejunojejunostomy leaks were identified. CONCLUSIONS Routine UGI after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has greater sensitivity than clinical signs for detecting gastrojejunal leak. Delay in the diagnosis of leakage can impact mortality, and this suggests that indications for routine UGI might still exist. Tachycardia is not a reliable early marker of leak. There might be risk factors for leak in addition to vital signs, including patient medical history or intraoperative events, which should prompt routine UGI on postoperative day 1.","output":"Routine upper gastrointestinal imaging is superior to clinical signs for detecting gastrojejunal leak after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During May 2020-April 2021, the estimated number of drug overdose deaths in the United States exceeded 100,000 over a 12-month period for the first time, with 64.0% of deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (mainly illicitly manufactured fentanyls [IMFs], which include both fentanyl and illicit fentanyl analogs).* Introduced primarily as adulterants in or replacements for white powder heroin east of the Mississippi River (1), IMFs are now widespread in white powder heroin markets, increasingly pressed into counterfeit pills resembling oxycodone, alprazolam, or other prescription drugs, and are expanding into new markets, including in the western United States?

In this paper, we describe and evaluate the operation of a central access and triage system for patients with rectal bleeding, which uses a high-risk/ low-risk designation based on the referring doctors subjective designation and a 10-item symptom checklist. METHODS: A total of 1846 patients, referred between February 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, were included. Exclusion criteria were the following: incorrect patient identification number, duplicate records, and pre-diagnosed gastrointestinal cancer. Data was obtained by chart review. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for each item on the symptom checklist. RESULTS: Eight hundred seventy-nine (48%) patients received endoscopy, and 37 (2%) were found to have cancer. Five hundred eighty-two (32%) patients were deemed high-risk. Twenty-nine (78%) of the patients with cancer were in the high-risk group. Patients in the high-risk group had a higher incidence of cancer (5.0% vs 0.6%, p < 0.001) and shorter waits to endoscopy (201 vs 292 days). Patients designated as high-risk by the referring physician had a relative risk of 22.3 compared to those designated as low-risk. Patients deemed high-risk by the symptom checklist had a relative risk of 3.5 compared to low-risk patients. CONCLUSION: Our system stratified 29/37 (78%) of the patients found to have cancer as high-risk. A total of 8/37 (22%) patients with cancer were deemed low-risk.

Here we show that the expression of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV2 cell receptor, increases during aging in mouse and human lungs, and following telomere shortening or dysfunction in mammalian cells and in mouse models. This increase is regulated at the transcription level, and Ace2 promoter activity is DNA damage response (DDR)-dependent. Indeed, ATM inhibition or the selective inhibition of telomeric DDR, through the use of antisense oligonucleotides, prevents Ace2 upregulation following telomere damage, in cultured cells and in mice. We propose that during aging telomeric shortening, by triggering DDR activation, causes the upregulation of ACE2, the SARS-CoV2 cell receptor, thus making the elderly likely more susceptible to the infection.","output":"DNA damage response at telomeres boosts the transcription of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 during aging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses. METHODS: We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection. FINDINGS: Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37-75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 52 log10 copies per mL (IQR 41-70). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope -015, 95% CI -019 to -011; R2=071). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's &#961;=048, 95% CI 0074-075; p=0020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2>09). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples. INTERPRETATION: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.

In neurons, clusters of these vesiculotubular structures are situated throughout the cell in proximity to the ER, passing cargo to the cis-Golgi cisternae, located mainly in the perinuclear region. Although ERGIC markers have been identified in neurons, the distribution and dynamics of neuronal ERGIC structures have not been characterized yet. Here, we show that long-distance ERGIC transport occurs via an intermittent mechanism in dendrites, with mobile elements moving between stationary structures. Slow and fast live-cell imaging have captured stable ERGIC structures remaining in place over long periods of time, as well as mobile ERGIC structures advancing very short distances along dendrites. These short distances have been consistent with the lengths between the stationary ERGIC structures. Kymography revealed ERGIC elements that moved intermittently, emerging from and fusing with stationary ERGIC structures. Interestingly, this movement apparently depends not only on the integrity of the microtubule cytoskeleton, as previously reported, but on the actin cytoskeleton as well. Our results indicate that the dendritic ERGIC has a dual nature, with both stationary and mobile structures. The neural ERGIC network transports proteins via a stop-and-go movement in which both the microtubule and the actin cytoskeletons participate. This article is protected by copyright.

All adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure related to confirmed COVID-19, on invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), with imaging or surgical findings documenting necrotizing pneumonia (NP) were included. (3) Results: Of 936 patients with COVID-19 that required IMV, 42 (4.5%) developed NP. Overall mortality was 57% and in-hospital mortality was 71%, occurring 15C79 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. NP was diagnosed at a median of 27 days after COVID-19 symptom onset and 15.5 days after initiation of IMV. Infections were polymicrobial in 52.4% of patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae (57%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33%) were the most common etiologic agents. Pulmonary embolism (PE) was documented in 13 patients overall (31%), and in 50% of patients who underwent an angioCT. Drainage and/or surgical procedures were performed on 19 patients (45.2%) with a 75% mortality rate.

METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study targeted tertiary hospitals in Jeddah. An electronic survey, consisting of 34 questions, was developed and distributed to pharmacy directors or their representatives to investigate the hospital pharmacies preparedness and pharmacist roles during disasters in the city of Jeddah. RESULTS: Six hospitals participated in the survey, with a 100% response rate. All respondents confirmed the presence of disaster plans involving pharmacy departments. Hospital committee consensuses determined which medication to stock in five hospitals (83.3%). All six respondents (100%) agreed that the following medication supplies were adequate in the event of disasters: analgesics, rapid sequence intubation medications (ie, sedatives and paralytics), respiratory medications, antimicrobials, and maintenance intravenous (IV) fluids. There was disagreement on the adequacy of wound infection prophylaxis, vasopressors/inotropes, antiemetic medications, ophthalmic medications, and antidotes for chemical weapons. There were discrepancies on pharmacist roles during disaster, but hospitals agreed on the following roles: maintain effective distribution and control, collaborate on medication management, and develop and maintain first-aid skills. CONCLUSION: All included facilities have emergency preparedness plans for the hospitals and the pharmacy departments. However, the type and quantities of stocked medications, as well as pharmacist roles, are not well recognized.

The aims of the present animal study in pigs were to verify: (1) the feasibility of the trans-umbilical route compared with the trans-oral route in gastric upper body ESD; (2) the non-inferiority of single port laparoscopic lymph node dissection (LLND) compared with multiport LLND; and (3) the safety of 2-basin LLND (upper greater and lesser curvature). METHODS We separated the pigs (~40 kg each) into two groups: conventional and experimental (n = 5 per group). We performed ESD in the fundus and upper body anterior wall (UBAW) via the trans-oral route and multiport LLND in the conventional group, and via the trans-umbilical route and single port LLND in the experimental group. RESULTS The completion rates, tissue weights, and specimen diameters of both routes showed no statistical differences in either the fundus or the UBAW. The operative time was shorter with the trans-umbilical route than with the trans-oral route in both areas (p < 0.05). In LLND, there were no differences in surgical outcomes between the multiport and single port groups. Intraoperative perforation was seen in the trans-oral route group (n = 1). Delayed perforation was observed in 30 % of the ESD sites. CONCLUSIONS The trans-umbilical route is feasible and has lower complication rates than the trans-oral route in gastric upper body ESD. Additionally, single port LLND is not inferior to multiport LLND, and one-side-basin dissection is safer than two-side.","output":"Feasibility of the trans-umbilical route compared with the trans-oral route in gastric upper body endoscopic submucosal dissection: a porcine model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the COVID-19 outbreak, it has become important to automatically detect whether people are wearing masks in order to reduce risk of front-line workers.

METHODS Fourteen men and four women with traumatic SCI (age: 44  18 years; C2-T11; AIS A-D; 1-383 months post-injury) participated in two electrophysiological testing sessions separated by an average of 1 day. During each session, sudomotor function was tested supine by recordings of SSRs in both hands and feet. Two stimulation approaches were chosen: median nerve stimulation and a deep breath maneuver. SSR recordings were analyzed as SSR scores representing the presence or absence of responses. In addition, SSR amplitude and latencies were calculated. Test-retest reliability for the SSR score was calculated by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and its confidence interval. Coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for SSR amplitudes and latencies. RESULTS SSR score to median nerve stimulation demonstrated 'almost perfect' reliability with ICCs of 0.97 and 0.96, for both hands and feet, respectively. The SSR score to deep breath maneuver was slightly lower, such as 0.89 and 0.74 for hands and feet. The CV of SSR amplitudes to median nerve stimulation was 48 and 18% for hands and feet, respectively, and 7 and 12% for the latency.

Despite its longstanding use in the plastic surgery community, substantial controversy remains regarding the optimal method of processing harvested lipoaspirate before grafting. This evidence-based review builds on prior examinations of the literature to evaluate both established and novel methods for lipoaspirate processing. METHODS A comprehensive, systematic review of the literature was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE in January of 2015 to identify all relevant publications subsequent to the most recent review on this topic. Randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, and comparative studies comparing at least two of the following techniques were included: decanting, cotton gauze (Telfa) rolling, centrifugation, washing, filtration, and stromal vascular fraction isolation. RESULTS Nine articles comparing various methods of processing human fat for autologous grafting were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Five compared established processing techniques (i.e., decanting, cotton gauze rolling, centrifugation, and washing) and four publications evaluated newer proprietary technologies, including washing, filtration, and/or methods to isolate stromal vascular fraction. CONCLUSIONS The authors failed to find compelling evidence to advocate a single technique as the superior method for processing lipoaspirate in preparation for autologous fat grafting. A paucity of high-quality data continues to limit the clinician's ability to determine the optimal method for purifying harvested adipose tissue. Novel automated technologies hold promise, particularly for large-volume fat grafting; however, extensive additional research is required to understand their true utility and efficiency in clinical settings.","output":"Roll, Spin, Wash, or Filter?

Therefore, we sought to investigate the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 following natural infection and following a single dose of AZD2221, in Sri Lankan individuals. MethodsUsing Luminex assays, we characterized the IgG and IgA responses in patients with varying severity of illness and following a single dose of the vaccine at 4 weeks and 12 weeks since onset of illness or following vaccination. Haemagglutination test (HAT) was used to assess the antibodies to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 wild type (WT), B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 (VOCs) and surrogate neutralizing test to measure ACE2 receptor blocking antibodies. ResultsThose with mild illness and in vaccinees, the IgG responses to S1, S2, RBD and N protein increased from 4 weeks to 12 weeks, while it remained unchanged in those with moderate/severe illness. Those who had a febrile illness in 2017 and 2018 (controls) also gave IgG and IgA high responses to the S2 subunit. In the vaccinees, the most significant rise was seen for the IgG antibodies to the S2 subunit (p<0.0001). Vaccinees had several fold lower IgA antibodies to all the SARS-CoV-2 proteins tested than those with mild and moderate/severe illness at 4 weeks and 12 weeks.

This study aimed to measure these changes and examine if they improved timely access to primary care. A secondary goal was to identify which telehealth technologies were deemed sustainable by primary care providers. METHODS: This was a comparative study on the use of telehealth technology before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between April 2020 and November 2020, 114 active primary care providers (family physicians or nurse practitioners) responded to the online survey. RESULTS: The findings illustrated an increase in the use of telehealth technologies. The use of phone consultations increased by 122%, from 43.9% pre-pandemic to 97.6% during the pandemic (p < 0.001). The use of virtual consultation (19.3% pre-pandemic vs. 41.2% during the pandemic, p < 0.001), emails and texts also increased during the pandemic. Whereas the more structural organizational tools (electronic medical charts and reservation systems) remained stable. However, those changes did not coincide with a significant improvement to timely access to care during the pandemic. Many participants (40.1%) wanted to keep phone consultations, and 21.9% of participants wanted to keep virtual consultations as part of their long-term practice. INTERPRETATION: The observed increase in the use of telehealth technologies may be sustainable, but it has not significantly improved timely access to primary care in New Brunswick.","output":"Changes to telehealth practices in primary care in New Brunswick (Canada): A comparative study pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we find that CD8(+) T cells expressing inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are the human equivalent of Ly49(+)CD8(+) regulatory T cells in mice and are increased in the blood and inflamed tissues of patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases.

Imbalances of gut microbiota have been previously linked to respiratory virus infection. Understanding how the gutClung axis affects the progression of COVID-19 can provide a novel framework for therapies and management. In this study, we examined the gut microbiota of patients with COVID-19 (n = 47) and compared it to healthy controls (n = 19). Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we have identified four microorganisms unique in COVID-19 patients, namely Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacteroides oleiciplenus, Fusobacterium ulcerans, and Prevotella bivia. The abundances of Bacteroides stercoris, B. vulgatus, B. massiliensis, Bifidobacterium longum, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 5163FAA, Prevotella bivia, Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 6145, and Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 2244A were enriched in COVID-19 patients, whereas the abundances of Clostridium nexile, Streptococcus salivarius, Coprococcus catus, Eubacterium hallii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Adlercreutzia equolifaciens were decreased (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of butyrate-producing Roseburia inulinivorans is evidently depleted in COVID-19 patients, while the relative abundances of Paraprevotella sp. and the probiotic Streptococcus thermophilus were increased. We further identified 30 KEGG orthology (KO) modules overrepresented, with 7 increasing and 23 decreasing modules. Notably, 15 optimal microbial markers were identified using the random forest model to have strong diagnostic potential in distinguishing COVID-19. Based on Spearmans correlation, eight species were associated with eight clinical indices. Moreover, the increased abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased abundance of Firmicutes were also found across clinical types of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that the alterations of gut microbiota in patients with COVID-19 may influence disease severity. Our COVID-19 classifier, which was cross-regionally verified, provides a proof of concept that a set of microbial species markers can distinguish the presence of COVID-19.","output":"Microbiome Profiling Using Shotgun Metagenomic Sequencing Identified Unique Microorganisms in COVID-19 Patients With Altered Gut Microbiota"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env), expressed at the cell surface, induce apoptosis of uninfected CD4+ T cells, contributing to the development of AIDS.

The same phenomena occurred in a T cell line and in transfected HEK.293 cells that expressed both wild-type CXCR4 and a truncated form of CD4 that is unable to bind the lymphocyte-specific protein kinase Lck. Env-mediated autophagy is required to trigger CD4+ T cell apoptosis since blockade of autophagy at different steps, by either drugs (3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1) or siRNAs specific for Beclin 1/Atg6 and Atg7 genes, totally inhibited the apoptotic process. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells still underwent Env-mediated cell death with autophagic features when apoptosis was inhibited. These results suggest that HIV-infected cells can induce autophagy in bystander CD4+ T lymphocytes through contact of Env with CXCR4, leading to apoptotic cell death, a mechanism most likely contributing to immunodeficiency.","output":"Autophagy is involved in T cell death after binding of HIV-1 envelope proteins to CXCR4."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification is known for its high sensitivity, specificity and tolerance to inhibiting-substances.

Outside of China, Italy is one of the most suffering countries with the COVID19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemics trend of COVID19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time series data of COVID 19 from Jan 22,2020 to Mar 16,2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible infected removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with similar total number of populations in Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for COVID 19 was respectively 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15 to 6.77) in Italy and 3.15(95% CI: 1.71 to 5.21) in Hunan. There would be totally 30 086 infected cases (95%CI:7920-81 869) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Apr 25 (95%CI: Mar 30 to Aug 07) in Italy.

In this article we develop an understanding of chronic psychophysiological stress from a psychological educational perspective, by drawing on supporting evidence that significant emotional events in early life (traumatic and benign) can influence health and well-being later in life. We suggest that traumatic events instigate psychophysiological stress responses and the formation of emotional memory images (EMIs) within very short time frames, i.e., split-second learning. Once formed these emotional memories are triggered in daily living re-playing psychophysiological stress responses, resulting in chronic psychophysiological dis-ease. We describe a novel therapeutic approach to scan clients for mannerisms signifying a subconscious freeze-like stress response that involves the client as a curious observer within their own experience, feeding back the non-verbal cues as they arrive in the moment. By breaking down the observable fragments of their split-second Pavlovian response to the trigger, clients can detach their EMI from the psychophysiology stress response, i.e., split-second unlearning. Our split-second unlearning model recognizes the EMI as a barrier to moving forward and needs to be unlearned before the client can become naturally adaptive again. We argue that this approach places the client at the center of the work without the need of getting bogged down in a life-long narrative.","output":"Split-Second Unlearning: Developing a Theory of Psychophysiological Dis-ease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), also known as stress cardiomyopathy and broken heart syndrome, is a neurocardiac condition that is among the most dramatic manifestations of psychosomatic disorders.

ResultsOf 221 included HEs, a number of 104 HEs (47.1%) reported at least one persisting symptom for more than 90 days after initial SARS-CoV-2 detection. A symptom duration over 28 days was associated with multiple symptom complexes. The most common was the interrelated occurrence of shortness of breath, memory disorder, concentration disorders and fatigue.

Objective: To validate the Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), a predictive model implemented in over 100 U.S. hospitals that has been recently promoted for use in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We studied adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to non-ICU level care at a large academic medical center from March 9 through April 7, 2020. We used the EDI, calculated at 15-minute intervals, to predict a composite adverse outcome of ICU-level care, mechanical ventilation, or death during the hospitalization. In a subset of patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours, we also evaluated the ability of the EDI (range 0-100) to identify patients at low risk of experiencing this composite outcome during their remaining hospitalization. We evaluated model discrimination and calibration using both raw EDI scores and their slopes. Results: Among 174 COVID-19 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 61 (35%) experienced the composite outcome. Area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of the EDI was 0.76 (95% CI 0.68-0.84). Patients who met or exceeded an EDI of 64.8 made up 17% of the study cohort and had an 80% probability of experiencing the outcome during their hospitalization with a median lead time of 28 hours from when the threshold was first exceeded to the outcome. Employing the EDI slope lowered the AUCs to 0.68 (95% CI 0.60-0.77) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.59-0.75) for slopes calculated over 4 and 8 hours, respectively. In a subset of 109 patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours and who had not experienced the composite outcome, 14 (13%) patients who never exceeded an EDI of 37.9 had a 93% probability of not experiencing the outcome throughout the rest of their hospitalization, suggesting low risk. Conclusion: In this validation study, we found the EDI identifies small subsets of high- and low-risk patients with fair discrimination.

Since no vaccine is yet available for MERS-COV, rapid case identification, isolation, and infection prevention strategies must be used to combat the spreading of MERS-COV infection. Additionally, there is a desperate need for vaccines and antiviral strategies. METHODS: The present study used immuno-informatics and computational approaches to identify conserved B- and T cell epitopes for the MERS-COV spike (S) protein that may perform a significant role in eliciting the resistance response to MERS-COV infection. RESULTS: Many conserved cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes and discontinuous and linear B-cell epitopes were predicted for the MERS-COV S protein, and their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B7 allele were estimated. Among B-cell epitopes, QLQMGFGITVQYGT displayed the highest antigenicity-score, and was immensely immunogenic. Among T-cell epitopes, MHC class-I peptide YKLQPLTFL and MHC class-II peptide YCILEPRSG were identified as highly antigenic.

METHODS We sent questionnaires to members of JSOG via official email. Participants answered anonymously using Google forms. RESULTS Two (0.08%) JSOG members had contracted COVID-19. There was a clear decrease in the number of patients scheduled for operation, not only for malignant but also for benign diseases. A decrease in the number of outpatients for infertility treatment was also observed. Polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was available in 20.4% of the facilities. Inpatients and outpatients were requested to wear masks, limit the number of contacts and check body temperature when visiting hospitals/clinics. During parturition care, caregivers and physicians wore gloves, masks (other than N-95), face shields and gowns. About 66% and 80% of the facilities decided to transfer pregnant women if they had asymptomatic and symptomatic infection, respectively. Cesarean section was typically chosen as delivery mode in infected women. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic provoked significant changes in obstetrics and gynecology practices in Japan.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of recently-developed reduced-toxicity myeloablative regimen that combines fludarabine, intravenous busulfan, and melphalan (FBM). METHODS We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of 39 patients (23 with myeloid neoplasms and 16 with lymphoid neoplasms), with a median age of 50 (range, 17-68) years, who underwent their first allo-HCT using the FBM regimen. Graft types were bone marrow in 11, peripheral blood in 11, and cord blood in 17 patients. Cyclosporine- or tacrolimus-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was administered. The primary end point of the study was the overall survival rate at 2-year after transplantation. RESULTS After a median follow-up of 910 days for the surviving patients, 2-year overall survival was 62% for the entire cohort; 73% in the low-to-intermediate-risk group and 44% in the high-to-very high-risk group classified by the refined CIBMTR Disease Risk Index. Cumulative incidences of engraftment, grade II-IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, relapse, and non-relapse mortality were 95%, 56%, 56%, 31%, and 17%, respectively. CONCLUSION These results suggest that our FBM regimen can be applied to allo-HCT using various graft types and yields acceptable outcomes with relatively low non-relapse mortality in both myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. Also, we observed a promising survival in the group of patients with high-risk diseases, warranting more accumulation of patients and longer follow-up.","output":"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation using fludarabine plus myeloablative busulfan and melphalan confers promising survival in high-risk hematopoietic neoplasms: a single-center retrospective analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aimed to review the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and future perspectives related to COVID-19 infections.

METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and microbiological data of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from April 2020 to January 2021 presenting with features of endogenous endophthalmitis within 12 weeks of their discharge from the hospital in two neighboring states in South India. The data included demography, systemic comorbidities, COVID-19 treatment details, time interval to visual symptoms, the microbiology of systemic and ocular findings, ophthalmic management, and outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age of 24 patients (33 eyes) was 53.6  13.5 (range: 5C72) years; 17 (70.83%) patients were male. Twenty-two (91.6%) patients had systemic comorbidities, and the median period of hospitalization for COVID-19 treatment was 14.5  0.7 (range: 7C63) days. Infection was bilateral in nine patients.

We investigated the incidence and outcomes of AKI in this population comparing the COVID-19 pandemic to the H1N1 pandemic of 2009. Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of all patients with severe COVID-19 infection, admitted to ICU level of care between 3/1/2020 and 6/1/2020 and we obtained patient data via the research patient data registry. We excluded patients who were admitted with a complaint unrelated to their COVID-19 infection and patients with end-stage renal disease. We stratified patients based on presence of AKI and further stratified the AKI group for the need for Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT). All data collection was approved by the IRB at Mass General Brigham (IRB #2020P001674). All data was analyzed using Excel and R version 4.0.1 (2020-06-06). When comparing groups, medians and interquartile ranges are reported. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used for statistical analysis. Results: 272 patients were identified of which 31 patients were excluded from further study due to reasons as above.

The questionnaire survey was conducted among patients of cancer clinics (Poland). The study was conducted in two stagesCbefore the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020). Data from 450 correctly completed questionnaires were analyzed statistically. The obtained data were statistically processed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test (p = 0.05). Results: Among the surveyed patients of the cancer clinic, the quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased by 2%, compared to the period before the pandemic. The frequency of negative feelings associated with cancer increased during the COVID-19 pandemicCby 11% more men, and 4.4% of women determined the frequency of negative feelings to be 2C3 times a week.

The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of cardiac dysfunction and elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), and its influence on mortality in patients with COVID\\\\19 in intensive care in Sweden. METHODS: This was a multicentre observational study performed in five intensive care units (ICUs) in Sweden. Patients admitted to participating ICU with COVID\\\\19 were examined with echocardiography within 72 h from admission and again after 4 to 7 days. Cardiac dysfunction was defined as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (ejection fraction <50% and/or regional hypokinesia) or right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (defined as TAPSE <17 mm or visually assessed moderate/severe RV dysfunction). RESULTS: We included 132 patients, of whom 127 (96%) were intubated. Cardiac dysfunction was found in 42 (32%) patients. Most patients had cardiac dysfunction at the first assessment (n = 35) while a few developed cardiac dysfunction later (n = 7) and some changed type of dysfunction (n = 3).

Transitions of care (TOC), particularly from the inpatient to the outpatient setting, is an especially complicated time and one that is potentially fraught with errors that contribute to negative outcomes. The coronavirus 2019 pandemic exacerbated many of these challenges. In particular, vulnerable patient populations have experienced more barriers to successful care transitions. Effective care transitions should include interprofessional teamwork, robust patient education, and seamless communication among the various healthcare team members. Increasingly, medical schools are working toward graduating systems-ready physicians who demonstrate competency in the health system sciences and are able to operate effectively within the healthcare system, including being able to navigate complex transitions of care issues. Undergraduate medical education, however, continues to provide experiential learning in the traditional silos of inpatient versus outpatient medicine, so that learners do not have the opportunity to directly participate in transitions of care. Although transitions of care is a pivotal part of patient care, it is rarely taught at the undergraduate level, and when it is, it is typically relegated to the classroom setting. METHODS: We used the disruption of the coronavirus 2019 pandemic to develop a TOC elective. The aim was to fulfill an acute educational need and to develop competencies around care transitions for students while concurrently providing support for patient care and teamwork. The elective was offered to second-, third- and fourth-year medical students. Our educational innovation was initiated within our safety-net hospital where we care for a high percentage of uninsured patients, with a high language discordance. In addition, our city has multiple care systems without a single or connected electronic health record system, further complicating patient care transitions. The work of the TOC elective crossed inpatient and outpatient silos, with close collaboration with our local federally qualified health centers. This remotely conducted elective includes three main pillars: participation in team activities, including virtual participation in interdisciplinary rounds and care coordination; discharge planning; and communication, including goals of care and end of life communication. RESULTS: Medical students successfully integrated into team structures to directly counsel families, facilitate goals of care conversations, and engage a multidisciplinary team for discharge planning. Students found this experience valuable in their reflections. In addition, there was a value-added component from a patient care and teamwork perspective. CONCLUSIONS: Participation of students in TOC is a valuable educational experience and contributes a value-added component to patient care and interprofessional teamwork. Moreover, an appreciation of the failures of the current system is pivotal as learners start to reimagine, explore, and design improved patient-centered systems in the future.","output":"Developing a Transitions of Care Elective for Medical Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), has been identified as the receptor for the SARS-CoV-2.

Phenylephrine is however reported to reduce the near infrared spectroscopy-determined frontal lobe oxygenation (ScO2) but whether that is the case for patients exposed to spinal anesthesia is not known. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of phenylephrine vs. ephedrine on ScO2during caesarean section with spinal anesthesia in a single center, open-label parallel-group study with balanced randomization of 24 women (1:1). Secondary aims were to compare the effect of the two drugs on maternal hemodynamics and fetal heart rate. INTERVENTION Ephedrine (0.8-3.3 mg/min) vs. phenylephrine infusion (0.02-0.07 mg/min). RESULTS For the duration of surgery, administration of ephedrine maintained ScO2 (compared to baseline +2.1  2.8%; mean  SE, while phenylephrine reduced ScO2 (-8.6  2.8%; p = 0.005) with a 10.7% difference in ScO2between groups (p = 0.0106). Also maternal heart rate was maintained with ephedrine (+3  3 bpm) but decreased with phenylephrine (-11  3 bpm); difference 14 bpm (p = 0.0053), but no significant difference in mean arterial pressure (p = 0.1904) or CO (p = 0.0683) was observed between groups.

We found that conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), defined in mice via expression of the transcription factor Zbtb46, were a major source of circulating sIL-6R and, thus, systemically regulated IL-6 signaling. This was uncovered through identification of a cDC-dependent but T cell-independent modality that naturally adjuvants plasma cell differentiation and antibody responses to protein antigens.

The combined direct health impact and the current macro-fiscal picture present real and present risks to health financing that facilitate progress toward universal health coverage (UHC). This paper lays out the health financing mechanisms through which the UHC objectives of service coverage and financial protection may be impacted. Macroeconomic, fiscal capacity, and poverty indicators and trends are analyzed in conjunction with health financing indicators to present spending scenarios. The analysis shows that falling or reduced economic growth, combined with rising poverty, is likely to lead to a fall in service use and coverage, while any observed reductions in out-of-pocket spending have to be analyzed carefully to make sure they reflect improved financial protection and not just decreased utilization of services. Potential decreases in out-of-pocket spending will likely be drive by households' financial constraints that lead to less service use. In this way, it is critical to measure and monitor both the service coverage and financial protection indicators of UHC to have a complete picture of downstream effects.

It has resulted in stretch of resources with canceled or delayed procedures. Patients with urinary calculi have also suffered the negative impact. This systematic review aims to assess the impact of the early COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation and management of urinary calculi around the globe. Methods: We reviewed the impact of early COVID-19 on the clinically important aspects of stone disease using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. We searched Medline, Embase, and Central databases using themes of COVID-19 OR Sars-Cov-2 OR pandemic OR coronavirus AND kidney stone, urinary calculi, urolithiasis, and similar allied terms. Inclusion criteria were studies with data on both pre- and COVID-19 period covering one or more of eight clinical domains. Results: Our search returned 231 studies, after removal of duplicates, of which 18 studies were included for analysis. The number of patients presenting to hospital declined by 21%-70% at the beginning of the pandemic, whereas majority of studies reported increased associated complications. There are mixed reports in terms of delay to presentation and use of conservative management. There was a consistent trend toward reduction in elective procedures with wide variations (shockwave lithotripsy 38%-98%, percutaneous nephrolithotomy 94%-100%, and ureteroscopy 8%-98%). There was a trend toward increased nephrostomy insertion with the onset of the pandemic. Conclusion: This review demonstrated the differences in the number of patients presenting to hospital, complication rates, and management of urinary calculi, including surgical interventions, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It offers baseline global information that would help understand the impact of early pandemic, variations in practices, and be useful for future comparisons.","output":"The Impact of Early COVID-19 Pandemic on the Presentation and Management of Urinary Calculi Across the Globe: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article discusses the challenges faced by healthcare staff in Great Britain in addressing the hesitancy or refusal of citizens to be vaccinated against COVID-19 amidst the anti-vaccination campaigns by powerful individuals in various countries","output":"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy or refusal: the challenges for healthcare staff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical observations indicate that COVID-19 is a systemic disease.

This cross-sectional survey included 183 COVID-19 diagnosed patients from COVID-19 isolation wards of public and private hospitals of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. After getting ethical permission from Institutional Review Board of Shifa International Hospital (Ref # 070-21), this survey was conducted for the time period of 6 months from December 2020 to May 2021. Through convenient sampling, 183 patients with the age range of 25 to 55 years with no already diagnosed psychological complaints were assessed for eligibility briefed regarding the study purpose and then were asked for their voluntary participation. The Functional Status Scale for the Intensive Care Unit (FSS-ICU) was used to assess the functional status impacted due to COVID-19 during hospitalization.

Most are treated with statins, but the impact of these drugs on clinical outcomes of COVID-19 remains unclear. This report is therefore based on meta-analyses of retrospective observational studies aimed at investigating the impact of previous statin therapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: In studies reporting on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in statin users vs non-users, two endpoints have been usedin-hospital death rates, and disease severity as assessed by admission to intensive care units (ICUs)with a special focus on patients with diabetes. RESULTS: Regarding mortality, 13 studies were included in the meta-analysis for a total of 10,829 statin users (2517 deaths) and 31,893 non-users (7516 deaths): univariate analysis showed no statistically significant reduction in deaths (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.92C1.03), although between-study heterogeneity was high (I2 = 97%). As for disease severity, 11 studies were selected for a total of 3462 statin users (724 endpoints) and 10,560 non-users (1763 endpoints): here again, univariate analysis showed no reduction in severity (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.99C1.22; I2 = 93%).

Design/methodology/approach: In total, 401 survey responses from doctors and university teachers are collected through online and personally administrated questionnaires. Partial least square-based structural equation modeling technique is applied using Smart PLS software. Findings: This study finds that COVID fear has a positive and significant impact on COVID stress and social distancing while religiosity negatively impacts COVID fear. Further, COVID stress and social distancing mediates the relationships between COVID fear and W-FC/ F-WC. However, the study found that COVID stress is a more effective mechanism as compared to social distancing in explaining the mediation process. It is also found that religiosity significantly moderates the nexus between COVID stress and both W-FC and F-WC negatively. Practical implications: Findings imply that the teachers, as well as doctors, must be immediately be provided with the proper facilitation to maintain their work from home operations with the best of the institutional facilities. Moreover, the recruitment policy in such professions can also consider religious practices to be the indicators of problem-solving and stress management in such a challenging context. Originality/value: This study provides timely and novel insight into the interplay between the domains of work and family during the period of stressful COVID outbreak.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective, cohort study of 96 individuals with type 2 diabetes followed up for a period of 6 months. The cohort was divided into two groups depending on the mode of consultation, namely IPV (n = 48) and VC (n = 48). Baseline and follow-up characteristics including glycemic profile and lipid profile were compared. RESULTS: The cohort had a mean age of 55.4  13.8 years, median diabetes duration of 8 (0.3-70) years, a mean body mass index (BMI) of 28.8  5.8 kg/m(2), 44 (46.3%) females, and uncontrolled hyperglycemia (HbA1c 8.7%  1.9%). Both groups were adequately matched at baseline. At the time of first visit, cessation of previous medications was more frequent in the IPV group (37.5% vs 8.3%; P = 0.001) than in the VC group. Follow-up was earlier in the VC group as compared to the IPV group (43.2 vs 87.9 days; P = 0.000).

However, the reported side-effects continue to have a crucial role in public confidence in the vaccine and its acceptance. This study aimed to investigate the short-term side-effects reported by the healthcare workers (HCWs) in Saudi Arabia after receiving the first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted among HCWs in the Jazan region of southwestern Saudi Arabia. Healthcare workers who had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and agreed to participate in the study were followed up for 3 weeks post vaccination through a weekly online survey. Information was collected on local and/or systemic side-effects reported following vaccine administration. Participants general and demographic information was also collected. Results: A total of 57.2% (250/437) of the HCWs who participated in this study reported at least one side-effect. Injection site pain and redness (80.0%), fever (73.2%), whole-body pain/fatigue (56.4%), and headache (48.8%) were the most commonly reported side-effects. Moreover, 12.4% of the participants who reported side-effects needed to see a physician, and only one female participant was admitted to the hospital. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that nationality (Saudi, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.65; 95% CI = 2.40, 5.55) and residency (Jazan governorate, aOR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.15, 0.95) were the significant factors associated with reporting COVID-19 post-vaccination side-effects, while the number of reported side-effects was found to be significantly influenced by occupation (medical, aOR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.26, 0.66; p < 0.001) and gender (female, aOR = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.38, 0.97; p = 0.038). Conclusions: Findings of the present study support the safety of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine among HCWs in Saudi Arabia. All the reported side-effects were mild-to-moderate side-effects.

However, it is a heterogeneous condition with inter-related factors including ethnicity, body mass index and gestational weight gain significantly modifying the absolute risk of complications at an individual level. Predicting the risk of pregnancy complications for an individual woman with GDM presents a useful adjunct to therapeutic decision-making and patient education. Diagnostic prediction models for GDM are prevalent. In contrast, prediction models for risk of complications in those with GDM are relatively novel. This study will systematically review published prognostic prediction models for pregnancy complications in women with GDM, describe their characteristics, compare performance and assess methodological quality and applicability. METHODS Studies will be identified by searching MEDLINE and Embase electronic databases. Title and abstract screening, full-text review and data extraction will be completed independently by two reviewers. The included studies will be systematically assessed for risk of bias and applicability using appropriate tools designed for prediction modelling studies. Extracted data will be tabulated to facilitate qualitative comparison of published prediction models. Quantitative data on predictive performance of these models will be synthesised with meta-analyses if appropriate. DISCUSSION This review will identify and summarise all published prognostic prediction models for pregnancy complications in women with GDM. We will compare model performance across different settings and populations with meta-analysis if appropriate. This work will guide subsequent phases in the prognosis research framework: further model development, external validation and model updating, and impact assessment. The ultimate model will estimate the absolute risk of pregnancy complications for women with GDM and will be implemented into routine care as an evidence-based GDM complication risk prediction model. It is anticipated to offer value to women and their clinicians with individualised risk assessment and may assist decision-making. Ultimately, this systematic review is an important step towards a personalised risk-stratified model-of-care for GDM to allow preventative and therapeutic interventions for the maximal benefit to women and their offspring, whilst sparing expense and harm for those at low risk.

We recruited 307 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed cases of severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring IMV. We excluded those who did not require IMV or had been transferred out to other hospitals. The Chi-square test was applied to find the association between categorical variables. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Out of the 307 cases of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 pneumonia, 61 had probable CAPA. The median age was 60 years. Malignancy and cirrhosis were significant risk factors associated with CAPA (p=<0.001, 0.001, respectively). Aspergillus fumigatus was detected in 78.7% of the cases.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of SS, SAN and MMN injuries after different types of ND. METHODS This systematic review and meta-analysis included studies reporting SAN and MMN injuries following the three main types of ND. Pooled estimates of the prevalence were made by the main types of ND with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS Nineteen studies reported a total of 457 SAN injuries. The estimated prevalence of SS or SAN injuries following radical neck dissection, modified radical neck dissection and selective neck dissection was 94.8% (95% CI: 88.5-98.9%), 33.0% (95% CI: 19.4-48.3%) and 27.9% (95% CI: 7.1-54.5%), respectively.

The results may be used to compare future research and as guidance for quality evaluation within departments.","output":"The prevalence of nerve injuries following neck dissections - a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last few years, the Internet of Things, and other enabling technologies, have been progressively used for digitizing Food Supply Chains (FSC). These and other digitalization-enabling technologies are generating a massive amount of data with enormous potential to manage supply chains more efficiently and sustainably. Nevertheless, the intricate patterns and complexity embedded in large volumes of data present a challenge for systematic human expert analysis. In such a data-driven context, Computational Intelligence (CI) has achieved significant momentum to analyze, mine, and extract the underlying data information, or solve complex optimization problems, striking a balance between productive efficiency and sustainability of food supply systems. Although some recent studies have sorted the CI literature in this field, they are mainly oriented towards a single family of CI methods (a group of methods that share common characteristics) and review their application in specific FSC stages. As such, there is a gap in identifying and classifying FSC problems from a broader perspective, encompassing the various families of CI methods that can be applied in different stages (from production to retailing) and identifying the problems that arise in these stages from a CI perspective. This paper presents a new and comprehensive taxonomy of FSC problems (associated with agriculture, fish farming, and livestock) from a CI approach; that is, it defines FSC problems (from production to retail) and categorizes them based on how they can be modeled from a CI point of view. Furthermore, we review the CI approaches that are more commonly used in each stage of the FSC and in their corresponding categories of problems. We also introduce a set of guidelines to help FSC researchers and practitioners to decide on suitable families of methods when addressing any particular problems they might encounter. Finally, based on the proposed taxonomy, we identify and discuss challenges and research opportunities that the community should explore to enhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization of the FSC.","output":"A Taxonomy of Food Supply Chain Problems from a Computational Intelligence Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic results in a profound physical and mental burden on healthcare professionals. This study aims to evaluate burnout status and mood disorder of healthcare workers during this period. An online questionnaire was voluntarily answered by eligible adult employees in a COVID-19 specialized medical center. The major analysis included the burnout status and mood disorder. Factors related to more severe mood disorder were also identified. A total of 2029 participants completed the questionnaire. There were 901 (44.4%) and 923 (45.5%) participants with moderate to severe personal and work-related burnout status, respectively. Nurses working in the emergency room (ER), intensive care unit (ICU)/isolation wards, and general wards, as well as those with patient contact, had significantly higher scores for personal burnout, work-related burnout, and mood disorder. This investigation identified 271 participants (13.35%) with moderate to severe mood disorder linked to higher personal/work-related burnout scores and a more advanced burnout status. Univariate analysis revealed that nurses working in the ER and ICU/isolation wards were associated with moderate to severe mood disorder risk factors. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that working in the ER (OR, 2.81;95% CI, 1.14-6.90) was the only independent risk factor. More rest, perquisites, and an adequate supply of personal protection equipment were the most desired assistance from the hospital. Compared with the non-pandemic period (2019), employees working during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) have higher burnout scores and percentages of severe burnout. In conclusion, this study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on healthcare professionals. Adequate measures should be adopted as early as possible to support the healthcare system.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic Is Associated with an Adverse Impact on Burnout and Mood Disorder in Healthcare Professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since cytokine release syndrome with elevation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) is considered to be associated with severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); IL-6 inhibitors, such as tocilizumab, are expected to be effective for its treatment. This was a retrospective study using a consecutive cohort of 224 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in March 2020. Patients were divided into those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU group) and those not (no ICU group), and clinical data including usage of tocilizumab were compared. Correlation between IL-6 value at admission and at peak, and tocilizumab use, as well as clinical outcomes were also investigated. The ICU group had higher rates of pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary disease, and higher IL-6 than no ICU group (all P < .05). Age, peak IL-6, and peak d-dimer were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality (1.05 [1.01-1.09], P = .012; 1.001 [1.000-1.002], P = .002; 1.10 [1.03-1.18], P = .008).

The two methods target different regions of the 16 S rRNA gene. The aim of this study was to compare targeted metagenomics and IS-Pro methods for the ability to discern the microbial composition of the lung microbiome of COPD patients. METHODS: Spontaneously expectorated sputum specimens were collected from COPD patients. Bacterial DNA was extracted and used for targeted metagenomics and IS-Pro method. The analysis was performed using QIIME2 (targeted metagenomics) and IS-Pro software (IS-Pro method). Additionally, a laboratory cost per isolate and time analysis was performed for each method. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed in alpha diversity when targeted metagenomics and IS-Pro methods' data were compared using the Shannon diversity measure (p-value = 0.0006) but not with the Simpson diversity measure (p-value = 0.84). Distinct clusters with no overlap between the two technologies were observed for beta diversity. Targeted metagenomics had a lower relative abundance of phyla, such as the Proteobacteria, and higher relative abundance of phyla, such as Firmicutes when compared to the IS-Pro method. Haemophilus, Prevotella and Streptococcus were most prevalent genera across both methods. Targeted metagenomics classified 23 % (144/631) of OTUs to a species level, whereas IS-Pro method classified 86 % (55/64) of OTUs to a species level. However, unclassified OTUs accounted for a higher relative abundance when using the IS-Pro method (35 %) compared to targeted metagenomics (5 %). The two methods performed comparably in terms of cost and time; however, the IS-Pro method was more user-friendly. CONCLUSIONS: It is essential to understand the value of different methods for characterisation of the microbiome. Targeted metagenomics and IS-Pro methods showed differences in ability in identifying and characterising OTUs, diversity and microbial composition of the lung microbiome. The IS-Pro method might miss relevant species and could inflate the abundance of Proteobacteria. However, the IS-Pro kit identified most of the important lung pathogens, such as Burkholderia and Pseudomonas and may work in a more diagnostics-orientated setting. Both methods were comparable in terms of cost and time; however, the IS-Pro method was easier to use.","output":"Comparison of targeted metagenomics and IS-Pro methods for analysing the lung microbiome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination aims to have a specific impact on a certain disease so that one day you will be exposed to the disease you will not get sick or only experience mild illness.

Experiences in the field can best guide us as to what has been effective. Circumstances in North America in the period of 1999C2004 resulted in numerous PRRS virus (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome) negative boar studs becoming infected and disseminating virus to sow farms. Earlier detection methods were needed, and withholding of semen pending negative test results became standard. To accomplish this, diagnostic labs complied with industry requests for same day testing. At the same time, research efforts helped clarify the major routes of PRRS virus introduction into the farms. The risk of fomites and aerosol spread became viewed as major risks. Addressing issues with people and supply entry alone did not eliminate new virus entry. The implementation of air filtration during 2005C2008 had a major impact on the rate of new virus introductions into boar studs after other measures alone were unsuccessful. Risks exposed with the introduction of PED virus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea) into North America further highlighted other risk factors such as feed ingredients, trailer sanitation, and the presence of clear physical barriers. The successful adaptation of testing procedures, combined with biosecurity procedures including air filtration, has made the incidence of infectious disease introduction extremely rare in North American boar studs over the last decade. While survivability of infectious disease agents can vary in different materials or in the air, successful protocols should be applied and adjusted as needed to accommodate new information or risks. Cleary defined physical barriers for people and animal entry and exit, sanitization and/or down time on incoming supplies, risk mitigation and testing of feed ingredients, and filtration have been keys to changing the incidence of emerging infectious disease introduction into boar studs.","output":"Effective biosecurity to protect North American studs and clients from emerging infectious disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On November 25, 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) authorized the presentation of Comirnaty vaccine (Pfizer-Biontech) for children between 5 and 11 years of age.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective epidemiologic study was conducted using datasets obtained from Web-based surveillance of Kawasaki disease and PIDs in Japan. We compared weekly numbers of patients who developed Kawasaki disease and specific PIDs between 2020 and 2017-2019 and evaluated the association between the percent reduction in the number of patients with these diseases. RESULTS: A total of 868 patients developed Kawasaki disease in 2020. During the social distancing period in 2020, the number of patients with Kawasaki disease was approximately 35% lower than in 2017-2019. Time from the onset of Kawasaki disease until the first hospital visit did not differ significantly among the examined years. The proportion of older children with Kawasaki disease decreased more than that of infants with Kawasaki disease (age <1 year), resulting in a significant difference in the proportion of infant patients between 2020 and 2017-2019 (24% vs 19%; P < .01). The number of patients with incomplete Kawasaki disease was unchanged from that of previous years. The weekly percent reduction in patient numbers differed between Kawasaki disease and PIDs during 2020, with no strong correlation between the 2 diseases.

In this cohort study, the infection dynamic of swIAV was evaluated in a Danish pig herd by sampling and PCR testing of pigs from two weeks of age until slaughter at 22 weeks of age. In addition, next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify and characterize the complete genome of swIAV circulating in the herd, and to examine the antigenic variability in the antigenic sites of the virus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins. Overall, 76.6% of the pigs became PCR positive for swIAV during the study, with the highest prevalence at four weeks of age. Detailed analysis of the virus sequences obtained showed that the majority of mutations occurred at antigenic sites in the HA and NA proteins of the virus. At least two different H1N2 variants were found to be circulating in the herd; one H1N2 variant was circulating at the sow and nursery sites, while another H1N2 variant was circulating at the finisher site. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that individual pigs had recurrent swIAV infections with the two different H1N2 variants, but re-infection with the same H1N2 variant was also observed.

Early reports suggest a reduced immunologic response to SARS-Cov-2 vaccines in dialysis patients, in spite of a high degree of seroconversion. We aimed to identify risk factors for a reduced efficacy of an mRNA vaccine in a cohort of hemodialysis patients. METHOD: In a multicenter study, including 294 Portuguese hemodialysis patients who had received 2 doses of BNT162b2 with a three week interval, IgG-class antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were determined 3 weeks after the first dose (M1) and 6 weeks after the second dose (M2). The threshold for seroconversion was 10UR/mL. Demographic and clinical data was retrieved from a quality registry. Adverse events were registered using a questionnaire. RESULTS: At M2, seroconversion was 93.1% with a median antibody level of 197.5U/mL (1.2C3237.0) and a median increase of 180.0U/mL (-82.9C2244.6) from M1. Age (beta -8.9; 95%CI: -12.88 to -4.91; P < 0.0001), ferritin > 600ng/mL (beta 183.93; 95%CI: 74.75 to 293.10; P = 0.001) and physical activity (beta 265.79; 95%CI: 30.7 to 500.88; P = 0.03) were independent predictors of SARS-Cov-2 antibody levels after two vaccine doses.

Only mild adverse reactions were observed in 10.9% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-Cov-2 vaccine BNT162b2 is safe and effective in hemodialysis patients. Besides age, iron status and nutrition are possible modifiable modulators of the immunologic response to SARS-Cov-2 mRNA vaccines. This data suggests the need for an early identification of populations at higher risk for diminished antibody production and the potential advantage of the implementation of oriented strategies to maximize the immune response to vaccination in these patients.","output":"Time-dependent evolution of IgG antibody levels after first and second dose of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in hemodialysis patients: a multicenter study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Healthcare workers face distinct occupational challenges that affect their personal health, especially during a pandemic. In this study we compare the characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 patients who are and who are not healthcare workers (HCW). Methods We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of adult patients with known HCW status and a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test presenting to a large academic medical center emergency department (ED) in New York State. We routinely collect data on occupation and exposures to suspected Covid-19. The primary outcome was hospital admission. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 adult patients based on whether they were or were not HCW using univariable and multivariable analyses. Results From March 1 2020 through June 2020, 2,842 adult patients (mean age 53+/-19 years, 53% male) with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests and known HCW status visited the ED. This included 193 (6.8%) known HCWs and 2,649 (93.2%) non-HCWs. Compared with non-HCW, HCWs were younger (43 vs 53 years, P<0.001), more likely female (118/193 vs 1211/2649, P<0.001), and more likely to have a known Covid-19 exposure (161/193 vs 946/2649, P<0.001), but had fewer comorbidities. On presentation to the ED, HCW also had lower frequencies of tachypnea (12/193 vs 426/2649, P<0.01), hypoxemia (15/193 vs 564/2649, P<0.01), bilateral opacities on imaging (38/193 vs 1189/2649, P<0.001), and lymphocytopenia (6/193 vs 532/2649, P<0.01) compared to non-HCWs. Direct discharges home from the ED were more frequent in HCW 154/193: 80% vs 1275/2649: 48% p<0.001). Hospital admissions (38/193 20% vs 1264/2694 47%, P<0.001), ICU admissions (7/193 3% vs 321/2694 12%, P<0.001), need for IMV (6/193 3% vs 321/2694 12%, P<0.001) and mortality (2/193 1% vs 219/2694 8%, P<0.01) were lower than among non-HCW. After controlling for age, sex, comorbidities, presenting vital signs and radiographic imaging, HCW were less likely to be admitted (OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.3-0.9) than non HCW.

In spite of clinical manifestations similar to the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003, affected organs and severity are yet to be defined. Moreover, viral load alterations and viral shielding among different specimens remained scarce. Therefore, clarifying clinical presentations and correlations among viral loads, disease severity, and viral shielding of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial in the disease prevention. METHODS: The clinical courses of SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented through Gantt charts. Laboratory examinations and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) among different specimens were tested periodically. Cycle thresholds (CT) were recorded and presented as viral loads. RESULTS: From March 2020 to April 2020, four SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented, of which, cases 1 and 2 manifested the symptoms severer than cases 3 and 4, along with higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels and graded for lymphocytopenia. Case 4 initially exhibited anosmia, but recovered within a short period. Curves of the CT of all the cases, except case 2, concaved upward after prescribing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin. Except for case 4, the CT in most stool specimens remained undetectable; however, none of the cases presented gastrointestinal symptoms. Surprisingly, the CT values of the saliva specimens were inconsistent with those of the nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 manifests various symptoms. Sudden onset of central nervous system symptoms should be considered. The timing of HCQ and azithromycin administration might be a key factor in the viral load reduction.

Although SARS likely stems from overexuberant host inflammatory responses, the exact mechanism leading to the detrimental outcome in patients remains unknown. Pulmonary macrophages (Mphi), airway epithelium, and dendritic cells (DC) are key cellular elements of the host innate defenses against respiratory infections. While pulmonary Mphi are situated at the luminal epithelial surface, DC reside abundantly underneath the epithelium. Such strategic locations of these cells within the airways make it relevant to investigate their likely impact on SARS pathogenesis subsequent to their interaction with infected lung epithelial cells. To study this, we established highly polarized human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells by using the Transwell culture system. Here we report that supernatants harvested from the apical and basolateral domains of infected Calu-3 cells are potent in modulating the intrinsic functions of Mphi and DC, respectively. They prompted the production of cytokines by both Mphi and DC and selectively induced CD40 and CD86 expression only on DC. However, they compromised the abilities of the DC and Mphi in priming na?ve T cells and phagocytosis, respectively. We also identified interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 as key SARS-CoV-induced epithelial cytokines capable of inhibiting the T-cell-priming ability of DC.

We showed that RBD appears as a monomer in solution, whereas S1, S-WT, and S-2P associate as homotrimers with substantial glycosylation.

Further subanalyses compared early post-COVID-19 (weeks 10-13) and late post-COVID-19 (weeks 14-16) periods. Statistical comparisons were performed using &#967;2 and independent-samples t tests. RESULTS: Compared with 2019, total inpatient imaging volume in 2020 post-COVID-19, early and late post-COVID-19 periods, declined by 13.6% (from 78,902 to 68,168), 16.6% (from 45,221 to 37,732), and 9.6% (from 33,681 to 30,436), respectively. By week 16, inpatient imaging volume rebounded and was only down 4.2% (from 11,003 to 10,546). However, a statistically significant shift (P < .0001) in the 2020 composition mix was observed largely comprised of radiography (74.3%), followed by CT (12.7%), ultrasound (8%), MRI (2.4%), interventional radiology (2.3%), and nuclear medicine (0.4%). Although the vast majority of imaging studies declined, few Current Procedural Terminology-coded groups showed increased trends in imaging volumes in the late post-COVID-19 period, including CT angiography chest, radiography chest, and ultrasound venous duplex. DISCUSSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a decrease in inpatient imaging volumes accompanied by a shift away from cross-sectional imaging toward radiography. These findings could have significant implications in planning for a potential resurgence.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic Shifts Inpatient Imaging Utilization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Histopathological analysis can provide additional clues in COVID-19 understanding. During the last year, autopsy reports have revealed that diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is the most significant observed finding.

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review in PubMed, Virtual Health Library (VHL), and Google Scholar. RESULTS: In total, 151 autopsies were included, and 91 cases presented microthrombi in the lung (73%), heart (11.2%), kidney (24%), and liver (16.3%). The age range was between 27 and 96 years. Males were 64.8%. The patients with microthrombi had more comorbidities such as arterial hypertension (62%), obesity or overweight (64%), diabetes mellitus type 2 (51%), and heart disease (53%). The most common histopathological changes found in patients with lung microthrombosis were DAD in exudative phase (78%), pulmonary embolism (59%), and lung infarct (81%). Presence of microthrombi was associated with arterial hypertension (p < 0.0001) and DAD in exudative and proliferative phases (p = 0.02).

These measures may affect health behaviours of the population such as eating habits, physical activity and alcohol consumption, which in turn can lead to weight gain resulting in overweight and obesity, increasing the risk of several chronic diseases, but also of severe COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of confinement measures on health behaviours and their associations with weight gain. METHODS: Data were derived from the second national COVID-19 health survey. Data were collected between the 16th and the 23rd of April 2020. The recruitment of participants was based on snowball sampling via Sciensanos website, invitations via e-mail and social media. The study sample includes participants aged 18 years and over with no missing data on the variables of interest (n = 28,029). The association between self-reported weight gain and health behaviour changes, adjusted for gender, age group and household composition was assessed through ORs (95% CI) calculated with logistic regression models, using post-stratification weights. RESULTS: Overall, 28.6% reported weight gain after 6 weeks of confinement. Higher odds of weight gain were observed among participants who increased or decreased their consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (OR = 1.39 (1.15C1.68) and 1.29 (1.04C1.60), respectively), among those who increased their consumption of sweet or salty snacks (OR = 3.65 (3.27C4.07)), among those who became less physically active (OR = 1.91 (1.71C2.13)), and among those who increased their alcohol consumption (OR = 1.86 (1.66C2.08)). CONCLUSIONS: The most important correlates of weight gain during confinement were an increased consumption of sweet or salty snacks and being less physically active. These findings confirm the impact of diet and exercise on short term weight gain and plead to take more action, in supporting people to achieve healthier behaviours in order to tackle overweight and obesity, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Short-term impact of the COVID-19 confinement measures on health behaviours and weight gain among adults in Belgium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Children become ill quite often, mainly because of infections, most of which can be managed in the community. Many children are prescribed antibiotics which contributes to antimicrobial resistance and reinforces health-seeking behaviour. Point-of-care C reactive protein (POC CRP) testing, prescription guidance and safety-netting advice can help safely reduce antibiotic prescribing to acutely ill children in ambulatory care as well as save costs at a systems level. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The ARON (Antibiotic prescribing Rate after Optimal Near-patient testing in acutely ill children in ambulatory care) trial is a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled superiority trial with a nested process evaluation and will assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of a diagnostic algorithm, which includes a standardised clinical assessment, a POC CRP test, and safety-netting advice, in acutely ill children aged 6 months to 12 years presenting to ambulatory care. The primary outcome is antibiotic prescribing at the index consultation; secondary outcomes include clinical recovery, reconsultation, referral/admission to hospital, additional testing, mortality and patient satisfaction. We aim to recruit a total sample size of 6111 patients. All outcomes will be analysed according to the intent-to-treat approach. We will use a mixed-effect logistic regression analysis to account for the clustering at practice level. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (current version), the principles of Good Clinical Practice and in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. Ethics approval for this study was obtained on 10 November 2020 from the Ethics Committee Research of University Hospitals Leuven under reference S62005. We will ensure that the findings of the study will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders other than the scientific world including the public, healthcare providers and policy-makers. The process evaluation that is part of this trial may provide a basis for an implementation strategy. If our intervention proves to be clinically and cost-effective, it will be essential to educate physicians about introducing the diagnostic algorithm including POC CRP testing and safety-netting advice in their daily practice.

All formulations were well tolerated, and adverse events after vaccination were generally mild to moderate, transient and highest in the adjuvanted groups. There was no CoVLP dose effect on serum NAbs, but titers increased significantly with both adjuvants. After the second dose, NAbs in the CoVLP + AS03 groups were more than tenfold higher than titers in Coronavirus 2019 convalescent sera.

Nevertheless, its clinical, virological and serological features are still a matter of debate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this cohort study, 170 consecutive subjects with new-onset OGD were consecutively recruited. Otolaryngological examination, OGD subjective grading, nasopharyngeal swabs (NS) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and serum samples (SS) collection for SARS-CoV-2 IgG quantification were conducted at baseline and after one (T1), two (T2) and four weeks (T3). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 79% of patients. Specifically, 43% of positive patients were detected only by SS analysis. The OGD was the only clinical complaint in 10% of cases. Concurrent sinonasal symptoms were reported by 45% of patients. Subjective improvement at T3 was reported by 97% of patients, with 40% recovering completely. Hormonal disorders and RNA detectability in NS were the only variables associated with OGD severity. Recovery rate was higher in case of seasonal influenza vaccination, lower in patients with systemic involvement and severe OGD. Not RNA levels nor IgG titers were correlated with recovery.

In particular, polymorphisms of the human IFITM3 gene have been shown to affect disease severity and progression in influenza A virus (FLUAV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, respectively. Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are commonly used to model human infections and the experimental inoculation of these animals with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is one of the best models for HIV/AIDS in humans. However, information on the role of IFITM3 in SIV infection of rhesus macaques is currently lacking. We show that rhesus macaque (rh) IFITM3 inhibits SIV and FLUAV entry in cell culture, although with moderately reduced efficiency as compared to its human counterpart. We further report the identification of 16 polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3 gene, three of which were exonic and synonymous while the remainder was located in non-coding regions. Employing previously characterized samples from two cohorts of SIV-infected rhesus macaques, we investigated the relationship between these rhIFITM3 polymorphisms and both AIDS-free survival time and virus load. In cohort 1, several intronic polymorphisms were significantly associated with virus load or survival. However, an association with both parameters was not observed and significance was lost in most cases when animals were stratified for the presence of MHC allele Mamu-A1*001. Moreover, no significant genotype-phenotype associations were detected in cohort 2. These results suggest that, although IFITM3 can inhibit SIV infection in cell culture, genetic variation in rhIFITM3 might have only a minor impact on the course of SIV infection in experimentally infected animals.","output":"Rhesus macaque IFITM3 gene polymorphisms and SIV infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objective of this paper is to identify the impacts of the COVID-crisis on growth, in particular on growth potential in the European Union (EU), in the context of a broader growth analysis. The quantitative analysis underlying this paper focuses on the financial and economic (\\"Great\\") recession of 2008-2009, the subsequent recovery and the period of the COVID-crisis. We provide a detailed overview of some of the mechanisms of the COVID-crisis on growth. The COVID-crisis is likely to have a direct impact on the level of potential output. A decrease in investments and labour market hysteresis may have long-lasting effects on potential growth. The former would have a negative impact on productivity. This can lead to increased inequalities and have a negative effect on social cohesion. The future development of divergences among the EU Member States is particularly important. Their possible intensification could disrupt the functioning of the euro area and the internal market. A lasting source of potential growth in the EU Member States could be productivity growth. Its decisive structural factor is the growth dynamism of total factor productivity (TFP). There are large differences in this area with regard to the level and growth dynamism of performance of the Member States. Narrowing the output gaps vis-a-vis the front-runners through deep structural reforms could be a key factor in raising growth potential.

Based on an online questionnaire, this study aims to assess how the significant changes in people's everyday lives induced by the French lockdown impacted their relationship with other species. Participants did not only observe and interact more with non human species, but also discovered new traits characterizing them, and felt less lonely thanks to them. The impact of the lockdown was stronger on people's relationship with their pets, farm animals, home plants and with birds than with other plants and animals. This study further demonstrates that participants with different profiles have been affected differently.

However, the way in which the resulting scores or classifications are produced from the input data may not be transparent. Algorithmic explainability or interpretability has become a focus of ML research. Shapley values, first introduced in game theory, can provide explanations of the result generated from a specific set of input data by a complex ML algorithm. METHODS: For a multivariate molecular diagnostic test in clinical use (the VeriStrat? test), we calculate and discuss the interpretation of exact Shapley values. We also employ some standard approximation techniques for Shapley value computation (local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) based methods) and compare the results with exact Shapley values. RESULTS: Exact Shapley values calculated for data collected from a cohort of 256 patients showed that the relative importance of attributes for test classification varied by sample. While all eight features used in the VeriStrat? test contributed equally to classification for some samples, other samples showed more complex patterns of attribute importance for classification generation. Exact Shapley values and Shapley-based interaction metrics were able to provide interpretable classification explanations at the sample or patient level, while patient subgroups could be defined by comparing Shapley value profiles between patients. LIME and SHAP approximation approaches, even those seeking to include correlations between attributes, produced results that were quantitatively and, in some cases qualitatively, different from the exact Shapley values. CONCLUSIONS: Shapley values can be used to determine the relative importance of input attributes to the result generated by a multivariate molecular diagnostic test for an individual sample or patient. Patient subgroups defined by Shapley value profiles may motivate translational research. However, correlations inherent in molecular data and the typically small ML training sets available for molecular diagnostic test development may cause some approximation methods to produce approximate Shapley values that differ both qualitatively and quantitatively from exact Shapley values. Hence, caution is advised when using approximate methods to evaluate Shapley explanations of the results of molecular diagnostic tests.

As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, supply chains were disrupted and fear of infection impacted food shopping decisions, pushing consumers to seek local and safer options for procuring fresh produce. Direct marketing arose as a promising alternative for both consumers and producers. We undertook a study in Bengaluru, India, in order to understand what direct marketing activities have unfolded with the COVID-19 pandemic. Media reports highlighted the plight of farmers struggling to market their harvest during lockdown as well as the farm to fork initiatives and lockdown farmers markets that have been created as a response. We see this moment as an opportunity to develop Bengaluru's food system to be more sustainable, specifically through the City Region Food System framework. This study conducted online and telephone surveys with both consumers and producers in Bengaluru to explore the elements of supply and demand that have fostered and hindered direct marketing schemes. We found that consumers are interested in sourcing fruits and vegetables directly from farmers, but communication and logistics between consumers and producers are major hindrances. Although producers are diversifying their marketing strategies, they need to be implemented at economically viable scales to ensure long-term success. We find that the role of technology, specifically messaging apps, can streamline direct marketing activities and remove the barriers that currently hamper rural-urban linkages.

LEA has been found highly prevalent among female elite athletes within endurance sports, thus hampering athletes health and performance. The prevalence and the underpinning risk factors of LEA among female elite football players are less studied. One reason is that the existing self-report measures and technological devices to monitor energy intake and expenditure are inadequately adapted to capture the nature of the physical activity and energy expenditure among football players and are thus inaccurate. The present paper outlines a study protocol addressing the prevalence of LEA, the measurement of LEA and the correlations of LEA in terms of health and performance in female football players. Four studies will be conducted with the following aims (1) to evaluate the accuracy of global positioning systems (GPS)-based devices to monitor energy expenditure with indirect calorimetry as the gold standard, (2) to assess energy intake, quantify energy expenditure and investigate energy availability through self-report instruments, double labelled water (DLW) and GPS monitoring devices, (3) to determine the point prevalence of LEA using self-report instruments, DLW, dual-X-ray-absorptiometry (DXA) to quantify muscle and bone mass distribution and density, and a battery of hormonal analyses, and (4) to explore whether the prevalence of LEA varies across a full football season. Measures covering mental symptoms and psychological resources will be included, and a selection of biological measures derived from study 3. Measurements of DXA and DLW are resource-demanding and will be collected from one professional club (N~20 women). In contrast, the remaining data will be collected from four professional clubs (N~60 women) located in Bergen, the largest city within the Western region of Norway.

Exploring their use and opinions about the app can inform improvements and diffusion of StopCovid among young people. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate health care students' knowledge of and attitudes, beliefs, and practices (KABP) toward the StopCovid app. METHODS: A field survey was conducted among 318 students at the health sciences campus of the University of Bordeaux, France, between September 25 and October 16, 2020. A quota sampling method was used, and descriptive statistics and univariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 318 respondents, 77.3% (n=246) had heard about the app, but only 11.3% (n=36) had downloaded it, and 4.7% (n=15) were still using it at the time of the survey. Among the 210 participants who had heard about the app but did not download it, the main reasons for not using the app were a belief that it was not effective given its limited diffusion (n=37, 17.6%), a lack of interest (n=37, 17.6%), and distrust in the data security and fear of being geolocated (n=33, 15.7%). Among the 72 students who had not heard of the app and were given a brief description of its functioning and confidentiality policy, 52.7% (n=38) said they would use it. Participants reported that the main solution for increasing the use of the app would be better communication about it (227/318, 71.4%).

Thrombocytopenia was reported in 107/187 CVST cases (57%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 50%C64%) in the ChAdOx1 nCov\\\\19 group, in none in the mRNA vaccine group (0%, 95% CI 0%C13%) and in 7/100 (7%, 95% CI 3%C14%) in the pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 group. In the ChAdOx1 nCov\\\\19 group, 39 (21%) reported COVID\\\\19 polymerase chain reaction tests were performed within 30 days of CVST symptom onset, and all were negative. Of the 117 patients with a reported outcome in the ChAdOx1 nCov\\\\19 group, 44 (38%, 95% CI 29%C47%) had died, compared to 2/10 (20%, 95% CI 6%C51%) in the mRNA vaccine group and 3/100 (3%, 95% CI 1%C8%) in the pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 group. Mortality amongst patients with thrombocytopenia in the ChAdOx1 nCov\\\\19 group was 49% (95% CI 39%C60%).

The data were collected between 2015 and 2019 in the health care centers of two large German initial reception centers for refugees. Multivariable analyses controlling for sociodemographics were carried out using generalized estimating equations. Out of 10,431 eligible residents, 6965 medical encounters of 2840 adult patients were recorded over 30 months. Of all the adult patients, 34.4% sought medical help for a respiratory symptom or diagnosis at least once. Older patients and patients from Sub-Saharan Africa sought help less often. The occurrence of ARD showed a typical distribution over the course of the year. Facility occupancy was not associated with ARD occurrence. Acute respiratory symptoms are a leading cause for adult refugee patients to seek medical care.

BACKGROUND PVE remains a rare but devastating complication of aortic valve replacement. Data regarding PVE after TAVR in low-risk patients are lacking. METHODS We performed a detailed review of all patients in the low-risk TAVR trials who underwent TAVR from 2016 to 2020 and were adjudicated to have definitive PVE by the independent Clinical Events Committee. RESULTS We analyzed 396 low-risk patients who underwent TAVR (including 72 with bicuspid valves). PVE occurred in 11 patients at a median 379 days (210, 528) from TAVR. The incidence within the first 30 days was 0%; days 31-365, 1.5%; and after day 365, 2.8%. The most common organism identified was Streptococcus (n = 4/11). Early PVE ( 365 days) occurred in five patients, of whom three demonstrated evidence of embolic stroke and two underwent surgical aortic valve re-intervention. Late PVE (> 365 days) occurred in six patients, of whom thee demonstrated evidence of embolic stroke and only one underwent surgical aortic valve re-intervention. Of the six patients with evidence of embolic stroke, two died, two were discharged to rehabilitation, and two were discharged home with home care. CONCLUSIONS PVE was infrequent following TAVR in low-risk patients but was associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Embolic stroke complicated the majority of PVE cases, contributing to worse outcomes in these patients.

The COVID-19 vaccine development is underway and it may take a significant amount of time to develop the vaccine and after development, it will take time to vaccinate the entire population, and plasma therapy has some limitations. Herd immunity can be a plausible option to fight COVID-19 for small countries. But for a country with huge population like India, herd immunity is not a plausible option, because to acquire herd immunity approximately 67% of the population has to be recovered from COVID-19 infection, which will put an extra burden on medical system of the country and will result in a huge loss of human life. Thus epidemiological interventions (complete lockdown, partial lockdown, quarantine, isolation, social distancing, etc.) are some suitable strategies in India to slow down the COVID-19 spread until the vaccine development.

Proper and faster diagnosis of pneumonia at an early stage is imperative for optimal patient care. Currently, chest X-ray is considered as the best imaging modality for diagnosing pneumonia. However, the interpretation of chest X-ray images is challenging. To this end, we aimed to use an automated convolutional neural network-based transfer-learning approach to detect pneumonia in paediatric chest radiographs. METHODS: Herein, an automated convolutional neural network-based transfer-learning approach using four different pre-trained models (i.e. VGG19, DenseNet121, Xception, and ResNet50) was applied to detect pneumonia in children (1-5 years) chest X-ray images. The performance of different proposed models for testing data set was evaluated using five performances metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity/recall, Precision, area under curve, and F1 score. RESULTS: All proposed models provide accuracy greater than 83.0% for binary classification. The pre-trained DenseNet121 model provides the highest classification performance of automated pneumonia classification with 86.8% accuracy, followed by Xception model with an accuracy of 86.0%. The sensitivity of the proposed models was greater than 91.0%. The Xception and DenseNet121 models achieve the highest classification performance with F1-score greater than 89.0%. The plotted area under curve of receiver operating characteristics of VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 models are 0.78, 0.81, 0.81, and 0.86, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that the proposed models achieve a high accuracy for binary classification. Transfer learning was used to accelerate training of the proposed models and resolve the problem associated with insufficient data. We hope that these proposed models can help radiologists for a quick diagnosis of pneumonia at radiology departments. Moreover, our proposed models may be useful to detect other chest-related diseases such as novel Coronavirus 2019.

We report our experiences and lessons learned during the initial 2\\\\year phase of developing and implementing the ILHSI. METHODS: The initial goals of the ILHSI were to instantiate the concept, establish partnerships, and perform LHS pilot projects to inform expansion. We established shared governance and technical capabilities, conducted a literature review\\\\based and regional environmental scan, and convened key stakeholders to iteratively identify focus areas, and select and implement six initial joint projects. RESULTS: The ILHSI successfully collaborated with its partner organizations to establish a foundational governance structure, set goals and strategies, and prioritize projects and training activities. We developed and deployed strategies to effectively use health system and regional HIE infrastructure and minimize information silos, a frequent challenge for multi\\\\organizational LHSs. Successful projects were diverse and included deploying a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Standards (FHIR)\\\\based tool across emergency departments state\\\\wide, analyzing free\\\\text elements of cross\\\\hospital surveys, and developing models to provide clinical decision support based on clinical and social determinants of health.

The latter is related to increased mortality in COVID-19. Still, it is not clear if iron dysmetabolism is mechanistically linked to COVID-19 pathobiology. METHODS: We herein present data from the ongoing prospective, multicentre, observational CovILD cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04416100), which systematically follows up patients after COVID-19. 109 participants were evaluated 60 days after onset of first COVID-19 symptoms including clinical examination, chest computed tomography and laboratory testing. RESULTS: We investigated subjects with mild to critical COVID-19, of which the majority received hospital treatment. 60 days after disease onset, 30% of subjects still presented with iron deficiency and 9% had anemia, mostly categorized as anemia of inflammation. Anemic patients had increased levels of inflammation markers such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein and survived a more severe course of COVID-19. Hyperferritinemia was still present in 38% of all individuals and was more frequent in subjects with preceding severe or critical COVID-19. Analysis of the mRNA expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated a correlation of increased ferritin and cytokine mRNA expression in these patients. Finally, persisting hyperferritinemia was significantly associated with severe lung pathologies in computed tomography scans and a decreased performance status as compared to patients without hyperferritinemia. DISCUSSION: Alterations of iron homeostasis can persist for at least two months after the onset of COVID-19 and are closely associated with non-resolving lung pathologies and impaired physical performance. Determination of serum iron parameters may thus be a easy to access measure to monitor the resolution of COVID-19.

Although the mutation at the population level had been extensively investigated, how the mutations evolve at the individual level is largely unknown, partly due to the difficulty of obtaining unbiased genome coverage of SARS-CoV-2 directly from clinical samples. Methods Eighteen time series fecal samples were collected from nine COVID-19 patients during the convalescent phase. The nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 were enriched by the hybrid capture method with different rounds of hybridization. Results By examining the sequencing depth, genome coverage, and allele frequency change, we demonstrated the impeccable performance of the hybrid capture method in samples with Ct value < 34, as well as significant improvement comparing to direct metatranscriptomic sequencing in samples with lower viral loads. We identified 229 intra-host variants at 182 sites in 18 fecal samples. Among them, nineteen variants presented frequency changes > 0.3 within 1-5 days, reflecting highly dynamic intra-host viral populations. Meanwhile, we also found that the same mutation showed different frequency changes in different individuals, indicating a strong random drift. Moreover, the evolving of the viral genome demonstrated that the virus was still viable in the gastrointestinal tract during the convalescent period. Conclusions The hybrid capture method enables reliable analyses of inter- and intra-host variants of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which changed dramatically in the gastrointestinal tract; its clinical relevance warrants further investigation.","output":"Hybrid capture-based sequencing enables unbiased recovery of SAR-CoV-2 genomes from fecal samples and characterization of the dynamics of intra-host variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The bursting of the US housing bubble in the second half of 2008 triggered an almost unprecedented systemic crisis in the world economy.

Outside of the ICU setting, D-dimer elevation on presentation or marked increase from baseline should alert the need for doppler ultrasound scan of the lower limbs. In the ICU setting, consideration should be given to routine screening with doppler ultrasound, given the high prevalence of thrombosis in this cohort despite standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. However, absence of lower limb thrombosis on ultrasound does not exclude pulmonary venous thrombosis. Screening with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is not justified in patients on the general wards, unless there are clinical features and/or marked elevations in markers of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. However, the risk of pulmonary embolism or pulmonary thrombosis in ICU patients is very high, especially in patients on ECMO, where studies that employed routine screening for thrombosis with CT scanning have uncovered up to 100% incidence of pulmonary thrombosis despite standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. Therefore, in patients at low bleeding risk and high clinical suspicion of venous thromboembolism, therapeutic anticoagulation should be considered even before screening, Our review highlights the need for increased vigilance for VTE, with a low threshold for doppler ultrasound and CTPA in high risk in-patient cohorts, where clinical features and D-dimer levels may not accurately reflect the occurrence of pulmonary thromboembolism.","output":"Screening for venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[RESUMEN].

If this syndrome is caused by septic shock, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Bundle suggests that vasopressin be given to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mmHg if the patient is hypotensive after fluid resuscitation. Nevertheless, it is important to note that some studies found an effect of various mean arterial pressures on organ function; for example, a MAP of less than 75 mmHg was associated with the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, no published study has evaluated the risk factors of mortality in the subgroup of acute kidney injury with respiratory failure, and little is known of the impact of general risk factors that may increase the mortality rate. Materials and Methods: The objective of this study was to determine the risk factors that might directly affect survival in critically ill patients with multiple organ failure in this subgroup. We retrospectively constructed a cohort study of patients who were admitted to the ICUs, including medical, surgical, and neurological, over 24 months (2015.1 to 2016.12) at Chiayi Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. We only considered patients who met the criteria of acute renal injury according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) and were undergoing mechanical ventilator support due to acute respiratory failure at admission. Results: Data showed that the overall ICU and hospital mortality rate was 63.5%. The most common cause of ICU admission in this cohort study was cardiovascular disease (31.7%) followed by respiratory disease (28.6%). Most patients (73%) suffered sepsis during their ICU admission and the mean length of hospital stay was 24.32  25.73 days. In general, the factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality were lactate > 51.8 mg/dL, MAP  77.16 mmHg, and pH  7.22. The risk of in-patient mortality was analyzed using a multivariable Cox regression survival model. Adjusting for other covariates, MAP  77.16 mmHg was associated with higher probability of in-hospital death [OR = 3.06 (1.374C6.853), p = 0.006]. The other independent outcome predictor of mortality was pH  7.22 [OR = 2.40 (1.122C5.147), p = 0.024]. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated and the log rank statistic was highly significant. Conclusions: Acute kidney injury combined with respiratory failure is associated with high mortality. High mean arterial pressure and normal blood pH might improve these outcomes. Therefore, the acidCbase status and MAP should be considered when attempting to predict outcome. Moreover, the blood pressure targets for acute kidney injury in critical care should not be similar to those recommended for the general population and might prevent mortality.","output":"Effects of Mean Artery Pressure and Blood pH on Survival Rate of Patients with Acute Kidney Injury Combined with Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory response; however, the precise mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation is poorly understood. Here we investigated direct inflammatory functions of major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We observed that spike (S) protein potently induces inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, IL-1, TNF, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL2, but not IFNs in human and mouse macrophages. No such inflammatory response was observed in response to membrane (M), envelope (E), and neucleocapsid (N) proteins. When stimulated with extracellular S protein, human lung epithelial cells A549 also produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, epithelial cells expressing S protein intracellularly are non-inflammatory, but elicit an inflammatory response in macrophages when co-cultured. Biochemical studies revealed that S protein triggers inflammation via activation of the NF-B pathway in a MyD88-dependent manner. Further, such an activation of the NF-B pathway is abrogated in Tlr2-deficient macrophages. Consistently, administration of S protein induces IL-6, TNF-, and IL-1 in wild-type, but not Tlr2-deficient mice. Together these data reveal a mechanism for the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that TLR2 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces inflammation via TLR2-dependent activation of the NF-B pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the summer semester 2019/20 it was degreed that universities switch to purely online learning due to COVID-19/SARS-CoV?2.

Several published meta-analyses have provided quantitative summaries for some of these associations, but not for respiratory infections. Demonstrating a causal relationship between dampness-related agents, which are preventable exposures, and respiratory tract infections would suggest important new public health strategies. We report the results of quantitative meta-analyses of published studies that examined the association of dampness or mold in homes with respiratory infections and bronchitis. METHODS: For primary studies meeting eligibility criteria, we transformed reported odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) to the log scale. Both fixed and random effects models were applied to the log ORs and their variances. Most studies contained multiple estimated ORs. Models accounted for the correlation between multiple results within the studies analyzed. One set of analyses was performed with all eligible studies, and another set restricted to studies that controlled for age, gender, smoking, and socioeconomic status. Subgroups of studies were assessed to explore heterogeneity. Funnel plots were used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: The resulting summary estimates of ORs from random effects models based on all studies ranged from 1.38 to 1.50, with 95% CIs excluding the null in all cases. Use of different analysis models and restricting analyses based on control of multiple confounding variables changed findings only slightly. ORs (95% CIs) from random effects models using studies adjusting for major confounding variables were, for bronchitis, 1.45 (1.32-1.59); for respiratory infections, 1.44 (1.31-1.59); for respiratory infections excluding nonspecific upper respiratory infections, 1.50 (1.32-1.70), and for respiratory infections in children or infants, 1.48 (1.33-1.65). Little effect of publication bias was evident. Estimated attributable risk proportions ranged from 8% to 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Residential dampness and mold are associated with substantial and statistically significant increases in both respiratory infections and bronchitis. If these associations were confirmed as causal, effective control of dampness and mold in buildings would prevent a substantial proportion of respiratory infections.","output":"Association of residential dampness and mold with respiratory tract infections and bronchitis: a meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Restrictions due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reduced physical activity provision for both children and their parents. Recent studies have reported decreases in physical activity levels during lockdown restrictions, but these were largely reliant on self-report methods, with data collected via unrepresentative self-report surveys. The post-pandemic impacts on childrens activity levels remain unknown. A key question is how active children become once lockdown restrictions are lifted. METHODS: Active-6 is a repeated cross-sectional natural experiment. Accelerometer data from 1296 children aged 10C11 and their parents were collected in 50 schools in the Greater Bristol area, UK in March 2017-May 2018 (pre-COVID-19 comparator group), and compared to 393 children aged 10C11 and parents in 23 of the same schools, collected in May-December 2021. Mean minutes of accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were derived for weekdays and weekend and compared pre- and post-lockdown via linear multilevel models. RESULTS: After adjusting for seasonality, accelerometer wear time and child/parent demographics, childrens mean weekday and weekend MVPA were 7.7 min (95% CI: 3.5 to 11.9) and 6.9 min (95% CI: 0.9 to 12.9) lower in 2021 than in 2018, respectively, while sedentary time was higher by 25.4 min (95% CI: 15.8 to 35.0) and 14.0 min (95% CI: 1.5 to 26.5). There was no evidence that differences varied by child gender or household education. There was no significant difference in parents MVPA or sedentary time, either on weekdays or weekends. CONCLUSIONS: Childrens MVPA was lower by 7C8 min/day in 2021 once restrictions were lifted than before the pandemic for all groups, on both weekdays and weekends. Previous research has shown that there is an undesirable age-related decline in childrens physical activity. The 8-min difference reported here would be broadly comparable to the decline that would have previously been expected to occur over a three-year period. Parents physical activity was similar to pre-pandemic levels. Our results suggest that despite easing of restrictions, childrens activity levels have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. There is an urgent need to understand why these changes have occurred and how long they are maintained.

When planning a program among partnering institutions, stakeholders may underestimate the need for, and value of, collaborative practice in facilitating partnership functioning. This method paper outlines an evaluative model to increase the use of collaborative practice in funded academic partnership programs. The model highlights collaborative practice across multiple stakeholder groups in the academic ecology: Sponsors of funded programs (S), Program partners and participants (P), Assessment and evaluation professionals (A), academic researchers (R), and the national and global Community (C). The SPARC model emphasizes evidence-based benefits of collaborative practice across multiple outcome domains. Tools and frameworks for evaluating collaborative practice take a view of optimizing partnership operational performance in achieving stated goals. Collaborative practice can also be an integral element of program activities that support the academic success and scholarly productivity, psychosocial adjustment, and physical and psychological well-being of stakeholders participating in the program. Given the goal of our alliance to promote diversification of the professoriate, the model highlights the use of collaborative practice in supporting stakeholders from groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields across these outcome domains. Using data from a mixed-methods program evaluation of our AGEP alliance over 4 years, the authors provide concrete examples of collaborative practice and their measurement.

Changes in APA have been associated with multiple biological processes and disease phenotypes. However, the role of hormones and their drug analogs in APA remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated transcriptome-wide the impact of glucocorticoids on APA in 30 human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. We found that glucocorticoids could regulate APA of a subset of genes, possibly by changing the expression of 142 RNA-binding proteins, some with known APA-regulating properties. Interestingly, genes with glucocorticoid-mediated APA were enriched in viral translation-related pathways, while genes with glucocorticoid-mediated expression were enriched in interferon and interleukin pathways, suggesting that glucocorticoid-mediated APA might result in functional consequences distinct from gene expression. Glucocorticoid-mediated APA was also cell-type-specific, suggesting an action of glucocorticoids that may be unique to immune regulation. We also observed evidence for genotype-dependent glucocorticoid-mediated APA, providing potential functional mechanisms for a series of common genetic variants that had previously been associated with immune disorders, but without a clear mechanism. In summary, this study reports a series of novel observations regarding the impact of glucocorticoids on APA, suggesting novel avenues for mechanistic studies of hormonal biology.","output":"Glucocorticoids Mediate Transcriptome-wide Alternative Polyadenylation: Mechanisms and Functional Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Declaration de liens d'interets: Les auteurs declarent ne pas avoir de liens d'interets Copyright ? 2020","output":"Impact de la pandemie COVID-19 sur les consommations hospitalieres en antibiotiques, etude monocentrique d'un ESR metropolitain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To identify the experiences and lessons learned on 'fever clinics' during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Beijing and to propose a better model in monitoring SARS to fit the 'fever clinics' into current situation.

Monocyte activation markers and cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-10, and sIL2R were elevated, corresponding to monocyte activation syndrome, while IL-1 levels were low. LPS, HKLM and Aspergillus fumigatus antigen stimulation provoked an immune response that did not differ between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, while COVID-19 patients showed an attenuated monocyte CD80 upregulation and abrogated release of IL-6, TNF, IL-1, and IL-1 toward Candida albicans. This study adds further detail to the characterization of the immune response in critically ill COVID-19 patients and hints at an increased susceptibility for Candida albicans infection.","output":"COVID-19 Impairs Immune Response to Candida albicans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Numerous studies have shown an effect of rapidly spreading SARS-COV-2 on combined anxiety-depressive disorders and maladjustment syndrome occurrences. Objective: To determine the primary medical students reactive anxiety level and the final scores of their educational progress in distance learning during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Materials and Methods: The study involved 824 students at medical universities in Saratov and Moscow. The assessment of the reactive anxiety level was carried out according to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI;the average score of students' academic performance was calculated according to the data of the technological platform \\"1C: Enterprise\\" version 8.4.1. The survey was completed during distance learning in May 2020. The quality of distance learning was compared to a similar score for 2019, when students were trained in a traditional way. Statistical analysis was conducted using Statistica 6.0. Results: It was shown the presence of moderately severe disorders among the primary medical students according to the average score of reactive anxiety (43.28  12.85), that expressed more in females s (p&lt;0.05), After distance learning, lasting 25% of the whole course, the overall performance score in theoretical knowledge did not change significantly (p&gt;0.05) but the practical skills suffered much especially in time trend (p&lt;0.05). Novelty: It was found that a high level of the reactive anxiety negatively affects the students' adaptive capabilities and the education quality. The specificity of programs at different faculties can determine the state of the students' psychological status. Findings: Timely transition to online classes during pandemics helps to preserve the students' mental well-being and the quality of the educational process. The duration of distance learning for a practical course should not exceed 25% of the whole course. ? 2021 by the authors. Licensee ESJ, Italy.

Optimal medical treatment is not completely understood at this time. The epidemiology and outcomes of bacterial co-infections are not well-established; however, empiric antibiotic (abx) use is anecdotally common. The purpose of this study is to characterize empiric antimicrobial drug selection and timing in COVID-19 and evaluate the impact on patient outcomes. METHODS: Cross-sectional cohort study for COVID-19 positive inpatients from March 1, 2020 to June 1, 2020 at an academic medical center and 4 community hospitals. Inclusion: patients with a documented positive COVID-19 PCR nasopharyngeal swab. Exclusion: patients less than 18 years; deceased or transitioned to hospice within 24 hours of admission. Primary endpoint: empiric abx drug, initiation, duration and indication. Additional data collected: severity of illness, co-infection diagnosis, microbiology, and adverse drug effects (ADE). Clinical outcomes included time to recovery by COVID-19 ordinal outcome, clinical status at day 15, and readmission. RESULTS: 400 patients were included with 27% from the ICU. COVID symptom category included mild (23.8%), moderate (53%), severe (15%), and critical (8.3%). 322 (80.5%) received abx at any time during hospital stay, 301 (93.5%) started within 1 day of admission. Most common documented indication community-acquired pneumonia (69%). Identified 43 (10.8%) microbiologically confirmed co-infections, including 5 MRSA and 7 Pseudomonas. Median duration of initial abx 4 days. 54/322 (16.8%) had abx restarted after discontinuation. Median days to recovery without abx was 10 days (7 C 14) and 14 days (9 C 20) with abx. Patient characteristics and outcomes described in table 1. 74 abx related ADE were identified: gastrointestinal 37 and renal 22. CONCLUSION: Its difficult to distinguish bacterial and Covid-19 in coinfections in patients ill enough to be hospitalized. Longer courses of empiric abx therapy were prevalent as the severity of illness increased. However, the low frequency of microbiologically confirmed bacterial co-infections results in potentially unnecessary abx exposure. This exposure increases risk of abx ADE and may not improve clinical outcome. [Image: see text] DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","output":"391.

A secondary objective was to determine the extent to which the associations were influenced by multiple potential confounding variables. A cross-sectional design and 8 years of data from the 2011-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used to answer the research questions. Ten macronutrients were evaluated: total carbohydrate, starch, simple carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total protein, total fat, saturated, polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, and total unsaturated fat. The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), based on fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels, was used to index insulin resistance. Age, sex, race, year of assessment, physical activity, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and waist circumference were used as covariates. The relationships between total carbohydrate intake (F = 6.7, p = 0.0121), simple carbohydrate (F = 4.7, p = 0.0344) and HOMA-IR were linear and direct. The associations between fiber intake (F = 9.1, p = 0.0037), total protein (F = 4.4, p = 0.0393), total fat (F = 5.5, p = 0.0225), monounsaturated fat (F = 5.5, p = 0.0224), and total unsaturated fat (F = 6.5, p = 0.0132) were linear and inversely related to HOMA-IR, with 62 degrees of freedom.

As obesity had a positive association with the risk of HT. Thus, this retrospective study was established to further explore the gender relationship between metabolic obesity phenotypes and the risk of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). Materials and Methods Data for 3697 subjects aged 18 years were randomly collected from a Health check-up database from April to December 2019. Obesity was defined by general obesity (GO; body mass index [BMI] 28 kg/m2) and abdominal obesity (AO; waist circumstance, male 90 cm, female 85 cm). Metabolic unhealthy was defined as having at least one metabolic syndrome component and a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance 2.5. Obesity phenotypes were divided into three groups: GO, AO, compound obesity (GO+AO). After adjustment for potential confounding factors, multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between metabolic obesity phenotypes and risk of HT by sex and explore the correlation between different obesity patterns and HT risk by metabolic health status. Results The incidence of HT was 23.5% and significantly higher among females than males with different metabolic phenotypes (26.2% vs 20.5%, p<0.05), except metabolically healthy AO. Compared with non-obese subjects, different metabolic obesity phenotypes were independent risk factors among males (p<0.05). Among females, unhealthy metabolic status with GO (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=2.62) or AO (adjusted OR=2.87) and metabolically healthy non-GO (adjusted OR=2.05) were risk factors of HT (p<0.05). Increasing BMI categories and waist circumstance quartiles were positively correlated with HT risk (p for trend <0.05). Subgroup analyses indicated that GO+AO (adjusted OR=2.52) or only AO (adjusted OR=2.41) were risk factors for HT for those with unhealthy metabolic status. Moreover, GO+AO (adjusted OR=2.37) was an independent risk factor for HT under healthy metabolic status. Conclusion GO+AO was associated with an increased risk of HT, identifying higher BMI/WC as a significant risk factor for HT. Males with unhealthy metabolic state or obesity and metabolically unhealthy females with obesity are high-risk group for HT. Additionally, only AO and GO+AO conferred increased risk of HT for individuals with metabolic abnormalities.","output":"Gender-Specific Impact of Metabolic Obesity Phenotypes on the Risk of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: A Retrospective Data Analysis Using a Health Check-Up Database."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance > The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has posed unique challenges to orthodontic profession by adversely impacting provision of in-office orthodontic care due to prevailing uncertainty around risks pertaining to splatter and aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). This review aims to provide an insight into the prevailing and emerging evidence informing potential risks related to splatter and AGPs, and risk mitigation strategies employed for reducing the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from dental bioaerosols. Methods > PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, LILACS, WHO COVID-19 databases and preprint databases were searched for eligible English language publications. Citation chasing was undertaken up until the review date of 4 January 2021. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment was undertaken independently in duplicate, or else by consultation with a third author. Results > Following filter application and duplicates removed, a total of 13 articles assessing procedural mitigation measures were included. Seven included studies revealed overall low risk of bias. The overall risk varied from unclear to high for rest of the studies, with the most concerning domains being blinding of the participants and the personnel and blinding of the outcome assessors. Accumulated consensual evidence points towards the use of dental suction devices with wide bore aspirating tips as effective procedural mitigation strategies. Variations in the literature can be observed concerning aerosol transmission associated with water spray use during debonding. Emerging direct evidence consistently supports adjunctive use of preprocedural Povidone-Iodine mouthrinse to mitigate direct transmission risk in the orthodontic practice.

Based on an extended SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model and continuous-time optimal control theory, we compute the optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy for the case that a vaccine is never found and complete containment (eradication of the epidemic) is impossible. In this case, the optimal control must meet competing requirements: First, the minimization of disease-related deaths, and, second, the establishment of a sufficient degree of natural immunity at the end of the measures, in order to exclude a second wave. Moreover, the socio-economic costs of the intervention shall be kept at a minimum. The numerically computed optimal control strategy is a single-intervention scenario that goes beyond heuristically motivated interventions and simple flattening of the curve. Careful analysis of the computed control strategy reveals, however, that the obtained solution is in fact a tightrope walk close to the stability boundary of the system, where socio-economic costs and the risk of a new outbreak must be constantly balanced against one another.

Similarly, haptic abilities (HA) refer to translating tactile information from the immediate environment into mental images and are involved in handling anatomical specimens and technical skill acquisition common to clinicians. Both abilities independently play an important role in learning anatomy, yet the relationships between SA and HA are unknown. The objective of this study is to explore SA-HA interactions. METHODS The Mental Rotations Test (MRT) and the newly developed haptic abilities test (HAT) respectively quantified SA and HA in undergraduate students. The HAT, modelled after the MRT, consisted of untimed, matching questions utilizing MRT-styled 3D handheld wooden objects (~10cm3) under three sensory conditions using sight (S), haptics (H) and the combination of both sight and haptics (SH). While HAT condition scores and response times determined accuracy, video recorded subject gaze and haptic behaviours on a question-by-question basis. Scores for MRT are presented as mean  SD and HAT scores as median (Q1-Q3). RESULTS Subjects (n=16, 10F, 20-28yrs) completed the MRT and HAT and were categorized into high (n=9, 4F, MRT: 14.83) and low (n=7, 6F, MRT: 6.33) (H/LSA) groups (p<0.0001). Scores obtained in the H condition [14 (13-15) vs14 (14-14), p=0.0031] were significantly lower than in the S [15 (15-15) vs14 (14-15)] and SH conditions [15 (15-15) vs14 (14-15)] in H/LSA groups respectively. Spearman's correlation coefficient illustrated MRT scores were moderately related in the S condition (r=0.506, p=0.038), but unrelated in the SH and H conditions (SH: r=0.325, p=0.203; H: r=0.162, p=0.534). The number of pupillary fixations per question was similar (S:6.03.0 vs5.91.4, p=0.910; SH: 4.52.0 vs6.72.0, p=0.099) for H/LSA groups respectively. Initial descriptive analyses of hand behaviours (n=4) suggest H/LSA objects differently. DISCUSSION Despite significant difference in SA, when individuals are presented identical environmental 3D objects to view, view and touch, or touch alone, it is difficult to differentiate SA. These data suggest that the addition of haptic sensory information may aid LSA individuals completing spatial tasks. Although visual attention and timing of haptic behaviours may be similar between H/LSA subjects, further kinematic analysis of haptic strategies may be more meaningful to isolate how somatosensory inputs aid problem solving behaviours in LSA persons. This is some of the first data to simultaneously measure hand and gaze behaviour during spatially challenging tasks in individuals with divergent SA. Given recent migrations to online anatomy teaching and learning environments due to COVID-19, understanding learner behaviour when sensory inputs, like haptics, are removed is valuable evidence that can inform future anatomy curriculum and resource development.","output":"Do Our Hands See What Our Eyes See: Investigating the Relationships Between Spatial and Haptic Abilities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The Australian federal government introduced new COVID-19 psychiatrist Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) telehealth items to assist with providing private specialist care. We investigate private psychiatrists' uptake of video and telephone telehealth, as well as total (telehealth and face-to-face) consultations for Quarter 3 (July-September), 2020. We compare these to the same quarter in 2019. METHOD: MBS-item service data were extracted for COVID-19-psychiatrist video and telephone telehealth item numbers and compared with Quarter 3 (July-September), 2019, of face-to-face consultations for the whole of Australia. RESULTS: The number of psychiatry consultations (telehealth and face-to-face) rose during the first wave of the pandemic in Quarter 3, 2020, by 14% compared to Quarter 3, 2019, with telehealth 43% of this total. Face-to-face consultations in Quarter 3, 2020 were only 64% of the comparative number of Quarter 3, 2019 consultations. Most telehealth involved short telephone consultations of a??15-30 min.

METHODS The diagnosis of patients with ARF in Peking University Third Hospital from January 1994 to December 2003 was reconfirmed and the data of epidemiology, etiology and prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS Only 209 discharged cases were diagnosed with ARF and all were reconfirmed. Two peak occurrences were found at ages of 35-45 and 60-80 with a male predominance of approximately 59.7%. Patients diagnosed with ARF accounted for 1.19 per thousand of the admissions in the same period and increased significantly in the last 5 years (p = 0.038). The creatinine level at diagnosis was 345.8 +/- 122.6 micromol/l and had no significant change (p > 0.05). The percent of hospital-acquired ARF (HA-ARF) demonstrated a significant increase in 1999-2003 compared to 1994-1998 (p = 0.008). Intrarenal ARF accounted for 73.69% and was multifactorial, with drugs, infections and operations as leading causes. Renal biopsy was performed in 37.32% (78/209) with 53.84% (42/78) having acute interstitial nephritis. Maintenance dialysis was discontinued in 46.41% because their renal function completely or partially recovered. The overall mortality was 37.91% without improvement over time.

The 4 local SARS-CoV-2 strains and 26 of 28 imported SARS-CoV-2 strains from this study were assigned to lineage B.1.617.2 (Supplementary Table S2), which was the fourth variant of concern (VOC) (Delta variant). The other two imported SARS-CoV-2 strains were assigned to lineage B.1.351 and lineage C.1.2. Molecular phylogeny indicated that 30 SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants (lineage B.1.617.2) from this study formed 2 distinct clades (Figure 1). The imported strain hCoV-19/Shenzhen/IVDC-0610-01/2021 (Case1) clustered in clade A and showed the closest relationship to the Indian strain hCoV-19/India/GJ-NCDC-NIV-INSACOG-24095/2021 by an Audacity Instant search in Global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID). The 4 local SARS-CoV-2 strains of lineage B.1.617.2 and 25 imported SARS-CoV-2 strains of lineage B.1.617.2 clustered in clade B and showed the closest relationship or showed only one nucleotide difference to the British strain hCoV-19/England/MILK-155F811/2021. These 29 SARS-CoV-2 strains of lineage B.1.617.2 showed at least 23 nucleotide differences to the strain hCoV-19/ Shenzhen/IVDC-0610-01/2021 (Case 1). In clade B, the imported strain hCoV-19/Shenzhen/IVDC-0610-04/2021 (Case 4) showed a certain degree of genetic distance to the other 28 virus strains from this study, which was also indicated by comparative analysis of genome sequences in the Table 1. The local B.1.617.2 strain hCoV-19/Shenzhen/IVDC-06-14/2021 (Case A) showed 100% sequence identity to 19 imported B.1.617.2 strains (Table 1). These 20 SARS-CoV-2 strains of lineage B.1.617.2 shared 31 nucleotide variation sites and 22 deletion mutations compared with the reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1. Except for the variation sites above, an additional variation site was observed in genomes of the 3 local strains hCoV-19/Shenzhen/IVDC-06-17/2021 (Case B), hCoV-19/Shenzhen/IVDC-06-18/2021 (Case C), and hCoV-19/Shenzhen/IVDC-06-20/2021 (Case D). The local strain hCoV-19/Shenzhen/IVDC-06-17/2021 (Case B) showed 100% sequence identity to the strain hCoV-19/Shenzhen/IVDC-0610-20/2021 from imported Case 20. Among imported SARS-CoV-2 strains, genome sequences of 19 SARS-CoV-2 strains from imported passengers showed 100% sequence identity to each other, and these 19 passengers had no common exposure history before boarding. It suggested that at least one virus transmission occurred between the 19 passengers after boarding. The only strain from Case 1 belonged to clade A within lineage B.1.617.2, which indicated that Case 1 was not related to the infection in the cabin. Based on phylogenetic relationship and comparative analysis of genome sequences, we deduced that 3 virus strains from local cases (Cases B to D) and 5 virus strains from imported passengers (Cases 10, 20, 34, 37, and 39) were progeny viruses. According to the report by Li et al (2), SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant strains from this study showed 18 to 28 nucleotide differences to those from the first outbreak of COVID-19 in Guangzhou, May 2021, which suggested that SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant that caused local outbreaks of COVID-19 in Guangzhou and Shenzhen came from different sources. At present, the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is becoming the dominant variant worldwide and has been detected in at least 142 countries as of August 10, 2021. The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is posing new challenges on the control and prevention of COVID-19 due to its increased transmissibility compared with Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7) and capacity of immune escape (3-7). In conclusion, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) confirmed that 4 local SARS-CoV-2 strains and 26 of 28 imported SARS-CoV-2 strains from this study were Delta variants, and phylogenetic and comparative genome analyses showed close relationship between the four local SARS-CoV-2 strains of Delta variant and imported SARS-CoV-2 strains of Delta variant introduced from South Africa.","output":"Whole-Genome Sequences Analysis Displays Relationship of SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant Between Four Local Cases and Passengers of a Flight from South Africa  Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, China, June 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Escherichia coli exposed to industrial-scale heterogeneous mixing conditions respond to external stress by initiating short-term metabolic and long-term strategic transcriptional programs. In native habitats, long-term strategies allow survival in severe stress but are of limited use in large bioreactors, where microenvironmental conditions may change right after said programs are started. Related on/off switching of genes causes additional ATP burden that may reduce the cellular capacity for producing the desired product. Here, we present an agent-based data-driven model linked to computational fluid dynamics, finally allowing to predict additional ATP needs of Escherichia coli K12 W3110 exposed to realistic large-scale bioreactor conditions. The complex model describes transcriptional up- and downregulation dynamics of about 600 genes starting from subminute range covering 28 h. The data-based approach was extracted from comprehensive scale-down experiments. Simulating mixing and mass transfer conditions in a 54 m3 stirred bioreactor, 120,000 E. coli cells were tracked while fluctuating between different zones of glucose availability. It was found that cellular ATP demands rise between 30% and 45% of growth decoupled maintenance needs, which may limit the production of ATP-intensive product formation accordingly. Furthermore, spatial analysis of individual cell transcriptional patterns reveal very heterogeneous gene amplifications with hot spots of 50%-80% messenger RNA upregulation in the upper region of the bioreactor. The phenomenon reflects the time-delayed regulatory response of the cells that propagate through the stirred tank. After 4.2 h, cells adapt to environmental changes but still have to bear an additional 6% ATP demand.","output":"Data-driven in silico prediction of regulation heterogeneity and ATP demands of Escherichia coli in large-scale bioreactors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the year 2020, the sanitary emergency norm forced universities to teach under the remote learning method, representing a challenge of designing courses that require high effectiveness.

METHODS: : Nineteen thousand four hundred ninety-six adults living in Italy were administered an online protocol including a sociodemographic checklist and questionnaires investigating suicide ideation and risk, mental health status and general distress (stress, anxiety, and depression), resilience, and perceived support. RESULTS: : One thousand two hundred seventy-four reported having lost their job because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 5.4% of the sample reported a mental illness (mostly a depressive disorder). Unemployment was independently associated with mental illness, poor mental health, and depression. Mental illness was associated with the risk of losing one's job because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but not at the multivariate analyses. Those who lost their job because of the COVID-19 pandemic (compared to others) reported worse mental health and depression. LIMITATIONS: : The presence of mental illness was self-reported by respondents and the administered measures were self-reported questionnaires affected by social desirability and other response bias.

Here, we explore the role of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines on hospital admission in predicting the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: This study included 214 patients with COVID-19 who were treated at Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital from January 19, 2020 to April 30, 2020. Any mutants were not detected in the studied patients. Patients were divided into non-intensive care unit (ICU) (mild/moderate) group and ICU (severe/critical) group, according to the severity of the disease. Clinical and laboratory data, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, were analyzed and compared. Logistic regression was used to analyze the predictive factors for ICU admission. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to evaluate the predictive value of selected indicators for the severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 214 patients enrolled, 161 were non-ICU patients and 53 were ICU patients. Lymphopenia was observed in nearly all of ICU patients (96.2%) and 84.5% of non-ICU patients on hospital admission. The absolute number of lymphocytes, CD3(+) T cells, CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, CD19(+) B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells were lower in ICU group (659.00  10(6)/L, 417.00  10(6)/L, 261.00  10(6)/L, 140.00  10(6)/L, 109.00  10(6)/L, 102.00  10(6)/L, respectively) than in non-ICU group (1063.00  10(9)/L, 717.00  10(6)/L, 432.00  10(6)/L, 271.00  10(6)/L, 133.00  10(6)/L, 143.00  10(6)/L, respectively). Interleukin (IL)-6 was significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (18.08 pg/mL vs. 3.13 pg/mL, P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio: 1.067 [1.034C1.101]), diabetes mellitus (odds ratio: 9.154 [2.710C30.926]), CD3(+) T cells (odds ratio: 0.996 [0.994C0.997]), and IL-6 (odds ratio: 1.006 [1.000C1.013]) were independent predictors for the development of severe disease. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of CD3(+) T cells and IL-6 was 0.806 (0.737C0.874) and 0.785 (0.705C0.864), respectively, and the cutoff values were 510.50  10(6)/L (sensitivity, 71.7%; specificity, 79.5%) and 6.58 pg/mL (77.4%, 74.5%), respectively. There were no statistical differences among all tested indicators of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines between severe group (n = 38) and critical group (n = 15) on hospital admission or ICU admission, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of lymphocyte subsets decreased and the level of IL-6 increased significantly in ICU COVID-19 patients compared with non-ICU COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the number of CD3(+) T cells and the level of IL-6 on hospital admission may serve as predictive factors for identifying patients with wild-type virus infection who will have severe disease.","output":"Characteristics of lymphocyte subsets and cytokine profiles of patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As we learn more about how peptide structure and activity are related, we anticipate that antimicrobial peptides will be engineered to have strong potency and distinct functions and that synthetic peptides will have new biomedical applications, such as treatments for emerging infectious diseases.

To investigate its alternative splicing pattern and relation to Bt resistance, we carried out single-molecule real-time (SMRT) transcript sequencing and Iso-seq analysis on resistant, eCry3.1Ab-selected and susceptible, unselected, western corn rootworm neonate midguts which fed on seedling maize with and without eCry3.1Ab for 12 and 24 hours. We present transcriptome-wide alternative splicing patterns of western corn rootworm midgut in response to feeding on eCry3.1Ab-expressing corn using a comprehensive approach that combines both RNA-seq and SMRT transcript sequencing techniques. The results showed genes in western corn rootworm are highly alternatively spliced, which happens on 67.73% of multi-exon genes. One of the alternative splicing events we identified was a novel peritrophic matrix protein with two alternative splicing isoforms. Analysis of differential exon usage between resistant and susceptible colonies showed that in eCry3.1Ab-resistant western corn rootworm, expression of one isoform was significantly higher than in the susceptible colony, while no significant differences between colonies were observed with the other isoform.

Confirmation of a virus is often conducted at centralized laboratories that are well-equipped with instruments for virus isolation, hemagglutinin inhibition, virus neutralization, ELISA, PCR and qPCR. These assays are known for their great accuracy and sensitivity, and hence are set as standard practices. Nevertheless, limitations arise due to the time, cost and on-site applicability. As the technology progresses, molecular diagnostics should be more accessible to isolated areas and even practicable for use by non-skilled personnel such as farmers and private breeders. One of the point-of-care diagnostic strategies to consider for such matters is loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). ABSTRACT: Over the years, development of molecular diagnostics has evolved significantly in the detection of pathogens within humans and their surroundings. Researchers have discovered new species and strains of viruses, while mitigating the viral infections that occur, owing to the accessibility of nucleic acid screening methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and reverse-transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR). While such molecular detection methods are widely utilized as the benchmark, the invention of isothermal amplifications has also emerged as a reliable tool to improvise on-field diagnosis without dependence on thermocyclers. Among the established isothermal amplification technologies are loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), recombinant polymerase amplification (RPA), strand displacement activity (SDA), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) and rolling circle amplification (RCA). This review highlights the past research on and future prospects of LAMP, its principles and applications as a promising point-of-care diagnostic method against avian viruses.","output":"Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) as a Promising Point-of-Care Diagnostic Strategy in Avian Virus Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Community Oncology Unit (COU) in Nazareth, Israel, provides complete medical treatments to patients who live in the rural area of the country.

However, few of these patients decompensate. There is a paucity of tools that predict airway compromise in patients with angioedema, and it is unclear if automatic triage to the ICU is warranted. We analyzed patients admitted to our tertiary center ICU with angioedema for airway watch to find a way to triage those at greatest risk of respiratory decompensation. Methods We performed a retrospective review of patients with angioedema admitted to our ICU between 2017 and 2020. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, nasopharyngolaryngoscopy (NPL) findings, need for intubation, and length of stay. Descriptive analysis and subsequent ANOVA or T-test statistical analysis was performed to determine the relationships between individual variables and outcomes. Categorical variables were compared using Pearson's Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test where applicable. Continuous variables were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test. Results Of 134 patients admitted to our ICU, 63 (47%) required intubation, primarily in the emergency department (92.1%). Of those who required intubation, 61.9% had abnormal NPL findings in contrast to 25.35% of patients who did not require intubation (p<0.0001). Normal NPL findings had a negative predictive value for requiring intubation of 86.5%. Abnormal NPL findings had a positive predictive value for requiring intubation of 68.4%. Conclusion While airway compromise is a serious complication of angioedema, there is scant evidence to support triage to the ICU for those not intubated immediately. The majority of patients with angioedema who required intubation had abnormal NPL findings, and the majority of those with normal NPL findings did not require intubation. This suggests that NPL findings in patients with angioedema can help with triage to the ICU.","output":"Nasopharyngolaryngoscopy as a Triage Tool for Airway Compromise in Angioedema: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, central venous access line teams were implemented at many hospitals throughout the world to provide access for critically ill patients. The objective of this study was to describe the structure, practice patterns, and outcomes of these vascular access teams during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, self-reported study of central venous access line teams in hospitals afflicted with the COVID-19 pandemic. To participate in the study, hospitals were required to meet one of the following criteria: development of a formal plan for a central venous access line team during the pandemic; implementation of a central venous access line team during the pandemic; placement of central venous access by a designated practice group during the pandemic as part of routine clinical practice; or management of an iatrogenic complication related to central venous access in a patient with COVID-19. RESULTS: Participants from 60 hospitals in 13 countries contributed data to the study. Central venous line teams were most commonly composed of vascular surgery and general surgery attending physicians and trainees. Twenty sites had 2657 lines placed by their central venous access line team or designated practice group. During that time, there were 11 (0.4%) iatrogenic complications associated with central venous access procedures performed by the line team or group at those 20 sites. Triple lumen catheters, Cordis (Santa Clara, Calif) catheters, and nontunneled hemodialysis catheters were the most common types of central venous lines placed by the teams. Eight (14%) sites reported experience in placing central venous lines in prone, ventilated patients with COVID-19. A dedicated line cart was used by 35 (59%) of the hospitals. Less than 50% (24 [41%]) of the participating sites reported managing thrombosed central lines in COVID-19 patients. Twenty-three of the sites managed 48 iatrogenic complications in patients with COVID-19 (including complications caused by providers outside of the line team or designated practice group). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a dedicated central venous access line team during a pandemic or other health care crisis is a way by which physicians trained in central venous access can contribute their expertise to a stressed health care system. A line team composed of physicians with vascular skill sets provides relief to resource-constrained intensive care unit, ward, and emergency medicine teams with a low rate of iatrogenic complications relative to historical reports.

Global efforts to develop novel therapeutics have intensified, but in late November 2020, few are approved. There is an urgent need for novel therapeutics to limit further spread of COVID-19. Passive immunity by infusing neutralising anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies provides a method to prevent infection in individuals at heightened risk such as frontline health care workers. Convalescent plasma (CP) collected from donors who have recovered from an infectious disease can be pooled and fractionated into hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (HIVIG), a concentrated formulation with enriched levels of pathogen-specific antibodies. HIVIG are established for therapeutic and prophylactic administration across many infectious diseases and possess many advantages over CP including consistent high titres of antiviral antibodies without ABO matching or risk of transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) or transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO), lower infusion volume, simpler storage, longer shelf life, and easier administration. Method: A parallel group, open-label, active control, phase 1/2 trial which allocates healthy adult healthcare workers never infected with SARS-CoV-2 to receive a single intravenous infusion of either CP or HIVIG. This clinical trial is the first to establish whether a HIVIG preparation concentrated with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is safe when administered to healthcare workers in the prevention of COVID-19, and to assess whether the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the HIVIG are pharmacokinetically equivalent to those in unmodified CP. Discussion: Trials to date suggest that allocation of limited CP may be optimised if used for prevention rather than treatment of COVID-19. This HIVIG (Covimmune TM , Aegros Ltd.) is manufactured by a novel plasma fractionation technology (HaemaFrac TM , Aegros Ltd.) which offers high purity and a greater protein yield from smaller batches of starting plasma than is possible with conventional fractionation techniques. If successful, this approach can be rapidly scaled up for implementation into clinical practice and contribute to the sustainability of healthcare systems during the current and future pandemics. The more prevention and treatment options available to address the COVID-19 pandemic, the stronger the position our society will hold.

Additionally, this reflection will shift the focus from the spring 2020 environment of SARS-CoV-2 to what EE teams and college administration can learn from those experiences. Moving forward, EE teams and administrators can be better equipped to proactively plan for future emergencies. DESCRIPTION: Using the What? So What? Now What? model of reflection, this manuscript will broadly describe the experiences of three EE administrators and their teams during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Proposed lessons learned as well as future planning strategies will be presented. ANALYSIS/INTERPRETATION: The world of education was unprepared for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and most sectors were left scrambling to adjust to new models very quickly with no planning or preparation. In the realm of pharmacy education, SARS-CoV-2 caused complete disruption for pharmacy students on rotations, clinical sites, preceptors, and EE teams. In reflecting on spring 2020, much can be gained and applied to future planning efforts so that institutions can be better prepared for future crises. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: While still in the pandemic, schools must plan for the coming year. EE teams can work together to prepare for emergencies, craft contingency plans, and build additional capacity into their teams and available rotation offerings.","output":"What does experiential education look like in a global pandemic?

We aimed to explore the clinical features of patients with COVID-19 and compared them with those of hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients caused by influenza virus during the same period.From Jan 1, to Mar 4, 2020, patients with COVID-19 or CAP caused by influenza virus who were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University were consecutively screened for enrollment.A total of 35 COVID-19 patients and 22 CAP patients caused by influenza virus were included in this study. Most of COVID-19 patients had characteristics of familial clustering (63%), however, in the other group, there was no similar finding. The percentages of patients with a high fever (the highest recorded temperature was &#8805;39.0C; 11% vs 45% [COVID-19 vs CAP groups, respectively]), dyspnea (9% vs 59%), leukocytosis (3% vs 32%), elevated C-reactive protein concentrations (>10a??mg/L, 48% vs 86%), elevated procalcitonin levels (>0.1a??ng/ml, 15% vs 73%), PaO2/FiO2 <200a??mm Hg (4% vs 22%), and infiltration on imaging (29% vs 68%) in the COVID-19 group were less than those same indices in the hospitalized CAP patients caused by influenza virus. Ground-glass opacity with reticular pattern (63%) and interlobular septal thickening (71%) in chest CT were commonly observed in the COVID-19 group.COVID-19 and CAP caused by influenza virus appear to share some similarities in clinical manifestaions but they definitely have major distinctions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2006 to December 2007, 168 consecutive patients (133 male, 35 female; mean age 66.7  10.1 years) with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A/B [146/22]) who underwent RFA for treatment for recurrent intrahepatic HCC 5 cm, and in up to three nodules (214 HCCs; mean diameter 20.8  7.5 mm; 38 multinodular forms), were included. Univariate and multivariate analyses for potential clinical, tumor-related, and radiologic factors affecting overall and recurrence-free patient survival were performed using the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS Major complications occurred in 5 patients (5 of 168, 3.0 %), although there were no procedure-related deaths. Complete ablation was achieved in 161 patients (161 of 168, 95.8 %). After a mean follow-up period of 4  21 months, local tumor progression, distant intrahepatic recurrence, and extrahepatic metastasis occurred in 22, 132, and 41 patients, respectively. Overall 5-year survival and recurrence-free survival were 48.0 and 11.9 %, respectively. Significant predicting factors for overall patient survival were Child-Pugh class B (relative risk [RR] = 4.52, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.97-10.34; P < 0.001), serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level (RR = 1.01, 95 % CI 1.01-1.01; P < 0.001), number of HCC nodules (RR = 1.70, 95 % CI 1.04-2.76; P = 0.033), tumor size (RR = 1.40, 95 % CI 1.07-1.83; P = 0.014), and presence of portosystemic collaterals (RR = 1.78, 95 % CI 1.09-2.92; P = 0.022). CONCLUSION RFA is a safe and effective treatment modality for recurrent intrahepatic HCC and has a 5-year survival rate of 48.0 %. Serum AFP level, Child-Pugh class, tumor number and size, and presence of portosystemic collaterals significantly affect overall patient survival.","output":"Radiofrequency ablation for intrahepatic recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma: long-term results and prognostic factors in 168 patients with cirrhosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe patterns of anticoagulation prescription and persistence for those aged 65 years with atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: Descriptive cohort study using electronic general practice records of patients in England, who attended an influenza vaccination aged 65 years and were diagnosed with AF between 2008 and 2018. Patients were stratified by 10-year age group and year of diagnosis. Proportion anticoagulated, type of anticoagulation (direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) or warfarin) initiated at diagnosis and persistence with anticoagulation over time are reported. RESULTS: 42 290 patients (49% female), aged 65C74 (n=11 722), 75C84 (n=19 055) and 85+ (n=11 513) years at AF diagnosis are included. Prescription of anticoagulation at diagnosis increased over the time period from 55% to 86% in people aged 65C74 years, from 54% to 86% in people aged 75C84 years and from 27% to 75% in people aged 85 years and over. By 2018, 92% of patients with newly diagnosed AF were started on a DOAC. Survivor function for 5-year persistence in patients prescribed DOAC was 0.80 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.82) and for warfarin 0.71 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.72). Survivor function for any anticoagulation at 5 years was 0.79 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.81), 0.73 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.75) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.64) for people aged 65C74, 75C84 and 85+ years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of anticoagulation in AF in those aged 65 years have increased from 2008 to 2018, over which time period there has been a shift from initiating anticoagulation with warfarin to DOAC. Persistence with anticoagulation is higher in people on DOACs than on warfarin and in people aged <85 years.","output":"Anticoagulation trends in adults aged 65 years and over with atrial fibrillation: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural selection operating on the genomes of viral pathogens in different host species strongly contributes to adaptation facilitating host colonization. Here, we analyse, quantify and compare viral adaptation in genomic sequence data derived from seven zoonotic events in the Coronaviridae family among primary, intermediate and human hosts. Rates of nonsynonymous (d (N)) and synonymous (d (S)) changes on specific amino acid positions were quantified for each open reading frame (ORF). Purifying selection accounted for 77% of all sites under selection. Diversifying selection was most frequently observed in viruses infecting the primary hosts of each virus and predominantly occurred in the orf1ab genomic region. Within all four intermediate hosts, diversifying selection on the spike gene was observed either solitarily or in combination with orf1ab and other genes. Consistent with previous evidence, pervasive diversifying selection on coronavirus spike genes corroborates the role this protein plays in host cellular entry, adaptation to new hosts and evasion of host cellular immune responses. Structural modelling of spike proteins identified a significantly higher proportion of sites for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 under positive selection in close proximity to sites of glycosylation relative to the other coronaviruses. Among human coronaviruses, there was a significant inverse correlation between the number of sites under positive selection and the estimated years since the virus was introduced into the human population. Abundant diversifying selection observed in SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 suggests the virus remains in the adaptive phase of the host switch, typical of recent host switches. A mechanistic understanding of where, when and how genomic adaptation occurs in coronaviruses following a host shift is crucial for vaccine design, public health responses and predicting future pandemics.","output":"Variable routes to genomic and host adaptation among coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To develop a deep learning-based method to assist radiologists to fast and accurately identify patients with COVID-19 by CT images.

Over the last decade, considerable research effort has been put into the development of adaptive, under-actuated, soft robots that facilitate robust interactions with dynamic environments. In this paper, we present soft, retractable, pneumatically actuated, telescopic actuators that facilitate the efficient execution of stable grasps involving a plethora of everyday life objects. The efficiency of the proposed actuators is validated by employing them in two different soft and hybrid robotic grippers. The hybrid gripper uses three rigid fingers to accomplish the execution of all the tasks required by a traditional robotic gripper, while three inflatable, telescopic fingers provide soft interaction with objects. This synergistic combination of soft and rigid structures allows the gripper to cage/trap and firmly hold heavy and irregular objects. The second, simplistic and highly affordable robotic gripper employs just the telescopic actuators, exhibiting an adaptive behavior during the execution of stable grasps of fragile and delicate objects. The experiments demonstrate that both grippers can successfully and stably grasp a wide range of objects, being able to exert significantly high contact forces.","output":"Employing Pneumatic, Telescopic Actuators for the Development of Soft and Hybrid Robotic Grippers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdown among healthy individuals in India Methods: A self-assessed cross-sectional web-based study was conducted between 3rd April and 4th May 2020 Centre for Epidemiological Study for Depression questionnaire was administered for assessing the depressive symptoms among general public during the COVID-19 lockdown Using the google forms the questionnaire was circulated among the public through social media Descriptive analysis was performed to represent the study characteristics, Chi-square test for assessing the associations of depressive symptoms among the study variables, and the logistic regression analysis for identifying the factors influencing the depressive symptoms Results: A total of 588 participants with a mean (SD) age of 27 59 (8 72) years were responded to the questionnaire The prevalence depressive symptoms were higher among males (54%) compared to females (36%) It was identified that the participants with educational background of pre-university education/diploma (58 22%) and middle school (71 42%), and occupation as semiskilled (60%) and unskilled workers (70%), social history of consumption alcohol (56 52%) and smoking (75%), and belong to joint family (53 10%) were the predictors for depressive symptoms Subgroup analysis identified that these factors influence depressive symptoms especially among male population Conclusions: It is an alarming situation that the depressive symptoms found in approximately 45% of healthy individuals during the COVID-19 lockdown Educational interventions by the government and non-government organizations are very much required to combat the progression of depressive symptoms into disorder","output":"PMH29 To Assess the Psychological IMPACT of COVID-19 Lockdown Among Healthy Individuals in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cyberchondria (CYB) is characterized by excessive online searching for medical information and is associated with increasing levels of distress, anxiety and interference with daily activities.

AIM: To examine the feasibility of a sexual health MBI, Mindful After Cancer, which was adapted to meet the needs of breast and gynecologic cancer survivors in a community setting and for delivery via videoconference. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was used to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of the 8-week virtual MBI. Weekly sessions were 1.5-2 hours in duration and included guided meditations and group discussion about sexuality after cancer and mindfulness in daily life. Home practice activities related to both mindfulness practice and sexual health. Participants completed online surveys at baseline and 1-month post-intervention. A purposive sample of 10 participants were invited to complete a follow-up interview 2-3 months post-intervention. OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes included both qualitative and quantitative assessments of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the Mindful After Cancer intervention for sexual health in cancer survivorship. RESULTS: Twenty-two women completed the intervention (Mean age 53.2 years, SD = 9.4, Range= 39-73), with time since diagnosis ranging from 1 to 27 years (Mean 6.0 years, SD = 5.9). Participants completed 6.8 sessions on average (Range = 2 - 8) and 77% reported that the time commitment was manageable. Both qualitative and quantitative findings support the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the intervention. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Many cancer survivors experience sexual dysfunction and related distress after diagnosis and well after treatment ends, yet there are few interventions available. Improved access to effective interventions can improve the delivery of survivorship care and patient outcomes. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: The sample size is small for this pilot study, and a control group was not included. The intervention was offered over two time periods, one prior to COVID-19 pandemic and one during the pandemic, resulting in both limitations associated with potential differences between the experiences of participants and the opportunity to learn more about the feasibility of the intervention during times of crisis.

Transfusions early during disease course was found to be beneficial. Lessons from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic could inform early responses to future pandemics and may continue to be relevant in lower resource settings. We sought to identify factors correlating to high antibody titers in convalescent plasma donors and understand the magnitude and pharmacokinetic time course of both transfused antibody titers and the endogenous antibody titers in transfused recipients. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected up to 174 days after convalescence from 93 CCP donors with mild disease, and from 16 COVID-19 patients before and after transfusion. Using ELISA, anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD, S1, and N-protein antibodies, as well as capacity of antibodies to block ACE2 from binding to RBD was measured in an in vitro assay. As an estimate for viral load, viral RNA and N-protein plasma levels were assessed in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and RBD-ACE2 blocking capacity were highest within the first 60 days after symptom resolution and markedly decreased after 120 days. Highest antibody titers were found in CCP donors that experienced fever. Effect of transfused CCP was detectable in COVID-19 patients who received high-titer CCP and had not seroconverted at the time of transfusion. Decrease in viral RNA was seen in two of these patients. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high titer CCP should be collected within 60 days after recovery from donors with past fever. The much lower titers conferred by transfused antibodies compared to endogenous production in the patient underscore the importance of providing CCP prior to endogenous seroconversion.","output":"Use of Outpatient-Derived COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma in COVID-19 Patients Before Seroconversion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aberrant 5-methylcytidine (m5C) modification plays an essential role in the progression of different cancers. More and more researchers are focusing on developing a lncRNA-based risk model to assess the clinical prognosis of cancer patients. However, the impact of m5C-related lncRNAs on the prognosis of patients with uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), as well as the immune microenvironment of UCEC, remains unclear. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the predictive value of m5C-associated lncRNAs in UCEC and their association with the tumor immune microenvironment, according to the information extracted from the TCGA-UCEC dataset. We identified a total of 32 m5C-associated lncRNAs that were significantly correlated with the prognosis of UCEC patients. Two molecular subtypes were determined by consensus clustering analysis of these 32 m5C-associated prognostic lncRNAs. Further data showed that cluster 1 was associated with poor clinical prognosis, advanced tumor grade, higher PD-L1 expression levels, higher ESTIMATEScore, and higher immuneScore, as well as the immune cell infiltration. Then, 17 m5C-associated lncRNAs with prognostic values were obtained using LASSO regression analysis. And a risk model was constructed based on these 17 lncRNAs. It was revealed that the risk model could be used as an independent factor for UCEC prognosis. In addition, patients with UCEC in the high-risk group had higher tumor grades and immune scores. The risk model based on m5C-related lncRNAs was also closely associated with infiltrating immune cells. In conclusion, our study elucidated the crucial roles of the identified m5C-related lncRNAs in the UCEC patients' prognoses, as well as in the immune microenvironment in UCEC. The results suggest that the components of risk models based on the m5C-related lncRNAs may serve as important mediators of the immune microenvironment in UCEC.","output":"Immune Infiltrates of m5C RNA Methylation-Related LncRNAs in Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper argues in support of the WHOs proposal to forego COVID-19 booster shots until 10% of people in every country are fully vaccinated.

Materials and methods: We examined 49 patients, which were hospitalized for inpatient treatment of COVID-19 infection from May to June 2020. Study group included 24 men (49%) and 25 women (51%), median age 58 years [48;70], BMI 26.4 kg/m2 [24.3;30.5]. All patients were diagnosed with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 with median percent of lung involvement equal to 29% [14;37], 22 patients (45%) required oxygen support upon admission. Median SpO2 was equal to 95% (92;97), median NEWS score was equal to 3 [2;6]. Participants were tested for vitamin D metabolites (25(OH)D3, 1,25(OH)2D3, 3-epi-25(OH)D3, 24,25(OH)2D3 and D3) by UPLC-MS/MS, free 25(OH)D and vitamin D-binding protein by ELISA, as well as PTH by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay and routine biochemical parameters of blood serum (calcium, phosphorus, albumin) at the time of admission. Results: patients had in general very low 25()D3 levels - median 10.9 ng/mL [6.9;15.6], corresponding to a pronounced vitamin D deficiency in half of the patients. Levels of 24,25(OH)2D3 were also low C 0.5 ng/mL [0.2;0.9], and resulting vitamin D metabolite ratios (25(OH)D3/24,25(OH)2D3) were high-normal or elevated in most patients C 24.1 [19.0;39.2], indicating decreased activity of 24-hydroxylase. Levels of 1,25(OH)2D3, on the contrary, were high-normal or elevated - 57 pg/mL [46;79], which, in accordance with 25(OH)D3/1,25(OH)2D3 ratio (219 [134;266]) suggests an increase in 1-hydroxylase activity. Median level of 3-epi-25(OH)D3 was 0.7 ng/mL [0.4;1.0] and D3 metabolite was detectable only in 6 patients. Median DBP level was 432 mg/L [382;498], median free 25(OH)D was 5.6 pg/mL [3.3;6.7], median calculated free 25(OH)D was 2.0 pg/mL [1.4;3.3]. Most patients had albumin-adjusted serum calcium level in the lower half of reference range (median 2.24 mmol/L [2.14;2.34]). Seven patients had secondary hyperparathyroidism and one patient had primary hyperparathyroidism, the rest of the patients had PTH levels within the normal range.25(OH)D3 levels showed significant negative correlation with percent of lung involvement (r = -0.36, p&amp;lt;0.05) and positive correlation with SpO2 (r = 0.4, p&amp;lt;0.05). 1,25(OH)2D3 levels correlated positively with 25(OH)D3 levels (r = 0.38, p&amp;lt;0.05) and did not correlate significantly with PTH levels (p&amp;gt;0.05). Conclusion: Our data suggests that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection have significant impairment of vitamin D metabolism, in particular, an increase in 1-hydroxylase activity, which cannot be fully explained by pre-existing conditions such as vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Inspired by said structure and the characteristics of associated materials, a bionic soft sucker with stiffness gradient and acetabular roof structure was proposed, made of silicone with varying hardness including structures such as acetabular roof and circle muscles. The automatic tensile force measurement system was used to experimentally analyze the adsorption performance of the suckers to the soft curved contact surface. Both dry and wet conditions were tested, along with practical tests on organisms. The bionic sucker adsorption force was increased by 25.1%and 34.6% on the cylindrical surface, and 45.2% and 7.3% on the spherical surface for dry and wet conditions, respectively. During the experiment, the bionic suckers did not cause notable suction damage to the contact surfaces. Thus, this type of bionic sucker shows good application prospects in the field of surgery.","output":"Octopus-inspired sucker to absorb soft tissues: Stiffness gradient and acetabular protuberance improve the adsorption effect."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) often see their respiratory, physical, and psychological functions impaired to varying degrees, especially for the elderly patients. Timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention for such patients may improve their prognoses. However, its relative effectiveness has not been proved. Therefore, this study is purposed to determine the effect of respiratory rehabilitation on elderly patients with COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to (1) describe how food-insecure emerging adults are adapting their eating and child-feeding behaviors during COVID-19 and (2) identify barriers and opportunities to improve local food access and access to food assistance. DESIGN The COVID-19 Eating and Activity Over Time study collected survey data from emerging adults during April to October 2020 and completed interviews with a diverse subset of food-insecure respondents. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING A total of 720 emerging adults (mean age: 24.7  2.0 years; 62% female; 90% living in Minnesota) completed an online survey, and a predominately female subsample (n = 33) completed an interview by telephone or videoconference. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Survey measures included the short-form of the US Household Food Security Survey Module and 2 items to assess food insufficiency. Interviews assessed eating and feeding behaviors along with barriers to healthy food access. ANALYSES PERFORMED Descriptive statistics and a hybrid deductive and inductive content analysis. RESULTS Nearly one-third of survey respondents had experienced food insecurity in the past year. Interviews with food-insecure participants identified 6 themes with regard to changes in eating and feeding behavior (eg, more processed food, sporadic eating), 5 themes regarding local food access barriers (eg, limited enforcement of COVID-19 safety practices, experiencing discrimination), and 4 themes regarding barriers to accessing food assistance (eg, lack of eligibility, difficulty in locating pantries). Identified recommendations include (1) expanding the distribution of information about food pantries and meal distribution sites, and (2) increasing fresh fruit and vegetable offerings at these sites. CONCLUSIONS Interventions of specific relevance to COVID-19 (eg, stronger implementation of safety practices) and expanded food assistance services are needed to improve the accessibility of healthy food for emerging adults.","output":"Barriers to Accessing Healthy Food and Food Assistance During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Racial Justice Uprisings: A Mixed-Methods Investigation of Emerging Adults' Experiences."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates a new model on coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) with three compartments including susceptible, infected, and recovered class under Mittag-Leffler type derivative The mentioned derivative has been introduced by Atangana, Baleanu, and Caputo abbreviated as ( ABC ) Upon utilizing fixed point theory, we first prove the existence of at least one solution for the considered model and its uniqueness Also, some results about stability of Ulam-Hyers type are also established By applying a numerical technique called fractional Adams-Bashforth (AB) method, we develop a scheme for the approximate solutions to the considered model Using some real available data, we perform the concerned numerical simulation corresponding to different values of fractional order","output":"On modeling of coronavirus-19 disease under Mittag-Leffler power law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The situation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is rapidly evolving, and medical researchers around the globe are dedicated to finding cures for the disease.

CASE REPORT A 74-year-old woman with no recent sick contacts or travel history presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Her vital signs were normal except for oxygen saturation of 87% and bilateral rhonchi on lung auscultation. Chest radiography revealed air space opacity in the right upper lobe, suspicious for pneumonia. A nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 came back positive while the patient was in the airborne-isolation unit. Laboratory data showed lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and interleukin-6. The patient was initially started on oral hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. On day 6, she developed ARDS and septic shock, for which mechanical ventilation and pressor support were started, along with infusion of high-dose intravenous vitamin C. The patient improved clinically and was able to be taken off mechanical ventilation within 5 days.

We aimed to use HACOR (combination of heart rate, acidosis, consciousness, oxygenation and respiratory rate) score to comprehensively assess the efficacy of NIV in ARDS patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ? 150 mmHg. METHODS: Secondary analysis was performed using the data collected from two databases. We screened the ARDS patients who used NIV as a first-line therapy. Patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ? 150 mmHg were enrolled. NIV failure was defined as requirement of intubation. RESULTS: A total of 224 moderate to severe ARDS patients who used NIV as a first-line therapy were enrolled. Of them, 125 patients (56%) experienced NIV failure and received intubation. Among the intubated patients, the survivor had shorter time from initiation of NIV to intubation than nonsurvivors (median 10 vs 22 h, p < 0.01). The median differences of HACOR score before and 1C2 h of NIV were 1 point (interquartile range: 0C3). We defined the patients with HACOR >1 as responders (n = 102) and the rest to non-responders (n = 122). Compared to non-responders, the responders had higher HACOR score before NIV. However, the HACOR score was lower in the responders than non-responders after 1C2 h, 12 h, and 24 h of NIV. The responders also had lower NIV failure rate (36% vs 72%, p < 0.01) and lower 28-day mortality (32% vs 47%, p = 0.04) than non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: NIV failure was high among patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Delayed intubation is associated with increased mortality.

The portable ventilator ensures adequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide clearance while avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Oxygen is delivered through the compression of a bag valve (Ambu bag) using a moving strap. Carbon dioxide is cleared through the control of a pinch valve actuated by a low-torque servomotor. The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is controlled by an adjustable mechanical valve of the system. An Arduino Mega microcontroller board is used in this prototype to control the respiratory variables. All mechanical components as well as sensors, actuators, and control hardware are of common use in robotics and are very inexpensive. The total cost of the prototype built in this work is about $425 U.S. dollars. The design is meant to be replicated and utilized in emergency conditions that involve an overwhelming number of cases, such as COVID-19 treatment, in places with no access to commercial mechanical ventilation (MV) technologies. In order to account for variations in the prototype as built, the software developed for this portable MV applies an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) strategy.

Only peptide M01 (aa 1C20) and to a lesser extent peptide M21 (aa 201C222) showed specific reactivity as compared to historical control plasma samples. Peptide M01 was recognized by IgM- (71.9%) and IgG-specific antibodies (43.8%) during the acute phase as early as day 8 PIO. In a longitudinal analysis, a higher reactivity was observed for the IgM response directed to peptide M01 following day 20 PIO as compared to earlier time points of the acute phase.

Results for Germany illustrate that estimated reproduction numbers based on death counts are often similar to classical estimates based on confirmed cases.

Patient encounters and shifts per pediatric intern in the inpatient and emergency department settings were evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic, from March to June 2020, as compared with these 3 months in 2019. Patient encounters by diagnosis were also evaluated. RESULTS: The median number of patient encounters per intern per 2-week block declined on the pediatric hospital medicine service (37.5 vs 27.0; P < .001) and intensive care step-down unit (29.0 vs 18.8; P = .004) during the pandemic. No significant difference in emergency department encounters was observed (63.0 vs 40.5; P = .06). The median number of shifts worked per intern per 2-week block also decreased on the pediatric hospital medicine service (10.5 vs 9.5, P < .001). Across all settings, there were more encounters for screening for infectious disease and fewer encounters for respiratory illnesses. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric interns at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic were exposed to fewer patients and had reduced clinical schedules. Careful consideration is needed to track and supplement missed clinical experiences during the pandemic.","output":"Pediatric Intern Clinical Exposure During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past eight years, the continuous call for more oral health services research in Germany has been (at least partially) answered. Today, relevant oral and dental health services research activities can be found at 12 medical faculties in Germany and nine large-scale projects are funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) or the Innovation Fund of the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA). However, the demand for high-level research in this field exceeds the current capacities of university and non-university dentistry; structured and methodically competent research networks that are cross-linked within the dental and public health services are required. These would allow research to assure sustainable and demand-oriented dental services, scientifically supporting the demographically, economically, and socially driven major changes to be expected in the coming years. The article describes the current status of dental and oral health services research in Germany and addresses major challenges: methodological competence, data accessibility and usage, and the prospects for this field of research. Therefore, it takes stock of existing research activities and infrastructure (including educational and funding opportunities). Knowledge obtained from dental and oral health services research in Germany can be pioneering for other countries, while researchers in Germany may be able to adopt and adapt servicing strategies from other countries and health systems for Germany. To achieve these aims, dental and oral health services researchers should professionalize and network.

Reports suggest a beneficial effect of the use of heparin/low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on mortality in COVID-19. In part, this beneficial effect could be explained by the anticoagulant properties of heparin/LMWH. Here, we summarise potential beneficial, non-anticoagulant mechanisms underlying treatment of COVID-19 patients with heparin/LMWH, which include: (i) Inhibition of heparanase activity, responsible for endothelial leakage; (ii) Neutralisation of chemokines, and cytokines; (iii) Interference with leukocyte trafficking; (iv) Reducing viral cellular entry, and (v) Neutralisation of extracellular cytotoxic histones. Considering the multiple inflammatory and pathogenic mechanisms targeted by heparin/LMWH, it is warranted to conduct clinical studies that evaluate therapeutic doses of heparin/LMWH in COVID-19 patients. In addition, identification of specific heparin-derived sequences that are functional in targeting non-anticoagulant mechanisms may have even higher therapeutic potential for COVID-19 patients, and patients suffering from other inflammatory diseases.","output":"Beneficial non-anticoagulant mechanisms underlying heparin treatment of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS\\\\CoV is a newly identified coronavirus (CoV) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

Notably, axillary and interpectoral lymphadenopathies ipsilateral to the vaccine inoculation were observed, but could be wrongly interpreted, complicating cancer patients management. Our study aimed to assess the hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy detection rate on PET/CT and investigated factors that might help in lymphadenopathy interpretation. A significantly higher vaccine-related lymphadenopathy detection rate resulted in the vaccinated population, as well as in younger and vaccinated patients within 20 days before PET. SUVmax significantly changed during different time intervals, with the lowest values beyond 20 days. To minimize misdiagnosis, a detailed vaccination anamnesis must be recorded and should take into account the appropriate PET schedule, preferable to be performed 20 days after vaccine. Since this health emergency situation will probably continue in the near future, with the need for a strong vaccination campaign for the whole population, it is essential to keep in mind these considerations in order to better manage and take care of oncologic patients. ABSTRACT: The widespread COVID-19 vaccination led to unexpected PET findings. Notably, axillary and interpectoral lymphadenopathies ipsilateral to the vaccine inoculation were observed. We aimed to assess the hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy (HLN) detection rate on PET/CT. Secondly, we investigated factors that might help in HLN differential diagnosis. A retrospective analysis on 1196 consecutive patients referred for a PET/CT was performed. All patients were asked about the date, type and site of vaccine injections. HLNs were recorded and categorized according to risk classes and SUVmax grades. A statistical analysis was performed to assess the correlation between HLN detection and different clinical/vaccine data. HLN detection rate was 15% and 27% in the No Vac- and vac-groups (p < 0.001), respectively. In the Vac-group, age (p < 0.001) and time interval from vaccine-to-PET (p = 0.010) were inversely correlated with HLN detection. Furthermore, SUVmax significantly changed during time intervals, with lower values beyond 20 days (p < 0.001). In the era of mass COVID-19 vaccination, a higher axillary and interpectoral lymphadenopathies detection ipsilateral to vaccine injection was observed. These PET findings can be wrongly interpreted, complicating cancer patients management. To minimize these pitfalls, a detailed vaccination anamnesis must be recorded and should take into account the appropriate PET schedule.","output":"The Day after Mass COVID-19 Vaccination: Higher Hypermetabolic Lymphadenopathy Detection on PET/CT and Impact on Oncologic Patients Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive cancer that has the highest mortality rate out of all breast cancer subtypes. Conventional clinical treatments targeting ER, PR, and HER2 receptors have been unsuccessful in the treatment of TNBC, which has led to various research efforts in developing new strategies to treat TNBC. Targeted molecular therapy of TNBC utilizes knowledge of key molecular signatures of TNBC that can be effectively modulated to produce a positive therapeutic response. Correspondingly, RNA-based therapeutics represent a novel tool in oncology with their ability to alter intrinsic cancer pathways that contribute to poor patient prognosis. Current RNA-based therapeutics exist as two major areas of investigationRNA interference (RNAi) and RNA nanotherapy, where RNAi utilizes principles of gene silencing, and RNA nanotherapy utilizes RNA-derived nanoparticles to deliver chemotherapeutics to target cells. RNAi can be further classified as therapeutics utilizing either small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA). As the broader field of gene therapy has advanced significantly in recent years, so too have efforts in the development of effective RNA-based therapeutic strategies for treating aggressive cancers, including TNBC. This review will summarize key advances in targeted molecular therapy of TNBC, describing current trends in treatment using RNAi, combination therapies, and recent efforts in RNA immunotherapy, utilizing messenger RNA (mRNA) in the development of cancer vaccines.","output":"RNA-Based Therapeutics: Current Developments in Targeted Molecular Therapy of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper addresses map-based information systems in the public health sector as an important application area in cartography.

We estimated the economic costs of universal access to basic hand hygiene services in household settings in 46 LDCs. METHODS: Our model combines quantities of households with no HWF and prices of promotion campaigns, HWFs, soap and water. For quantities, we used estimates from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme. For prices, we collated data from recent impact evaluations and electronic searches. Accounting for inflation and purchasing power, we calculated costs over 2021C2030, and estimated total cost probabilistically using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: An estimated US$12.2CUS$15.3 billion over 10 years is needed for universal hand hygiene in household settings in 46 LDCs. The average annual cost of hand hygiene promotion is US$334 million (24% of annual total), with a further US$233 million for top-up promotion (17%). Together, these promotion costs represent US$0.47 annually per head of LDC population. The annual cost of HWFs, a purpose-built drum with tap and stand, is US$174 million (13%). The annual cost of soap is US$497 million (36%) and water US$127 million (9%). CONCLUSION: The annual cost of behavioural change promotion to those with no HWF represents 4.7% of median government health expenditure in LDCs, and 1% of their annual aid receipts. These costs could be covered by mobilising resources from across government and partners, and could be reduced by harnessing economies of scale and integrating hand hygiene with other behavioural change campaigns where appropriate. Innovation is required to make soap more affordable and available for the poorest households.","output":"Costs of hand hygiene for all in household settings: estimating the price tag for the 46 least developed countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (CoV) is a virus infectious disease with a considerable spectrum of clinical presentations. Symptoms ranged from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia that may lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and several clinical complications. Neurologic symptoms related to CoV have been described recently in the literature. The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the central nervous system (CNS) is still not clear. This review aimed to reveal the current knowledge regarding CNS manifestation in SARS-CoV-2. A systematic literature review was carried out to identify the particularities of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with CNS involvement, using the PubMed database between January 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. Conference papers, reviews, published letters, editorials, studies in pregnant women and children, and studies only reporting on a specific factor were excluded. An initial search included as many as 83 articles. Out of the 83 screened articles, 32 were selected for full-text review. Sixteen studies were excluded because they did not analyze nervous system involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, 16 papers were included in this review. There were three retrospective studies and 13 case reports/series of cases. Data from the current literature reveal that patients who suffer from a severe illness have more CNS involvement, neurological symptoms (i.e., dizziness, headache) and an association with strokes.

Pathogenic yield varies by clinician and/or patient characteristics. Our objectives were to determine the pathogenic yield of genetic testing, the variability in rate of pathogenic results based on subject characteristics, and the percentage of pathogenic findings resulting in further medical recommendations in toddlers with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition diagnosis of ASD. METHODS We conducted a retrospective chart review of 500 toddlers, 18 to 36 months, diagnosed with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ASD (mean age: 25.8 months, 79% male). Subject demographics, medical and neuropsychological characteristics, and genetic test results were abstracted. Genetic results were divided into negative or normal, variants of unknown significance, and pathogenic. Subject characteristics were compared across results. Manual chart review determined if further recommendations were made after pathogenic results. RESULTS Over half of subjects (59.8%, n = 299) completed genetic testing, and of those, 36 (12.0%) had pathogenic findings. There were no significant differences in Bayley Scales of Infant Development cognitive (P = .112), language (P = .898), or motor scores (P = .488) among children with negative or normal findings versus a variant of unknown significance versus pathogenic findings. Medical recommendations in response to the genetic finding were made for 72.2% of those with pathogenic results. CONCLUSIONS Our findings reinforce the importance of genetic testing for toddlers diagnosed with ASD given the 12% yield and lack of phenotypic differences between subjects with and without pathogenic findings.

The present convergent parallel design mixed-methods study explored the early effects of COVID-19 on African American/Black or Latino (AABL) long-term survivors of HIV in a pandemic epicenter, New York City. A total of 96 AABL PLWH were recruited from a larger study of PLWH with non-suppressed HIV viral load. They engaged in structured assessments focused on knowledge, testing, trust in information sources, and potential emotional, social, and behavioral impacts. Twenty-six of these participants were randomly selected for in-depth semi-structured interviews. Participants were mostly men (64%), African American/Black (75%), and had lived with HIV for 17 years, on average (SD=9 years). Quantitative results revealed high levels of concern about and the adoption of recommended COVID-19 prevention recommendations. HIV care visits were commonly canceled but, overall, engagement in HIV care and antiretroviral therapy use were not seriously disrupted. Trust in local sources of information was higher than trust in various federal sources. Qualitative findings complemented and enriched quantitative results and provided a multifaceted description of both risk factors (e.g., phones/internet access were inadequate for some forms of telehealth) and resilience (e.g., hustling for food supplies).

It remains unclear whether models incorporating trends of digital searches lead to better predictions. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between Google Trends searches of symptoms associated with COVID-19 and confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. To develop predictive models to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic based on the combination of Google Trends searches of symptoms and conventional COVID-19 metrics. METHODS: An open-access web application was developed to evaluate Google Trends and traditional COVID-19 metrics via an interactive framework based on principal components analysis (PCA) and time series modeling. The app facilitates the analysis of symptom search behavior associated with COVID-19 disease in 188 countries. In this study, we selected data of eight countries as case studies to represent all continents. PCA was used to perform data dimensionality reduction, and three different time series models (Error Trend Seasonality, Autoregressive integrated moving average, and feed-forward neural network autoregression) were used to predict COVID-19 metrics in the upcoming 14 days. The models were compared in terms of prediction ability using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the first principal component (PC1). The predictive abilities of models generated with both Google Trends data and conventional COVID-19 metrics were compared with those fitted with conventional COVID-19 metrics only. RESULTS: The degree of correlation and the best time-lag varied as a function of the selected country and topic searched; in general, the optimal time lag was within 15 days. Overall, predictions of PC1 based on both searched termed and COVID-19 traditional metrics performed better than those not including Google searches (median [IQR]: 1.56 [0.90-2.49] vs. 1.87 [1.09-2.95], respectively), but the improvement in prediction varied as a function of the selected country and timeframe. The best model varied as a function of country, time range, and period of time selected. Models based on a 7-day moving average led to considerably smaller RMSE values as opposed to those calculated with raw data (median [IQR]: 0.90 [0.50-1.53] vs. 2.27 [1.62-3.74], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of digital online searches in statistical models may improve the nowcasting and forecasting of the COVID-19 epidemic and could be used as one of the surveillance systems of COVID-19 disease.

We estimated random effects logistic regression models to test the following three hypotheses using the monthly Current Population Survey micro-data. One, the transportation industry experienced a greater incidence of unemployment than other industries. Two, there is heterogeneity in employment impacts within the transportation sector. Three, specific sectors within the transportation industry experienced more employment impacts than other essential industries, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Phase 1a vaccination guidelines. Model results highlight that workers in the transportation sector were 20.6% more likely to be unemployed because of the pandemic than workers in non-transportation industries. Model results also indicate large intra-sector heterogeneities in employment impacts within the transportation sector. Taxi and limousine drivers were 28 times more likely to be unemployed compared to essential workers. Scenic and sightseeing transportation workers were 23.8 times more likely to be unemployed compared to essential workers. On the other end of the spectrum, however, postal workers and pipeline workers were 84% and 67% less likely to be unemployed compared to essential workers, respectively.

Comparability is key both for regular research and to allow international comparison in response to pandemics. Here, we evaluate the appropriateness of the most common genomic tools used to depict population structure in a standardized and comparable manner. The end goal is to reduce the effects of confounding and learn from genuine variation in genetic effects on phenotypes across populations, which will improve the value of biobanks (locally and internationally), increase the accuracy of association analyses and inform developmental efforts.

The purpose of this study was to estimate national hospital reimbursement and net income losses due to elective orthopaedic surgery cancellation during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) and the Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample (NASS) were used to identify all elective orthopaedic and musculoskeletal (MSK) surgery performed in the inpatient setting and in hospital owned outpatient surgery departments throughout the USA. Total cost, reimbursement, and net income were estimated for all elective orthopaedic surgery and were compared with elective operations from other specialties. RESULTS: Elective MSK surgery accounted for $65.6C$71.1 billion in reimbursement and $15.6C$21.1 billion in net income per year to the US hospital system, equivalent to $5.5C$5.9 billion in reimbursement and $1.3C$1.8 billion in net income per month. When compared with elective surgery from all other specialties, elective MSK surgery accounted for 39% of hospital reimbursement and 35% of hospital net income. Compared with all hospital encounters for all specialties, elective MSK surgery accounted for 13% of reimbursement and 23% of net income. Estimated hospital losses from cancellation of elective MSK surgery during 8 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic were $10.9C$11.9 billion in reimbursement and $2.6C3.5 billion in net income. CONCLUSION: Cancellation of elective MSK surgery for 8 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic has substantial economic implications on the US hospital system.","output":"Economic implications of decreased elective orthopaedic and musculoskeletal surgery volume during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug designing and development is an important area of research for pharmaceutical companies and chemical scientists. However, low efficacy, off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost impose a hurdle and challenges that impact drug design and discovery. Further, complex and big data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials also impose an obstacle in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology play a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structureCactivity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Evidence from the past strengthens the implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements provide an excellent opportunity for rational drug design and discovery process, which will eventually impact mankind. The primary concern associated with drug design and development is time consumption and production cost. Further, inefficiency, inaccurate target delivery, and inappropriate dosage are other hurdles that inhibit the process of drug delivery and development. With advancements in technology, computer-aided drug design integrating artificial intelligence algorithms can eliminate the challenges and hurdles of traditional drug design and development. Artificial intelligence is referred to as superset comprising machine learning, whereas machine learning comprises supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Further, deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has been extensively implemented in drug design and development. The artificial neural network, deep neural network, support vector machines, classification and regression, generative adversarial networks, symbolic learning, and meta-learning are examples of the algorithms applied to the drug design and discovery process. Artificial intelligence has been applied to different areas of drug design and development process, such as from peptide synthesis to molecule design, virtual screening to molecular docking, quantitative structureCactivity relationship to drug repositioning, protein misfolding to proteinCprotein interactions, and molecular pathway identification to polypharmacology. Artificial intelligence principles have been applied to the classification of active and inactive, monitoring drug release, pre-clinical and clinical development, primary and secondary drug screening, biomarker development, pharmaceutical manufacturing, bioactivity identification and physiochemical properties, prediction of toxicity, and identification of mode of action.

Almost all subjects with COVID-19 develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin-G (IgG) within three weeks after infection. No data are available on the seroconversion rates of cancer patients and COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, observational, prospective study that enrolled: 1) patients and oncology health professionals with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays on nasal/pharyngeal swab specimens; 2) patients and oncology health professionals with clinical or radiological suspicious of infection by SARS-CoV-2; and 3) patients with cancer who are considered at high risk for infection and eligible for active therapy and/or major surgery. All enrolled subjects were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, which is a qualitative membrane-based immunoassay for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the study was to evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rate in patients with cancer and oncology healthcare professionals with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19. RESULTS: From March 30 to May 11, 2020, 166 subjects were enrolled in the study. Among them, cancer patients and health workers were 61 (36.7%) and 105 (63.3%), respectively. Overall, 86 subjects (51.8%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, while 60 (36.2%) had a clinical suspicious of COVID-19. Median time between symptom onset (for cases not confirmed by RT-PCR) or RT-PCR confirmation to serum antibody test was 17 days (interquartile range, 26). In the population with confirmed RT-PCR, 83.8% was IgG positive. No difference in IgG positivity was observed between cancer patients and health workers (87.9% vs 80.5%; P = 0.39).

METHODS: Murine activities and appetite, body weight, and ratio of liver weight to its body weight (Hepatic mass index, HMI) were observed. Worm load and liver egg burden were evaluated as the infection intensity. Number and size of liver egg granulomas and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were investigated. We analysed hepatic fibrosis by markers of fibrosis in tissue, detected hepatic Th17 and Treg frequency by flow cytometry, and measured hepatic expressions of ROR?3t, Foxp3, IL-17A and TGF-?1 via qPCR. Lipid metabolism was determined by serum levels of cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) as well as hepatic Oil red O staining. RESULTS: In the infected ApoE-/- mice, the increased infection intensity aggravated the hepatic immunopathology (evidenced by increased HMI, elevated egg granulomas and increased ALT levels) and fibrosis (increased hepatic collagen deposition). ApoE deficiency resulted in significantly elevated ratio of hepatic Th17/Treg and higher serum levels of TC and TG, along with higher level of hepatic Oil red O staining.

Cognitive alterations are among the most frequent symptoms, and may persist beyond the acute phase of infection. Methods We conducted a narrative review of the literature. Results Hospitalised patients, and especially critically ill patients, are at greater risk of developing cognitive symptoms. PostCCOVID-19 cognitive symptoms, unlike those associated with other viral illnesses, have been observed in patients with mild infection, and present some atypical features. Cognitive symptoms may last longer in COVID-19 than in other infectious processes, and more frequently affect young people. PostCCOVID-19 cognitive symptoms share common features with those described in chronic fatigue syndrome, including a similar profile with affective symptoms. Brief screening tests for cognitive impairment present suboptimal diagnostic performance, and standardised criteria are needed to ensure correct diagnosis. PostCCOVID-19 cognitive impairment can have a significant impact on the patient's quality of life and functional independence, regardless of other postCCOVID-19 symptoms. Currently, no specific treatments have been approved for postCCOVID-19 cognitive impairment, although cognitive stimulation may be useful in some patients. Conclusions PostCCOVID-19 cognitive symptoms are common and are often associated with other systemic symptoms.

Methods: Data were extrapolated retrospectively from two separate 6-week periods in 2019 and 2020 (1st April-13th May) using electronic records of patients referred to the orthopaedic team. Soft tissue injuries were included where a confirmed diagnosis was made with radiological evidence. Patients were excluded if no orthopaedic intervention was required. Data were compared between the two time periods. Results: There were fewer attendances to hospital in 2020 compared with 2019 (178 vs. 328), but time from presentation to surgery significantly increased in 2020 (2.94 days vs. 4.91 days, p = 0.009).

The rapid development of digital technologies is believed to play a huge role in this revolution. The ongoing prevention and control of COVID-19 has greatly boosted the penetration of digital technology services in all areas of society, and sustainable transformation driven by digital technologies and services is rapidly becoming an area of innovation and research. Studies have shown that the rapid advancement of digitalization is also accompanied by a series of new governance challenges and problems: (1) unclear strategic orientation and inadequate policy and regulatory responses;(2) various stakeholders have not formed a sustainable community of interest;(3) information explosion is accompanied by information fragmentation and digital divide between countries and populations within countries. Meanwhile, current research has focused more on the role of digital services in urban governance and industrial development and lacks systematic research on its role in sustainable agricultural and rural development. To address the realities faced by different stakeholders in the process of digital transformation of agriculture, this paper aims to propose an inclusive analytical framework based on the meta-governance theory to identify and analyze the demand, supply, actor networks, and incentives in the digital technology-and-services-driven sustainable agricultural transformation, starting from the goals and connotations of sustainable agricultural and rural transformation and the interactions among different stakeholders in governing information flows. This analytical framework is further applied to analyze the cases of China and the EU. Although China and the EU represent different development phases and policy contexts, the framework is valid for capturing the characteristics of information flows and actor networks along the flows. It is concluded that a common information platform based on the stakeholder network would benefit all stakeholders, help reach common framing of issues, and maintain a dynamic exchange of information. Depending on the country context, different types of stakeholders may play different roles in creating, supervising, and maintaining such platforms.

Transnational law, it must be said, is a far from settled concept. There is uncertainty as to what the term actually means, and how it differs from other concepts, such as national legal ordering or global law. For early theorists, the essence of transnational law was whether it regulated conduct or events that crossed national boundaries. More recent scholarship, however, has focused not on what is being regulated, but rather on how laws and norms are transmitted between supranational and local levels.Corporate governance, with its complex array of public and private actors, fits naturally within the modern conception of transnational law as a species of law that can no longer be viewed through a purely national lens. Financial markets today are global and interconnected and events, such as the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and the current COVID-19 crisis, exemplify the risk of contagion across those markets.Not only can corporate governance problems transcend national boundaries, so too can their solutions, which often involve regulatory efforts that operate at a transnational level. In this environment, the corporation has taken on a greater societal role. Indeed, according to The British Academys influential Future of the Corporation project, the main purpose of business today is to solve the problems of people and planet profitably.This paper explores, from a transnational perspective, the transmission of laws and norms that are designed to constrain directors conduct and enhance corporate accountability. It focuses on two key examples of such accountability mechanisms fiduciary duties and corporate codes.The paper begins with a comparative and historical examination of directors fiduciary duties in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, analyzing the extent to which the transfer of fiduciary law to these common law jurisdictions has resulted in a unified approach to directors duties, as is often assumed by studies such as the law matters hypothesis. The paper then moves on to discuss the modern phenomenon of codes, such as corporate governance codes and shareholder stewardship codes. Corporate codes originated in the United Kingdom in the early 1990s, but have subsequently spread throughout the world. The paper explores the global transmission of these codes, which constitute powerful norm creators. The rise of corporate codes epitomizes the fact that transnational legal ordering occurs multi-directionally and recursively up from and down to the national and local levels. It also demonstrates the importance of who writes the rules, because this can affect the substance of those rules and result in significant divergence between national codes.The paper assesses these various developments against the backdrop of convergence and path dependence theories in corporate governance.","output":"Transnational Migration of Laws and Norms in Corporate Governance: Fiduciary Duties and Corporate Codes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The antiviral efficacy of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. We aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of remdesivir plus standard of care compared with standard of care alone in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, with indication of oxygen or ventilator support. METHODS: DisCoVeRy was a phase 3, open-label, adaptive, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial conducted in 48 sites in Europe (France, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Luxembourg). Adult patients (aged 18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness of any duration were eligible if they had clinical evidence of hypoxaemic pneumonia, or required oxygen supplementation. Exclusion criteria included elevated liver enzymes, severe chronic kidney disease, any contraindication to one of the studied treatments or their use in the 29 days before random assignment, or use of ribavirin, as well as pregnancy or breastfeeding. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive standard of care alone or in combination with remdesivir, lopinavirCritonavir, lopinavirCritonavir and interferon beta-1a, or hydroxychloroquine. Randomisation used computer-generated blocks of various sizes; it was stratified on severity of disease at inclusion and on European administrative region. Remdesivir was administered as 200 mg intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by once daily, 1-h infusions of 100 mg up to 9 days, for a total duration of 10 days. It could be stopped after 5 days if the participant was discharged. The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15 measured by the WHO seven-point ordinal scale, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population and was one of the secondary outcomes. This trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT2020-000936-23, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04315948. FINDINGS: Between March 22, 2020, and Jan 21, 2021, 857 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to remdesivir plus standard of care (n=429) or standard of care only (n=428). 15 participants were excluded from analysis in the remdesivir group, and ten in the control group. At day 15, the distribution of the WHO ordinal scale was: (1) not hospitalised, no limitations on activities (61 [15%] of 414 in the remdesivir group vs 73 [17%] of 418 in the control group); (2) not hospitalised, limitation on activities (129 [31%] vs 132 [32%]); (3) hospitalised, not requiring supplemental oxygen (50 [12%] vs 29 [7%]); (4) hospitalised, requiring supplemental oxygen (76 [18%] vs 67 [16%]); (5) hospitalised, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices (15 [4%] vs 14 [3%]); (6) hospitalised, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (62 [15%] vs 79 [19%]); (7) death (21 [5%] vs 24 [6%]).

There was no significant difference in the occurrence of serious adverse events between treatment groups (remdesivir, 135 [33%] of 406 vs control, 130 [31%] of 418; p=048). Three deaths (acute respiratory distress syndrome, bacterial infection, and hepatorenal syndrome) were considered related to remdesivir by the investigators, but only one by the sponsor's safety team (hepatorenal syndrome). INTERPRETATION: No clinical benefit was observed from the use of remdesivir in patients who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19, were symptomatic for more than 7 days, and required oxygen support.

Globally, it has been observed that according to the statistics, India has the second largest number of people with diabetes. Literature review has been implemented within the databases using suitable keywords. For persons suffering from diabetic disorder, the COVID-19 infection becomes a dual challenge. Diabetes is a severe metabolic situation which causes the sugar levels in the blood to increase than the normal level. Normally, communicable disease like COVID-19 is more prevailing in patients with diabetes. Diabetic patient has poor immune response to infections. The different bacterial, viral, parasitic, and mycotic infections showed increased probability in diabetic patients as compared to non-diabetic patient. All these conclusions clear out the intention that the diabetic patients are more susceptible to enhanced inflammatory response that may lead to rapid spreading of COVID-19 infection with high rate of mortality. In the present situation of pandemic, managing diabetes seems to be quite challenging and diabetic patient having COVID-19 infection should follow normal course of antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs prescribed with the exception of sodium glucose co-transpoters-2 inhibitors which would increase the risk of dehydration and ketoacidosis.

We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of neurophysiologic TMS measures in people with isolated dystonia to provide a synthesized understanding of cortical neurophysiology associated with isolated dystonia. We performed a systematic database search and data was extracted independently by the two authors. Separate meta-analyses were performed for TMS measures of: motor threshold, corticomotor excitability, short interval intracortical inhibition, cortical silent period, intracortical facilitation and afferent-induced inhibition. Standardised mean differences were calculated using a random effects model to determine overall effect sizes and confidence intervals.

This study investigated the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis on Italian residents during the first week of government-imposed lockdown and the role of defense mechanisms as protective factors against distress. In this cross-sectional study, 5,683 Italians responded to an online survey assessing socio-demographics, overall psychological distress, post-traumatic symptoms, and defense mechanisms using validated measures as the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Defense Mechanisms Rating Scale-Self-Report-30 (DMRS-SR-30). Data were collected from March 13 to March 18, within the first week of lockdown in Italy. Results showed that younger age and female gender were associated with increased psychological distress. Having positive cases nearby, more days on lockdown, and having to relocate were also associated with greater distress. Higher overall defensive functioning (ODF) was associated with lower levels of depression (r = ?.44, 95% CI ?0.48, ?0.40), anxiety (r = ?.38, 95% CI ?0.42, ?0.35), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (r = ?.34, 95% CI ?0.38, ?0.30). Conversely, less adaptive defensive functioning was related to greater affective distress across all domains. Each increased unit of ODF decreased the chances of developing post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) by 71% (odds ratio = 0.29, p < 0.001, 95% CI.026,.032). The psychological impact of COVID-19 among Italians during the early weeks of government lockdown has been significant.

While the physics of particle filtration results in the PFE being size-dependent, measurement standards are specified using a single, integrated PFE, for simplicity. This integrated PFE is commonly defined with respect to either the number (NBFE) or mass (MBFE) distribution of particles as a function of size. This relationship is non-trivial; it is influenced by both the shape of the particle distribution and the fact that multiple practical definitions of particle size are used. This manuscript discusses the relationship between NBFE and MBFE in detail, providing a guide to practitioners. Our discussion begins with a theoretical discussion of the underlying principles. We then present experimental results for a database of size-resolved PFE (SPFE) measurements for over 900 candidate respirators and filter media, including filter media with systematically varied properties and commercial samples that span the 20%-99.8% MBFE. The observed relationships between NBFE and MBFE are discussed in terms of the most-penetrating particle size (MPPS) and charge state of the media. For the NaCl particles used here, we observed that MBFEs were greater than NBFEs for charged materials and vice versa for uncharged materials. This relationship is observed because a shift from NBFE to MBFE weights the distribution towards larger sizes, while charged materials shift the MPPS to smaller sizes. Results are validated by comparing the output of a pair of TSI 8130As, a common instrument used in gauging standards compliance, to that of MBFEs computed from a system capable of measuring SPFE.","output":"Comparison of measurement systems for assessing number- and mass-based particle filtration efficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel partial differential equation (PDE) - based denoising framework for photon-limited medical microscopy images is proposed in this article Such a microscopy image processing approach could be further applied in the analysis of the medical images of viruses and bacteria, thus being useful in the context of the current coronavirus pandemic The considered technique is based on a nonlinear hyperbolic second-order PDE model The differential model is then solved numerically by applying a consistent and fast converging finite difference-based iterative approximation algorithm to it The numerical approximation scheme provided here removes successfully the Poisson noise from the microscopy images representing viruses like COVID-19, while enhancing their essential details and thus facilitating their analysis Quantum denoising experiments and method comparison results are also described ? 2020 Editura Academiei Romane All rights reserved","output":"A nonlinear second-order hyperbolic pde-based photon- limited medical microscopy image restoration technique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study focused on intestinal restitution including phenotype switching of absorptive enterocytes and the abundance of different enterocyte subtypes in weaned pigs after porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection.

Patients: Eleven consecutive patients with COVID-19 ARDS. Intervention. Helmet CPAP in prone position after failing a CPAP trial in the supine position. Main variable of interest: Data collection at baseline and then after 24, 48 and 72 hours of pronation. We measured PaO2/FIO2, pH, lactate, PaCO2, SpO2, respiratory rate and the status of the patients at 28-day follow up. Results: Patients were treated with helmet CPAP for a mean +SD of 7+2.7 days. Prone positioning was feasible in all patients, but in 7 of them dexmedetomidine improved comfort. PaO2/FIO2 improved from 107.520.8 before starting pronation to 244.4106.2 after 72 hours (p<.001). We also observed a significantly increase in Sp02 from 90.62.3 to 963.1 (p<.001) and a decrease in respiratory rate from 27.64.3 to 20.14.7 (p=.004). No difference was observed in PaCO2 or pH. At 28 days two patients died after ICU admission, one was discharged in the main ward after ICU admission and eight were discharged home after being successfully managed outside the ICU. Conclusions: Helmet CPAP during pronation was feasible and safe in COVID-19 ARDS managed outside the ICU and sedation with dexmedetomidine safely improved comfort. We recorded an increase in PaO2/FIO2, SpO2 and a reduction in respiratory rate.","output":"Awake pronation with helmet continuous positive airway pressure for COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients outside the ICU: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of COVID-19 in the entire world has put the human kind in danger.

Given this increased prevalence within the CF community, we sought to understand how people with CF experiencing food insecurity prefer to receive resources and support. The results were used to inform and prioritize creation of patient-centered resources for CF care teams. Methods: A survey request was posted via the CF Foundations Community Voice (CV), a program that provides opportunities for people with CF and their family members to influence programs and initiatives affecting the CF community [3]. A total of 1134 CV participants who identified as an adult with CF, a spouse of a person with CF, or a parent of a child with CF were invited to respond to an anonymousweb-based survey from February 3C17, 2021. Results: Therewere 140 responses to the survey. From these responses, 84% (117/140) reported prior knowledge of food insecurity, and 21% (30/140) reported experiencing some degree of food insecurity. Of those reporting food insecurity, 73% (22/30) worried about running out of food before having money to buy more, and 67% (20/30) reported that their food did not last and that they did not have money to buy more. Half (15/30) indicated that their family or household food status worsened because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents indicating food insecurity reported assistance preferences including local community resources (57%, 17/30), their care team social worker (40%, 12/30), and community and religious support groups (43%,13/30). Additionally, respondents preferred to receive food security resources via email (87%, 26/30), website (50%, 15/30), or patient portal (43%, 13/30). To bolster food status, respondents preferred to receive grocery store gift cards (93%, 28/30) or a food box mailed to the home (77%, 23/30) or to use a food pantry (70%, 21/30). Conclusion: Results indicated that people with CF who experience food insecurity prefer to receive food in a variety ofways, many being virtually or through private organizations. These resources may be preferred because of the level of anonymity, less perceived stigma, increased autonomy of choice, and ease of use.We believe this is in part why people experiencing food insecurity report a preference to obtain resources electronically (email, website, patient portal). About 40% of respondents identified their care team social worker as a preferred contact to advocate, connect, and educate on food resources, highlighting the importance of a trusting, safe relationship between care team social workers and patients.

Moreover, untreated diabetes can lead to complications and severe conditions. A few studies exist on the prevalence of diabetes and the adequacy of diabetes management for the Canadian population, and so this study aims to estimate the diabetes prevalence rates using biomarkers and the treatment statuses of non-institutionalized Canadian patients. Methods The Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) cycles 1 to 4 were conducted between 2007 and 2015 as interviews with non-institutionalized Canadians. Four blood diabetic markers were measured: insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin percentages, random-spot glucose, and fasting glucose. Subjects with levels higher than normal ranges were considered to have pre-diabetes or diabetes. Treatment statuses were categorized into treated (using anti-diabetic agents or diagnosed with diabetes), probably treated (taking prescriptions or diagnosed with chronic conditions), potentially treated (taking any medications or diagnosed with chronic conditions), and untreated (not taking any medications and not diagnosed with chronic conditions). Weights were applied to generate nationally representative statistics. Results The blood insulin levels in cycle 4 were significantly higher than those in cycle 1 (ratio = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.79). The proportions of patients with pre-diabetes and diabetes were estimated differently at 0.75% using random-spot glucose and 42.17% using glycosylated hemoglobin percentages, respectively. The proportions of Canadians with uncontrolled pre-diabetes or diabetes varied from 0.59% using random-spot glucose levels to 4.63% using fasting glucose levels, respectively. Through cycles 1 to 4, the proportions of untreated Canadians with pre-diabetes or diabetes ranged from 3.86% to 3.73%. More than 93% of those with high fasting glucose levels were taking prescription medications or had been diagnosed with chronic conditions (probably treated). Less than 33% of those with high fasting glucose levels were diagnosed or actively being treated with anti-diabetic agents (treated). Conclusion Diabetes biomarkers might be useful for screening untreated and undertreated patients with pre-diabetes or diabetes. The treatment categories we used indicated different intensities of intervention that might be useful for determining levels of patient outreach and for planning targeted screening in Canada.","output":"Trends in Diabetes Biomarkers and Treatment Statuses of Non-Institutionalized Canadians: Canadian Health Measures Survey 2007 to 2015"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"\\"Plantation politics\\" pervade multiple institutions in the United States, including public health.

Based on the critical role of None Structural Proteins (NSP), NSP3, NSP4, and NSP6 in COVID-19, this study attempts to investigate the superior natural selection mutations and Epistasis among these none structural proteins. MethodsApproximately 6.5 million SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences of each NSP3, NSP4, and NSP6 nonstructural protein were analyzed from January 2020 to January 2022. Python programming language was utilized to preprocess and apply inclusion criteria on the FASTA file to prepare a list of suitable samples. NSP3, NSP4, and NSP6 were aligned to the reference sequence to compare and identify mutation patterns categorized based on frequency, geographical zone distribution, and date. To discover epistasis situations, linear regression between mutation frequency and date among candidate genes was performed to determine correlations. ResultsThe rate of NSP3, NSP4, and NSP6 mutations in divided geographical areas was different. Based on continental studies, P1228L (54.48%), P1469S (54.41%), and A488S (53.86%) mutations in NSP3, T492I (54.84%), and V167L (52.81%) in NSP4 and T77A (69.85%) mutation in NSP6 increased over time, especially in recent months. For NSP3, Europe had the highest P1228L, P1469S, and A488S mutations. For NSP4, Oceania had the highest T492I and V167L mutations, and for NSP6, Europe had the highest T77A mutation.

In response to the global need for effective sterilization techniques, this study evaluated the virucidal efficacy of FATHHOMEs self-contained, ozone-based dry-sanitizing device, by dose and time response assessment. We tested inactivation of human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, a close genetic model of SARS-CoV-2, on porous (N95 filtering facepiece respirator/FFR) and nonporous (glass) surfaces. We started our assays with 20 ppm of ozone for 10 min exposure, which was able to effectively reduce, 99.8% and 99.9% of virus from glass and N95 FFR surfaces, respectively. Importantly, the virus was completely inactivated, below the detection limit (over 6-log10 reduction) with 25 ppm ozone for 15 mins on both tested surfaces. As expected, a higher ozone concentration (50 ppm) resulted in faster inactivation of HCoV-OC43 with 100% inactivation in 10 mins from both the surfaces, with no residual ozone present after completion of the 5-minute post exposure recapture cycle and no measurable increase in ambient ozone levels. These results confirmed that FATHHOMEs device may provide a safe and viable solution for rapid decontamination of SARS-CoV-2- from worn items, frequently touched items, and PPE including N95 FFRs, face shields and other personal items.","output":"Inactivation of Human Coronavirus by Fathhomes Dry Sanitizer Device: Rapid and Eco-friendly Ozone-based Disinfection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Distinguishing whether pathogens are novel or endemic is critical for controlling emerging infectious diseases, an increasing threat to wildlife and human health.

The incidences of cardiac injury in advance age (>60 years) (30%) was about two\\\\fold than young patients (<60 years) (15%) with COVID\\\\19. Severe cases (42%) have seven\\\\fold prevalence cardiac injury than in their non\\\\ severe counterparts (6%). Furthermore, cardiac injury is associated with an increased risk of all\\\\cause mortality in patients with COVID\\\\19 (OR 10.11, 95% CI 4.49C22.77). In patients with severe COVID\\\\19, cardiac injury is associated with an increased risk of all\\\\cause mortality (OR: 16.79, 95% CI: 5.52C51.02). CONCLUSIONS: This was the first meta\\\\analysis exploring the prevalence and impact of cardiac injury on COVID\\\\19. Cardiac injury is common in hospitalized patients and advanced age and severe COVID\\\\19 patients prone to experience more risk of cardiac injury. Furthermore, cardiac injury is associated with increased risk of all\\\\cause mortality.","output":"Prevalence and impact of cardiac injury on COVID\\\\19: A systematic review and meta\\\\analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic influenza is one of a small number of infectious diseases that pose a significant global threat.

The effects of the behavioral restriction on cognition have been little examined. The present study is aimed at analyzing the effects of lockdown on executive function prominently involved in adapting behavior to new environmental demands. We analyze non-verbal fluency abilities, as indirectly providing a measure of cognitive flexibility to react to spatial changes. Sixteen students (mean age 20.75;SD 1.34), evaluated before the start of the lockdown (T1) in a battery of psychological tasks exploring different cognitive domains, have been reassessed during lockdown (T2). The assessment included the modified Five-Point Test (m-FPT) to analyze non-verbal fluency abilities. At T2, the students were also administered the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). The restriction of behaviors following a lockdown determines increased non-verbal fluency, evidenced by the significant increase of the number of new drawings. We found worsened verbal span, while phonemic verbal fluency remained unchanged. Interestingly, we observed a significant tendency to use the left part of each box in the m-FPT correlated with TAS-20 and with the subscales that assess difficulty in describing and identifying feelings. Although our data were collected from a small sample, they evidence that the restriction of behaviors determines a leftward bias, suggesting a greater activation of the right hemisphere, intrinsically connected with the processing of non-verbal information and with the need to manage an emotional situation.","output":"Behavioral Restriction Determines Left Attentional Bias: Preliminary Evidences From COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The process of capturing a well-composed photo is difficult and it takes years of experience to master.

Early reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detectable in wastewater in advance of confirmed cases sparked widespread interest in wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) as a tool for mitigation of COVID-19 outbreaks. One hypothesis was that wastewater surveillance might provide a cost-effective alternative to other more expensive approaches such as pooled and random testing of groups. In this paper, we report the outcomes of a wastewater surveillance pilot program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a large urban university with a substantial population of students living in on-campus dormitories. Surveillance was conducted at the building level on a thrice-weekly schedule throughout the university's fall residential semester. In multiple cases, wastewater surveillance enabled identification of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases that were not detected by other components of the campus monitoring program, which also included in-house contact tracing, symptomatic testing, scheduled testing of student athletes, and daily symptom reporting. In the context of all cluster events reported to the University community during the fall semester, wastewater-based testing events resulted in identification of smaller clusters than events triggered by other means. This includes identification of single asymptomatic individuals in dorms with total resident populations of 150-200. While the strategy described was developed for COVID-19, it is likely to be broadly applicable to mitigation of future pandemics in universities and other group-living environments.","output":"Implementing Building-Level SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Surveillance on a University Campus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Liver chemistry abnormalities (LCA) are common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but their causes and clinical impact have not been adequately studied. We assessed the associations between LCA and clinical characteristics, inflammatory serum markers, in-hospital mortality. METHODS: Ten thousand eight hundred fifty-six adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in 13 hospitals in New York (1 March to 27 April 2020) were analyzed retrospectively. Abnormalities of liver chemistries [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin] were defined as absent, mild-moderate (at least one value up to four times elevated), or severe. RESULTS: LCA were mild-moderate in 63.9% and severe in 7.6% at admission. Risk factors for severe LCA were male sex and chronic liver disease. Conversely, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were less likely associated with severe LCA. AST elevation correlated weakly to modestly with inflammatory markers. On adjusted analysis, in-hospital mortality was 1.56 times and 1.87 times increased in patients with mild-to-moderate and severe LCA, respectively. Diabetes, hypertension, male sex, and age greater than 60 years was associated with incremental risk of mortality with increase severity of LCA, especially in the first week of hospitalization. HTN was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality unless LCA was present. CONCLUSION: Increasing severity of LCA on hospital admission predicts early in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients.

The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of S100A12, a prominent marker gene for bacterial infection, in the prognosis of disease severity in COVID-19 patients. To ensure the robustness of the association, a total of 1695 samples from 14 independent transcriptome datasets on sepsis, influenza infection and COVID-19 infection were examined. First, it was demonstrated that S100A12 was a marker for sepsis and severity of sepsis. Then, S100A12 was found to be a marker for severe influenza infection, and there was an upward trend of S100A12 expression as the severity level of influenza infection increased. As for COVID-19 infection, it was found that S100A12 expression was elevated in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 infection. More importantly, S100A12 expression at hospital admission was robustly correlated with future quantitative indexes of disease severity and outcome in COVID-19 patients, superior to established prognostic markers including CRP, PCT, d-dimer, ferritin, LDH and fibrinogen.

This post-hoc analysis of data from the pivotal phase 3, prospective, open-label study of valrubicin evaluated the effects of patient characteristics and past treatments on the response to valrubicin. METHODS Enrolled patients had non-muscle-invasive CIS with or without concurrent papillary disease stage Ta and/or T1 for which papillary tumors had been resected before treatment, and had previously received  2 courses of IVe therapy ( 1 BCG course). Patients received a course of valrubicin, which consisted of 6 weekly IVe treatments of valrubicin (800 mg). Complete response was defined as no evidence of disease by urine cytology, cystoscopy, and biopsy at 3 and 6 months posttreatment. Patient characteristics, baseline urinary symptoms, and number and type of previous treatment courses and instillations were compared for complete versus nonresponders (including partial responders) to valrubicin. RESULTS Ninety patients enrolled; 87 patients with positive biopsy at initiation completed a valrubicin course and underwent the 3-month assessment. Five had missing data at 6 months. Of the remaining 82 patients, 18 demonstrated a complete response; 64 demonstrated partial or no response. For complete responders versus partial or nonresponders, differences in patient characteristics, baseline urinary symptoms, and number of previous courses or instillations of BCG or other types of treatment were not significant (P > 0.05). More complete responders had evidence of inflammation before or during valrubicin treatment (P = 0.005 vs nonresponders). CONCLUSIONS In these patients with BCG-refractory CIS, complete responders to valrubicin did not differ significantly from partial or nonresponders in the number of prior courses or instillations. The results suggest that therapy with valrubicin may be considered in appropriate candidates who have not responded to prior therapies.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of the mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and JNJ-78436735 vaccines among US military personnel before and during the predominance of the Delta variant in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study was conducted among all unvaccinated and fully vaccinated US military personnel who had a documented SARS-CoV-2 test performed in the US between January 1 and September 24, 2021. Individuals were identified using Department of Defense (DOD) electronic medical, laboratory, and surveillance databases. The pre-Delta period was defined as January 1 to May 31, 2021, and the Delta period as June 19 to September 24, 2021. Case individuals were defined by a positive polymerase chain reaction SARS-CoV-2 test result or a positive antigen test result with symptoms. Control individuals had at least 1 negative SARS-CoV-2 test result. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 vaccination with the mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, or JNJ-78436735 vaccine, assessed from DOD electronic vaccination records. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness overall, by vaccine type, and by outcome stratified by the pre-Delta and Delta periods in the US. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 100  (1 ? odds ratio) in a logistic regression model with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: The cohort included 441 379 individuals, with 290 256 in the pre-Delta period (236 555 [81%] male; median age, 25 years [range, 17-68 years]) and 151 123 in the Delta period (120 536 [80%] male; median age, 26 years [range, 17-70 years]). Adjusted vaccine effectiveness of all vaccines was significantly higher during the pre-Delta period (89.2%; 95% CI, 88.1%-90.1%) compared with the Delta period (70.2%; 95% CI, 69.3%-71.1%) for all outcomes, an overall decrease of 19%. mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness was highest in the pre-Delta (93.5%; 95% CI, 91.9%-94.7%) and Delta (79.4%; 95% CI, 78.3%-80.4%) periods for all outcomes, whereas the JNJ-78436735 vaccine had the lowest effectiveness during the pre-Delta (81.8%; 95% CI, 74.2%- 87.1%) and Delta (38.3%; 95% CI, 34.5%-41.9%) periods. Effectiveness for all vaccines during both periods was higher for symptomatic infection and hospitalization among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this case-control study, among US military personnel, COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness was significantly lower during the period when the Delta variant predominated compared with the period before Delta variant predominance; this was especially true for the JNJ-78436735 vaccine.

Total, direct and indirect effects were estimated through bootstrapped mediated moderation analyses providing 95% bias corrected bootstrap confidence intervals. After controlling for the effects of gender and age range, job loss was found to be negatively associated with QoL, and hopelessness partially mediated such relationship. These relationships were in turn moderated by trait EI. Our study suggests that trait EI levels act as protective factor for a good QoL, mitigating the impact of both job loss and hopelessness over QoL levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying psychological protective and/or risk factors for a better QoL is crucial for the development of interventions aimed at reducing the emotional impact of the pandemic and of its negative real-life consequences.","output":"Quality of Life and Job Loss during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mediation by Hopelessness and Moderation by Trait Emotional Intelligence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 is killing untold numbers of older adults around the world, it is important to reflect on the loss of this generation.

Most previous studies focus on the negative effects of death anxiety via the Western materialistic view, neglecting both the positive aspects of death anxiety within the Chinese cultural background and the positive effects of death anxiety upon environmental consumption. By implementing the unique Chinese cultural background for the concepts of justice and interests, this study explores the positive influence of individual death anxiety on altruistic environmental consumption during the COVID-19 crisis by analyzing personal life reviews and other sources. The results show that (1) under the guidance of the correct concept of justice and benefit, individuals with high death anxiety during the epidemic period not only enhance their self-esteem through positive self-perception and social evaluation, but they are more inclined to benefit from other environmental consumption behaviors and attain a symbolic self-survival; and (2) during the epidemic period, mental resilience, as a transformation mechanism of external defense and the internal growth of death psychology, can directly affect altruistic environmental consumption by consumers without relying on external standards. In the context of the Chinese cultures concept of justice and interests, this study enriches the knowledge of fear management theory and the positive impact of death anxiety on environmental consumption. The introduction of mental resilience as a boundary condition has important theoretical and practical significance within the study of consumer behavior in public health emergencies and post-epidemic economic recovery.","output":"Reflection in the Context of the Epidemic: Does Death Anxiety Have a Positive Impact?

It is now well established that the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with its primary host receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Additionally, the interaction of S with the neuropilin (NRP) receptor has been reported to facilitate viral entry. SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to neuropilin-1 (NRP1) by virtue of a CendR motif which terminates with either an arginine or lysine. Furthermore, a number of different peptide sequences have been reported to bind to the same site in NRP1 including vascular endothelial growth factor A and other viral proteins. To gain a deeper understanding of additional factors besides the C-terminal arginine that may favour high NRP1 binding, several modelled peptides were investigated using triplicate 1 s molecular dynamics simulations. A C-end histidine failed to exhibit strong NRP1 affinity. Some previously reported factors that increase binding affinity and secure NRP1 receptor activation was observed in the NRP1-peptide complexes studied and such complexes had higher molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area based free energy of binding. Additionally, the results also highlight the relevance of an exposed arginine at its canonical location as capping it blocked arginine from engaging key residues at the NRP1 receptor site that are indispensable for functional binding; and that the presence of proline reinforces the C-terminal arginine. Given that stable NRP1 binding is crucial for viral uptake, stable interactions should be accounted for in the design of potential drugs and treatment routes to target or disrupt this interface, considering the S1-NRP1 interaction as well as its endogenous VEGF-A ligand that is associated with nociception.","output":"Characterization of peptide binding to the SARS-CoV-2 host factor neuropilin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Blood procalcitonin (PCT) levels usually increase during infectious diseases and might be helpful to differentiate bacterial from non-bacterial origin.

Furthermore, recently available vaccination options might not be amenable or effective for all patients in this heterogeneous population. Therefore, these patients often rely on passive immunization with plasma-derived, intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (IVIG/SCIG). Whether the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and/or the progress in vaccination programs lead to increased and potentially protective titers in plasma-derived immunoglobulins (Ig) indicated (e.g., for humoral immunodeficiency) remains a pressing question for this patient population. PURPOSE: We investigated SARS-CoV-2 reactivity of US plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG products from the end of 2020 until June 2021 as well as in convalescent plasma (CP) from May 2020 to August 2020 to determine whether potentially neutralizing antibody titers may be present. METHODS: Final containers of IVIG/SCIG and CP donations were analyzed by commercial ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG as well as microneutralization assay using a patient-derived SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) isolate. Neutralization capacities of 313 single plasma donations and 119 plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG lots were determined. Results obtained from both analytical methods were normalized against the WHO International Standard. Finally, based on dense pharmacokinetic profiles of an IVIG preparation from previously published investigations, possible steady-state plasma levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacities were approximated based on currently measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 potencies in IVIG/SCIG preparations. RESULTS: CP donations presented with high variability with regards to anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity in ELISA as well as in neutralization testing. While approximately 50% of convalescent donations were not/low neutralizing, approximately 10% were at or above 600 IU/mL. IVIG/SCIG lots derived from pre-pandemic plasma donations did not show neutralizing capacities for SARS-CoV-2. Lots produced between December 2020 and June 2021 entailing plasma donations after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 showed a rapid and constant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity over time. While lot-to-lot variability was substantial, neutralization capacity increased from a mean of 21 IU/mL in December 2020 to 506 IU/mL in June 2021 with a maximum of 864 IU/mL for the most recent lots. Pharmacokinetic extrapolations, based on non-compartmental superposition principles using steady-state reference profiles from previously published pharmacokinetic investigations on IVIG in PID, yielded potential steady-state trough plasma levels of 16 IU/mL of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 IgG based on the average final container concentration from May 2021 of 216 IU/mL. Maximum extrapolated trough levels could reach 64 IU/mL based on the latest maximal final container potency tested in June 2021. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity in IVIG/SCIG produced from US plasma rapidly and in part exponentially increased in the first half of 2021. The observed increase of final container potencies is likely trailing the serological status of the US donor population in terms of COVID-19 convalescence and vaccination by at least 5 months due to production lead times and should in principle continue at least until Fall 2021. In summary, the data support rapidly increasing levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in IVIG/SCIG products, implicating that a certain level of protection could be possible against COVID-19 for regularly substituted PID/SID patients. Nevertheless, more research is still needed to confirm which plasma levels are needed to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in immune-compromised patients.

The digestive system is composed of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or the alimentary canal, salivary glands, the liver, and the exocrine pancreas. The principal functions of the gastrointestinal tract are to digest and absorb ingested nutrients, and to excrete waste products of digestion. Most nutrients are ingested in a form that is either too complex for absorption or insoluble, and therefore, indigestible or incapable of being digested. Within the GI tract, much of these substances are solubilized and further degraded enzymatically to simple molecules, sufficiently small in size, and in a form that permits absorption across the mucosal epithelium. This chapter explains in detail the mechanisms of salivary secretions, compositions of saliva, and the functions of saliva. The chapter also elaborates properties of bile as well as the synthesis of bile acids.

Different doses of EDP-938 were assessed. Nasal-wash samples were obtained from day 2 until day 12 for assessments. Clinical symptoms were assessed by the participants, and pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained. The primary end point was the area under the curve (AUC) for the RSV viral load, as measured by reverse-transcriptase-quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay. The key secondary end point was the AUC for the total symptom score. RESULTS: In part 1 of the trial, 115 participants were assigned to receive EDP-938 (600 mg once daily [600-mg once-daily group] or 300 mg twice daily after a 500-mg loading dose [300-mg twice-daily group]) or placebo. In part 2, a total of 63 participants were assigned to receive EDP-938 (300 mg once daily after a 600-mg loading dose [300-mg once-daily group] or 200 mg twice daily after a 400-mg loading dose [200-mg twice-daily group]) or placebo.

The AUC for the mean total symptom score (hours  score, with higher values indicating greater severity) was 124.5 in the 600-mg once-daily group, 181.8 in the 300-mg twice-daily group, and 478.8 in the placebo group. The results in part 2 followed a pattern similar to that in part 1: the AUC for the mean viral load was 173.9 in the 300-mg once-daily group, 196.2 in the 200-mg twice-daily group, and 879.0 in the placebo group, and the AUC for the mean total symptom score was 99.3, 89.6, and 432.2, respectively.

RT-PCR-based kits are the current standard kits used for COVID-19 diagnosis, but these tests take much time despite their high precision. A faster automated diagnostic tool is required for the effective screening of COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, a new semi-supervised feature learning technique is proposed to screen COVID-19 patients using chest CT scans. The model proposed in this study uses a three-step architecture, consisting of a convolutional autoencoder based unsupervised feature extractor, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) based feature selector, and a Bagging Ensemble of support vector machines based binary classifier. The proposed architecture has been designed to provide precise and robust diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs.nonCOVID).

Several optical imaging methods and probes have been used to track how stem cells incorporate and regenerate themselves in vivo over time. However, these approaches are limited by photobleaching, toxicity and interference from background tissue autofluorescence. Here we show that fluorescent nanodiamonds, in combination with fluorescence-activated cell sorting, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and immunostaining, can identify transplanted CD45(C)CD54(+)CD157(+) lung stem/progenitor cells in vivo, and track their engraftment and regenerative capabilities with single-cell resolution. Fluorescent nanodiamond labelling did not eliminate the cells properties of self-renewal and differentiation into type I and type II pneumocytes. Time-gated fluorescence imaging of tissue sections of naphthalene-injured mice indicates that the fluorescent nanodiamond-labelled lung stem/progenitor cells preferentially reside at terminal bronchioles of the lungs for 7 days after intravenous transplantation.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of various treatment modalities in nCOV-2019 patients. METHODS: A literature search was conducted before 29 June 2020 in PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane library databases. A fixed-effect model was applied if I2 < 50%, else results were combined using random-effect model. Risk ratio (RR) or standardized mean difference (SMD) along with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to pool the results. Between-study heterogeneity was explored using influence and sensitivity analyses, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Entire statistical analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.2. RESULTS: Fifty studies involving 15 in vitro and 35 clinical studies including 9170 nCOV-2019 patients were included. Lopinavir-ritonavir was significantly associated with shorter mean time to clinical recovery (SMD -0.32; 95% CI -0.57 to -0.06), remdesivir was significantly associated with better overall clinical recovery (RR 1.17; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.29), and tocilizumab was associated with less all-cause mortality (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.93). Hydroxychloroquine was associated with longer time to clinical recovery and less overall clinical recovery. It additionally had higher all-cause mortality and more total adverse events. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that except in vitro studies, no treatment has shown overall favourable outcomes in nCOV-2019 patients. Lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir and tocilizumab may have some benefits, while hydroxychloroquine administration may cause harm in nCOV-2019 patients.

Therefore, accurately predicting the dynamics of the pandemic can be very beneficial. Two main elements required for developing reliable predictions include: (1) a predictive model and (2) an indicator of the current condition and status of the pandemic. As a pandemic indicator, we used the effective reproduction number (Rt), which is defined as the number of new infections transmitted by a single contagious individual in a population that may no longer be fully susceptible. To bring the pandemic under control, Rt must be less than one. To eliminate the pandemic, Rt should be close to zero. Therefore, this value may serve as a strong indicator of the current status of the pandemic. For a predictive model, we used graph neural networks (GNNs), a method that combines graphical analysis with the structure of neural networks. We developed two types of GNN models, including: (1) graph-theory-based neural networks (GTNN) and (2) neighborhood-based neural networks (NGNN). The nodes in both graphs indicated individual states in the United States. While the GTNN models edges document functional connectivity between states, those in the NGNN model link neighboring states to one another. We trained both models with R(t) numbers collected over the previous four days and asked them to predict the following day for all states in the United States. The performance of these models was evaluated with the datasets that included R(t) values reflecting conditions from 22 January through 26 November 2020 (before the start of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States). To determine the efficiency, we compared the results of two models with each other and with those generated by a baseline Long short-term memory (LSTM) model.

Using in silico and machine learning tools, the viral mutational events were analyzed, and variants of concern and of interest were identified during each of the four waves. The overall mutation frequency (mutations per genome) increased during the course of the pandemic from 12.19 to 23.63, 31.03, and 41.22 in the first, second, third, and fourth waves, respectively. We determined that the viral strains rose to higher frequencies in local transmission.

We examined the impact of the pandemic on changes in exercise behaviors and identified characteristics associated with these changes among cancer patients. METHODS: Cancer patients (n = 1,361) completed a survey from August-September 2020 to assess COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in health behaviors and psychosocial factors. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: exercising less, exercising did not change, and exercising more. Patient characteristics were compared by exercise groups. RESULTS: One-third of the patients reported a decreased amount of regular exercise, while 11% reported exercising more during the pandemic. Patients who exercised less were more likely to be unemployed/retired, undergoing active treatment, and had increased pandemic-related alcohol consumption and psychosocial stressors such as loneliness and financial stress (all p < 0.05). In contrast, patients who exercised more were younger, female, full-time employed, did not consume alcohol, and had good health status and more social interactions (all p < 0.05). Patients who were living in rural areas and did not experience changes in daily life, were also more likely not to experience changes in exercise habits (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that a significant proportion of cancer patients experienced changes in exercise habits during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Age, sex, employment status, health status, alcohol consumption, and psychosocial factors were associated with changes in exercise behaviors.

METHODS: This case series from a single, tertiary university hospital includes all mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and proning between 17 March 2020 and 19 May 2020. The primary measure was change in PaO2 :FiO2 . RESULTS: Forty-four patients, 32 males/12 females, were treated with proning for a total of 138 sessions, with median (range) two (1-8) sessions. Median (IQR) time for the five sessions was 14 (12-17) hours. In the first session, median (IQR) PaO2 :FiO2 increased from 104 (86-122) to 161 (127-207) mm Hg (P < .001). 36/44 patients (82%) improved in PaO2 :FiO2 , with a significant increase in PaO2 :FiO2 in the first three sessions. Median (IQR) FiO2 decreased from 0.7 (0.6-0.8) to 0.5 (0.35-0.6) (<0.001). A significant decrease occurred in the first three sessions.

This study, approved by the Ethical Committee of Clinical Center Kragujevac, was designed as an observational prospective cross-sectional clinical study which was conducted on 127 patients with diagnosed respiratory COVID-19 viral infection from April to August 2020. The primary goals were to determine the predictors of COVID-19 severity and to determine the predictors of the negative outcome of COVID-19 infection. All patients were divided into three categories: patients with a mild form, moderate form, and severe form of COVID-19 infection. All biochemical and laboratory procedures were done on the first day of the hospital admission. Respiratory (p < 0.001) and heart (p = 0.002) rates at admission were significantly higher in patients with a severe form of COVID-19. From all observed hematological and inflammatory markers, only white blood cell count (9.43  4.62, p = 0.001) and LDH (643.13  313.3, p = 0.002) were significantly higher in the severe COVID-19 group.

The presence of dyspnea and a higher heart rate were confirmed as predictors of a negative, fatal outcome. Results from our study show that presence of hypertension, anosmia, and ageusia, as well as the duration of ICU stay, and serum levels of O2 - are predictors of COVID-19 severity, while the presence of dyspnea and an increased heart rate on admission were predictors of COVID-19 mortality.","output":"Predicting Severity and Intrahospital Mortality in COVID-19: The Place and Role of Oxidative Stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric evidence of the original and short versions of the Santa Clara Strength of Religious Faith Questionnaire (SCSRFQ) in Spanish in a sample of 245 Peruvian adolescents and adults (mean age = 21.04 years, SD = 3.07, 47.8% male and 52.2% female), selected by nonprobabilistic convenience sampling.

Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in children has not yet been approved globally, and it is unclear what attitude families will take when it is approved in children. We aimed to investigate the underlying causes of vaccine acceptance, hesitation, and refusal, as well as concerns about the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine by parents of children with rheumatic diseases. METHODS: Parents of children followed up with a diagnosis of rheumatic disease in the pediatric rheumatology outpatient clinic of a university hospital were included in the study. We applied a closed web-based online survey conducted cross-sectionally and sent to the participants via mobile smartphones. RESULTS: For fathers, mothers, and their children, acceptance rates for a COVID-19 vaccine were 64.2%, 57.7%, and 41.8%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, factors affecting parents' acceptance of vaccines for their children were as follows: Receiving antirheumatic medications regularly (AOR 5.40, 95% CI 1.10-26.33, p=0.03), the previous history of getting special recommended vaccines (AOR 4.12, 95% CI 1.12-27.85, p=0.03), relying on vaccines for ending pandemic (AOR 8.84, 95% CI 2.80-27.85, p=0.001), complying with the pandemic measures entirely (AOR 5.24, 95% CI 1.46-18.74, p=0.01). The two most common reasons for vaccine rejection were fear of the side effects of the vaccine and its possible interaction with rheumatic drugs used by children. CONCLUSION: According to our survey, parents were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves than their children. The success of COVID-19 vaccination programs sources highly on people's willingness to accept the vaccine. It is crucial to vaccinate children for achieving herd immunity and in terms of avoiding vaccine hesitancy.

In this work, we devise techniques to localise infections and decrease infection rates based on a principled analysis of disease transmission paths within human-contact networks (proximity graphs). Experimental results of disease spreading shows that that at low visibility rates contact tracing slows disease spreading. However to stop disease spreading, contact tracing requires both significant visibility (at least 60%) into the proximity graph and the ability to place half of the population under isolation. We find that pro-actively isolating super-links -- key proximity encounters -- has significant benefits: targeted isolation of a fourth of the population based on 35% visibility into the proximity graph prevents an epidemic outbreak. It turns out that isolating super-spreaders is more effective than contact tracing and testing but less effective than targeting super-links. We highlight the important role of topology in epidemic outbreaks. We argue that proactive innoculation of a population by disabling super-links and super-spreaders may have an important complimentary role alongside contact tracing and testing as part of a sophisticated public-health response to epidemic outbreaks.","output":"Unlinking super-linkers: the topology of epidemic response (Covid-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bhutana landlocked country in South Asiahas reported 3381 COVID-19 cases per million population and three deaths until August 2021.

Prediction of the number of persons carrying the live COVID-19 coronavirus (I) in a susceptible population (S) was achieved using two rate constants describing the rate of increase and decrease in the number of infectious persons on a daily basis. The model was verified using observational data for the city of Heidelberg, Germany. Three hypothetical scenarios, having their counterparts in practice were considered, namely Scenario A - No restrictions on the population; Scenario B - Assumption of a 10-fold higher number of infections than observed; Scenario C - Protective measures introduced only for elderly persons. It could be demonstrated using the model that the lockdown measures introduced prevented a major medical emergency and possibly a near catastrophe in the region. It was further demonstrated that the prospective application of the model can facilitate realtime decisions on pandemic management strategy for the population. This is achieved by curve-fitting for the rate constants, determinants for the number of infectious persons. The calculated maximum numbers of infected and infectious persons daily increased in proportion to the number of persons initially susceptible to the infection. After appearance of the first two infections in Heidelberg, the calculated maximum number of persons carrying live virus was 2,291 at Day 102 (Scenario B), 18,936 infectious persons at Day 139 (Scenario C) and 22,535 infectious at Day 142 (Scenario A). In Scenario A, high values would have persisted for 6 months during which a total of 124,301 persons would have been infected in Heidelberg. The model predicted that the virus would have disappeared within 1 year after being first detected. A disease catastrophe of this magnitude would not be expected provided the rate constant () for the rate of increase in the number of infectious persons remained lower than the rate constant () for the fall in number of infectious persons. .","output":"Evaluation of the COVID-19 pandemic using an algorithm based on the Bateman function: Prediction of disease progression using observational data for the city of Heidelberg, Germany ."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Littoral chydorids were sampled with a bottom sledge in Takvatn, a 15 km2 north Norwegian oligotrophic lake with poor vegetation Three out of eight recorded species of chydorids were common, with abundance minima in late summer and maxima in autumn Eurycercus lamellatus (O F Mller, 1776) and Acroperus harpae (Baird, 1835) were monocyclic, whereas Chydorus sphaericus (O F Mller, 1776) was seemingly acyclic Females of E lamellatus appeared in early June and grew to maximum sizes of 2C2 5 mm in early August Parthenogenesis started in late July and two summer generations could be distinguished by size distributions Gamogenesis took place in September Acroperus harpae females appeared in early June and grew to maximum sizes of around 0 7 mm in early August Parthenogenesis started in early July and gamogenesis took place in September and October Parthenogenetic females of C sphaericus appeared already at ice-break and had constant sizes of around 0 4 mm through the entire season Males or ephippial females were not observed The acyclic life history may be an adaptation to the challenging environment of this subarctic lake Summer generations could not be distinguished in the two small-sized species, but both populations reached high abundances in autumn The abundance of E lamellatus increased from August, but then decreased, possibly as a result of fish predation We argue that the present results are typical for large oligotrophic lakes in subarctic Europe","output":"Diversity, abundance, and life histories of littoral chydorids (Cladocera: Chydoridae) in a subarctic European lake"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The main purpose of the research was to examine the differences between adults in the age group 70+ and two other age groups (45-59 and 60-69), concerning their healthy and active lifestyle The death toll of the current COVID-19 pandemic is strongly biased toward the elderly However, some studies of crises suggest that older adults tend to perceive events as less stressful than do younger people Therefore, we examined healthy behavior in populations at risk according to the age cutoff-points used by the Ministry of Health at the time of vaccination, and divided the participants into three age groups (45-59, 60-69, and 70+) following health organizations' recommendations METHODS: Participants were 1202 people, 381 males and 821 females, aged 45-90 A survey comprised of six parts was used: Demographic background, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short version, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - PANAS, the Connor and Davidson Resilience Scale, a questionnaire for measuring depressive moods, and questions regarding weight change, based on the Israeli National Health and Nutrition (MABAT) survey Data were collected in Israel during the first complete lockdown The questionnaire was distributed via e-mail, WhatsApp, Twitter, and Facebook using a snowball sampling method RESULTS: Resilience and negative feelings and depression symptoms were higher in age group 45-59 compared to 70+ year-old participants, and the depression symptoms score was also higher among participants aged 45-59 compared to ages 60-69 Physical activity was associated with higher resilience, fewer depression symptoms, and fewer negative emotions Regarding gender and psychological variables, no differences were found During the time of lockdown, weight change was not prevalent and sleeping hours increased CONCLUSION: In adults at 70+, the physical activity level, physical activity before and during the lockdown, emotions, sleeping hours, and weight change were similar to the other adult groups that were examined (45-59 and 60-69) However, in the older adults groups (70+ and 60-69), resilience and depression symptoms were lower than in the youngest age group","output":"Physical activity, resilience, emotions, moods, and weight control of older adults during the COVID-19 global crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To analyze the impact of housing instability and social risk facts on food insecurity using resource center client information.

It is proposed that virus is normally latent in many elderly brains but reactivates periodically (as in the peripheral nervous system) under certain conditions, for example stress, immunosuppression, and peripheral infection, causing cumulative damage and eventually development of AD. Diverse approaches have provided data that explicitly support, directly or indirectly, these concepts. Several have confirmed HSV1 DNA presence in human brains, and the HSV1-APOE-4 association in AD. Further, studies on HSV1-infected APOE-transgenic mice have shown that APOE-e4 animals display a greater potential for viral damage. Reactivated HSV1 can cause direct and inflammatory damage, probably involving increased formation of beta amyloid (A) and of AD-like tau (P-tau)changes found to occur in HSV1-infected cell cultures. Implicating HSV1 further in AD is the discovery that HSV1 DNA is specifically localized in amyloid plaques in AD. Other relevant, harmful effects of infection include the following: dynamic interactions between HSV1 and amyloid precursor protein (APP), which would affect both viral and APP transport; induction of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in HSV1-infected astrocyte cultures, which has been linked to the likely effects of reactivation of the virus in brain. Several epidemiological studies have shown, using serological data, an association between systemic infections and cognitive decline, with HSV1 particularly implicated. Genetic studies too have linked various pathways in AD with those occurring on HSV1 infection. In relation to the potential usage of antivirals to treat AD patients, acyclovir (ACV) is effective in reducing HSV1-induced AD-like changes in cell cultures, and valacyclovir, the bioactive form of ACV, might be most effective if combined with an antiviral that acts by a different mechanism, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).","output":"Herpes simplex virus type 1 and Alzheimers disease: increasing evidence for a major role of the virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The comprehensive and integrative analysis of RNA-seq data, in different molecular layers from diverse samples, holds promise to address the full-scale complexity of biological systems.

The emergence of SM activity around the ASCO annual meetings has dramatically increased over the past 5 years, with factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic further accelerating use of digital platforms. This growth in SM engagement within the oncology community has previously been presented by totaling the quantity of tweets within a given time frame. Here, we explore the impact of specific trends through impression data. Methods: To evaluate activity trends among certain oncology stakeholders, we utilized an SM analytics platform, Symplur, to conduct a content analysis around ASCO conferences (2016-2020) using hashtags (#ASCOyy) as the search criterion. We focused our analysis on trends in impressions, defined by the theoretical maximum number of Twitter users a given tweet could have directly reached in a follower's timeline. We gathered impressions data to quantitatively assess overall ASCO engagement and evaluate topics of interest, and to discover common ASCO themes and reach within specific stakeholder groups. Results: Our results show the largest increase in impressions was during #ASCO20, despite a plateauing effect seen in the actual number of tweets (Table). The cumulative number of impressions for #ASCO16 was 468.2 million compared with approximately 1.12 billion for #ASCO20. Differentiating this result from the number of tweets related to ASCO, there was stabilization in the absolute number from #ASCO17 onward. When compiling impressions by doctors and by patient advocates, a similar trend emerged, with the most impressions captured during #ASCO20 (Table). Conclusions:As SM use continues to expand in the oncology community, stakeholders have turned to their digital voice to express views and opinions. The impact of impressions versus absolute number of tweets will continue to grow with a stakeholder's follower count, thus building on the digital presence in oncology.","output":"Impact of #ASCO Twitter impressions on the oncology community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, and host cell entry is the first step in the viral life cycle. The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) entry process into susceptible host tissue cells is complex requiring (1) attachment of the virus via the conserved spike (S) protein receptor-binding motif (RBM) to the host cell angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, (2) S protein proteolytic processing, and (3) membrane fusion. Spike protein processing occurs at two cleavage sites, i.e., S1/S2 and S2'. Cleavage at the S1/S2 and S2' sites ultimately gives rise to generation of competent fusion elements important in the merging of the host cell and viral membranes. Following cleavage, shedding of the S1 crown results in significant conformational changes and fusion peptide repositioning for target membrane insertion and fusion. Identification of specific protease involvement has been difficult due to the many cell types used and studied. However, it appears that S protein proteolytic cleavage is dependent on (1) furin and (2) serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 proteases acting in tandem. Although at present not clear, increased SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding motif binding affinity and replication efficiency may in part account for observed differences in infectivity. Cleavage of the ACE2 receptor appears to be yet another layer of complexity in addition to forfeiture and/or alteration of ACE2 function which plays an important role in cardiovascular and immune function.","output":"SARS-CoV-2, Early Entry Events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE We aimed to identify collaborative disaster governance through the demand and supply analysis of resources recognized by nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A 42-question online survey focusing on disaster governance was sent to nurses working in COVID-19 designated hospitals, public health offices, and schools. A total of 630 nurses participated in the survey. Demand and supply analysis was used to identify the specific components of disaster governance during a pandemic situation and analyze priority areas in disaster governance, as reported by nurses. RESULTS Demand and supply analysis showed that supplies procurement, cooperation, education, and environment factors clustered in the high demand and supply quadrant while labor condition, advocacy, emotional support, and workload adjustment factors clustered in the high demand but low supply quadrant, indicating a strong need in those areas of disaster governance among nurses. The nurses practicing at the public health offices and schools showed major components of disaster governance plotted in the second quadrant, indicating weak collaborative disaster governance.

We illustrate how state-run social media employed fandom governance early in the COVID-19 pandemic when the country was convulsed with anxiety. As the state faced a crisis of confidence, state social media responded with a propagandistic display of state efficacy, broadcasting a round-the-clock livestream of a massive emergency hospital construction project. Chinese internet users playfully embellished imagery from the livestream. They unexpectedly transformed the construction vehicles into cute personified memes, with Baby Forklift and Baby Mud Barfer (a cement mixer) among the most popular. In turn, state social media strategically channeled this playful engagement in politically productive directions by resignifying the personified vehicles as celebrity idols. Combining social media studies with cultural and linguistic anthropology, we offer a processual account of the semiotic mediations involved in turning vehicles into memes, memes into idols, and citizens into fans. We show how, by embedding cute memes within modules of fandom management such as celebrity ranking lists, state social media rendered them artificially vulnerable to a fall in status. Fans, in turn, rallied around to protect these cute idols with small but significant acts of digital devotion and care, organizing themselves into fan circles and exhorting each other to vote. In elevating the memes to the status of celebrity idols, state social media thereby created a disposable pantheon of virtual avatars for the state, and consolidated state power by exploiting citizens voluntary response to vulnerability.

About one-third of all proteins of the cellular proteome interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER is a large, dynamic cellular organelle that orchestrates synthesis, folding, and structural maturation of proteins, regulation of lipid metabolism and additionally functions as a calcium store. Recent evidence suggests that both acute and chronic hypercapnia (elevated levels of CO(2)) impair ER function by different mechanisms, leading to adaptive and maladaptive regulation of protein folding and maturation. In order to cope with ER stress, cells activate unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. Initially, during the adaptive phase of ER stress, the UPR mainly functions to restore ER protein-folding homeostasis by decreasing protein synthesis and translation and by activation of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and autophagy. However, if the initial UPR attempts for alleviating ER stress fail, a maladaptive response is triggered. In this review, we discuss the distinct mechanisms by which elevated CO(2) levels affect these molecular pathways in the setting of acute and chronic pulmonary diseases associated with hypercapnia.","output":"Mechanisms of Hypercapnia-Induced Endoplasmic Reticulum Dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fungal diseases have not been taken seriously in public health agendas as well as research priorities, despite of globally causing an estimated two million deaths every year, and the emergence of many troublesome fungal pathogens like Candida auris, azole resistant Aspergillus fumigatus, terbinafine and azole resistant dermatophytes, and zoonotic sporotrichosis in humans.

METHODS Adult male Wistar rats (120  10 g) were classified as control received the vehicle, C. aronia (200 mg/kg), and C. aronia (2,000 mg/kg)-treated rats. After treatments for consecutive 7 days, hematological and molecular experiments were conducted to detect alterations in platelet aggregation, thromboxane B2 (THXB2) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content; protein levels of P2Y12, p-Akt, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated-phosphoprotein (p-VASP), nuclear factor B (NF-B), P-selectin, and etc. in platelets were determined by Western blot; mRNA expressions of P2Y12 and some inflammatory markers were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS At a concentration of 200 mg/kg, C. aronia inhibited platelet aggregation through multiple interconnected mechanisms including downregulation P2Y12 synthesis and expression, stimulating intracellular cAMP levels and protein levels of p-VASP, inhibiting platelets THXB2 release and protein levels of P-selectin. Also, it inhibited platelets level of ROS and of NF-B, a major signaling pathway that stimulates the expression of P2Y12 and THXA2 synthesis. Opposite findings were seen in platelets of rats received C. aronia at a concentration of 2,000 mg/kg. Interestingly, co-administration of N-acetylcysteine prevented all hematological and molecular alterations exerted by the high dose of the extract and inhibited platelet aggregation. CONCLUSION Oral administration of C. aronia at low dose inhibits platelet aggregation by reducing THXB2 release, expression of P-selectin and activating cAMP and Akt signaling through two major mechanisms including downregulation of P2Y12 and inhibition of ROS-induced activation of NF-B, an effect that is observed to be in the opposite direction with its high dose.","output":"Opposite Modulatory Effects of Crataegus aronia Aqueous Extract on Platelet Aggregation in Rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the global pandemic of COVID-19, there is an urgent need to utilize existing technologies to their full potential.

Different techniques have been used to treat the thoracic anomaly, including the positioning of an implant, fat transfer or latissimus dorsi transposition, but in some cases these techniques are not feasible resulting in a poor reconstruction. METHODS We present our experience in correction of the chest anomaly of PS in a teenage population by using a pedicled laparoscopically harvested omental flap (LOF) to cover a pectoral or breast prosthesis. Procedures were performed by a surgical team which included experienced plastic surgeons and general paediatric surgeons. Preoperative endocrinological and psychological evaluation helped to determine the best timing for the correction.

From academic care centres, community hospitals, to clinics across the country, pathology data are a crucial component of patient care. But for much of the modern era, pathology and laboratory medicine have been absent from health policy conversations. Though select members in the field have advocated for an enhanced presence of these specialists in policy conversations, little work has been done to thoroughly evaluate the moral and ethical obligations of the pathologist and the role they play in healthcare justice and access to care. In order to make any substantive improvements in access to care, pathology and laboratory medicine must have a seat at the table. Specifically, pathologists and laboratorians can assist in bringing about change through improving clinician test choice, continuing laboratory improvement programmes, promoting just advanced diagnostic distribution, triage testing and be good stewards of healthcare dollars, and recruiting a more robust laboratory workforce. In order to get to that point, much work has to be done in pathology education and the laboratory personnel training pipeline but there also needs to be adjustments at the system level to better involve this invaluable group of specialists in these policy conversations.","output":"Critical role of pathology and laboratory medicine in the conversation surrounding access to healthcare."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The older population is one of the most vulnerable to experience adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Exploring different clinical features that may act as detrimental to this population's survival is pivotal for recognizing the highest risk individuals for poor outcome. We thus aimed to characterize the clinical differences between 60-day survivors and non-survivors, as well as analyze variables influencing survival in the first older adults hospitalized in Poznan, Poland, with COVID-19. Symptoms, comorbidities, complications, laboratory results, and functional capacity regarding the first 50 older patients (&#8805;60 years) hospitalized due to COVID-19 were retrospectively studied. Functional status before admission (dependent/independent) was determined based on medical history. The 60-day survivors (n = 30/50) and non-survivors (n = 20/50) were compared across clinical parameters. The patients had a mean age of 74.8  9.4 years. Overall, 20/50 patients died during hospitalization, with no further fatal outcomes reported during the 60-day period. The non-survivors were on average older (78.3  9.7 years), more commonly experienced concurrent heart disease (75%), and displayed functional dependence (65%) (p < 0.05). When assessing the variables influencing survival (age, heart disease, and functional dependence), using a multivariate proportional hazards regression, functional dependence (requiring assistance in core activities of daily living) was the main factor affecting 60-day survival (HR, 3.34; 95% CI: 1.29-8.63; p = 0.01). In our study, functional dependence was the most important prognostic factor associated with mortality. Elderly with COVID-19 who required assistance in core activities of daily living prior to hospitalization had a three times increased risk to experience mortality, as compared to those with complete independence. Exploring geriatric approaches, such as assessment of functional capacity, may assist in constructing comprehensive survival prognosis in the elderly COVID-19 population.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Survival Analysis in a Small Sample of Older COVID-19 Patients with Defined 60-Day Outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To determine the presence of SARS-COV 2 viruses in tears and conjunctival secretions of patients with diagnosed COVID-19.

The results were collected and subjected to content analysis. RESULTS: From the point of view of traditional Iranian physicians, disease prevention is primarily possible by avoiding pathogenic factors. As a secondary solution, reducing one's susceptibility to the disease is crucial; this can be achieved through cleansing the body and strengthening the mood, reducing food intake, decreasing the internal humidity, disinfecting the house with herbal fumigation, and making use of pleasant aromas. Some of these recommendations are reaffirmed by modern research. CONCLUSION: Persian medicine techniques may be preventive during respiratory, influenza-like disease pandemics.

It is hypothesized that the dynamic capability to innovate reinforces the dynamic capability to adapt and to recover in highly dynamic and vulnerable environments during the pandemic. This allows LSPs to successfully create new services and respond to the changing market circumstances in terms of logistics service quality (LSQ) and firm performance. Data were collected from 83 LSPs and 30 in-house logistics departments via an online survey. The study determined the general strength and direction of the relationships between latent variables. A correlation analysis was utilized to establish statistical significance of the results.Findings>In this study, a range of innovation-oriented capabilities for achieving more dynamic resilience were bundled in a conceptual framework and were found to be statistically significant for LSQ and firm performance. They are the capability to distribute new knowledge, to train employees effectively, to develop cross-functional collaboration within the firm, to develop inter-firm relationships with business partners on a long-term basis as well as to learn from rivals, and to pursue a win-win relationship with them.Research limitations/implications>The results of the study do not imply that the identified capabilities are the only ones relevant to increasing dynamic resilience during the pandemic. In October 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was at different stages in different countries, so that the level to which firms were affected varied, and although the data were collected during one month only, due to the high dynamics of the pandemic, data were collected during different stages of disruptions, even among respondents in the same country. This study was set in the context of COVID-19, and it could not be proved whether the conceptual framework is generalizable to other crises or particular industries, but it would be worthwhile to examine this in the future. Finally, it was not tested whether LSQ mediates the relationship between innovative capabilities and firm performance during the pandemic.Practical implications>The results help managers with regard to their strategic and operational decisions in relation with COVID-19. These findings are useful for executives and logistics managers to improve these capabilities to gain a competitive advantage during pandemic and to find their strengths and weaknesses to develop critical capabilities for situations with a high turbulence and dynamic in their environment, and therefore provide a path for improvement.Originality/value>This paper operationalizes a multi-theoretical conceptual framework in the context of logistics management (LM) and supply chain management (SCM).

The use of 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate and superoxide dismutase as scavengers for in situ production of nitric oxide and superoxide radical anion respectively, revealed that the mechanisms of formation of N-nitroso-CIP likely involved a nitrosation pathway through the formation of peroxynitrite and another one through codenitrification processes, even though the former one appeared to be prevalent.

Many recognition approaches based on convolutional neural networks have been proposed for COVID-19 chest X-ray images. However, only a few of them make good use of the potential inter- and intra-relationships of feature maps. Considering the limitation mentioned above, this paper proposes an attention-based convolutional neural network, called PCXRNet, for diagnosis of pneumonia using chest X-ray images. To utilize the information from the channels of the feature maps, we added a novel condense attention module (CDSE) that comprised of two steps: condensation step and squeeze-excitation step. Unlike traditional channel attention modules, CDSE first downsamples the feature map channel by channel to condense the information, followed by the squeeze-excitation step, in which the channel weights are calculated. To make the model pay more attention to informative spatial parts in every feature map, we proposed a multi-convolution spatial attention module (MCSA). It reduces the number of parameters and introduces more nonlinearity. The CDSE and MCSA complement each other in series to tackle the problem of redundancy in feature maps and provide useful information from and between feature maps. We used the ChestXRay2017 dataset to explore the internal structure of PCXRNet, and the proposed network was applied to COVID-19 diagnosis. Additional experiments were conducted on a tuberculosis dataset to verify the effectiveness of PCXRNet. As a result, the network achieves an accuracy of 94.619%, recall of 94.753%, precision of 95.286%, and F1-score of 94.996% on the COVID-19 dataset.","output":"PCXRNet: Pneumonia diagnosis from Chest X-Ray Images using Condense attention block and Multiconvolution attention block"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by global spread of several lineages with evidence for increased transmissibility. Russia is among the countries with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, making it a potential hotspot for emergence of novel variants. Here, we show that among the globally significant variants of concern, B.1.1.7 (501Y.V1), B.1.351 (501Y.V2) or P.1 (501Y.V3), none have been sampled in Russia before January 2021. Instead, since summer 2020, the epidemic in Russia has been characterized by the spread of two lineages that are rare elsewhere: B.1.1.317 and a sublineage of B.1.1 including B.1.1.397 (hereafter, B.1.1.397+). In February-March 2021, these lineages reached frequencies of 26.9% (95% C.I.: 23.1%-31.1%) and 32.8% (95% C.I.28.6%-37.2%) respectively in Russia. Their frequency has increased in different parts of Russia. Together with the fact that these lineages carry several spike mutations of interest, this suggests that B.1.1.317 and B.1.1.397+ may be more transmissible than the previously predominant B.1.1, although there is no direct data on change in transmissibility. Comparison of frequency dynamics of lineages carrying subsets of characteristic mutations of B.1.1.317 and B.1.1.397+ suggests that, if indeed some of these mutations affect transmissibility, the transmission advantage of B.1.1.317 may be conferred by the (S:D138Y+S:S477N+S:A845S) combination; while the advantage of B.1.1.397+ may be conferred by the S:M153T change. On top of these lineages, in January 2021, B.1.1.7 emerged in Russia, reaching the frequency of 17.4% (95% C.I.: 12.0%-24.4%) in March 2021. Additionally, we identify three novel distinct lineages, AT.1, and two lineages prospectively named B.1.1.v1 and B.1.1.v2, that have started to spread, together reaching the frequency of 11.8% (95% C.I.: 7.5%-18.1%) in March 2021. These lineages carry combinations of several notable mutations, including the S:E484K mutation of concern, deletions at a recurrent deletion region of the spike glycoprotein (S:{Delta}140-142, S:{Delta}144 or S:{Delta}136-144), and nsp6:{Delta}106-108 (also known as ORF1a:{Delta}3675-3677). Community-based PCR testing indicates that these variants have continued to spread in April 2021, with the frequency of B.1.1.7 reaching 21.7% (95% C.I.: 12.3%-35.6%), and the joint frequency of B.1.1.v1 and B.1.1.v2, 15.2% (95% C.I.: 7.6%-28.2%).

Peripheral blood-derived macrophages were stimulated with poly I:C, simulating an RNA virus, or IFN, a cytokine at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity. Not only did B2-derived peripheral monocytes differentiate into macrophages more readily than the B19 monocytes, but as determined by NO production, macrophages from B2 and B2 on B19 genetic background chicks were also significantly more responsive to either stimulant. In conclusion, the correlation with resistance to illness following viral infection may be directly linked to a more vigorous innate immune response.","output":"Dramatic differences in the response of macrophages from B2 and B19 MHC-defined haplotypes to interferon gamma and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid stimulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In maxillofacial surgery, there are periodic cases of long-lasting chronic inflammation of the soft tissues without the positive effect of the conservative treatment.

It has been utilized to discriminate patients at risk of postoperative complications and predict the postoperative outcome of major surgeries. However, this index remains limited for breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The research explores the clinical and prognostic significance of NRI in breast cancer patients. This study included 785 breast cancer patients (477 cases received NACT and 308 cases did not) were enrolled in this retrospective study. The optimal NRI cutoff value was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, then reclassified as low NRI group (<112) and high NRI group (112). The results demonstrated that NRI independently predicted survival on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) by univariate and multivariate Cox regression survival analyses [P = 0.019, hazard ratio (HR): 1.521, 95% CI: 1.071C2.161 and P = 0.004, HR: 1.415, 95% CI: 1.119C1.789; and P = 0.026, HR:1.500, 95% CI: 1.051C2.143 and P < 0.001, HR: 1.547, 95% CI: 1.221C1.959]. According to the optimal cutoff value of NRI, the high NRI value patients had longer mean DFS and OS time in contrast to those with low NRI value patients (63.47 vs. 40.50 months; 71.50 vs. 56.39 months). Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the high NRI score patients had significantly longer mean DFS and OS time than those with low NRI score patients in early-stage breast cancer ((2) = 9.0510, P = 0.0026 and (2) = 9.2140, P = 0.0024) and advanced breast cancer ((2) = 6.2500, P = 0.0124 and (2) = 5.8880, P = 0.0152). The mean DFS and OS values in patients with high NRI scores were significantly longer in contrast to those with low NRI scores in different molecular subtypes. The common toxicities after NACT were hematologic and gastrointestinal reactions, and the NRI had no statistically significant effects on toxicities, except in nausea ((2) = 9.2413, P = 0.0024), mouth ulcers ((2) = 4.8133, P = 0.0282), anemia ((2) = 8.5441, P = 0.0140), and leukopenia ((2) = 11.0951, P = 0.0039).

The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on normal pituitary glands function or pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) have not yet been elucidated. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the impairment of pituitary glands and the development of PitNETs. Methods: : PitNETs tissues were obtained from 114 patients, and normal pituitary gland tissues were obtained from the autopsy. The mRNA levels of ACE2 and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1) were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for ACE2 in 69 PitNETs and 3 normal pituitary glands. The primary tumor cells and pituitary cell lines (MMQ, GH3 and AtT-20/D16v-F2) were treated with diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an ACE2 agonist, with various dose regimens. The pituitary hormones between 43 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with 45 healthy controls. Results: : Pituitary glands and the majority of PitNET tissues showed low/negative ACE2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, while AGTR1 showed high expression in normal pituitary and corticotroph adenomas. ACE2 agonist increased the secretion of ACTH in AtT-20/D16v-F2 cells through downregulating AGTR1. The level of serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients as compared to normal controls (p<0.001), but was dramatically decreased in critical cases as compared to non-critical patients (p=0.003).

Using contact tracing, the secondary attack rate in households is estimated at 18-20%, yet no studies have examined COVID-19 clustering within households, an important measure to inform testing and prevention. We sought to quantify and characterize household clustering of COVID-19 cases in Fulton County, Georgia. METHODS: We used state surveillance data to identify all PCR- or antigen-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Fulton County. Clustered cases were defined as cases with matching street address, including unit number. Communal places (e.g., nursing homes, correctional facilities) were excluded, as were apartments missing unit number. Household clusters were defined as 2 COVID-19 cases at the same residential address with positive sample collection dates within 14 days of one another. We described proportion of COVID-19 cases that were clustered, stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity over time. RESULTS: There were 60,614 COVID-19 cases with available address reported in Fulton County during 6/1/20C4/30/21. Of these, 25,149 (41.6%) had an address that matched at least one other case; 20,793 (34.3%) were from 8,582 household clusters with positive sample collection dates within 14 days (Fig 1). Majority of clusters had 2 individuals (N=6119, 71%), though some had 6 individuals (N=79, 0.9%). Clustering increased through January 2021 (Fig 2). Children were more likely to be in household clusters (Fig 4) and 15% of clusters had a child as first diagnosed case with increases since January 2021 (Fig 3). Consistently higher clustering was observed among Hispanic persons, with rising clustering among Asian persons (Fig 5). [Image: see text] Figure 1.

The higher proportion of children in household clusters likely reflects higher probability of living in a home with an adult caregiver. Higher household clustering among Hispanic and Asian persons, regardless of age, may reflect larger households (supported by census data) or increased exposures outside the house.

In this paper, we present a decision support framework for optimizing multiple aspects of vaccine distribution across a multi-tier cold chain network. We propose two multi-period optimization formulations within this framework: first to minimize inventory, ordering, transportation, personnel and shortage costs associated with a single vaccine;the second being an extension of the first for the case when multiple vaccines with differing efficacies and costs are available for the same disease. Vaccine transportation and administration lead times are also incorporated within the models. We use the case of the Indian state of Bihar and COVID-19 vaccines to illustrate the implementation of the framework. We present computational experiments to demonstrate: (a) the organization of the model outputs;(b) how the models can be used to assess the impact of storage capacities at the cold chain points, transportation vehicle capacities, and manufacturer capacities on the optimal vaccine distribution pattern;and (c) the impact of vaccine efficacies and associated costs such as ordering and transportation costs on the vaccine selection decision informed by the model. We then consider the computational expense of the framework for realistic problem instances, and suggest multiple preprocessing techniques to reduce their computational burden.

PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the course and the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection among children with asthma and determine the risk factors for the decline in lung function tests (LFTs). METHODS: In this retrospective study, asthmatic children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were compared with a random control group of asthmatic patients without COVID-19. In addition, the clinical course and the effect on LFTs of COVID-19 among children with asthma were also evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine patients who had COVID-19, and 792 who did not were included in the study. Fever, fatigue, and cough were the most frequent symptoms during COVID-19. Regarding the severity of COVID-19, 163 patients (87.6%) had a mild clinical condition, 13 (7%) had moderate disease, 1 (0.5%) had severe disease, and 2 had (1.1%) critically ill disease. Two patients were diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), one patient suffered from pneumothorax. LFTs of the patients before and after COVID-19 infection were analyzed; no significant differences were found in FEV1 % (91.7% vs. 90.9%, p = 0.513), FVC% (89.8% vs. 90.8%, p = 0.502) and FEV1 /FVC (103.1% vs. 100.6%, p = 0.056), while FEF25%-75% values (107.6% vs. 98.4%, p < 0.001) were significantly lower after the COVID-19 infection. Obesity (odds ratio [OR]: 3.785, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.152-12.429, p = 0.028] and having a family history of atopy (OR: 3.359, 95% CI: 1.168-9.657, p = 0.025] were found to be the independent risk factors for 25% decrease in FEF25-75 after COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection leads to dysfunction of the small airways in asthmatic children and obesity is an independent risk factor for a 25% decrease in FEF25-75.

Seventy-eight samples were positive for coronaviruses (15.2%), comprising 68 alphacoronaviruses (13.3%) and 10 betacoronaviruses (2.0%). The positive rates tended to increase during the awakening (April) period. Notably, betacoronaviruses were only found in the site where Rhinolophus ferrumequinum was the major species of bats, and were related to SARS- and MERS-related CoVs identified in China and South Korea, respectively. No betacoronaviruses were closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in this study. Alphacoronaviruses were detected in the sites where Hypsugo alaschanicus, Miniopterus fuliginosus, Miniopterus schreibersii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Myotis bombinus, Myotis macrodactylus and Myotis petax were found to be the major bat species. Furthermore, alphacoronaviruses had higher genetic diversity than betacoronaviruses and had a wider distribution in Korea. Considering that different bat species are co-roosting in crowded conditions in the same habitat, the diverse coronaviruses in Korean bats are likely to undergo cross-species transmission events due to the richness in host species.

Single- and multiphase CTA collateral scoring systems have been described but are subjective and require training. We aimed to test whether the CTP-derived hypoperfusion intensity ratio is associated with CTA collateral status and whether a threshold hypoperfusion intensity ratio exists that predicts poor CTA collaterals. MATERIALS AND METHODS Imaging and clinical data of consecutive patients with large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke were retrospectively reviewed. Single-phase CTA and multiphase CTA scoring were performed by 2 blinded neuroradiologists using the Tan, Maas, and Calgary/Menon methods. CTP was processed using RApid processing of PerfusIon and Diffusion software (RAPID). Hypoperfusion intensity ratio = ratio of brain volume with time-to-maximum >10 seconds over time-to-maximum >6-second volume. Correlation between the hypoperfusion intensity ratio and CTA collateral scores was calculated using the Pearson correlation. The optimal threshold of the hypoperfusion intensity ratio for predicting poor collaterals was determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS Fifty-two patients with large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke were included. Multiphase CTA collateral scoring showed better interrater agreement ( = 0.813) than single-phase CTA (Tan,  = 0.587; Maas,  = 0.273). The hypoperfusion intensity ratio correlated with CTA collateral scores (multiphase CTA: r = -0.55; 95% CI, -0.67 to -0.40; P  .001). The optimal threshold for predicting poor multiphase CTA collateral status was a hypoperfusion intensity ratio of >0.45 (sensitivity = 78%; specificity = 76%; area under the curve = 0.86). Patients with high hypoperfusion intensity ratio/poor collateral status had lower ASPECTS/larger infarcts, higher NIHSS scores, and larger hypoperfused volumes. CONCLUSIONS The hypoperfusion intensity ratio is associated with CTA collateral status in patients with large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke. The hypoperfusion intensity ratio is an automated and quantitative alternative to CTA collateral scoring methods for both clinical and future stroke trial settings.","output":"Hypoperfusion Intensity Ratio Correlates with CTA Collateral Status in Large-Vessel Occlusion Acute Ischemic Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 can involve several organs and systems, often with indirect and poorly clarified mechanisms.

Impacts on the mental health conditions and the associated predictors relating to adults in Pakistan, the fifth most populous country in the world, during the COVID-19 remain understudied. Our aim was to investigate distress, anxiety, and overall mental health and their associated predictors among Pakistani adults in this pandemic. We specifically examine mental health issues based on the distance from the epicenter, (a predictor that has revealed opposing evidence in other countries) based on the theories of typhoon eye effect and ripple effect. The sample consisted of 601 adults who were surveyed online about 2.5 months into the outbreak across Pakistan with varying distances from the epicenter of COVID-19 of Karachi. RESULTS: The results showed that 9.2 and 19.0% of the participants surpassed the cut-off criteria for distress and anxiety disorders, respectively. Overall, the distance from the epicenter positively predicted the mental health of adults in Pakistan, and family size negatively moderated this effect. The distance from the epicenter negatively predicted distress and anxiety disorders for adults in large families, which are quite common in Pakistan. CONCLUSION: The evidence of the study interestingly finds that the prediction of the mental health of people by their distance from the epicenter depends on family size. The evidence of this study can help to provide initial indicators for mental health care providers to screen vulnerable groups in Pakistan, a populous country that continues struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Typhoon eye effect versus ripple effect: the role of family size on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several countries around the world have faced an important obesity challenge for the past four decades as the result of an obesogenic environment. This disease has a multifactorial origin and it is associated with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, metabolic syndrome, cancer, and dyslipidemia. With regard to dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia is a well-known activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome, triggering adipokines and cytokines secretion which in addition induce a systemic inflammatory state that provides an adequate scenario for infections, particularly those mediated by viruses such as HIV, H1N1 influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and it is responsible for the pandemic that we are currently living. COVID-19 causes an aggressive immune response known as cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm that causes multiorgan failure and in most cases leads to death. In the present work, we aimed to review the molecular mechanisms by which obesity-associated systemic inflammation could cause a more severe clinical presentation of COVID-19.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among students and employees of two higher education institutions in Lahore, Pakistan, namely the University of Lahore and the Gulab Devi Educational Complex. Participants were recruited using a convenient sampling method. A validated 45-item, self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Total possible scores were 0C14 for knowledge (scores < 7, 7C10 and > 10 were considered to indicate poor, moderate and good knowledge, respectively); 0C7 for attitude (scores > 5 were considered to indicate a good attitude); and 0C18 for COVID-19 preventative practices (scores > 12 were considered to indicate good preventative practices). RESULTS: Of the 417 enrolled participants, 416 reported that they were aware of COVID-19 and social media was the major source of their information. Mean scores were 10.12  2.20 for knowledge (good, moderate and poor knowledge in 50.2%, 42.8% and 7.0% of participants, respectively); 5.74  1.28 for attitude (65.4% of individuals had a positive attitude); and 11.04  3.34 for COVID-19 preventative practices (only 36.5% of participants had good preventive practices).

The improvement of primary care efficiency and productivity should be a priority, to ensure that future investments in the medical workforce can cope with the increasingly large and complex demand for care. OBJECTIVES: This paper presents a systematic literature review of studies that define or measure efficiency in primary care in high-income settings. The review of the existing definitions of primary care efficiency and their limitations will inform future research on the measurement of efficiency in primary care in England and its determinants. METHODS: Literature searches were performed on Embase, Medline, and EconLit in January 2020. The records that passed the screening were reviewed in full text, and data on the study settings, the efficiency definition, and the efficiency analysis were extracted. RESULTS: Of the 2590 non-duplicate records retrieved from the searches, 38 papers were included in the analysis. The volume of the literature on primary care efficiency has evolved significantly from the 1980s, with the majority of the published studies focussing on European health systems. The setting most often analysed was primary care centres. Output was usually expressed using measures of primary care utilisation, with or without quality adjustments. Reference to the health outcomes achieved was, however, limited. Inputs were more commonly expressed in labour terms, while the exogenous variables related either to the characteristics of the patient population or the organisation of primary care. While all studies included an analysis of technical efficiency, consideration of allocative or cost efficiency or the determinants of productivity (e.g. technological change, skill mix) was rare. CONCLUSIONS: The main limitations that future research on primary care efficiency should address relate to the definition of output. Current approaches to measure the impact on health and the multiple dimensions of output are not sufficient to represent the valued output of primary care. In light of the recent changes in the model of primary care delivery in England, future research should also investigate the impact of technological change on productivity and the scope for substitution across staff roles.

However, drug treatments are also necessary. Antivirals are the most frequently considered treatments. However, strategies targeting mechanisms involved in disease aggravation may also be effective. A major role of the tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the pathophysiology and severity of COVID-19 has been suggested. The main link between RAS and COVID-19 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a central RAS component and the primary binding site for SARS-CoV-2 that facilitates the virus entry into host cells. An initial suggestion that the susceptibility to infection and disease severity may be enhanced by angiotensin type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) because they increase ACE2 levels, led to the consideration of discontinuing treatments in thousands of patients. More recent experimental and clinical data indicate that ACEIs and, particularly, ARBs can be beneficial for COVID-19 outcome, both by reducing inflammatory responses and by triggering mechanisms (such as ADAM17 inhibition) counteracting viral entry. Strategies directly activating RAS anti-inflammatory components such as soluble ACE2, Angiotensin 1-7 analogues, and Mas or AT2 receptor agonists may also be beneficial. However, while ACEIs and ARBs are cheap and widely used, the second type of strategies are currently under study.","output":"Drugs Modulating Renin-Angiotensin System in COVID-19 Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid 19 epidemic has modified the way that plastic surgeons can treat their patients.

Thus, there is question of supplementation with vitamins and micronutrients, especially in reproductive-aged women planning pregnancy, due to socio-economic aspects, geographical latitude, dietary habits, and increased needs associated with the epidemiological situation. The deficiency of certain micronutrients in the diet has been found to impair the chemical, structural and regulatory processes in the body, which can negatively affect the state of the immune system. Certain associations have been identified between sufficiency of micronutrients, the severity of the course and development of complications of COVID-19. Severe course of infection is associated with severe deficiency of vitamin D (<10 ng/ml). Vitamin D contributes to changing the macrophage phenotype from pro-inflammatory Th1 to anti-inflammatory Th2, which may reduce the risk of a cytokine storm. There was a statistically significant decrease in the level of inflammatory markers, including ferritin and D-dimer, a decrease in the risks of multiple organ failure, a tendency to reduce the need for ventilation, vascular damage in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome with parenteral use of high doses of ascorbic acid. The experimental studies have shown that cations Zn2+ inhibit the activity of SARS-coronavirus RNA polymerase by reducing its replication;this fact opens up prospects for the use of Zn2+ as an antiviral agent in the treatment of COVID-19. Vitamin E and selenium have effects that reduce the risk of infection: they increase the number of T cells, enhance the responses of mitogenic lymphocytes, increase the secretion of IL-2 cytokines, and stimulate the activity of natural killer cells. The causative agent influences beta-carotene which accelerates the immune response of the body by increasing the activity of macrophages. Conclusion. The strategies for the prevention of COVID-19 provide for the intake of vitamin and mineral complexes containing vitamins D, A, E, zinc, selenium. The optimal intake of micronutrients largely determines the protection of a person from the effects of negative environmental factors including biological agents, namely microbes and viruses. ?

METHODS In an international clinical trial, we randomly assigned patients with very severe ARDS, as indicated by one of three criteria - a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 50 mm Hg for more than 3 hours; a Pao2:Fio2 of less than 80 mm Hg for more than 6 hours; or an arterial blood pH of less than 7.25 with a partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide of at least 60 mm Hg for more than 6 hours - to receive immediate venovenous ECMO (ECMO group) or continued conventional treatment (control group). Crossover to ECMO was possible for patients in the control group who had refractory hypoxemia. The primary end point was mortality at 60 days. RESULTS At 60 days, 44 of 124 patients (35%) in the ECMO group and 57 of 125 (46%) in the control group had died (relative risk, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 1.04; P=0.09). Crossover to ECMO occurred a mean (SD) of 6.59.7 days after randomization in 35 patients (28%) in the control group, with 20 of these patients (57%) dying. The frequency of complications did not differ significantly between groups, except that there were more bleeding events leading to transfusion in the ECMO group than in the control group (in 46% vs. 28% of patients; absolute risk difference, 18 percentage points; 95% CI, 6 to 30) as well as more cases of severe thrombocytopenia (in 27% vs. 16%; absolute risk difference, 11 percentage points; 95% CI, 0 to 21) and fewer cases of ischemic stroke (in no patients vs. 5%; absolute risk difference, -5 percentage points; 95% CI, -10 to -2).

Prioritizing vaccine rollout, and achievement of herd immunity depend on SARS-CoV-2 transmission reduction. The vaccine's effect on infectivity is thus a critical priority. METHODS: Among all 9650 HCW of a large tertiary medical center in Israel, we calculated the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR cases with asymptomatic presentation, tested following known or presumed exposure and the infectious subset (N-gene-Ct-value<30) of these. Additionally, infection incidence rates were calculated for symptomatic cases and infectious (Ct<30) cases. Vaccine effectiveness within three months of vaccine rollout was measured as one minus the relative risk or rate ratio, respectively. To further assess infectiousness, we compared the mean Ct-value and the proportion of infections with a positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen test of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. The correlation between IgG levels within the week before detection and Ct level was assessed. FINDINGS: Reduced prevalence among fully vaccinated HCW was observed for (i) infections detected due to exposure, with asymptomatic presentation (VE(i)=65.1%, 95%CI 45-79%), (ii) the presumed infectious (Ct<30) subset of these (VE(ii)=69.6%, 95%CI 43-84%) (iii) never-symptomatic infections (VE(iii)=72.3%, 95%CI 48-86%), and (iv) the presumed infectious (Ct<30) subset (VE(iv)=83.0%, 95%CI 51-94%). Incidence of (v) symptomatic and (vi) symptomatic-infectious cases was significantly lower among fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals (VE(v)= 89.7%, 95%CI 84-94%, VE(vi)=88.1%, 95%CI 80-95%). The mean Ct-value was significantly higher in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated (27.31.2 vs. 22.21.0, p<0.001) and the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests was also significantly lower among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated PCR-positive HCW (80% vs. 31%, p<0.001). Lower infectivity was correlated with higher IgG concentrations (R=0.36, p=0.01).

However, some children will develop persistent or late wheezing. OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that early and late postbronchiolitis wheezing are determined by distinct clinical, immunologic, and genetic variables. METHODS A cohort of 101 children hospitalized for RSV LRTI was prospectively followed for 6 years. During RSV LRTI, cytokine studies were performed and genetic polymorphisms were determined. Parents performed daily log registration of respiratory symptoms during the first 3 years of follow-up and again at age 6 years during the winter season. RESULTS Distinctive associations for early and late postbronchiolitis wheezing were found. We previously showed that airflow limitation during RSV LRTI as well as convalescent monocyte IL-10 production are associated with early wheezing. These variables were not associated with late wheezing. On the other hand, atopic family history was not associated with early wheezing, but it was associated with late wheezing. Most importantly, the IL-13 Gln allele was associated with late wheezing (odds ratio 3.27, 95% confidence interval 1.32-8.06), but it was not associated with early wheezing. CONCLUSION This study revealed distinct clinical, immunologic, and genetic determinants of early and late wheezing after RSV LRTI, indicating distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. We conclude that late wheezing at age 6 years, but not early postbronchiolitis wheezing, is an asthmatic phenomenon and genetically related to a functional IL-13 polymorphism.

While these therapies hold great promise, they face the same limitation as other kinase inhibitors, the emergence of resistant mechanisms. The biology behind KRAS G12C inhibitor resistance has been investigated with genome-wide approaches, in the hopes of finding a way to improve the efficacy of these new molecules. Here, we review the biology of KRAS G12C, mechanisms of drug resistance and potential approaches to overcome the later. ABSTRACT: Lung cancer represents the most common form of cancer, accounting for 1.8 million deaths globally in 2020. Over the last decade the treatment for advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer have dramatically improved largely thanks to the emergence of two therapeutic breakthroughs: the discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeting of oncogenic driver alterations. While these therapies hold great promise, they face the same limitation as other inhibitors: the emergence of resistant mechanisms. One such alteration in non-small cell lung cancer is the Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (KRAS) oncogene. KRAS mutations are the most common oncogenic driver in NSCLC, representing roughly 20C25% of cases. The mutation is almost exclusively detected in adenocarcinoma and is found among smokers 90% of the time. Along with the development of new drugs that have been showing promising activity, resistance mechanisms have begun to be clarified. The aim of this review is to unwrap the biology of KRAS in NSCLC with a specific focus on primary and secondary resistance mechanisms and their possible clinical implications.","output":"KRAS G12C Mutations in NSCLC: From Target to Resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ethanol is a widely produced fuel, as well as a fuel additive Its price is closely related to the price of gasoline, its major substitute This paper focuses on the impacts of the related variables on regional ethanol prices Additionally, the length of the price dataset made it possible to isolate the impacts of COVID-19 on the ethanol prices Using multiple regression and Confirmatory Factor Analyses, we found no significant correlation between the European and US ethanol prices because the major influencing factors were regionally different In the case of the European ethanol markets, the positive factors were wheat, maize, and potassium chloride prices, while the European sugar and diammonium phosphate prices were negative In the US markets, gasoline, sugar, and most of the artificial fertilizer prices were positive, while wheat prices were negative Based on factor analysis, artificial fertilizers and maize factors proved to be important to the European markets, while US ethanol prices were driven by the crude oil-gasoline and raw materials factors The COVID variable showed no significant connection with the EU prices, but negatively affected the US ethanol prices This is explained by the different market characteristics, as the US is not only the major consumer, but also the major producer of the different oil products Therefore, COVID-19 had a double effect on their oil and ethanol markets","output":"The Major Driving Forces of the EU and US Ethanol Markets with Special Attention Paid to the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new 1-step method for synthesizing glass-ceramic composites consisting of rare earth phosphates (REPO4) dispersed in borosilicate glass (BG) is reported herein as an alternative to the 2-step approach that is traditionally used. The effect of annealing time and annealing temperature on the formation of the 1-step glass-ceramic composites was investigated. Backscattered electron images and energy dispersive X-ray maps were collected to observe the morphology and chemical distribution in the glass-ceramic composites. X-ray diffraction was used to study the long-range order and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy was used to study the local environment of La, Y, P and Si. All analyses showed glass-ceramic composites made by the 1 and 2-step methods were similar to each other except for the Si L2,3-edge XANES spectra, which showed a slight change between the glass-ceramic composite materials made by the different synthesis methods. Xenotime-type phosphates (YPO4) were observed to be more soluble in the borosilicate glass than the monazite-type phosphates (LaPO4). This was attributed to the difference in the field strength of the rare-earth ions as a result of the difference in the ionic radii. Glass-ceramic composites made by the 1-step method were shown to form in 1 day at 1100 C and in 3 days at 1000 C without a significant change in glass or ceramic composition compared to the 1-step composite synthesized at 1100 C for 3 days.","output":"A one-step synthesis of rare-earth phosphate-borosilicate glass composites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a large, well-described representative Viennese cohort after an early governmental lockdown with respect to the occurrence of symptoms and household transmission.

The optimum management of kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 remains uncertain. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a multicenter cohort study of kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection in Saudi Arabia. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to study predictors of graft and patient outcomes at 28 days after coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis. RESULTS We included 130 kidney transplant recipients, with a mean age of 48.7(14.4) years. Fifty-nine patients were managed at home with daily follow-up utilizing a dedicated clinic, while 71 (54.6%) required hospital admission. Acute kidney injury occurred in 35 (26.9%) patients. Secondary infections occurred in 38 (29.2%) patients. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing was carried out in 84 patients, of whom 70 tested positive for IgG and/or IgM. Fourteen patients died (10.8%). A multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that age, creatinine at presentation, acute kidney injury, and use of azithromycin were significantly associated with worse patient survival. Graft loss was associated with requiring renal replacement therapy and development of secondary infections. CONCLUSIONS Despite kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection having higher rate of hospital admission and mortality compared to the general population, a significant number of them can be managed using a telemedicine clinic.

However, limitations of the resources, risk of disease transmission and redirection of medical attention to a more severe infective health problem during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic period have affected the quality of care even in a surgical emergency. AIM: To compare the 30-d mortality rate and complications of hip fracture patients treated during COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic times. METHODS: The search of electronic databases on 1(st) August 2020 revealed 45 studies related to mortality of hip fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic times. After careful screening, eight studies were eligible for quantitative and qualitative analysis of data. RESULTS: The pooled data of eight studies (n = 1586) revealed no significant difference in 30-d mortality rate between the hip fracture patients treated during the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods [9.63% vs 6.33%; odds ratio (OR), 0.62; 95%CI, 0.33, 1.17; P = 0.14]. Even the 30-d mortality rate was not different between COVID-19 non-infected patients who were treated during the pandemic time, and all hip fracture patients treated during the pre-pandemic period (OR, 1.03; 95%CI, 0.61, 1.75; P = 0.91). A significant difference in mortality rate was observed between COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients (OR, 6.99; 95%CI, 3.45, 14.16; P < 0.00001).

These data are of particular importance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused disruptions in healthcare processes and may continue to impact cancer care for the foreseeable future. The aim of our study was to characterize the prevalence and clinical significance of diagnostic and treatment delays in patients with HCC. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients diagnosed with HCC between January 2008 and July 2017 at 2 US health systems. Diagnostic and treatment delays were defined as >90 days between presentation and HCC diagnosis and between diagnosis and treatment, respectively. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with diagnostic and treatment delays and Cox proportional hazard models to identify correlates of overall survival. RESULTS Of 925 patients with HCC, 39.0% were diagnosed via screening, 33.1% incidentally, and 27.9% symptomatically. Median time from presentation to diagnosis was 37 days (interquartile range, 18-94 days), with 120 patients (13.0%) experiencing diagnostic delays. Median time from HCC diagnosis to treatment was 46 days (interquartile range, 29-74 days), with 17.2% of patients experiencing treatment delays. Most (72.5%) diagnostic delays were related to provider-level factors (eg, monitoring indeterminate nodules), whereas nearly half (46.2%) of treatment delays were related to patient-related factors (eg, missed appointments). In multivariable analyses, treatment delays were not associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.60-1.35); these results were consistent across subgroup analyses by Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage and treatment modality.

Port (Covidien Surgical Devices, Norwalk, CT), which contains a gas insufflation channel and three individual cannulas that can readily accommodate laparoscopic instruments up to 12 mm in diameter. Nephrectomy was performed using a standard set of laparoscopic instruments and a rigid 5 mm 30 degree laparoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) with an end-on light source.

Three-year LTPFS rates of mutant-RAS were significantly worse than wild-type RAS in both CLM subgroups with minimal ablation margin 10 mm (29% vs. 70%, p<0.001) and >10 mm (48% vs. 94%, p=0.006). Predictors of worse LTPFS were ablation margins 10 mm (HR: 2.17, 95% CI 1.2-4.1, p=0.007), CLM size 2 cm (1.80, 1.1-2.8, p=0.017) and mutant-RAS (2.85, 1.7-4.6, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Minimal ablation margin and RAS status interact as independent predictors of LTPFS following CLM ablation. While minimal ablation margins >10 mm should be always the procedural goal, this becomes especially critical for mutant-RAS CLM. KEY POINTS ? RAS and ablation margins are predictors of local tumour progression-free survival. ? Ablation margin >10 mm, always desirable, is crucial for mutant RAS metastases. ? Interventional radiologists should be aware of RAS status to optimize LTPFS.","output":"Ablation of colorectal liver metastasis: Interaction of ablation margins and RAS mutation profiling on local tumour progression-free survival."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Restrictions due to COVID-19 necessitated staying at home, but in some cases, encouraged charitable behavior, e.g., donating items to people in need (e.g., clothes, food), or money to support combatting COVID-19. Drawing on the previous findings regarding helping during disastrous situations and roles of time perspective in helping behaviors, the study tested the predictive value of age, gender, previous volunteering, altruistic social value orientation, and time perspectives of donating items to people in need or money to combat COVID-19. The study is pioneering in terms of including time perspectives as individual differences which might contribute to making donations during COVID-19 circumstances. The study was questionnaire-based and conducted online in the eighth week of social distancing in Poland. 150 young adults (age 18-35) took part in the study. Results of multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that age, frequency of volunteering before the epidemic, and Present-Hedonistic time perspective predict donating items to people in need, but none of the tested variables predicted donating money to combat COVID-19. The findings suggest that charitable behavior, especially in the context of extraordinary social situations, needs to be treated as a multifaceted phenomenon.

Here, we report the structure of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein in complex with its host cell receptor ACE2 revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The complex structure shows that only one receptor-binding domain of the trimeric S glycoprotein binds ACE2 and adopts a protruding up conformation. In addition, we studied the structures of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and its complexes with ACE2 in different in vitro conditions, which may mimic different conformational states of the S glycoprotein during virus entry. Disassociation of the S1-ACE2 complex from some of the prefusion spikes was observed and characterized. We also characterized the rosette-like structures of the clustered SARS-CoV S2 trimers in the postfusion state observed on electron micrographs. Structural comparisons suggested that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein retains a prefusion architecture after trypsin cleavage into the S1 and S2 subunits and acidic pH treatment. However, binding to the receptor opens up the receptor-binding domain of S1, which could promote the release of the S1-ACE2 complex and S1 monomers from the prefusion spike and trigger the pre- to postfusion conformational transition.","output":"Cryo-EM structure of the SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein in complex with its host cell receptor ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The thrombotic aortic disease in dogs and cats is characterized by the pathological formation of blood clots that can rupture and obstruct the blood flow.

All patients completed the social functioning domain of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire. Participants suspected of CBS were interviewed to further evaluate their visual hallucinations. RESULTS CBS prevalence was 8.4%. Six out of seven patients with CBS were women. CBS was not associated with age (p=0.279, Mann-Whitney). Patients with CBS had a significant lower social functioning score (p<0.05, Mann-Whitney). All seven patients with CBS were in the category of vision impairment (visual acuity <6/12, but 3/60). Moreover, first hallucinations manifested after a drop in visual acuity. The retinal atrophic area of the worst eye tended to be lower in the CBS group (range 0.11-9.86 mm2) as compared with controls (range 0-180 mm2). There was no relation between the position of the scotoma and the location of the visual hallucinations. CONCLUSION The relative high CBS prevalence in STGD1 suggests that CBS may be more prevalent in younger ophthalmic patients than currently presumed. In this specific group of patients, we established social isolation and acquired vision impairment as risk factors for CBS. There was a female preponderance among patients with CBS. Age and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy were not identified as significant risk factors.

However, radial artery cannulation can be challenging for medical residents, and it is necessary to establish a facile and straightforward teaching strategy. This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of acoustic shadowing-facilitated ultrasound guidance on radial artery cannulation teaching for medical residents. METHODS: A total of 116 medical postgraduates who underwent standardized residency training programs in the Department of Anesthesiology were randomly divided into a new ultrasound-guided teaching group and a traditional ultrasound-guided teaching group. In the new ultrasound-guided teaching group, radial artery puncture technique was taught by acoustic shadowing-facilitated ultrasound guidance. The training included both theoretical and practical components. After the training, the success rate of the first puncture attempt, the success rate of the catheterization, the ultrasonic positioning time, and the catheterization time of the two groups were compared in a unified manner. A questionnaire on the subjective evaluation of the various aspects of the program by participants was conducted at the end of the training period. RESULTS: The study included 101 medical residents. The success rate for radial artery puncture at the first attempt in the new ultrasound-guided teaching group was 78.43%. It was significantly higher than that of the traditional ultrasound-guided group (58.00%, odds ratio = 0.380; 95% CI = 0.159 to 0.908; p = 0.027). The success rate for the first arterial catheterization in the new ultrasound-guided teaching group was significantly higher than that of the traditional ultrasound-guided group (74.51% vs. 52.00%, odds ratio = 0.371; 95% CI = 0.160 to 0.858; p = 0.019). The ultrasonic positioning time and catheterization time in minutes in the new ultrasound-guided teaching group were significantly shorter than that of the traditional ultrasound-guided group (14.36  3.31 vs. 18.02  4.95, p < 0.001; 10.43  2.38 vs. 14.78  8.02, p = 0.012). However, no significant differences were observed in the incidence of local hematomas and teaching satisfaction scores between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Acoustic shadowing facilitates ultrasound-guided radial artery puncture and catheterization is beneficial in the standardized training and teaching of residents. It improves the success rate of the first attempt at radial artery puncture and catheterization and shortens the time of ultrasound location and catheterization.

Eleven of these children are now clinically allergic; 5 have asthma. Immunologic evidence for allergic sensitization was observed in these 11 children by RAST, antigen-induced leukocyte histamine release, lymphoblastogenesis, and rise in serum IgE. Upper respiratory infections (URI) occurred in these 11 allergic children 1 to 2 months prior to the onset of allergic sensitization.

METHODOLOGY Four different strengths (1T, 2T, 3T and 4T) of the pulsed magnetic field (PMF) were applied in thirty repetitions to bacterial suspension. A pickup coil setup was used to measure the electromotive force induced inside the bacterial suspensions. The optical density (OD) was monitored over time (for 16 h 40 min) during the post-treatment period to assess bacterial growth. Along with the change in OD-values, live/dead assay, membrane depolarization study, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay on selected samples were studied to evaluate the effect of PMFs. All results were analysed using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey test and considered significant at p < 0.05. Regression analysis (at a confidence of 95%,  = 0.05) was performed on the bacterial growth and membrane depolarization studies to determine progressive changes of the outcomes. RESULTS The peak value of the induced electromotive force was recorded as 0.25 V, for the 4 T magnetic field pulse with a pulse-width of 16 ms. There was a significant arrest of bacterial cell growth after an exposure to PMFs of 1 T, 3 T, 4 T (ANOVA score: F (4, 495) = 395.180 at p = 0.05). The image-based qualitative results of the live/dead assay using fluorescence microscopy techniques indicated that an exposure to higher PMFs (3 T/ 4 T) induced a bacteriostatic effect in a longer post-exposure timescale. Evidence of altered membrane-potential within the 2 h of exposure to 4 T PMF were supported by the incidence of elevated ROS. For the ROS assay, a significant difference occurred for 4 T exposed samples (ANOVA score: calculated F (1, 3) = 20.2749 at p = 0.05). SEM and AFM observations corroborated with the outcomes, by portraying significant membrane damage.

The elderly, including individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are at an increased risk due to a variety of factors ranging from the molecular, to the physiological and social domains. Here we describe the development of a neural network\\\\inspired, expanded Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOP) approach to examine the relations, outcomes and potential interventions across scales at the intersections of these acute and long\\\\term health crises. METHOD: Using an Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) approach we compared key events and their relationships in COVID\\\\19 and ADRD. However, whereas current AOP approaches are often limited and centralized around the molecular domain we expand these to encompass a range of domains across scales such as the neuropsychological and social factors. Inspired by neural network modeling approaches we also extend the traditional AOP framework to explicitly include: inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms, causal recurrence, strength of interactions and advantageous pathways. RESULT: By including an analysis that spans molecular pathways, system level vulnerabilities, psychological, environmental and social factors we are able to assess commonalities of events (e.g., macrophage activation, systemic inflammation, environmental exposures and disproportionately affected racial/ethnic communities). In addition, by utilizing higher order and systems perspectives, we were able to better identify mechanistic differences (e.g., vulnerabilities of specific brain regions, timescale of bio\\\\cognitive consequences, sex\\\\gender differences), as well as chart interactions resulting in comorbidities and resilience factors. CONCLUSION: In recent years the global ADRD research field has strongly shifted to a conceptual framework that recognizes the essential role of interactions between levels of biosocial organization. The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has also revealed the crucial biopsychosocial connections of disease vulnerability, resistance and management. AOPs are powerful tools in clarifying key linkages in these multifactorial diseases. However, AOPs have also showed their limitation by biasing molecular events as the prime initiating events. Our hybrid approach integrates multiscale elements to more effectively develop a mechanistic framework and identify pathways to health.

We sought to understand the challenges nursing homes faced during the early phase of the pandemic with regard to personal protective equipment (PPE), supplies for staff and infection\\\\control policies and procedures, as well as the ability to maintain sufficient staffing levels and manage staff turnover. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted telephone interviews with nine key stakeholders knowledgeable about nursing home responses to the pandemic. We also conducted a systematic policy review to document federal, state, and local laws and policies designed to support nursing homes during and after the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, with a focus on workforce challenges. POPULATION STUDIED: Interview respondents included researchers and national association leaders representing the nursing home industry, direct care staff, and involved in long\\\\term care policy and practice. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Staffing shortages and attrition due to the pandemic intensified nursing home workforce problems during the pandemic. In response to low pay, poor working conditions, and the high risk of COVID\\\\19 infection, some nurses and certified nursing assistants left their jobs despite increased demand for their skills and expertise. The nursing home workforce also confronted new challenges during the pandemic that stemmed from a lack of critical resources, such as childcare coverage and mental health support, which escalated critical shortages of staff. The lack of a unified national testing strategy, distribution of test kits, and policies to cover cost, reportedly delayed timely testing of residents and nursing home staff early on, and hindered understanding about the risk of COVID\\\\19 transmission. CONCLUSIONS: To fill vacancies and provide surge support, nursing homes developed strategies to recruit new staff, while states and the federal government modified licensing and credentialing requirements and deployed nontraditional staff. Governments and nursing homes also increased wages and augmented non\\\\wage benefits such as childcare, housing, transportation assistance, and food supports.

In this paper, an Gaussian Bayesian network-based estimation of distribution algorithm (GBNEDA-DR) is proposed to effectively tackle continued large-scale MaOPs. In the proposed algorithm, dimension reduction technique (i.e. LPP) is employed in the decision space to speed up the estimation search of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better on many of the problems and for different decision space dimensions, and achieves comparable results on some compared with many existing algorithms.","output":"A New EDA with Dimension Reduction Technique for Large Scale Many-Objective Optimization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is a phenotype, which is defined by reduced muscle strength, muscle mass, and obesity. Limited mobility leads to increased sedentary behavior and decreased physical activity. Both sarcopenia and obesity are aggravated by these factors. In combination, SO is an additional challenge for the setting nursing home (NH). Previous studies have shown a low prevalence of residents with SO in comparable settings, such as community-dwelling. We hypothesize that the BaSAlt cohort also has a small proportion of residents with SO. Methods: For the analysis, 66 residents (women: 74.2%) aged  65 years from NH, were screened for SO based on EWGSOP2 specifications and cut-off values to classify obesity. Results: Severe sarcopenia was quantified in eleven residents (16.7%). The majority of sarcopenic residents were women (n = 10) compared to men (n = 1). However, no SO could be identified by assessment of body mass index, fat mass in percentage, and fat mass index. Conclusion: As expected, the setting-specific cohort showed a low number of SO. Furthermore, no case of SO was identified in our study. Sarcopenia was associated with an increased fat-free mass in NH residents.

Interleukin (IL-6) inhibitors can be used in severe COVID-19 patients due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-immune effects. We aimed to assess the therapeutic effect of tocilizumab (Actemra) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Overall, 1382 patients were admitted to a temporary hospital during July outbreak of COVID-19. Of these, 282 patients were hospitalized. Baseline clinical, radiological and laboratory data were collected from patient records. Laboratory markers prior to discharge were also collected. Wilcoxon rank sum test was conducted to show the significance of change of laboratory markers. Results: Eleven of the 282(3.9%) hospitalized patients who had severe pneumonia confirmed by either chest radiography (CXR) or computed tomography (CT) received tocilizumab (Actemra). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) viral markers of COVID-19 were positive in three cases. Hypoxemia and surrogate markers of cytokine storm improved after the prescription of tocilizumab (p=0.003 in all laboratory parameters).

Here, we review the current understanding of how anti-inflammatory intervention via inhibition of the pro-inflammatory but pleiotropic cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 may benefit patients with these or related diseases or complications. AREAS COVERED Based on a PubMed literature search, this review integrates and contextualizes evidence regarding the clinical utility of anti-IL-6 intervention in the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases, as well as of the associated condition non-alcoholic hepatosteatosis. EXPERT OPINION Evidence implicates the pro-inflammatory effects of IL-6 in the pathophysiology of diabetes, CKD and CVD. Thus, targeting the IL-6 pathway holds a therapeutic potential in these cardiometabolic disorders. However, because IL-6 has multiple homeostatic roles, antagonizing this cytokine may be associated with side effects such as increased risk of infection as seen with other anti-inflammatory drugs. Additional studies are required to establish the benefit-risk profile of anti-IL-6 intervention in the cardiometabolic diseases, whilst also considering alternative interventions such as lifestyle changes. IL-6 is also elevated in NASH, but the clinical usefulness of targeting IL-6 in this hepatic disorder remains largely unexplored.","output":"Interleukin 6 in diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease: mechanisms and therapeutic perspectives."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Theoretical and practical knowledge integration is essential in Electrical Engineering.

The gravity model of international trade is applied to examine the hypothesized impact of maritime network reconfiguration on the bilateral trade between nine exporting countries (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Panama, Colombia, Costa Rica, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia) and their 128 trading partners. The panel data on the five components of the Liner Shipping Bilateral Connectivity Index, the export value, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the nine exporting countries, the GDP of their trading partners and the maritime distance linking them to these 128 trading partners for each of the years from 2008 to 2016 are used in the analysis. The results show that the estimated coefficient for the number of transhipments is negative, revealing an inverse relationship between transhipments and bilateral exports, reconfirming that a redesign of the maritime supply chain network in response to the BRI could significantly improve bilateral export values. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of required transhipments, because of a reconfiguration of maritime networks with BRI trading partners, will improve the maritime network structure between countries located along the three strategic chokepoints: the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, and the Strait of Malacca. In general terms, the BRI-driven reconfiguration of maritime supply networks is linked to an improvement in the productivity of nine exporting countries. An innovative gravity-based econometric model, estimated on a large set of panel data, is introduced below, aiming at the modelling of the effect of BRI on supply chain network reconfiguration.","output":"Reconfiguring maritime networks due to the Belt and Road Initiative: impact on bilateral trade flows"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Delta variant was first detected in India in October of 2020, and it led to a massive second wave of COVID-19 cases in the country. Since then, the highly infectious Delta strain has been spreading globally. The Delta variant and its sub-lineages showed an increased infection rate with a reduced effect of the potential antibody neutralization. The current work is a modeled computational analysis of the mutated receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 lineage binding with ACE2 and GRP78 to understand the increased strain transmissibility. The cell-surface Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78) attached to the mutated ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD complex is modeled. The results showed that GRP78 -substrate-binding domain weakly binds to the wild-type RBD combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) within the SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD-ACE2 complex. Both GRP78 and ACE2 bind approximately in the same region on the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD surface. On the other hand, GRP78 strongly binds to the mutated SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD in the RBD-ACE2 complex through the -substrate-binding domain instead of -substrate-binding domain in a different region from that of ACE2. The current findings suggest that blocking the main ACE2 pathway may not prevent the interactions between GRP78 and the mutated SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD, which might introduce an additional avenue into the virus invasion for the host cell if the ACE2 pathway is blocked by the neutralized antibodies. Hence, the peptide satpdb10668 has been proposed as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 attachment and virus invasion into the host cell.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 variant surge and vaccine breakthrough infection: A computational analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study describes the feasibility of using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) as a multidisciplinary outcome measure for pediatric telerehabilitation (TR).

Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are manufactured fluorinated chemicals widely used in many industrial and household products. The objective of this case-control study was to assess the association between PFASs exposure and COVID-19 susceptibility and to elucidate the metabolic dysregulation associated with PFASs exposure in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Total 160 subjects (80 COVID-19 patients and 80 symptom-free controls) were recruited from Shanxi and Shandong provinces, two regions heavily polluted by PFASs in China. Twelve common PFASs were quantified in both urine and serum. Urine metabolome profiling was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: In unadjusted models, the risk of COVID-19 infection was positively associated with urinary levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (Odds ratio: 2.29 [95% CI: 1.52 - 3.22]), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (2.91, [1.95 - 4.83], and total PFASs ( (12) PFASs) (3.31, [2.05 - 4.65]). After controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), the associations remained statistically significant (Adjusted odds ratio of 1.94 [95% CI: 1.39 - 2.96] for PFOS, 2.73 [1.71 - 4.55] for PFOA, and 2.82 [1.97 - 3.51] for  (12) PFASs). Urine metabolome-PFASs association analysis revealed that 59% of PFASs-associated urinary endogenous metabolites in COVID-19 patients were identified to be produced or largely regulated by mitochondrial function. In addition, the increase of PFASs exposure was associated with the accumulation of key metabolites in kynurenine metabolism, which are involved in immune responses (Combined  coefficient of 0.60 [95% CI: 0.25 to 0.95, P = 0.001]). Moreover, alternations in PFASs-associated metabolites in mitochondrial and kynurenine metabolism were also correlated with clinical lab biomarkers for mitochondrial function (serum growth/differentiation factor-15) and immune activity (lymphocyte percentage), respectively. CONCLUSION: Elevated exposure to PFASs was independently associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. PFASs-associated metabolites were implicated in mitochondrial function and immune activity. Larger studies are needed to confirm our findings and further understand the underlying mechanisms of PFASs exposure in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection.","output":"Association Between Urinary Per- and Poly-fluoroalkyl Substances and COVID-19 Susceptibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Few studies have tracked the long-term mental health outcomes following major disaster We sought to document the trajectories of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in the aftermath of the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami A cohort of community-dwelling older adults were followed for 5 5 years after the disaster at 3 waves (2010, 2013 and 2016) Depressive symptoms were measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form, while PTSS was assessed by the Screening Questionnaire for Disaster Mental Health We examined the trajectories of mental illness symptoms based on the probabilities of persistence, recovery, and delayed onset Among people without pre-disaster depressive symptoms, 13 6% had developed depressive symptoms 2 5 years after the disaster Of these, half of those had recovered and half had persisted at the 5 5 year follow-up 11 1% of survivors reported post-traumatic stress symptoms in 2013;of these, 58% recovered by 2016, while 4 8% experienced delayed onset Job loss was associated with persistent PTSS (OR 2 03;95%CI 1 01-4 12) while a drop in subjective economic status predicted delayed onset of PTSS (OR 2 13;1 34-3 39) However, disaster-related experiences were unrelated to the trajectory of depressive symptoms at 5 5 years The probabilities of remission (58%) and delayed onset (5%) of PTSS are consistent with prior disaster research The experience of job loss and drop in subjective economic status appeared to exert a lingering influence on the persistence or delayed onset of PTSS Depressive symptoms after the disaster had remitted in roughly half of the survivors after 5 5 years","output":"Persistent mental health impacts of disaster.

PURPOSE: To compare rates of stroke admissions and case fatality between corresponding periods in 2020 and 2019, within a hospital system in Ghana, to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We compared monthly stroke admissions and mortality rates between January to June 2020 vs. January to June 2019 at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, a tertiary medical center in Ghana. Predictors of in-patient mortality were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: Stroke admissions were higher in January to June 2020 vs. January to June 2019 (431 vs. 401), an increase of +7.5% (95% CI: 5.1C10.5%). There was also a rise in recurrent stroke admissions in 2020 vs. 2019 (19.0% vs. 10.9%, p = .0026). Stroke case fatality trended higher in 2020 vs. 2019 (29.3% vs. 24.2%, p = .095) with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.22 (95% CI: 0.89C1.68). CONCLUSION: While an influence of secular trends cannot be excluded, the COVID-19 outbreak coincided with a comparatively significant rise in initial and recurrent stroke admissions at this Ghanaian tertiary hospital. Continued surveillance at this hospital, as well as assessment of this issue at other sites in Africa is warranted.","output":"COVID-19 and stroke: Experience in a Ghanaian healthcare system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It seems certain that blended learning will be on the rise in higher education, with in-person meetings increasingly precious time, and online synchronous and asynchronous sessions used to complement them. This paper examines Knowledge Building in two graduate courses conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were no in-person sessions;rather, synchronous Zoom sessions were combined with asynchronous work in a knowledge building environment--Knowledge Forum. Knowledge Forum is designed to make transparent and accessible means by which deep understanding and sustained creative work proceed. Accordingly, for example, rise-above notes and view rearrangement support synthesis and explanatory coherence, epistemic markers support knowledge-advancing discourse, and analytics support self-and group-monitoring of progress as work proceeds. In this report, we focus on these aspects of Knowledge Building, using a subset of analytics to enhance understanding of key concepts and design of principles-based practices to advance education for knowledge creation. Overall, we aimed to have students take collective responsibility for advancing community knowledge, rather than focus exclusively on individual achievement. As we reflect on our experiences and challenges, we attempt to answer the following questions: Do courses that introduce Knowledge Building in higher education need an in-person or synchronous component? In what ways can we leverage in-class time and Knowledge Forum work to engage students in more advanced knowledge creation? We conclude that synchronous and asynchronous Knowledge Building can be combined in powerful new ways to provide students with more design time and deeper engagement with content and peers.","output":"Knowledge Building in Online Mode: Insights and Reflections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background International literature suggests that disadvantaged groups are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection due to poorer living/working conditions and barriers to healthcare access. Yet, to date, there is no evidence of this disproportionate impact on non-national individuals, including economic migrants, short-term travellers, and refugees. Methods We analysed data from the Italian surveillance system of all COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases tested positive from the beginning of the outbreak (20th of February) to the 19th of July 2020. We used multilevel negative-binomial regression models to compare the case-fatality rate and the rate of admission to hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) between Italian and non-Italian nationals. The analysis was adjusted for differences in demographic characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, and period of diagnosis. Results We analysed 213,180 COVID-19 cases, including 15,974 (7.5%) non-Italian nationals. We found that, compared to Italian cases, non-Italian cases were diagnosed at a later date and were more likely to be hospitalised [(adjusted relative risk (ARR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-1.44)] and admitted to ICU (ARR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.07-1.32), with differences being more pronounced in those coming from countries with lower HDI. We also observed an increased risk of death in non-Italian cases from low-HDI countries (ARR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.01-1.75). Conclusions A delayed diagnosis in non-Italian cases could explain their worse outcomes compared to Italian cases. Ensuring early access to diagnosis and treatment to non-Italians could facilitate the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and improve health outcomes in all people living in Italy, regardless of nationality.","output":"Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases in non-Italian nationals notified to the Italian surveillance system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By introducing the theory of social co-governance into the field of e-commerce intellectual property protection, this paper builds an evolutionary game model among the government, e-commerce platforms, and rights holders, and studies the conditions under the stakeholders form a stable equilibrium state under different constraints.

Of the existing devices, all have shortcomings which render them ineffective and impractical in out-of-hospital environments. Therefore, we propose a new design for such a device, along with a pragmatic evaluation of its efficacy. Must-have criteria for the device included: reduction of aerosol transmission by at least 90% as measured by pragmatic testing; construction from readily available, inexpensive materials; easy to clean; and compatibility with common EMS stretchers. The Patient Particle Containment Chamber (PPCC) consists of a standard shower liner draped over a modified octagonal PVC pipe frame and secured with binder clips. 3D printed sleeve portals were used to secure plastic sleeves to the shower liner wall. A weighted tube sealed the exterior base of the chamber with the contours of the patient's body and stretcher. Upon testing, the PPCC contained 99% of spray-paint particles sprayed over a 90s period.

The binding is partially host specific, as FPV binds only to the feline TfR, while CPV binds to both the canine and feline TfRs. The host-specific binding is controlled by a combination of residues within a raised region of the capsid. To define the TfR structures that interact with the virus, we altered the apical domain of the feline or canine TfR or prepared chimeras of these receptors and tested the altered receptors for binding to FPV or CPV capsids. Most changes in the apical domain of the feline TfR did not affect binding, but replacing Leu221 with Ser or Asp prevented receptor binding to either FPV or CPV capsids, while replacing Leu221 with Lys resulted in a receptor that bound only to CPV but not to FPV. Analysis of recombinants of the feline and canine TfRs showed that sequences controlling CPV-specific binding were within the apical domain and that more than one difference between these receptors determined the CPV-specific binding of the canine TfR. Single changes within the canine TfR which removed a single amino acid insertion or which eliminated a glycosylation site gave that receptor the expanded ability to bind to FPV and CPV. In some cases, binding of capsids to mutant receptors did not result in infection, suggesting a structural role for the receptor in cell infection by the viruses.","output":"Residues in the apical domain of the feline and canine transferrin receptors control host-specific binding and cell infection of canine and feline parvoviruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ICU ultrasonography constitutes important part of modern car patient care.

In fact, one tenth of all limb bone fractures fail to heal completely due to the extent of the trauma, disease, or age of the patient. Our ability to improve bone regenerative strategies is critically dependent on the ability to mimic serious bone trauma in test animals, but the generation and stabilization of large bone lesions is technically challenging. In most cases, serious long bone trauma is mimicked experimentally by establishing a defect that will not naturally heal. This is achieved by complete removal of a bone segment that is larger than 1.5 times the diameter of the bone cross-section. The bone is then stabilized with a metal implant to maintain proper orientation of the fracture edges and allow for mobility. Due to their small size and the fragility of their long bones, establishment of such lesions in mice are beyond the capabilities of most research groups. As such, long bone defect models are confined to rats and larger animals. Nevertheless, mice afford significant research advantages in that they can be genetically modified and bred as immune-compromised strains that do not reject human cells and tissue. Herein, we demonstrate a technique that facilitates the generation of a segmental defect in mouse femora using standard laboratory and veterinary equipment. With practice, fabrication of the fixation device and surgical implantation is feasible for the majority of trained veterinarians and animal research personnel.

Confounding is an important consideration as OSA is associated with several known risk factors for severe COVID-19. Our aim was to assess the association of OSA with hospitalization due to COVID-19 using a population-based cohort with detailed information on OSA and comorbidities. METHODS: Included were all community-dwelling Icelandic citizens 18 years of age and older diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2020. Data on demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes of COVID-19 was obtained from centralized national registries. Diagnosis of OSA was retrieved from the centralized Sleep Department Registry at Landspitali C The National University Hospital. Severe COVID-19 was defined as the composite outcome of hospitalization and death. The associations between OSA and the outcome were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), calculated using logistic regression models and inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: A total of 4,756 individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Iceland were included in the study (1.3% of the Icelandic population), of whom 185 had a diagnosis of OSA. In total, 238 were hospitalized or died, 38 of whom had OSA. Adjusted for age, sex, and BMI, OSA was associated with poor outcome (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4C3.5). This association was slightly attenuated (OR 2.0, 95% CI 2.0, 1.2C3.2) when adjusted for demographic characteristics and various comorbidities.

In Canada, between January 2016 and March 2020, a total of 16,364 people died due to opioid-related overdose. The World Health Organization reports that 70% of the 0.5 million deaths worldwide caused by drugs are related to opioid overdose. Although supervised consumption sites or safe injection sites have been shown to be effective in reducing the harms associated with the use of illicit substances and increasing uptake of addiction treatment and other health services, there is still significant stigma associated with them, and it is unlikely that all of the people who would benefit from supervised consumption service will ever access a site. OBJECTIVE: To help prevent deaths in populations that cannot or will not access physical safer consumption services in Alberta, we propose to provide virtual (telephone-based) overdose response services, staffed by people with lived experience.The primary outcome for this study is uptake of the service as measured by the number of calls to the service. Secondary outcomes will include patterns of use of the phone line (days of the week and time of calls) and outcomes from the calls (number of emergency medical services dispatches for overdoses from the service and the results of those dispatches). METHODS: This phase 1 clinical study is set to officially launch in early May 2020. The service will be available to up to 15 participants who self-disclose as using opioids unobserved and have given informed consent for both data collection and interviews. This group will have access to a toll-free telephone number and be invited to call when they plan to use opioids alone. RESULTS: The analysis will include mixed methods. To improve the design of the service and ensure safety of all involved, quantitative data will be collected on phone calls and participant health care usage, while qualitative data will be collected from both participants and virtual overdose response operators.

In the case of infectious diseases that present risks of transmission to healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients, the use of the identify-isolate-inform framework is essential to protect staff and patients and the delivery of safe and effective care. This includes early identification of PUIs, institution of appropriate transmission-based precautions including use of specific personal protective equipment (PPE) and isolation, and prompt notification of relevant personnel, including relevant experts and authorities. Depending on the specific infection suspected, once appropriate infection control measures have been implemented, clinical evaluation of PUIs can vary in complexity. In the case of Ebola virus disease (EVD), the need for specialized PPE and training, well-developed procedures, and dedicated space can be extremely resource-intensive and costly for facilities. In addition, depending upon the need to reduce risks to other patients and HCWs, regular laboratory and imaging equipment may not be available (or available at the standard frequency or turnaround time) to support medical care. Lastly, diagnostic tests needed to confirm the diagnosis may not be available at the healthcare facility and may instead be accessible through public health authorities. This testing may take several days to confirm the diagnosis or rule out the presence of the suspected infection. Thus, the potential period of evaluation for a PUI can extend well beyond a typical clinic or emergency department (ED) visit.

Methods: Eight vaccine hesitancy scale (VHS) items, adopted from WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Immunization (SAGE), were used to assess VH for COVID-19 vaccine vs. routine childhood vaccines. We distributed the online survey to parents with the commence of the national childhood COVID-19 vaccination program in Saudi Arabia. Results: Among 3,167 parents, 47.6% are decided to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. The most common reasons for refusal were inadequate safety information (69%) and worry about side effects (60.6%). Parents have a significantly greater positive attitudes toward children's routine vaccines vs. the COVID-19 vaccine, with higher mean VHS (SD) = 2.98  0.58 vs. 2.63  0.73, respectively (p-value < 0.001). Parents agreed more that routine childhood vaccines are more essential and effective as compared to the COVID-19 vaccine (Cohen's D: 0.946, and 0.826, consecutively; T-test p-value < 0.00). There is more parental anxiety about serious side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine vs. routine childhood vaccines (Cohen's D = 0.706, p-value < 0.001).

In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the factors associated with intention to vaccinate children were parents who received COVID-19 vaccine, older parents, having children aged 12C18, and parents with lower education levels. Conclusions: Significant proportion of parents are hesitant about the COVID-19 vaccine because they are less confident in its effectiveness, safety, and whether it is essential for their children.

METHODS The data were drawn from the 2017 Survey of Living Conditions and Welfare Needs of Korean Older Persons, a nationally representative survey. Digital technology use was measured by the number of digital functions that respondents perform with their electronic devices. Social interactions were measured by the frequencies of face-to-face and remote connections with friends or neighbors. Relationships were estimated with multiple regression analyses. RESULTS Digital technology use was inversely associated with depressive symptoms even after adjusting for covariates including cognitive function. Both remote and face-to-face connections with friends or neighbors were associated with fewer depressive symptoms. An interaction between digital technology use and remote contact also was detected: the effect of digital technology use on depressive symptoms was more beneficial for older adults with infrequent remote contact with friends or neighbors than for those with frequent remote contact. CONCLUSION Findings suggest that digital technology use can reduce depressive symptoms of older adults, especially those who have fewer social interactions. Educating older adults to increase their digital literacy level and use of remote interactions may improve their psychological wellbeing, perhaps even during times of a viral pandemic.","output":"Digital technology use and depressive symptoms among older adults in Korea: beneficial for those who have fewer social interactions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed more than 240,000 lives worldwide, causing tremendous public health, social, and economic damages. While the risk factors of COVID-19 are still under investigation, environmental factors, such as urban air pollution, may play an important role in increasing population susceptibility to COVID-19 pathogenesis. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional nationwide study using zero-inflated negative binomial models to estimate the association between long-term (2010C2016) county-level exposures to NO(2), PM(2.5) and O(3) and county-level COVID-19 case-fatality and mortality rates in the US. We used both single and multipollutant models and controlled for spatial trends and a comprehensive set of potential confounders, including state-level test positive rate, county-level healthcare capacity, phase-of-epidemic, population mobility, sociodemographic, socioeconomic status, behavior risk factors, and meteorological factors. RESULTS: 1,027,799 COVID-19 cases and 58,489 deaths were reported in 3,122 US counties from January 22, 2020 to April 29, 2020, with an overall observed case-fatality rate of 5.8%. Spatial variations were observed for both COVID-19 death outcomes and long-term ambient air pollutant levels. County-level average NO(2) concentrations were positively associated with both COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate in single-, bi-, and tri-pollutant models (p-values<0.05). Per inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in NO(2) (4.6 ppb), COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate were associated with an increase of 7.1% (95% CI 1.2% to 13.4%) and 11.2% (95% CI 3.4% to 19.5%), respectively. We did not observe significant associations between long-term exposures to PM(2.5) or O(3) and COVID-19 death outcomes (p-values>0.05), although per IQR increase in PM(2.5) (3.4 ug/m(3)) was marginally associated with 10.8% (95% CI: ?1.1% to 24.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to NO(2), which largely arises from urban combustion sources such as traffic, may enhance susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes, independent of long-term PM(2.5) and O(3) exposure. The results support targeted public health actions to protect residents from COVID-19 in heavily polluted regions with historically high NO(2) levels. Moreover, continuation of current efforts to lower traffic emissions and ambient air pollution levels may be an important component of reducing population-level risk of COVID-19 deaths.","output":"Urban Air Pollution May Enhance COVID-19 Case-Fatality and Mortality Rates in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many hospital supply chains in the US follow a stockless structure, often implemented with the acquisition of new systems promising improved efficiencies and responsiveness. Despite vendor promises, supply chain gains from new technology are often unfulfilled or result in a reduction of performance. A critical component of achieving promised gains is the hospitals ability to accurately and consistently capture hospital inventory use. In practice, recording demand with perfect, 100% accuracy is infeasible, so our models condition on the level of accuracy in a particular hospital department, or point-of-use (POU) inventory location. Similar to previous literature, we consider actual net inventory and recorded net inventory in developing the system performance measures. We develop two models, optimizing either cost or service level, and we assume a periodic-review, base-stock (or par-level) inventory policy with full backordering. In addition to choosing the optimal order-up-to level, we seek the optimal frequency of inventory counts to reconcile inaccurate records. Results from both models provide insights for supply chain managers in the hospital setting, as well as hospital administrators considering the adoption of similar technologies or systems.","output":"Point-of-use hospital inventory management with inaccurate usage capture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Privacy protection during collaborative distributed association rule mining is an important research, which has been widely used in market prediction, medical research and other fields. In medical research, Domadiya et al. (Sadhana 43(8):127, 2018) focused on mining association rules from horizontally distributed healthcare data to diagnose heart disease. They claimed they proposed a more effective privacy-preserving distributed association rule mining (PPDARM) scheme. However, a serious security scrutiny of the scheme is performed, and we find it vulnerable to protect the support of the itemsets from any electronic health record (EHR) system, which is the most important parameter Domadiya et al. tried to protect. In this paper, we first present the cryptanalysis of the PPDARM scheme proposed by Domadiya et al. as well as some revised performance analyses. Then a new PPDARM scheme with less interactions is proposed to avert the shortcomings of Domadiya et al., using the homomorphic properties of the distributed Paillier cryptosystem to accomplish the cooperative computation. Our scheme allows the directed authority (miner) to obtain the final results rather than all cooperative EHR systems, in case of semi-honest but pseudo EHR systems.

Hypocalcemia is a common laboratory finding in critically ill patients. Data regarding levels of calcium in SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with hypocalcemia could have a worse outcome. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and included all patients who had any serum calcium measurement in the first 72 hours since hospital admission. Main objective was to investigate the relation of low serum calcium with adverse outcome, measured by the requirement of high oxygen support - defined as high flow nasal cannula oxygen, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and/or invasive ventilation-, intensive care unit admission or death. RESULTS: A total of 316 patients were included in the study. Median age was 65 years (IQR 55-74), 65% were men. Hypocalcemia within 72 hours since hospital admission was present in 63% of patients. A higher number of patients in the hypocalcemia group required high oxygen support during hospitalization (49% vs 32%; p = 0,01) and were admitted to the ICU (42% vs 26%; p = 0,005). No differences in mortality were observed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Hypocalcemia is frequent in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and can identify patients with worse outcome.

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on dental practice by conducting an online questionnaire among the Iranian dental practitioners and finding their perspectives on the subject. METHODS: This report is based on a questionnaire that was conducted among Iranian dentists. The survey included questions that evaluate the dentists' perceptions and attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on their personal life, financial status, and the quality of dental services for patients. RESULTS: Overall, 240 dentists contributed to this study (214 general dentists and 26 specialists). The majority of the participants (n = 170, 70%) did not perform non-emergency procedures during the pandemic. The dental practitioners have suggested several strategies to decrease the risk of contagion, such as reducing treatment sessions (n = 90, 37%), strict triage of patients (n = 156, 64%), and using personal protective equipment (n = 108, 45%). However, most of the dentists (n = 210, 87%) had problems, providing personal protective equipment during the pandemic. Moreover, 97% (n = 234) of the participants reported that they encountered a decrease in their financial income since the eruption of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Dental health care workers are at the highest risk of contracting COVID-19. Thus, dental practitioners ought to execute the standard protocols more cautiously during the pandemic. They could also lower their work hours and limit dental procedures to emergency treatments to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Besides, the public organizations should provide proper equipment for the dental practitioners to decrease the risk of contagion.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on dental practice in Iran: a questionnaire-based report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research aims to conduct a cross cultural study of Mainland Chinese and the United States (U.S.) seniors personality traits and identify how they affect motivation, preferences, sociodemographic, and travel-related characteristics.

Results: Of the patients evaluated, 88% were adults and 12% of them were children (<18 years old). While 24.2% of all patients, and 40.8% of the patients under the age of 18 were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms in adults were fatigue (47.9%), myalgia (44.7%), loss of smell and taste (32.4%), and the symptoms in children were fever (37.5%), fatigue (12.5%) and myalgia (11.7%). Pneumonia was observed in 35.4% of COVID-19 patients. Pneumonia was associated with advanced age, lack of BCG vaccination, presence of additional disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney disease. Overall case-fatality rate was 2.6 percent. The mean age of the patients who died was 76.5 years. The mortality rate in patients over 65 years of age was found to be %11.5. In multivariate analysis, presence of nephrological disease, neurological disease, cardiovascular disease, cigarette exposure, dyspnea, loss of smell and taste, presence of diabetes mellitus, being over 65 years of age, number of drugs used and income status were found to be determinative factors. Conclusion: We found that the independent risk factors for COVID-19 mortality included older age, history of neurological, nephrological, or cardiovascular disease, smoking, and dyspnea symptom. In addition, we found patients with disturbed smell and taste had a better prognosis. Knowing the determinants of mortality can help clinicians to predict patients prognosis at an earlier stage.

In this review, we first describe the state of the art of medical-laboratory tests that can be performed near the patient. At present, POCT ranges from basic blood-glucose measurement to complex viscoelastic coagulation assays. POCT shortens the time to clinical decision-making about additional testing or therapy, as delays are no longer caused by transport and preparation of clinical samples, and biochemical-test results are rapidly available at the point of care. Improved medical outcome and lower costs may ensue. Recent, evolving technological advances enable the development of novel POCT instruments. We review the underlying analytical techniques. If new instruments are not yet in practical use, it is often hard to decide whether the underlying analytical principle has real advantage over former methods. However, future utilization of POCT also depends on health-care trends and new areas of application.

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against the risk of infection, hospitalisation, and death during the first 9 months after vaccination for the total population of Sweden. METHODS: This retrospective, total population cohort study was done using data from Swedish nationwide registers. The cohort comprised all individuals vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, mRNA-1273, or BNT162b2, and matched unvaccinated individuals, with data on vaccinations and infections updated until Oct 4, 2021. Two outcomes were evaluated. The first was SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity from Jan 12 to Oct 4, 2021. The second was severe COVID-19, defined as hospitalisation for COVID-19 or all-cause 30-day mortality after confirmed infection, from March 15 to Sept 28, 2021. FINDINGS: Between Dec 28, 2020, and Oct 4, 2021, 842 974 individuals were fully vaccinated (two doses), and were matched (1:1) to an equal number of unvaccinated individuals (total study cohort n=1 685 948). For the outcome SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity, the vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 waned progressively over time, from 92% (95% CI 92 to 93; p<0001) at 15C30 days, to 47% (39 to 55; p<0001) at 121C180 days, and to 23% (?2 to 41; p=007) from day 211 onwards. Waning was slightly slower for mRNA-1273, with a vaccine effectiveness of 96% (94 to 97; p<0001) at 15C30 days and 59% (18 to 79; p=0012) from day 181 onwards. Waning was also slightly slower for heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 plus an mRNA vaccine, for which vaccine effectiveness was 89% (79 to 94; p<0001) at 15C30 days and 66% (41 to 80; p<0001) from day 121 onwards. By contrast, vaccine effectiveness for homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was 68% (52 to 79; p<0001) at 15C30 days, with no detectable effectiveness from day 121 onwards (?19% [C98 to 28]; p=049). For the outcome of severe COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness waned from 89% (82 to 93; p<0001) at 15C30 days to 64% (44 to 77; p<0001) from day 121 onwards. Overall, there was some evidence for lower vaccine effectiveness in men than in women and in older individuals than in younger individuals. INTERPRETATION: We found progressively waning vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity across all subgroups, but the rate of waning differed according to vaccine type. With respect to severe COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness seemed to be better maintained, although some waning became evident after 4 months. The results strengthen the evidence-based rationale for administration of a third vaccine dose as a booster.

We aimed to determine the proportion of participants reporting sexual risk behaviours, SRH service use and unmet need, and to assess remote sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing service use after the first national lockdown in Britain. Methods We used data from the National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal)-COVID cross-sectional, quasi-representative web survey (Natsal-COVID Wave 1). Adults aged 18-59 years who resided in England, Scotland, or Wales completed the survey between July 29 and Aug 10,2020, which included questions about the approximate 4-month period after announcement of the initial lockdown in Britain (March 23, 2020). Quota-based sampling and weighting were used to achieve a quasi-representative population sample. Participants aged 45-59 years were excluded from services analysis due to low rates of SRH service use. Among individuals aged 18-44 years, we estimated reported SRH service use and inability to access, and calculated age-adjusted odds ratios (aORs) among sexually experienced individuals (those reporting any sexual partner in their lifetime) and sexually active individuals (those reporting any sexual partner in the past year). Unweighted denominators and weighted estimates are presented hereafter. Findings 6654 individuals had complete interviews and were included in the analysis. Among 3758 participants aged 18-44 years, 82.0% reported being sexually experienced, and 73.7% reported being sexually active. 20- 8% of sexually experienced participants aged 18-44 years reported using SRH services in the 4-month period. Overall, 9.7% of 3108 participants (9.5% of men;9.9% of women) reported being unable to use a service they needed, although of the participants who reported trying but not being able to use a SRH service at least once, 76.4% of participants also reported an instance of successful use. 5.9% of 1221 sexually active men and 3.6% of 1560 sexually active women reported use of STI-related services and 14.8% of 1728 sexually experienced women reported use of contraceptive services, with SRH service use highest among individuals aged 18-24 years. Sexually active participants reporting condomless sex with new partners since lockdown were much more likely to report using STI-related services than those who did not report condomless sex (aOR 23.8 [95% CI 11.6-48.9]) for men, 10.5 [3.9-28.2] for women) and, among men, were also more likely to have an unsuccessful attempt at STI-service use (aOR 13.3 [5-3-32.9]). Among 106 individuals who reported using STI testing services, 64.4% accessed services remotely (telephone, video, or online). Among 2581 women aged 25-59 years, 2.4% reported cervical screening compared with an estimated 6% in a comparable 4-month period before the pandemic.

Microarray methods have been applied to microbial detection, genotyping and antimicrobial resistance gene detection. Microarrays can offer a panel approach to diagnose specific patient presentations, such as respiratory or gastrointestinal infections, and can discriminate isolates by genotype for tracking epidemiology and outbreak investigations. And, as more information has become available on specific genes and pathways involved in antimicrobial resistance, we are beginning to be able to predict susceptibility patterns based on sequence detection for particular organisms. With further advances in automated microarray processing methods and genotypeCphenotype prediction algorithms, these tests will become even more useful as an adjunct or replacement for conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing, allowing for more rapid selection of targeted therapy for infectious diseases.","output":"Chapter 11 Solid and Suspension Microarrays for Microbial Diagnostics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid and global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a viral pathogen responsible for the development of the \\"coronavirus disease of 2019\\" (COVID-19), has developed into an unprecedented health crisis with considerable case fatality rate.

These changes have affected the inpatient management of many gastrointestinal conditions including gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Our aim was to assess the impact of the pandemic on the consultation and management of GIB during its first peak (Spring 2020) in an urban, safety-net hospital that saw significant service disruptions. Methods: Using the electronic health record, adult patients were identified who had an inpatient GI consult, endoscopy (EGD), or colonoscopy at Temple University Hospital from March-June 2020 in addition to patients during the same periods in 2017-2019. Data collected included demographic information, length of stay (LOS), reason for GI consult and procedures performed. For those with GIB, additional data included hemoglobin (hgb) nadir, units of red blood cells (RBCs) transfused and endoscopic therapeutics. Individual patients with multiple admissions were counted as separate entries. Only the index procedure for each admission was used. Analysis performed using SPSS. Results: 1,839 patients with 2,087 unique admissions met inclusion criteria. There were no significant deviations from prior years with regard to age, sex, or race. There were significantly fewer GI consults during Spring 2020 compared to 2017-2019 (108 vs 128 per month, p=0.002);however, there was no change in the number of consults for GIB (62 vs 63 per month, p=0.77). Fewer inpatient EGDs (49 vs 61 per month, p=0.007) and colonoscopies (11 vs 23 per month, p<0.001) were performed for all indications, but there was no difference in procedures performed for GIB in Spring 2020 compared to prior years (38 vs 43 per month, p=0.07). When patients were stratified based on the type of endoscopic procedure performed, there were no significant differences in mean hgb nadir, RBCs transfused or LOS. There was also no significant difference in the proportion requiring endoscopic therapeutics performed in Spring 2020 compared to prior years (37.8% vs 32.6%, p=0.27). Discussion: Despite fewer overall inpatient consults and procedures in Spring 2020, the number of each related to GIB did not differ compared to the monthly averages of prior years. Additionally, there was no difference in the percentage of GIB cases requiring intervention or in severity of GIB. While our data show that management of inpatient GIB did not appreciably change during the pandemic, consults for other GI complaints and non-GIB procedures were less frequent. This study supports the idea that, regardless of an ongoing pandemic, GIB occurs at similar rates to non-pandemic periods, which is perhaps in contrast to studies of other acute inpatient issues with lower pandemic rates such as myocardial infarction and stroke.(Table Presented)(Table Presented)","output":"Covid-19 Pandemic Lowered Rates of Inpatient Gastroenterology Consults and Endoscopic Procedures but Did Not Change Rates of Gastrointestinal Bleeding or Related Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most challenging infectious disease of pig populations causing devastating economic loss to swine industry.

To discover such viral variants, we assembled a cohort of 683 COVID-19 patients;388 inpatients (cases) and 295 outpatients (controls) from April to August 2020 using electronically captured COVID test request forms and sequenced their viral genomes. To improve the analytic power, we accessed 7,137 viral sequences in Washington State to filter out viral single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that did not have significant expansions over the collection period. Applying this filter led to the identification of 53 SNVs that were statistically significant, of which 13 SNVs each had 3 or more variant copies in the discovery cohort. Correlating these selected SNVs with case/control status, eight SNVs were found to significantly associate with inpatient status (q-values<0.01). Using temporal synchrony, we identified a four SNV-haplotype (t19839-g28881-g28882-g28883) which was significantly associated with case/control status (Fishers exact p=2.84*10-11) that appeared in April 2020, peaked in June, and persisted into January 2021.

This special article introduces clinical practice guidelines to prevent secondary transmission of COVID-19 within hemodialysis facilities, which were developed to protect patients, healthcare workers, and caregivers from this highly transmissible virus. The areas of infection control covered by these guidelines include standard precautions, performing dialysis therapy for confirmed or suspected cases, performing cohort isolation for contact patients, and disease monitoring and contact surveillance.

Methods: A surgical registry was reviewed for primary, single-level MIS TLIF patients. Patients were categorized by preoperative ASA score: ASA 1, ASA 2, ASA 3+. Perioperative complications were compared among groups. PROMs for back pain, leg pain, physical function, and disability were recorded preoperatively and at 6-week, 12-week, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year postoperative timepoints. PROM improvement from baseline (PROM) and minimum clinically important difference (MCID) achievement was calculated for each timepoint and compared among groups. MCID achievement was determined as  PROMs that surpassed previously established MCID values. Results: Of the 487 patients, 64 had an ASA classification of 1, whereas 336 had an ASA of 2, and 87 had an ASA of 3 or greater. Rates of complications were not associated with ASA classification (all p>0.050). Neither mean PROM scores nor PROM scores were significantly associated with ASA classification at any timepoint (all p>0.050).

In this study, we investigate the antibody responses induced by heterologous prime-boost with vaccines based on mRNA and virus-like particles (VLPs). The VLP-based mCuMVTT-RBM vaccine candidate and the approved mRNA-1273 vaccine were used for this purpose. We find that homologous prime boost regimens with either mRNA or VLP induced high levels of high avidity antibodies. Optimal antibody responses were, however, induced by heterologous regimens both for priming with mRNA and boosting with VLP and vice versa, priming with VLP and boosting with mRNA.

Infections and their associated symptoms are the common and frequent challenges to human health that are causing severe economic and social consequences around the world. During aging, human immune system undergoes dramatic aging-related changes/dysfunctions known as immunosenescence. Clinically, immunosenescence refers to the gradual deterioration of immune system that increases exposure to infections, and reduces vaccine efficacy. Such phenomenon is linked to impaired immune responses that lead to dysfunction of multiple organs, while lack of physical activity, progressive loss of muscle mass, and concomitant decline in muscle strength facilitate immunosenescence and inflammation. In the present review, we have discussed the role of nutrition and PA, which can boost the immune system alone and synergistically. Evidence suggests that long-term PA is beneficial in improving immune system and preventing various infections. We have further discussed several nutritional strategies for improving the immune system. Unfortunately, the available evidence shows conflicting results. In terms of interaction with food intake, PA does not tend to increase energy intake during a short time course. However, overcoming nutritional deficiencies appears to be the most practical recommendation. Through the balanced nutritious diet intake one can fulfill the bodily requirement of optimal nutrition that significantly impacts the immune system. Supplementation of a single nutrient as food is generally not advisable. Rather incorporating various fruits and vegetables, whole grains, proteins and probiotics may ensure adequate nutrient intake. Therefore, multi-nutrient supplements may benefit people having deficiency in spite of sufficient diet. Along with PA, supplementation of probiotics, bovine colostrum, plant-derived products and functional foods may provide additional benefits in improving the immune system.","output":"Physical Activity and Nutritional Influence on Immune Function: An Important Strategy to Improve Immunity and Health Status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The health, social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have loomed large as every national government made decisions about how to respond. The 40 Health Systems, Covid-19 (40HS.C-19) Study aimed to investigate relationships between governments' capacity to respond (CTR), their response stringency, scope of COVID-19 testing, and COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Data to April 2020 were extracted for 40 national health systems on pre-pandemic government capacity to respond (CTR) (Global Competitiveness Index), stringency measures (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker Stringency Index), approach to COVID-19 testing and COVID-19 cases and deaths (Our-World-in-Data). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis were applied to examine latent dimensions and visualise country similarities and dissimilarities. Outcomes were tested using multivariate and one-way analyses of variances and Kruskal-Wallis H tests. RESULTS: The MDS model found three dimensions explaining 91% of the variance and cluster analysis identified five national groupings. There was no association between national governments' pre-pandemic CTR and the adoption of early stringent public health measures or approach to COVID-19 testing. Two national clusters applied early stringency measures and reported significantly lower cumulative deaths. The best performing national cluster (comprising Australia, South Korea, Iceland and Taiwan) adopted relatively early stringency measures but broader testing earlier than others which was associated with a change in disease trajectory and the lowest COVID-19 death rates. Two clusters (one with high CTR and one low) both adopted late stringency measures and narrow testing and performed least well in COVID-19 outcomes. CONCLUSION: Early stringency measures and intrinsic national capacities to deal with a pandemic are insufficient. Extended stringency measures, important in the short-term, are not economically sustainable.

In this study, we propose that fine-tuning of NLC polarization (and therefore survival of leukemic cells) is dictated by a balance between IL-10 and TNF. ABSTRACT: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are also called nurse-like cells (NLC), and confer survival signals through the release of soluble factors and cellular contacts. While in most patient samples the presence of NLC in co-cultures guarantees high viability of leukemic cells in vitro, in some cases this protective effect is absent. These macrophages are characterized by an M1-like phenotype. We show here that their reprogramming towards an M2-like phenotype (tumor-supportive) with IL-10 leads to an increase in leukemic cell survival. Inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, are also able to depolarize M2-type protective NLC (decreasing CLL cell viability), an effect which is countered by IL-10 or blocking antibodies. Interestingly, both IL-10 and TNF are implied in the pathophysiology of CLL and their elevated level is associated with bad prognosis. We propose that the molecular balance between these two cytokines in CLL niches plays an important role in the maintenance of the protective phenotype of NLCs, and therefore in the survival of CLL cells.","output":"IL-10 Rescues CLL Survival through Repolarization of Inflammatory Nurse-like Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Texas medical students struggle to fight the pandemic in their own way while adjusting to a lot of uncertainty.","output":"The Class of COVID-19: Texas Medical Students Struggle with Uncertainty."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International scientific collaborations have always been regarded as critical actions to address global pandemics, however, there was an obvious uncertainty between international collaboration and the COVID-19 control.

RESULTS: At the county level, the relationship between DE status and readmissions is partially confounded by at least three social risk factors.

Therefore, the aim of the present work was to review the literature available on the topic and provide information about COVID-19, in both healthy and diseased livers, and issue recommendations. The incidence of liver injury specifically associated with COVID-19 varies from 14.8-53%. The majority of case series have reported altered ALT and AST, elevated total bilirubin, and low serum albumin and liver compromise has been associated with the most severe cases of COVID-19. Cirrhosis of the liver has a recognized immune dysfunction status that includes immunodeficiency and systemic inflammation, making it reasonable for those patients to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The recommendations for those patients, in addition to the general measures of physical distancing and handwashing for all persons, include social, medical, and psychologic support during the period of home quarantine to prevent lapses in treatment. Patients should be made aware that they need to keep abreast of changes in recommendations and social policies.","output":"Manifestaciones hepticas y repercusin en el paciente cirrtico de COVID-19./ Manifestaciones hepticas y repercusin en el paciente cirrtico de COVID-19./ Hepatic manifestations and impact of COVID-19 on the cirrhotic patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Under the influence of the COVID-19, the analysis of physical health data is helpful to grasp the physical condition in time and promote the level of prevention and control of the epidemic Especially for novel corona virus asymptomatic infections, the initial analysis of physical health data can help to detect the possibility of virus infection to some extent The digital information system of traditional hospitals and other medical institutions is not perfect For a large number of health data generated by smart medical technology, there is a lack of an effective storage, management, query and analysis platform Especially, it lacks the ability of mining valuable information from big data Aiming at the above problems, the idea of combining Struts 2 and Hadoop in the system architecture of the platform is proposed in this paper Data mining association algorithm is adopted and improved based on MapReduce A service platform for college students' physical health is designed to solve the storage, processing and mining of health big data The experiment result shows that the system can effectively complete the processing and analysis of the big data of College students' physical health, which has a certain reference value for college students' physical health monitoring during the COVID-19 epidemic [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems is the property of IOS Press and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Health data analysis based on multi-calculation of big data during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: SARS CoV-2 infection has been associated with long-term sequelae, including cough. The clinical course of chronic cough following SARS CoV-2 infection and therapies are not known. This study examined the prevalence and characteristics of chronic cough following SARS CoV-2 infection, aiming to assess its course, impact on patient well-being and predisposing factors. Methods: 113 patients were analysed as part of PREDICT UK follow up (NHS HRA: 20/HRA/2344) at 3 to 6 months (mean 152 days) after admission for a PCR positive SARS CoV2 infection. The baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were examined to assess contributing mechanisms that may predispose to chronic cough (defined as &gt;8 weeks following SARS CoV2 infection). Results: 41.5% patients did not have a cough. In contrast, 24% of patients had an acute cough (&lt;3 weeks), 10.6% had subacute cough (3 to 8 weeks), and 21.6% had chronic cough (&gt;8 weeks). 1.7% of patients had a pre-existing cough, unchanged following COVID-19. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population are summarised in Table 1.50% of the cough group had a pre-existing lung disease (mainly airways disease), compared to 16% of patients without cough (P &lt; 0.001). No differences in hypoxia, inflammation or infection markers (CRP) were noted between the 2 groups at admission. Diffusion Capacity for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO) was significantly reduced in those with cough compared with the non-cough group (32.2% vs 57.7%;P = 0.02). No significant differences in cough was noted between patients treated with different ventilator support strategies i.e. ITU and CPAP vs simple oxygen supplementation. Conclusions: This study notes a prevalence of chronic cough in 21.6% of patients post COVID-19. This was not associated with airway obstruction, reducing the likelihood of post infective bronchoconstriction. There was a significant reduction in DLCO consistent with post-infective interstitial lung disease (ILD). This study has looked at first-wave patients where dexamethasone was minimally used. Future studies reviewing cough with steroids therapy in patients requiring oxygen supplementation may note reduced levels of chronic cough. The use of cough as marker of post- COVID ILD warrants investigation. The current findings are in keeping with previous reports in SARS and MERS, where DLCO impairments were noted with time resolution of up to two years.","output":"Prevalence of chronic cough following COVID-19 infection: A cross sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The effectiveness of remdesivir, a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been repeatedly questioned during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Most of the recently reported studies were randomized controlled multicentre clinical trials. Our goal was to test the efficiency of remdesivir in reducing nasopharyngeal viral load and hospitalization length in a real-life setting in patients admitted to a large tertiary centre in Israel. METHODS: A total of 142 COVID-19 patients found to have at least three reported SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR tests during hospitalization were selected for this study. Of these, 29 patients received remdesivir, while the remaining non-treated 113 patients served as controls. RESULTS: Among the tested parameters, the control and remdesivir groups differed significantly only in the intubation rates. Remdesivir treatment did not significantly affect nasopharyngeal viral load, as determined by comparing the differences between the first and last cycle threshold values of the SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR tests performed during hospitalization (cycle threshold 7.07  6.85 vs. 7.08  7.27, p 0.977 in the control and treated groups, respectively). Remdesivir treatment shortened hospitalization length by less than a day compared with non-treated controls and by 3.1 days when non-intubated patients from both groups were compared. These differences, however, were not statistically significant, possibly because of the small size of the remdesivir group. DISCUSSION: Remdesivir was not associated with nasopharyngeal viral load changes, but our study had a significant disease severity baseline imbalance and was not powered to detect viral load or clinical differences.","output":"A real-life setting evaluation of the effect of remdesivir on viral load in COVID-19 patients admitted to a large tertiary centre in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While studies have explored how health sector corruption, weak healthcare system, large-scale immune compromised population, misinformation and prevalence of highly congested slums contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria, they have glossed over the impact of political distrust on the spread of the virus. This study explores the impact of political distrust on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. The study utilised qualitative dominant mixed methods approach comprising telephone interviews and a survey of 120 educated Nigerians purposively selected from four COVID-19 most affected states including Lagos, Oyo, Kano and Rivers as well as the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The study also relied on secondary data on the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria sourced from Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control from 27 February to 31st August 2020. The study found that political corruption motivates large-scale political distrust. This undermines public compliance to government protocols, limits the outcomes of government responses to COVID-19 and facilitates the spread of the virus in Nigeria. The paper concludes that improving government accountability in the public sector management is relevant for building public trust, promoting citizens' compliance to COVID-19 safety measure and mitigating the spread of the pandemic in Nigeria and beyond.","output":"Political distrust and the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination plays a vital role in controlling diseases caused by chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the specific amino acids contributing to S2 epitopes. Site mutagenesis and peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) showed that 16R in S2 protein was a key amino acid mediating the antigenicity of S2 protein. S2-derived peptides with 16R, but not those with 16 K, could react with sera against different types of IBVs. Notably, a commercial ELISA kit for detection of antibodies against IBV did not react with sera against all types of IBVs. Taken together, these data demonstrated that S2-derived peptides with 16R could be used as novel marker-based antigens for developing both broad-spectrum vaccines and serological diagnostic kits to control IBV.","output":"Peptides with 16R in S2 protein showed broad reactions with sera against different types of infectious bronchitis viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: English youth typically do not sufficiently engage in the types and intensities of physical activity that develop muscular fitness. The aim of this study was to use a combination of qualitative techniques to explore adolescent boys understanding, perceptions, and experiences of physical activity and the role muscular fitness plays within boys physically active lifestyles. Methods: Focus group interviews with a write, draw, show, and tell activity were conducted with 32 adolescent boys aged 14C16 years from 3 secondary schools. Three separate sources of data (frequency counts, verbatim transcripts, and visual data) were generated and were pooled together and triangulated. Data were analysed deductively, first using the Youth Physical Activity Promotion model as a thematic framework, and then inductively. Results: Physical activity was frequently associated with organised sport, and most boys were unaware of current UK physical activity guidelines. Co-participation was frequently reported as a reinforcing factor to physical activity. Conclusions: There was a perceived lack of opportunity to participate in muscular fitness activities, particularly in school, and knowledge of how to conduct muscular fitness activities was limited.

The objective of this study was to evaluate a community pharmacist AKI education programme aimed at patient self-management during acute dehydrating illnesses. METHODS This was a multimethod study. Potential participants were identified by community pharmacists when they presented a prescription containing a study medicine. The intervention consisted of completion of a short demographic questionnaire and a pharmacist providing verbal AKI information and advice on self-management during acute dehydrating illness, including medicine withholding. This information was supported with take-home information. Participants were telephoned between 4 and 11 months later and invited to participate in a structured telephone interview. Descriptive statistics were generated from questionnaire responses, and interview data were analysed using manifest content analysis. KEY FINDINGS One hundred and thirteen adults were recruited and 93 (82%) interviewed. Fifty-four (58%) interviewees remembered the pharmacist's education, and 51 (55%) had retained the information sheet. Fifty-eight (62%) would temporarily withhold medicines during acute dehydrating illnesses. Thirty-nine were comfortable they knew when to restart their medicines; 15 (38%) indicated this was once symptom-free for 48 h. Forty-six interviewees were comfortable about contacting their general practice; 16 (35%) would do this after 24 h of illness. Participants found the educational content and pharmacist approach acceptable. CONCLUSION A majority of participants accepted and remembered the information provided by their community pharmacist and felt comfortable to self-manage during acute dehydrating illness.

The results from the scenario simulations suggest that the global total output is projected to fall by 3.60% and 8.41% under the V-shaped and L-shaped recovery scenarios, respectively, and that the propagation through input-output linkages is an important channel that causes global economic fluctuations. Economies at the hub of the production network, that is, the United States, China, and Germany, are the most seriously affected.

Because RSV passive immunisations, including maternal vaccination and monoclonal antibodies, can only grant a temporary period of protection, their effectiveness and efficiency will be determined by the timing of the immunisation relative to the underlying RSV seasonality. We aimed to assess the potential effect of different approaches for passive RSV immunisation of infants in LMICs. METHODS: We included 52 LMICs in this study on the basis of the availability of RSV seasonality data and developed a mathematical model to compare the effect of different RSV passive immunisation approaches (seasonal approaches vs a year-round approach). For each candidate approach, we calculated the expected annual proportion of RSV incidence among infants younger than 6 months averted (effectiveness) and the ratio of per-dose cases averted between that approach and the year-round approach (relative efficiency). FINDINGS: 39 (75%) of 52 LMICs included in the study had clear RSV seasonality, defined as having more than 75% of annual RSV cases occurring in 5 or fewer months. In these countries with clear RSV seasonality, the seasonal approach in which monoclonal antibody administration began 3 months before RSV season onset was only a median of 16% (IQR 13C18) less effective in averting RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) hospital admissions than a year-round approach, but was a median of 70% (50C97) more efficient in reducing RSV-associated hospital admissions per dose. The seasonal approach that delivered maternal vaccination 1 month before the season onset was a median of 27% (25C33) less effective in averting hospital admissions associated with RSV-ALRI than a year-round approach, but was a median of 126% (87C177) more efficient at averting these hospital admissions per dose. INTERPRETATION: In LMICs with clear RSV seasonality, seasonal approaches to monoclonal antibody and maternal vaccine administration might optimise disease prevention by dose given compared with year-round administration. More data are needed to clarify if seasonal administration of RSV monoclonal antibodies or maternal immunisation is programmatically suitable and cost effective in LMICs.

The majority (89.5%) of these cases occurred in dogs <12 months of age, indicating failure of the primary vaccination course to provide protective immunity (most likely due to interference of the vaccine antigen with maternal antibodies but other reasons are discussed). Extending the age at which the final puppy vaccination is administered might be one of several strategies to consider. The final multivariate model showed that in non-litter CPV cases, risk of death was significantly associated with season of diagnosis (summer) and pedigree type (hounds and non-sporting dogs). Euthanasia in non-litter CPV cases was significantly associated with season of diagnosis (summer), state of residence (Northern Territory/South Australia/Tasmania combined), age (<six months) and vaccination status (unvaccinated and unknown).

METHODS: The participants in the study were 119 middle school students in J city. The measurements included a self-efficacy scale, a self-control scale, a social support scale, and the Internet Addiction Scale for Youth. Data were analyzed using the independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, one-way analysis of variance, the Scheff test, Pearson correlation coefficients, and multiple-regression using SPSS version 22.0. Mediation effects were analyzed by the Sobel test and Baron and Kenny's hierarchical analysis technique. RESULTS: Significant correlations were found among self-efficacy, self-control, and internet addiction. Social support had partial mediating effects in the relationship between self-efficacy and internet addiction, as well as in the relationship between self-control and internet addition. CONCLUSION: In order to prevent internet addiction, the promotion of interactions among peers, which is a component of social support, is particularly important. It is also necessary to promote face-to-face activities that can strengthen relationships.

A 57-year-old man with obstructive sleep apnea presented with a T0N1M0 right sided, human papillomavirus related head and neck cancer diagnosed with excisional lymph node biopsy. On further work-up, the cancer was found to originate in the right tonsil and was staged as T1N1. The patient started definitive treatment with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, but after 5 treatments, was no longer able to lay in a supine position for treatment. Diagnostic imaging work-up eventually revealed an idiopathic right sided hemi-diaphragm eventration. After consultation with cardiology, pulmonology and head and neck surgery, recommendation was made for tracheostomy in order to tolerate supine radiotherapy position, but the patient refused. Instead, CT simulation for radiotherapy re-planning was performed using a combination of biphasic cuirass ventilation, home continuous positive airway pressure and oxygen. The patient then tolerated definitive treatment to a dose of 69.96 Gray in 33 fractions with concurrent chemotherapy, with no unexpected side effects. Although complex, daily treatment set-up was consistent. Daily onboard imaging was precise and accurate. The patient continues to follow-up with radiation oncology, medical oncology and pulmonology. This is the first use of biphasic cuirass ventilator supported radiotherapy reported in the scientific literature. Although daily treatment set-up is complex, its use could be considered in patients unable to tolerate radiotherapy treatment positioning as an alternative to tracheostomy.","output":"Novel Use of Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation During Definitive Radiotherapy: A Technical Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, many countries around the world created and enforced heavy restrictions geared towards reducing the spread of the coronavirus (i.e., COVID-19).

MATERIALS AND METHODS The local institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant study. Veterans were screened for contraindications and gave written informed consent before the study. In a semiblinded retrospective protocol, veterans in three Gulf War illness groups-syndrome 1 (impaired cognition), syndrome 2 (confusion-ataxia), and syndrome 3 (central neuropathic pain)-and a control group received intravenous infusions of saline in an initial session and physostigmine in a second session, 48 hours later. Each infusion was followed by measurement of hippocampal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with pulsed ASL. A mixed-effects linear model adjusted for age was used to test for differences in rCBF after the cholinergic challenge across the four groups. RESULTS Physostigmine significantly decreased hippocampal rCBF in control subjects (P < .0005) and veterans with syndrome 1 (P < .05) but significantly increased hippocampal rCBF in veterans with syndrome 2 (P < .005) and veterans with syndrome 3 (P < .002). The abnormal increase in rCBF was found to have progressed to the left hippocampus of the veterans with syndrome 2 and to both hippocampi of the veterans with syndrome 3.

Therefore, it is currently considered as one of the most important global health problems of human societies and there is an urgent need for potent drugs or vaccines which can effectively combat this virus. The chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role in the viral replication inside the host and thus is a promising drug target to design and develop effective antiviral drugs against SARS and other coronaviruses. This study evaluated some antiviral coumarin phytochemicals as potential inhibitors of coronaviruses 3CLpro by in silico approaches such as molecular docking, ADMET prediction, molecular dynamics simulation, and MM-PBSA binding energy calculation. Natural coumarin derivatives were docked to the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and for further investigation, docked to the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The docking scores of these natural compounds were compared with 3CLpro referenced inhibitors (ritonavir and lopinavir) and co-crystal inhibitor N3. Molecular docking studies suggested more than half of the coumarin phytochemicals had favorable interaction at the binding pocket of the coronaviruses 3CLpro and exhibited better binding affinities toward 3CLpro than ritonavir and lopinavir. Most antiviral phytochemicals interact strongly with one or both the catalytic dyad residues (His41 and Cys145) and the other key residues of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Further, MD simulation and binding free energy calculations using MM-PBSA were carried out for three 3CLpro-coumarin complexes and 3CLpro-N3/lopinavir. The results confirmed that the 3CLpro-glycycoumarin, 3CLpro-oxypeucedanin hydrate, and 3CLpro-inophyllum P complexes were highly stable, experience fewer conformation fluctuations and share a similar degree of compactness. Also, the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness studies showed good results for the selected coumarin phytochemicals.Therefore, the coumarin phytochemicals could be used as antiviral agents in the treatment of COVID-19 after further studies.

However, PE prevalence (28%) was high compared with some studies. Our hypothesis was that the use of SPECT V/Q may be responsible for an overdiagnosis of PE, especially at the implementation phase of the test. The aim was to carry out a time trend analysis of the evolution over the years of PE diagnosis with SPECT V/Q. PATIENTS AND METHODS To evaluate the time trend of SPECT V/Q results, the conclusions of all SPECT V/Q scans performed for a suspected acute PE in our department from April 2011 to December 2016 were collected. To confirm the safety of a diagnostic management on the basis of SPECT V/Q to rule out PE, a retrospective observational study of the outcome of patients assessed with SPECT V/Q for suspected acute PE was carried out during the period 2014-2016. SPECT V/Q was interpreted using a diagnostic cutoff of one segmental or two subsegmental mismatches. The final diagnostic conclusion was established by the physician responsible for patient care. The safety of SPECT V/Q was assessed by monitoring the risk of thromboembolic events during the 3-month follow-up period in patients left untreated on the basis of a negative SPECT V/Q. RESULTS Over the period 2011-2016, an average 16% (95% confidence interval: 10-22%) annual reduction in the proportion of positive SPECT V/Q results was observed. The percentage of positive SPECT V/Q results was 25.3% over the period 2011-2013 compared with 16.3% in 2014-2016 (P<0.0001). Out of the 696 patients analyzed over the period 2014-2016, the SPECT V/Q was positive, indeterminate, and negative in 118, 3, and 575 patients, respectively. The 3-month thromboembolic risk in patients in whom PE was deemed absent according to the SPECT V/Q was 3/543=0.55% (95% confidence interval 0.19-1.61). CONCLUSION A continuous decrease in the annual proportion of positive SPECT V/Q results was mainly observed while maintaining the safety of the test to rule out PE. Explanatory factors include the introduction of a combined SPECT/CT scan, increased experience and familiarity with the test, and an increased awareness of the risks and consequences of overdiagnosing PE.","output":"Time trend analysis of pulmonary embolism diagnosis with single-photon emission computed tomography ventilation/perfusion imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we present a hybrid deep learning framework named CTNet which combines convolutional neural network and transformer together for the detection of COVID-19 via 3D chest CT images.

However, some contrasting evidence exists in the literature with regard to commonly reported risk factors. In this study, we investigated whether the known risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections have a stronger effect for either infection. This retrospective study included samples from 696 cats seropositive for FIV and 593 cats seropositive for FeLV from the United States and Canada. Data were collected during two cross sectional studies, where cats were tested using IDEXX FIV/FeLV ELISA kits. To compare the effect of known risk factors for FIV infection compared to FeLV, using a case-case study design, random intercept logistic regression models were fit including cats age, sex, neuter status, outdoor exposure, health status and type of testing facility as independent variables. A random intercept for testing facility was included to account for clustering expected in testing practices at the individual clinics and shelters. RESULTS: In the multivariable random intercept model, the odds of FIV compared to FeLV positive ELISA results were greater for adults (OR = 2.09, CI: 1.50-2.92), intact males (OR = 3.14, CI: 1.85-3.76), neutered males (OR = 2.68, CI: 1.44- 3.14), cats with outdoor access (OR = 2.58, CI: 1.85-3.76) and lower for cats with clinical illness (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.52-0.90).

Results showed that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in all samples, including viral strains harboring mutations in the Spike coding sequence that became dominant in the pandemic. Given the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their rapid spread in some populations, fourplex rRT-PCR assay containing four primer-probe sets represents a reliable approach to allow quicker detection of circulating relevant variants in a single reaction.","output":"Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its first variants in fourplex real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: This observational study aimed to investigate the possible influence of sexual behavior and demographic characteristics in the expression of HPV-related biomarkers in a colposcopy population. Lifestyle factors that impacted HPV DNA positivity in a statistically significant manner were younger age at first sexual intercourse, a history of more than four sexual partners as well as a partner change during the last year before HPV DNA assessment. Although ambitious, the development and validation of lifestyle scoring systems that combine molecular and epidemiological patient data to effectively predict underlying cervical pathology will represent a milestone in the quest of cervical cancer prevention. ABSTRACT: Despite the significant scientific evolution in primary and secondary cervical cancer prevention in the battle started by George Papanicolaou in the previous century, global cervical cancer mortality rates remain disappointing. The widespread implementation of HPV-related molecular markers has paved the way to tremendous developments in cervical cancer screening, with the transition from cytological approach to the more accurate and cost-effective HPV testing modalities. However, the academic audience and different health systems have not yet adopted a universal approach in screening strategies, and even artificial intelligence modalities have been utilized from the multidisciplinary scientific armamentarium. Combination algorithms, scoring systems as well as artificial intelligent models have been so far proposed for cervical screening and management. The impact of sexual lifestyle inherently possesses a key role in the prevalence of HPV-related biomarkers. This study aimed to investigate any possible influence of sexual behavior and demographic characteristics in the expression of HPV-related biomarkers in a colposcopy population from October 2016 to June 2017, and corroborated the determining role of age at fist intercourse; the older the age, the lower the probability for DNA positivity. Multivariate analysis illustrated additionally that a number of sexual partners exceeding 4.2 was crucial, with women with 5 partners being approximately four times less likely to harbor a positive HPV DNA test (p < 0.0001). Similarly, a reported partner change during the last year before HPV DNA assessment contributed to 2.5 times higher odds for DNA positivity (p = 0.0006). From this perspective, the further development and validation of scoring systems quantifying lifestyle factors that could reflect cervical precancer risk seems paramount.","output":"The Influence of Sexual Behavior and Demographic Characteristics in the Expression of HPV-Related Biomarkers in a Colposcopy Population of Reproductive Age Greek Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unexpected pandemic initiated by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused severe panic among people around the world since December 2019. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has wreaked havoc, and Health Authorities have started to make announcements and studies have been started quickly, for effective treatment and vaccination. In studies, drugs that reduce the symptoms of COVID-19 and alleviate the course of the disease have been used. In addition to the effects of these promising drugs, adverse events and multiple drug interactions have begun to appear all over the world, as well as in our country. Therefore, pharmacovigilance is of particular importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health authorities have been taking additional actions and measures to carry out adverse effects monitoring and risk minimization activities of drugs.

Nevertheless, in the light of existing literature, the effectiveness of conventional coagulation on microplastics removal is insufficient. Hence, enhanced coagulation is worth being explored. This study investigated the improving performance of anionic polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium alginate (SA), and activated silicic acid (ASA) when using poly?aluminum chloride (PAC) to remove polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics. The experimental results showed that ASA had the highest removal efficiency (54.70%) under conventional dosage, while PAM achieved the best removal effect (91.45%) at high dosage. Mechanism of coagulation was studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the results illustrated that when only PAC existed or the dosage of coagulant aids was low, double layer compression was the main principle. The increase of coagulant aids dosage improved the effect of adsorption and sweep flocculation significantly.

Vaccination plays a central role in reducing the severity and potentially the spread of the disease. In healthcare, this is important to prevent disease-related staff shortages. However, there is a lack of data on factors influencing the humoral immune response. Aim The aim of our study was to determine factors influencing the level of Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike IgG after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination in healthcare workers. Methods 1,750 study participants were recruited who met the following inclusion criteria: age [] 18 years, PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination, working in health care. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike IgG titres were determined by SERION ELISA agile SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Results Mean Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike IgG levels increased significantly with the number of COVID-19 vaccinations (92.2 BAU/ml for single dose, 140.9 BAU/ml for two doses and 1,144.3 BAU/ml after threefold vaccination). Hybrid COVID-19 immunized respondents (after infection and vaccination) had significantly higher antibody titres compared with participants after infection only (525.4 BAU/ml vs. 105.7 BAU/ml). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike IgG titres declined significantly with time after administration of the second vaccine dose. Smoking and high age were associated with lower titres. Conclusion Both recovered and vaccinated HCWs presented a predominantly good humoral immune response with decreasing antibody levels over the temporal course. Smoking and higher age limited the humoral SARS-CoV-2 immunity. This reduced immune response is an important aspect as people with these risk factors are recognized as people with an increased risk for a severe course of disease.","output":"Influencing factors of Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike IgG antibody titres in healthcare workers - A cross-section study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 is pandemic which recently crossed the hundred million mark of infection cases all over the world.

Unfortunately, hand hygiene adherence of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Japan is suboptimal according to previous studies. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to evaluate hand hygiene adherence among physicians and nurses before touching hospitalized patients and to evaluate changes in hand hygiene adherence after a multimodal intervention was implemented. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a pre- and postintervention study with HCWs at four tertiary hospitals in Niigata, Japan. Hand hygiene observations were conducted from June to August 2018 (preintervention) and February to March 2019 (postintervention). INTERVENTION: The multimodal hand hygiene intervention recommended by the World Health Organization was tailored to each hospital and implemented from September 2018 to February 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We observed hand hygiene adherence before touching patients in each hospital and compared rates before and after intervention. Intervention components were also evaluated. RESULTS: There were 2,018 patient observations preintervention and 1,630 postintervention. Overall, hand hygiene adherence improved from 453 of 2,018 preintervention observations (22.4%) to 548 of 1,630 postintervention observations (33.6%; P < .001). Rates improved more among nurses (13.9 percentage points) than among doctors (5.7 percentage points). Improvement varied among the hospitals: Hospital B (18.4 percentage points) was highest, followed by Hospitals D (11.4 percentage points), C (11.3 percentage points), and Hospital A (6.5 percentage points).

All patients had Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors-defined disease progression documented within 12 months before baseline. A total of 171 patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive best supportive care with either sunitinib at a dose of 37.5 mg per day or placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival; secondary end points included the objective response rate, overall survival, and safety. RESULTS The study was discontinued early, after the independent data and safety monitoring committee observed more serious adverse events and deaths in the placebo group as well as a difference in progression-free survival favoring sunitinib. Median progression-free survival was 11.4 months in the sunitinib group as compared with 5.5 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26 to 0.66; P<0.001). A Cox proportional-hazards analysis of progression-free survival according to baseline characteristics favored sunitinib in all subgroups studied. The objective response rate was 9.3% in the sunitinib group versus 0% in the placebo group.

Objective: To estimate the associations between prison crowding, community COVID-19 transmission, and prison incidence rates of COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a longitudinal ecological study among all incarcerated persons in 14 Massachusetts state prisons between April 21, 2020, and January 11, 2021. Exposures: The primary exposure of interest was prison crowding, measured by (1) the size of the incarcerated population as a percentage of the prison's design capacity and (2) the percentage of incarcerated persons housed in single-cell units. The analysis included the weekly COVID-19 incidence in the county where each prison is located as a covariate. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the weekly COVID-19 incidence rate as determined by positive SARS-CoV-2 tests among incarcerated persons at each prison over discrete 1-week increments. Results: There was on average 6876 people incarcerated in 14 prisons during the study period. The median level of crowding during the observation period ranged from 25% to 155% of design capacity. COVID-19 incidence was significantly higher in prisons where the incarcerated population was a larger percentage of the prison's design capacity (incidence rate ratio [IRR] per 10-percentage-point difference, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03-1.27). COVID-19 incidence was lower in prisons where a higher proportion of incarcerated people were housed in single-cell units (IRR for each 10-percentage-point increase in single-cell units, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73-0.93).
