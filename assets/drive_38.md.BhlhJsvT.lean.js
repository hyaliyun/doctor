MSC-based tissue engineered constructs are generally considered a safe procedure, however, the long-term results obtained up to now are far from satisfactory. The main causes of these therapeutic limitations are inefficient homing, engraftment, and directional differentiation. Flavonoids are a secondary metabolite, widely existed in nature and have many biological activities. For a long time, researchers have confirmed the anti-osteoporosis effect of flavonoids through in vitro cell experiments, animal studies. In recent years the regulatory effects of flavonoids on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) differentiation have been received increasingly attention. Recent studies revealed flavonoids possess the ability to modulate self-renewal and differentiation potential of MSCs.

For laboratories, data entry of multiple variables both at pre-analytical steps and again in laboratory information systems (LIS) is time-consuming and difficult to implement in a resource-limited setting and negatively affects the timeliness of the surveillance system. We set up a simple harmonized laboratory query that summarized 22 public-health relevant scenarios and variables, reduced to a two-digit code. Methods & Materials Information data specialists were mobilized to integrate data from the 108 different LIS using the harmonized query, which provided timely access to COVID-19 testing indications, volumes, and positivity rates stratified by age, health region, clinical settings, outbreak context or Health-Care worker status. The information system allowed to develop multiple indicators for a better understanding of the pandemic and the COVID-19 transmission in population subgroups. Results Dashboards were available for public health and infection prevention and control officers in their location. Multiple stakeholders were able to interpret real-time data for more than 40 000 different qPCR tests every day. The data allowed to adjust prescription practice and promote optimal usage and plan contingencies within Quebec's qPCR lab capacities. It also served as the basis to monitor community transmission through test positivity rate in various settings. The coding system also allowed labs to easily implement sample triage, which reduced turnaround time to less than 24h for most samples. Starting May 2021, public health authorities add monitoring of the positive predictive value of rapid antigen test used at the community level to support evidence-based public health decisions about the best possible use of those assays. Conclusion This simple scenario-based coding system allowed timely PH and management of both sampling and processing priorities which proved most useful during surge periods. Quebec Public Health Authorities were better able to target preventive actions and to plan outreach screening activities in subpopulations, neighbourhoods, and communities, while modulating clinical criteria to get access to testing and allowing laboratories to better triage samples.","output":"Harmonized Scenario-Based Laboratory Coding System to Guide Real-Time Public Health Actions in Quebec Province, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibiotic overprescribing is one of the main drivers of the global and growing problem of antibiotic resistance, especially in primary care and for respiratory tract infections (RTIs). RTIs are the most common reason for patients to consult out-of-hours (OOH) primary care. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way general practitioners (GPs) work, both during office hours and OOH. In Belgian OOH primary care, remote consultations with the possibility of issuing prescriptions and telephone triage were implemented. We aimed to describe the impact of COVID-19 on GPs antibiotic prescribing during OOH primary care. In an observational study, using routinely collected health data from GP cooperatives (GPCs) in Flanders, we analyzed GPs antibiotic prescriptions in 2019 (10 GPCs) and 2020 (20 GPCs) during OOH consultations (telephone and face-to-face). We used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling to identify any changes after lockdowns were implemented. In total, 388,293 contacts and 268,430 prescriptions were analyzed in detail. The number of antibiotic prescriptions per weekend, per 100,000 population was 11.47 (95% CI: 9.08C13.87) or 42.9% lower after compared to before the implementation of lockdown among all contacts. For antibiotic prescribing per contact, we found a decrease of 12.2 percentage points (95% CI: 10.6C13.7) or 56.5% among all contacts and of 5.3 percentage points (95% CI: 3.7C6.9) or 23.2% for face-to-face contacts only. The decrease in the number of prescriptions was more pronounced for cases with respiratory symptoms that corresponded with symptoms of COVID-19 and for antibiotics that are frequently prescribed for RTIs, such as amoxicillin (a decrease of 64.9%) and amoxicillin/clavulanate (a decrease of 38.1%) but did not appear for others such as nitrofurantoin. The implementation of COVID-19 lockdown measures coincided with an unprecedented drop in the number of antibiotic prescriptions, which can be explained by a decrease in face-to-face patient contacts, as well as a lower number of antibiotics prescriptions per face-to-face patient contact. The decrease was seen for antibiotics used for RTIs but not for nitrofurantoin, the first-choice antibiotic for urinary tract infections.","output":"Antibiotic Prescribing Trends in Belgian Out-of-Hours Primary Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study Using Routinely Collected Health Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Recent strides in computational structural biology have opened up an opportunity to understand previously uncharacterised proteins. The under-representation of transmembrane proteins in the Protein Data Bank highlights the need to apply new and advanced bioinformatics methods to shed light on their structure and function. This study focuses on a family of transmembrane proteins containing the Pfam domain PF09335 ('SNARE_ASSOC'/ VTT /Tvp38). One prominent member, Tmem41b, has been shown to be involved in early stages of autophagosome formation and is vital in mouse embryonic development as well as being identified as a viral host factor of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We used evolutionary covariance-derived information to construct and validate ab initio models, make domain boundary predictions and infer local structural features. Results: The results from the structural bioinformatics analysis of Tmem41b and its homologues showed that they contain a tandem repeat that is clearly visible in evolutionary covariance data but much less so by sequence analysis. Furthermore, cross-referencing of other prediction data with covariance analysis showed that the internal repeat features two-fold rotational symmetry. Ab initio modelling of Tmem41b and homologues reinforces these structural predictions. Local structural features predicted to be present in Tmem41b were also present in Cl (-)/H (+ )antiporters. Conclusions: The results of this study strongly point to Tmem41b and its homologues being transporters for an as-yet uncharacterised substrate and possibly using H (+) antiporter activity as its mechanism for transport.","output":"In silico prediction of structure and function for a large family of transmembrane proteins that includes human Tmem41b"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Early detection of mortality risk is important in patients diagnosed with of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the predictive value of different clinical and laboratory parameters in disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients admission date, discharge date, intensive care transfer/ death date, contact history, smoking, symptoms at the time admission, vital markers at admission, and laboratory parameters were recorded. Results: The study included a total of 347 patients, of whom 168 (48.4%) were female. The mean age of the patients was 59.6916.87 (14-97) years, while 40.9% (n=142) were aged over 65 years. Overall, 10.1% (n=35) of the patients required transfer to an intensive care unit and 8.4% (n=29) were deceased. When clinical parameters were evaluated at the time of admission, oxygen saturation was found to be lower in the group that died (79.516.95), compared to the survivors (88.786.11) (p<0.001). Additionally, male gender (p=0.05), advanced age (p<0.001), positive PCR result (p=0.036), congestive heart failure (p=0.044), severe COVID-19 involvement on thorax CT (p<0.001), and presence of at least one comorbidity (p=0.003) were observed at a higher rate in the mortality group. In the multivariate analyses, increased values of the NLR (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00-1.08), creatinine (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.13-1.66), CRP (=-0.18, OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99), GGT (OR: 1.006, 95% CI: 1.001-1.012), age (OR: 5.67, 95% CI: 2.24-14.38), male gender (OR: 2.38, 95% CI: 0.98-5.75), and presence of any comorbidity (OR: 5.23, 95% CI: 2.08-13.13) were associated with mortality. Conclusions: Several clinical and laboratory parameters, such as advanced age, male gender, presence of any comorbidity, and NLR, GGT, CRP and creatinine levels at the time of admission can predict mortality in COVID-19 patients. These parameters obtained at the time of admission can contribute to the reduction of mortality through a closer clinical and laboratory follow-up in these patients.

To examine this, the complete genomic sequences of the two subpopulations of the VicS vaccine, VicS-v and VicS-del, were determined. Compared with VicS-v, the more attenuated VicS-del strain had two non-synonymous changes in the non-structural protein 6 (nsp6), a transmembrane (TM) domain that may participate in autocatalytic release of the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, a polymorphic difference at the end of the S2 gene, which coincided with the body transcription-regulating sequence (B-TRS) of mRNA 3 and a truncated open reading frame for a peptide encoded by gene 4 (4b). These genetic differences could be responsible for the differences between these variants in pathogenicity in vivo, and replication in vitro. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome showed that VicS-v and VicS-del did not cluster with strains from other countries, supporting the hypothesis that Australian IBV strains have been evolving independently for some time, and analyses of individual polymerase peptide and S glycoprotein genes suggested a distant common ancestor with no recent recombination. This study suggests the potential role of the TM domain in nsp6, the integrity of the S2 protein and the B-TRS 3, and the putative accessory protein 4b, as well as the 3 untranslated region, in the virulence and replication of IBV and has provided a better understanding of relationships between the Australian vaccine strain of IBV and those used elsewhere.","output":"Analysis of the complete genomic sequences of two virus subpopulations of the Australian infectious bronchitis virus vaccine VicS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The need for protective masks greatly exceeds their global supply during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

To date, only a few adjuvants have been approved for use in humans, among which aluminum-containing adjuvants are the only ones widely used. However, the medical need for potent and safe adjuvants is currently continuously increasing, especially those triggering cellular immune responses for cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation, which are urgently needed for the development of efficient virus and cancer vaccines. Manganese is an essential micronutrient required for diverse biological activities, but its functions in immunity remain undefined. We previously reported that Mn(2+) is important in the host defense against cytosolic dsDNA by facilitating cGAS-STING activation and that Mn(2+) alone directly activates cGAS independent of dsDNA, leading to an unconventional catalytic synthesis of 23-cGAMP. Herein, we found that Mn(2+) strongly promoted immune responses by facilitating antigen uptake, presentation, and germinal center formation via both cGAS-STING and NLRP3 activation. Accordingly, a colloidal manganese salt (Mn jelly, MnJ) was formulated to act not only as an immune potentiator but also as a delivery system to stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses, inducing antibody production and CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell proliferation and activation by either intramuscular or intranasal immunization. When administered intranasally, MnJ also worked as a mucosal adjuvant, inducing high levels of secretory IgA.

METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We aim to recall a prospective cohort (n=200) of Latinx/Hispanic mothers from an ongoing study, power analysis will estimate minimum sample size (power=0.80 and alpha =0.05). Assessments of pandemic related maternal stress (PRMS) will be done with the COVID-19 and Perinatal Experiences Interview, perceived stress scale, and Parental Stress Index. Bonding, attachment, and trauma history will be assessed with psychological questionnaires and Childs behaviors with the Ackerman-CBCL questionnaire. Descriptive statistical analysis will be done. Correlations will identify associations and multivariate models will assess the role of parental bonding and effects of maternal attachment/trauma on associations to PRMS and child behavioral outcomes (controlling for confounding effects). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: First, we expect to find that mothers will report higher levels of stress (pandemic related, perceived, and parental) which will be associated with less bonding behaviors towards her child. Second, we expect that mothers levels of PRMS will be mediated by poorer bonding characteristics thus leading to negative child behavioral outcomes (i.e., poor regulation, crying spells, alterations in physiological patterns, and social-emotional developmental outcomes). Further mothers insecure attachment traits and trauma history will moderate perception of stress and negative child behavioral outcomes. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Results will describe stress in Latinx/Hispanics mothers during the pandemic and effects on child development.

AIM: To explore the characteristics and predictive markers of severely and critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at the B11 Zhongfaxincheng campus and E1-3 Guanggu campus of Tongji Hospital affiliated with Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan. Patients with COVID-19 admitted from 1(st) February 2020 to 8(th) March 2020 were enrolled and categorized into 3 groups: The moderate group, severe group and critically ill group. Epidemiological data, demographic data, clinical symptoms and outcomes, complications, laboratory tests and radiographic examinations were collected retrospectively from the hospital information system and then compared between groups. RESULTS: A total of 126 patients were enrolled. There were 59 in the moderate group, 49 in the severe group, and 18 in the critically ill group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age [odd ratio (OR) = 1.055, 95% (confidence interval) CI: 1.099-1.104], elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (OR = 4.019, 95%CI: 1.045-15.467) and elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (OR = 10.126, 95%CI: 1.088 -94.247) were high-risk factors.

However, given varied socioeconomic circumstances, there may be some inequality in the level of proper knowledge of COVID-19. Despite a proliferation of studies on COVID-19, the extent and prevalence of inequalities in knowledge about COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia are not known. Most related studies have only focused on understanding the determinants of COVID-19 knowledge. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the socioeconomic inequalities in knowledge regarding COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Methods: Data were extracted from an online cross-sectional self-reported questionnaire conducted on the knowledge about COVID-19 from 3,388 participants. Frequencies and graphs were used to identify the level and distribution of inequality in knowledge about COVID-19. Concentration curves and concentration indices were further used to assess and quantify the income- and education-related inequality in knowledge about COVID-19. Results: The level of COVID-19 knowledge was high among the surveyed sample, although the extent of knowledge varied. The findings further suggest the existence of socioeconomic inequality in obtaining proper knowledge about COVID-19, indicating that inequality in comprehensive knowledge is disproportionately concentrated among the wealthy (concentration index = 0.016; P < 0.001) and highly educated individuals (concentration index = 0.003; P = 0.029) in Saudi Arabia. Conclusions: There is inequality in the level of knowledge about COVID-19 among the more socioeconomically privileged population of Saudi Arabia. Given that COVID-19 cases ebb and flow in different waves, it is important that proper policies be put in place that will help in improving knowledge among the lower income and less educated individuals, leading to behavior that can help reduce transmission.","output":"Inequalities in Knowledge About COVID-19 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

This is a case-control study including the tested individuals for SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR officially reported by the Health Secretary of Mexico from January 01 to May 8, 2020 (102,875 subjects). Demographic (sex, age, foreign and immigrant status, native speaking, place of residence), life-style (smoking), and co-morbidities [diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure (HBP), asthma, immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease other than HBP, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and other not specified diseases (other diseases)] variables were included in this study. The risk of infection and hospitalization conferred by each variable was calculated with univariate (ULR) and multivariate (MLR) logistic regression models. Results. The place of residence (OR=4.91 living in Tijuana City), followed by advanced age (OR=6.71 in 61-70 years-old), suffering from diabetes (OR=1.87) or obesity (OR=1.61), being male (OR=1.55), having HBP (OR=1.52), and notoriously being indigenous (OR=1.49) conferred a higher risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico. Unexpectedly, we found that having asthma (OR=0.63), immunosuppression (OR=0.65) or smoking (OR=0.85) are protective factors against infection, while suffering from COPD does not increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, advanced age (OR=11.6 in [] 70 years-old) is the main factor for hospitalization due to Covid-19, followed by some co-morbidities, mainly diabetes (OR=3.69) and HBP (OR=2.79), being indigenous (OR=1.89), male sex (OR=1.67) and the place of residence (OR=4.22 for living in Juarez City). Unlike the protective risk against infection, immunosuppression (OR=2.69) and COPD (OR=3.63), contribute to the risk of being hospitalized, while having asthma (OR=0.7) also provides protection against hospitalization.

In physiological conditions, tetraspanins interact with specific partner proteins in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains and regulate their subcellular localizations and function. However, the function of Tspan5 in pathological processes, particularly in cancer biology, and its clinical significance are still unclear. Here, we describe that a high expression of Tspan5 is significantly associated with some clinicopathological features including invasive length, vascular invasion, clinical stage and poor overall survival of HCC patients. Alterations of Tspan5 expression by lentivirus transductions in HCC cells demonstrated that Tspan5 promotes wound healing and cell migration in vitro and tumour metastasis of HCC cells in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that Tspan5 promoted cell migration and tumour metastasis by increasing the enzymatic maturation of ADAM10 and activating Notch signalling via the increase of the cleavage of the Notch1 receptor catalysed by the ?3-secretase complex. Activation of Notch signalling by Tspan5 was shown to further enhance the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and actin skeleton rearrangement of tumour cells. In clinical HCC samples, Tspan5 expression is strongly correlated with many key molecules acting in Notch signalling and EMT, highlighting the role of Tspan5 in the regulation of Notch signalling, EMT and tumour metastasis of HCC.

METHODS: Fifty-six patients, who were admitted to the emergency clinic and diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, were included in the study. Data on clinical characteristics, inflammatory parameters and vitamin D status were recorded for each patient. All the participants had data on 25-hydroxyvitamin D status within the last 6 months prior to COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: The patients were stratified as those with vitamin D status less than 20 ng/mL and higher than 20 ng/mL. A group with vitamin D status less than 20 ng/mL had lower lymphocyte counts and lower haemoglobin levels that was statistically significant (respectively; p = 0.021, p = 0.035). Higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were seen in the vitamin D-deficient group (p = 0.013).

Through viral whole-genome sequencing, we explored the evolution of two clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 during passage in unmodified Vero-derived cell lines and in parallel, in well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cell (WD-PNEC) cultures. We identify a consistent, rich genetic diversity arising in vitro, variants of which could rapidly rise to near-fixation with 2 passages. Within isolates, SARS-CoV-2 evolution was dependent on host cells, with Vero-derived cells facilitating more profound genetic changes. However, most mutations were not shared between strains. Furthermore, comparison of both Vero-grown isolates on WD-PNECs disclosed marked growth attenuation mapping to the loss of the polybasic cleavage site (PBCS) in Spike while the strain with mutations in NSP12 (T293I), Spike (P812R) and a truncation of ORF7a remained viable in WD-PNECs.

The uncertainty of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic along with increased workload and difficult medical triage decisions may lead to a further decline in physician psychological health. METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for primary research from database inception (Medline [1946], EMBASE [1974], PsycINFO [1806]) to November 17, 2020. Titles and abstracts were screened by one of three reviewers and full-text article screening and data abstraction were conducted independently, and in duplicate, by three reviewers. RESULTS: From 6223 unique citations, 480 articles were reviewed in full-text, with 193 studies (of 90,499 physicians) included in the final review. Studies reported on physician psychological symptoms and management during seven infectious disease outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], three strains of Influenza A virus [H1N1, H5N1, H7N9], Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], and COVID-19) in 57 countries. Psychological symptoms of anxiety (14.3C92.3%), stress (11.9C93.7%), depression (17C80.5%), post-traumatic stress disorder (13.2C75.2%) and burnout (14.7C76%) were commonly reported among physicians, regardless of infectious disease outbreak or country. Younger, female (vs. male), single (vs. married), early career physicians, and those providing direct care to infected patients were associated with worse psychological symptoms. INTERPRETATION: Physicians should be aware that psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression, fear and distress are common, manifest differently and self-management strategies to improve psychological well-being exist. Health systems should implement short and long-term psychological supports for physicians caring for patients with COVID-19.

Here, we identify research priorities by critically reviewing pre-clinical and clinical studies using extracts and compounds derived from molluscs, as well as traditional molluscan medicines, used in the treatment of respiratory diseases. We reviewed 97 biomedical articles demonstrating the anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, and immunomodulatory properties of >320 molluscan extracts/compounds with direct relevance to respiratory disease, in addition to others with promising bioactivities yet to be tested in the respiratory context. Of pertinent interest are compounds demonstrating biofilm inhibition/disruption and antiviral activity, as well as synergism with approved antimicrobial and chemotherapeutic agents. At least 100 traditional medicines, incorporating over 300 different mollusc species, have been used to treat respiratory-related illness in cultures worldwide for thousands of years. These medicines provide useful clues for the discovery of bioactive components that likely underpin their continued use. There is particular incentive for investigations into anti-inflammatory compounds, given the extensive application of molluscan traditional medicines for symptoms of inflammation, and shells, which are the principal molluscan product used in these preparations. Overall, there is a need to target research toward specific respiratory disease-related hypotheses, purify bioactive compounds and elucidate their chemical structures, and develop an evidence base for the integration of quality-controlled traditional medicines.","output":"Molluscan Compounds Provide Drug Leads for the Treatment and Prevention of Respiratory Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA homodimerization is important for various physiological processes, including the assembly of membraneless organelles, RNA subcellular localization, and packaging of viral genomes. However, understanding RNA dimerization has been hampered by the lack of systematic in vivo detection methods. Here, we show that CLASH, PARIS, and other RNA proximity ligation methods detect RNA homodimers transcriptome-wide as \\"overlapping\\" chimeric reads that contain more than one copy of the same sequence. Analyzing published proximity ligation data sets, we show that RNA:RNA homodimers mediated by direct base-pairing are rare across the human transcriptome, but highly enriched in specific transcripts, including U8 snoRNA, U2 snRNA, and a subset of tRNAs. Mutations in the homodimerization domain of U8 snoRNA impede dimerization in vitro and disrupt zebrafish development in vivo, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role of this domain. Analysis of virus-infected cells reveals homodimerization of SARS-CoV-2 and Zika genomes, mediated by specific palindromic sequences located within protein-coding regions of N gene in SARS-CoV-2 and NS2A gene in Zika.

This study was conducted to characterize webPOISONCONTROL cases and highlight its potential for real-time monitoring of poisoning. METHODS: Case data for all completed, nonduplicated public cases entered in 2020 were analyzed using a custom Qlik Sense dashboard. RESULTS: Of the 156,202 cases, 52.9% occurred in children younger than 4 years. Most cases (109,057, 69.8%) were initially triaged to home, 28.4% were advised to call Poison Control, and 1.7% were referred to the ED. Follow-up was available for 33.3% of home-triaged cases; 1.7% of those had a change in triage recommendation. Pharmaceuticals were implicated in 41.5% of cases (nonpharmaceuticals in 58.5%). Ingestion was the most common route (88.4%, 138,012). One-time double dose therapeutic error cases were implicated in 17,901 cases (27.6% of pharmaceutical cases). Cosmetics (13.9%) and cleaning substances (12.9%) were the most frequent substance categories. Melatonin was the most frequently implicated generic substance (4.5% of cases). Most (72.0%) cases had no effect (21.4%), a minor effect (3.9%) or were minimally toxic with unknown outcome (46.7%). There were no deaths, 17 major outcomes (0.01%), and 26.7% of cases had potentially toxic exposures with no outcome determination. In 2020, webPOISONCONTROL handled 7.3% as many human poison exposure cases as were reported to U.S. phone-based poison centers. Online cases are skewed towards younger ages (53% in children younger than 4 years vs 37% of phone-based cases) and towards nonpharmaceuticals (58.5% vs 43.5%). Near real-time data visualizations enabled detection of COVID-19-related increases in exposures to hand sanitizers and cleaners, illustrating the public health surveillance and hazard detection capabilities of webPOISONCONTROL.

The majority of NIs are bacterial, fungal, and viral infections; however, parasites also play a considerable role in NIs, particularly in our increasingly complex healthcare environment with a growing proportion of immunocompromised patients. Moreover, parasitic infections acquired via blood transfusion or organ transplantation are more likely to have severe or fatal disease outcomes compared with the normal route of infection. Many of these infections are preventable and most are treatable, but as the awareness for parasitic NIs is low, diagnosis and treatment are often delayed, resulting not only in higher health care costs but, importantly, also in prolonged courses of disease for the patients. For this article, we searched online databases and printed literature to give an overview of the causative agents of parasitic NIs, including the possible routes of infection and the diseases caused. Our review covers a broad spectrum of cases, ranging from widely known parasitic NIs, like blood transfusion malaria or water-borne cryptosporidiosis, to less well-known NIs, such as the transmission of Strongyloides stercoralis by solid organ transplantation or nosocomial myiasis. In addition, emerging NIs, such as babesiosis by blood transfusion or person-to-person transmitted scabies, are described.","output":"Nosocomial Infections: Do Not Forget the Parasites!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Poverty has a significant influence on health. Efforts to optimize income and reduce poverty could make a difference to the lives of patients and their families. Routine screening for poverty in primary care is an important first step but rarely occurs in Canada. We aimed to implement a targeted screening and referral process in a large, distributed primary care team in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The main outcome was the proportion of targeted patients screened. METHODS: This implementation evaluation was conducted with a large community-based primary care team in north Toronto. The primary care team serves relatively wealthy neighborhoods with pockets of poverty. Physicians were invited to participate. We implemented targeted screening by combining census information on neighborhood-level deprivation with postal codes in patient records. For physicians agreeing to participate, we added prompts to screen for poverty to the charts of adult patients living in the most deprived areas. Standardized electronic medical record templates recommended a referral to a team case worker for income optimization, for those patients screening positive. We recorded the number and percentages of participants at each stage, from screening to receiving advice on income optimization. RESULTS: 128 targeted patients with at least one visit (25%) were screened. The primary care team included 86 physicians distributed across 19 clinical locations. Thirty-four physicians (39%) participated. Their practices provided care for 27,290 patients aged 18 or older; 852 patients (3%) were found to be living in the most deprived neighborhoods. 509 (60%) had at least one office visit over the 6 months of follow up. 25 patients (20%) screened positive for poverty, and 13 (52%) were referred. Eight patients (62% of those referred) were ultimately seen by a caseworker for income optimization. CONCLUSIONS: We implemented a targeted poverty screening program combined with resources to optimize income for patients in a large, distributed community-based primary care team. Screening was feasible; however, only a small number of patients were linked to the intervention Further efforts to scale and spread screening and mitigation of poverty are warranted; these should include broadening the targeted population beyond those living in the most deprived areas.

The experimental group participated in the CDSMP, while the comparison group joined a Tai-Chi interest class in a mass-activity format. Subjects completed evaluation questionnaires before beginning their program and 1 week following the program. RESULTS: Analysis of covariance showed that the CDSMP participants demonstrated significantly higher self-efficacy in managing their illness, used more cognitive methods to manage pain and symptoms, and felt more energetic than the subjects in the comparison group. The CDSMP participants also demonstrated changes in their profile of coping strategies, having a tendency to adopt the cognitive methods of diverting attention, reinterpreting pain, ignoring sensations, and making positive self-statements.

When tidal volume (V(T)) is kept constant, P may change according to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)-induced changes in lung aeration. P may decrease if PEEP leads to a recruitment of collapsed lung tissue but will increase if PEEP mainly causes pulmonary overdistension. This study tests the hypothesis that individualized high PEEP, when compared to fixed low PEEP, protects against PPC in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery. METHODS: The Driving prESsure durIng GeNeral AnesThesIa for Open abdomiNal surgery trial (DESIGNATION) is an international, multicenter, two-group, double-blind randomized clinical superiority trial. A total of 1468 patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two intraoperative ventilation strategies. Investigators screen patients aged  18 years and with a body mass index  40 kg/m(2), scheduled for open abdominal surgery and at risk for PPC. Patients either receive an intraoperative ventilation strategy with individualized high PEEP with recruitment maneuvers (RM) (individualized high PEEP) or one in which PEEP of 5 cm H(2)O without RM is used (low PEEP). In the individualized high PEEP group, PEEP is set at the level at which P is lowest. In both groups of the trial, V(T) is kept at 8 mL/kg predicted body weight. The primary endpoint is the occurrence of PPC, recorded as a collapsed composite of adverse pulmonary events. DISCUSSION: DESIGNATION will be the first randomized clinical trial that is adequately powered to compare the effects of individualized high PEEP with RM versus fixed low PEEP without RM on the occurrence of PPC after open abdominal surgery. The results of DESIGNATION will support anesthesiologists in their decisions regarding PEEP settings during open abdominal surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03884543.

Remarkable progress has led this field toward animal trials and the next challenge lies with translation to humans. There is an emerging number of small human trials that can take advantage of new models integrating behavioral and social factors. Understanding dynamic aging mechanisms, given the powerful social determinants of aging (Crimmins, 2020) and human variability and environmental contexts (Moffitt, 2020), will be critical. Behavioral and social factors are intrinsic to aging. Toxic stressors broadly defined can lead to stress-acceleration of aging, either directly impacting aging processes or by shaping poor behavioral health, and underlie the socioeconomic disparities of aging. In contrast, hormetic stressors, acute intermittent stressors of moderate intensity, can produce stress resilience, the ability for quick recovery and possibly rejuvenation of cells and tissues. Although health research usually examines static biomarkers, aging is reflected in dynamic ability to recover from challenges pointing to new interventions and targets for examining mechanisms. A fuller model incorporating stress resilience provides innovative biobehavioral interventions, both for bolstering response to challenges, such as COVID-19, and for improving healthspan.","output":"The geroscience agenda: Toxic stress, hormetic stress, and the rate of aging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Face-touching behavior has the potential for self-inoculation and transmission of the SARS-2 Coronavirus.

In this article we propose a new mechanism and suggest innovative therapeutic avenues for its prevention. We have reported that particles of cell-free chromatin (cfCh) that are released from the billions of cells that die in the body everyday can illegitimately integrate into genomes of healthy cells to trigger dsDNA breaks. The latter leads to apoptosis and/or intense activation of inflammatory cytokines in the affected cells. We hypothesise that a similar phenomenon of dsDNA breaks and inflammation is involved in cytokine storm. The abundant cfCh particles that are released from dying host cells following viral/microbial invasion initiate a cascading effect of more cell death resulting in a vicious cycle of further DNA damage, apoptosis and hyper-inflammation which culminate in cytokine storm. We propose that this unrelenting vicious cycle of cellular DNA damage and cytokine storm may be the underlying cause of high mortality from severe COVID-19. We discuss results of our preclinical studies wherein we have shown that endotoxin induced cytokine storm in mice can be reversed by three different agents that have the ability to inactivate cfCh.

While traditional short-course fractionation regimens are suitable for most patients, a minority may derive gains from higher doses of PRT. Compared to older regimens such as 13 fractions of 3 Gy, more hypofractionated, non-ablative concepts with reduced overall treatment time are not well studied. Methods Retrospective analysis (2017-2020) of 107 patients treated to metastatic lesions (one or two target volumes per patient) with traditional >2 weeks regimens or newer 2 weeks regimens, e.g. seven fractions of 5 Gy or five fractions of 6 Gy. Results Failure to complete radiotherapy was registered in 8% of patients (traditional fractionation) and 1%, respectively (p=0.12). Moderate rates of PRT30 were observed (11% and 6%, respectively, p=0.44). PRT30 was more likely in patients irradiated for brain or lymph node metastases. Utilization of newer 2 weeks regimens was highest in 2020, presumably as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Conclusion The implementation of newer fractionation regimens for selected patients has resulted in acceptable rates of non-completion and PRT30. Optimal selection criteria remain to be determined. Established, guideline-endorsed short-course regimens such as five fractions of 4 Gy and 8-Gy single fractions continue to represent important PRT approaches.","output":"Shortened Palliative Radiotherapy Results in a Lower Rate of Treatment During the Last Month of Life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to determine whether self-collected pure saliva (SCPS) is comparable to nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs in the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in asymptomatic, mild patients with confirmed COVID-19 Thirty-one patients aged from 18 to 85 years were included between 9 June and 11 December 2020 A SCPS sample and a NP sample were taken for each patient Quantitative PCR was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral load Results of SCPS vs NP samples testing were compared Statistical analyses were performed Viral load was significantly correlated (r = 0 72) The concordance probability was estimated at 73 3% In symptomatic adults, SCPS performance was similar to that of NP swabs (Percent Agreement = 74 1%;p = 0 11) Thus, the salivary test based on pure oral saliva samples easily obtained by noninvasive techniques has a fair agreement with the nasopharyngeal one in asymptomatic, mild patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19","output":"Performance of Self-Collected Saliva Testing Compared with Nasopharyngeal Swab Testing for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A significant portion of COVID-19 sufferers have asthma. The impacts of asthma on COVID-19 progression are still unclear but a modifying effect is plausible as respiratory viruses are acknowledged to be an important trigger for asthma exacerbations and a different, potentially type-2 biased, immune response might occur. In this study, we compared the blood circulating cytokine response to COVID-19 infection in patients with and without asthma. METHODS: Plasma samples and clinical information were collected from 80 patients with mild (25), severe (36) or critical (19) COVID-19 and 29 healthy subjects at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. The concentrations of 51 circulating proteins in the plasma samples were measured with Luminex and compared between groups. RESULTS: Total 16 pre-existing asthma patients were found (3 in mild, 10 in severe, and 3 in critical COVID-19). The prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 severity groups did not suggest a clear correlation between asthma and COVID-19 severity. Within the same COVID-19 severity group, no differences were observed between patients with or without asthma on oxygen saturation, CRP, neutrophil counts, and length of hospital stay. The mortality in the COVID-19 patients with asthma (12.5%) was not higher than that in patients without asthma (17.2%).

The New Jersey Alliance of Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) is one of 65 CTSA hubs. The goal of this project was to evaluate and improve the NJ ACTS program by learning from pilot programs across the consortium. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The initial research on pilot programs was conducted using the CTSA Search Solutions tool, a tool developed at NJ ACTS which provides links to individual pages by topic in all the hub websites. Using the tool, public information was accessed, including common award amounts, significant dates, and preferred categories of research. Then, a survey created in REDCap was distributed to colleagues at all CTSA hubs to gather additional information and thoughts on pilot programs. The data were compiled in an excel database to observe and analyze trends. These trends were graphically presented in figures developed from the data to see how NJ ACTS compares to other CTSA hubs in how they focus and operate their pilot programs. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: There are both similarities and differences between NJ ACTS and other hubs. NJ ACTS utilizes a REDCap form for its application, as do 14 other CTSA hubs. Surveys also show that NJ ACTS follows similar processes for: letter of intent and application due dates;having a standing review committee;and the categories of awards. Award categories for Clinical/Translational Innovation, Methodology/Infrastructure, and Partnership/Collaboration are shared with 47, 25, and 41 institutions, respectively. NJ ACTS requires collaboration between its multiple institutions, as do 28 other hubs. It does not, however, have a public notification of award date, and notifications tend to go out relatively late. NJ ACTS funded multiple proposals pertaining to COVID-19, something 11 other CTSA hubs did as well. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Although a new CTSA hub, NJ ACTSs Pilot Program operates comparably to more mature CTSA hubs. Using the survey data, NJ ACTS can implement modest changes, better serving its scientific community. CTSA Search Solutions has proven an excellent tool and can be used by any hub to understand how they compare and implement changes to improve their programs.","output":"Pilot Projects as Catalysts for Research Initiatives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging viral pandemic disease. In the last 6 months, SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of reported cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. As other world regions, South America has not contained the pandemics advance since it lacks the hospital and economic capacities. Public health implications of transmission, while the asymptomatic/presymptomatic infection is a critical concern at the current pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Describe the socio-demographic, clinical, and viral features of a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals from the Colombian Caribbean. METHODS: Six hundred eighty-six clinical samples of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection cases and contacts individuals from several hospital centers in the department of Crdoba, Colombia, were received at our laboratory between April 9th and May 16th, 2020. RNA was extracted using lysis buffers and spin columns. The samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using commercially available multiplex real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection of 3 target genes of SARS-CoV-2 (Allplex?, 2019-nCoV assay, Korea). Viral copies quantification was done using a standard curve constructed from seriated dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 positive control. Statics descriptive methods were used. RESULTS: Thirty-five nasopharyngeal samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection; the average age was 43 (range, 1C95 years). Seventeen of 35 (49%) of the patients showed symptoms. Most of them had a cough, fever, and odynophagia; three of the patients reported having arthralgia. Only two patients required hospitalization. None of the patients had known co-morbidities. RT-qPCR results show that two of the symptomatic patients had significantly higher RNA copies than the rest. Eighteen of 35 (51%) individuals were asymptomatic, and the average age was 30 (range, 6C61 years). Four asymptomatic individuals showed a higher copy than some symptomatic patients; nonetheless, the average of RNA copies 8.26  10(10) was lower than the symptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that asymptomatic patients may develop infections with a high number of RNA copies. Since a considerable percentage of infections may be asymptomatic/presymptomatic, enhanced testing approaches may be needed to detect these persons. Due the occurrence of a large proportion of infections being a result from transmission originated in asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals, public health interventions in Colombia should be based on two steps: a massive molecular screening, and viral load quantification. Finally, a remarkable issue in our study is the average age of symptomatic and asymptomatic groups (43 and 30 respectively) which may be important because of the economic impact that has been caused by the coronavirus pandemic and may be probably the cause of the reduced lethality observed in the country and the department at the time of this study.","output":"Epidemiological and viral features of a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in an area of the Colombian Caribbean"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteoglycans (PGs) are one of the main components in the extracellular matrix of the central nervous system. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a glycosaminoglycan (GAG), which is composed of major PGs. Similar to keratin sulfate (KS), another GAG, CS inhibits axon regeneration. However, the influence of these GAGs on the pathogenicity of neuroimmunological diseases is unclear. Here, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice lacking CS N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-1 (CSGalNAcT1-KO), an important enzyme for CS synthesis. In our study, CSGalNAcT1-KO mice showed milder EAE symptoms than those in wild-type (WT) mice. The recall response of antigen-specific lymphocytes showed that CSGalNAcT1-KO-derived lymphocytes had a milder cell proliferation response than that in WT-derived lymphocytes. These results suggest that CS contributes toward the induction phase of EAE. We previously performed EAE experiments in GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase KO (GlcNAc6ST-KO) and C6ST1-KO mice, which had reduced KS and reduced CS-C, respectively. EAE in CSGalNAcT1-KO mice was more similar to that in GlcNAc6ST-KO mice than in C6ST1-KO mice. In conclusion, the distinct GAG sugar chains are associated with severe or mild phenotypes of EAE and are therefore potential new therapeutic targets for neuroimmunological diseases, including multiple sclerosis.","output":"Chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosyltransferase-1 knockout shows milder phenotype in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis than in wild type"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper examines the current uncertainty within real estate markets through the quotes of Dr James A Graaskamp, a real estate educator and researcher Graaskamp focused his teachings on real estate investment through the lens of risk management and risk mitigation Using the current COVID 19 pandemic crisis as the backdrop, the author examines how we might learn from Graaskamp to look differently at real estate investments during these uncertain times when an external shock shakes a market, causing transactions to stall and sometimes freeze In addition, she explores how we might learn from today's situation and make long-term changes to our built environment to have a better understanding of the risks associated with the current but also future pandemics and other uncertainties including natural disasters or climate change The quotes were gathered by Jim Curtis, a student, friend and colleague of Dr Graaskamp from the late 1970s until his death in 1988 Through these quotes, the author explores the many facets of the complex nature of the real estate asset class particularly during these very uncertain times created by the global pandemic Design/methodology/approach: This is a thought piece on the current uncertainty surrounding real estate markets around the globe caused by the COVID 19 pandemic The author of this essay was also a student, friend and mentee of Jim Graaskamp's, so it is an oral history of her experiences with this well-known and iconic real estate educator and scholar Findings: As a discussion piece, this is not a traditional research project with empirical findings It is an exploration of the current uncertain times caused by the COVID 19 pandemic and its impact on real estate markets The author examines how the increased risk is currently, and will also continue to, significantly influence the fields of property investment and finance Practical implications: The James A Graaskamp Collection on Teaching Materials compiled by the Wisconsin Real Estate Alumni Association is not a widely recognized resource for real estate scholars and practitioners yet the two CDs contain a wealth of information and knowledge from an intelligent real estate expert Used as the base for the discussion, this paper sheds light on the teachings and writings of Dr Graaskamp It illustrates the usefulness of the materials for other researchers and educators In particular, it highlights Graaskamp focus on risk management and mitigation which he strongly believed were essential skills to understanding the complicated nature of a real estate investment and for making good investment decisions, particularly when markets are full of uncertainty as is the case during these current times of the global COVID 19 pandemic Originality/value: As one of only a handful of living and still practicing doctoral students of Professor Graaskamp, the author has a unique perspective and lens to attempt to interpret the quotes of this real estate expert He was a leader in real estate education, particularly as it pertains to real estate valuation, feasibility and investment, and this essay draws out some of his more important lessons from his pithy and often humorous quotes ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"COVID 19, real estate and uncertainty: examining this new normal through the quotes of Jim Graaskamp"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: As the burden of COVID-19 enhances, the need of a fast and reliable screening method is imperative.

Covid-19 related respiratory manifestations have been reported as mild, moderate to severe including acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome necessitating non-invasive forms of oxygenation to mechanical ventilation (MV). MV patients frequently undergo prolonged hospitalizations with substantial morbidity and mortality. We sought to evaluate risk factors for MV in our cohort. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted in our institution from March 1st to June 21st2020, to assess risk factors for Covid-19 related respiratory failure requiring MV. The original cohort encompassed 166 MV and 503 non MV patients. Information from our hospital medical records was extracted, which included demographics, presenting symptoms, past medical history, vital signals, and laboratory data and need for MV. We propensity matched 166 MV with a concurrent cohort of non MV patients in our institution. Covariates applied in matching included age, gender, race, and body mass index (BMI). The admission clinical attributes and laboratory parameters were analyzed, along with outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age of our matched cohort was 63.8 years. Mechanically Ventilated patients had a higher incidence of tachycardia (heart rate > 125) (p <.001), elevated respiratory rate > 24 cycles per minute (p <.001), fever > 97.8 F (Temperature > (p =.037), shortness of breath (p =.001), and headaches (p =.005). In addition, mechanically ventilated patients had a lower serum albumin (g/dl)  3 units (p <. 001), elevated serum creatinine (mg/dl)  1.135 units (p =.02), elevated serum CRP-HS  123 units (p =.005), HbA1C (%) > 6.6 units (p =.004), serum lactic acid (mmol/L) > 1.7 units (p =.003), serum LDH U/L > 465 U/L (p <.001), Procalcitonin (ng/ml) >.305 units (p <0.001), SGOT IU/L or AST IU/L  54 units (p < 0.001), SGPT or ALT IU/L  41 units (p =.021), and WBC count > 8.4 k/ul (p <.001). Furthermore, tachycardia (OR = 3.98, p =.001), HbA1C (OR = 2.36, p =.008), serum LDH (OR = 1.9, p =.041), and absolute lymphocyte percent  12 (OR = 1.98, p =.022) predicted mechanical ventilation in all matched patients in our institutional cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our case series provides clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and predictors for mechanical ventilation in matched patients with Covid-19. Elevated heart rate, HbA1C, serum LDH and decreased lymphocyte percentage were predictors for mechanical ventilation. Tachycardia had the highest odds of 3.98. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Several clinical and laboratory parameters can be utilized for evaluating and stratifying Covid-19 patients risk for mechanical ventilation. These risk factors will need further validation in other similar cohorts.

AIM: To show that visceral fat accumulation better predicts severity of COVID-19 outcome compared to either SCF amounts or BMI. METHODS: We selected patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and a computed tomography (CT) scan. Severe COVID-19 was defined as requirement for mechanical ventilation or death. Fat depots were quantified on abdominal CT scan slices and the measurements were correlated with the clinical outcomes. ACE 2 mRNA levels were quantified in fat depots of a separate group of non-COVID-19 subjects using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Among 165 patients with a mean BMI of 26.1a?a?5.4a?kg/m2, VF was associated with severe COVID-19 (pa?=a?0.022) and SCF was not (pa?=a?0.640). Subcutaneous fat was not different in patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and the SCF/VF ratio was lower in patients with severe COVID-19 (pa?=a?0.010).

The health, social, and economic consequences of the pandemic are difficult to evaluate, since there are many scientific uncertainties and unknowns. OBJECTIVES the main focus of this paper is on statistical methods for profiling municipalities by excess mortality, directly or indirectly caused by COVID-19. METHODS the use of excess mortality for all causes has been advocated as a measure of impact less vulnerable to biases. In this paper, observed mortality for all causes at municipality level in Italy in the period January-April 2020 was compared to the mortality observed in the corresponding period in the previous 5 years (2015-2019). Mortality data were made available by the Ministry of Internal Affairs Italian National Resident Population Demographic Archive and the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat). For each municipality, the posterior predictive distribution under a hierarchical null model was obtained. From the posterior predictive distribution, we obtained excess death counts, attributable community rates and q-values. Full Bayesian models implemented via MCMC simulations were used. RESULTS absolute number of excess deaths highlights the burden paid by major cities to the pandemic. The Attributable Community Rate provides a detailed picture of the spread of the pandemic among the municipalities of Lombardy, Piedmont, and Emilia-Romagna Regions. Using Q-values, it is clearly recognizable evidence of an excess of mortality from late February to April 2020 in a very geographically scattered number of municipalities. A trade-off between false discoveries and false non-discoveries shows the different values of public health actions. CONCLUSIONS despite the variety of approaches to calculate excess mortality, this study provides an original methodological approach to profile municipalities with excess deaths accounting for spatial and temporal uncertainty.","output":"A municipality-level analysis of excess mortality in Italy in the period January-April 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the influent of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), pumping stations, manholes, sewer networks and sludge of WWTP and facilities of countries as France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, United States, Australia, Ecuador, Brazil and Japan Although this virus has been detected in the wastewater streams, there is no robust method for its detection and quantification in wastewater This review compiled and analyzed the virus concentration approaches applied to detect the SARS-CoV-2, besides to provide insights about the methodology for viral concentration, limit of detection, occurrence, persistence, and perspectives post-COVID-19 related with the implications of the virus presence in wastewater The SARS-COV-2 detection in wastewater has been related to virus concentration methods, which present different recovery rates of the virus The most used viral concentration methods have been the polyethylene glycol (PEG) for precipitation of viral material and the ultrafiltration at molecular weight level After viral concentration, the detection and quantification of SARS-COV-2 in wastewater are mainly via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), which is the clinical assay adapted for environmental purposes Although in some experiments the positive control during RT-qPCR is running a surrogated virus (e g , Mengovirus or Dengue virus), RT-qPCR or reverse transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) targeting the gene encoding nucleocapsid (N1, N2 and N3) of SARS-COV-2 are highly recommended to calculate the limit of detection in wastewater samples Current results suggest that a rigorous methodology to elucidate the positive cases in a region from genomic copies in wastewater is needed ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Approaches applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and perspectives post-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traffic intersections are the most suitable locations for the deployment of computing, communications, and intelligence services for smart cities of the future.

Studying the association between central and peripheral cytokines and neuroinflammation is a prelude to the development of treatments for PND. Here, we investigate the hypotheses that there is a greater cytokine response in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than plasma after orthopaedic surgery, and that plasma cytokine levels are directly related to CSF cytokine levels, indicating that plasma cytokine levels may have potential as biomarkers of neuroinflammation. Patients admitted with a fractured neck of femur were invited to participate in this study. Participants had a spinal catheter inserted just prior to induction of anaesthesia. Samples of blood and CSF were taken before, immediately after, and on the first day following emergency surgery. The catheter was then removed. Samples were analysed for the presence of ten cytokines by immunoassay. A spinal catheter was successfully inserted in 11 participants during the 18-month study period. Five plasma cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70 and IL-13) rose significantly following surgery, whereas all ten CSF cytokines rose significantly (IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IFN- and TNF-) (adjusted-p < 0.05). Central (CSF) cytokine levels were consistently higher than their peripheral (plasma) counterparts after surgery, with some patients having a particularly marked neuroinflammatory response. The greatest increases occurred in IL-8 in CSF and IL-6 in plasma. There were significant, strong positive correlations between several of the measured cytokines in the CSF after surgery, but far fewer in plasma. There was no significant correlation between cytokine levels in the plasma and CSF at each of the three time points. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse paired samples of plasma and CSF for cytokine levels before and after emergency orthopaedic surgery. This study demonstrates that following surgery for a fractured neck of femur, there is a far greater rise in cytokines in the CSF compared to plasma. The lack of correlation between peripheral and central cytokines suggests measurement of peripheral cytokines are not necessarily related to which patients may have a large neuroinflammatory response.","output":"Cytokine changes in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma after emergency orthopaedic surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines derived from chimpanzee adenovirus Y25 (ChAdOx1), human adenovirus type 26 (HAdV-D26), and human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-C5) are critical in combatting the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.

A species' dispersal pattern can be complex as it emerges from individuals' decisions shaped by the cost-benefit tradeoffs associated with either remaining in the natal group or dispersing. Given the potential complexity, combining long-term demographic information with molecular data can provide important insights into dispersal patterns of a species. Based on a 15-year study that integrates multi-year demographic data on six groups with longitudinal and cross-sectional genetic sampling of 20 groups (N=169 individuals, N=21 polymorphic microsatellite loci), we describe the various dispersal strategies of male and female black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) inhabiting Palenque National Park, Mexico. Genetically confirmed dispersal events (N=21 of 59 males; N=6 of 65 females), together with spatial autocorrelation analyses revealed that the dispersal pattern of black howlers is bisexual with strong sex-biases in both dispersal rate (males disperse more often than females) and dispersal distance (females disperse farther than males). Observational and genetic data confirm that both males and females can successfully immigrate into established groups, as well as form new groups with other dispersing individuals. Additionally, both males and females may disperse singly, as well as in pairs, and both may also disperse secondarily. Overall, our findings suggest multiple dispersal trajectories for black howler males and females, and longer multi-year studies are needed to unravel which demographic, ecological, and social factors underlie individuals' decisions about whether to disperse and which dispersal options to take.","output":"Dispersal patterns in black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra): Integrating multi-year demographic and molecular data."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created barriers to the delivery of health care services, including dental care.

Herein, we report the preliminary findings. MethodsThis placebo-controlled, randomized, adaptive, platform trial conducted among symptomatic Brazilian adults confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 included eligible patients with a known risk factor for progression to severe disease. Patients were randomly assigned to either fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) or placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome of emergency room observation for >6 hours or hospitalization from COVID-19 up to 28 days post randomization using intention to treat. Modified intention to treat (mITT) explored patients receiving at least 24 hours of treatment before a primary outcome event. Secondary outcomes included viral clearance at day 7, time to hospitalization, mortality, and adverse drug reactions. We used a Bayesian analytic framework to determine effects along with probability of success of intervention compared to placebo. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04727424) and is ongoing. FindingsThe study team screened 9020 potential participants for this trial. The trial was initiated on June 2, 2020, with the current protocol reporting randomization from January 15, 2021 to August 6th 2021, when the trial arms were stopped for superiority. A total of 3238 patients were allocated to fluvoxamine (n=739), placebo (n=733) and other treatments (n=1766). Herein, we report the effectiveness of fluvoxamine vs. a concurrent placebo control. The average age of participants was 50 years (range 18-102 years); 57% were female.

METHODS: A total of 214 diabetic patients without previously documented diabetic retinopathy (DR) underwent point-of-care non-mydriatic fundus photography through their primary care providers at five Beth Israel Lahey Health locations. The characteristics of the patients who received remote screening were compared with those patients who were eligible for screening but did not take part in the program. Time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) was implemented to examine the cost of screening by tele-ophthalmology compared with in-person examinations. RESULTS: Tele-ophthalmology screening was more likely to be provided for patients who were younger (OR 0.985; 95% CI 0.973C0.997, p=0.016), who were obese (OR 2.04; 95% CI: 1.47C2.84, p=0.008), who had an HbA1c above 8.0% (OR 1.60; 95% CI: 1.13C2.26, p=0.031), or who had an eye examination in the past year (OR 5.55; 95% CI: 3.89C7.92, p<0.001).

Different names have been used to describe various types of miRNA. During evolution, RNA retroviruses or transgenes invaded the eukaryotic genome and inserted in the non-coding regions of DNA, conceivably acting as transposon-like jumping genes, providing defense from viral invasion and fine-funing of gene expression as a secondary level of gene modulation in eukaryotes. When a transposon is inserted in the intron, it becomes an intronic miRNA, taking advantage of the protein synthesis machinery, i.e., mRNA transcription and splicing, as a means for processing and maturation. Recently, miRNAs have been found to play an important, but not life-threatening, role in embryonic development. They might play a pivotal role in diverse biological systems in various organisms, facilitating a quick response and accurate plotting of body physiology and structures. Based on these unique properties, man-made intronic miRNAs have been developed for in vitro evaluation of gene function, in vivo gene therapy and generation of transgenic animal models.

Specific care activities, in particular aerosol-generating procedures, may have a higher risk of transmission. The rapid emergence and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has created significant challenges in health care facilities, particularly with severe shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) used to protect health care personnel (HCP). Evidence-based recommendations for what PPE to use in conventional, contingency, and crisis standards of care are needed. Where evidence is lacking, the development of specific research questions can help direct funders and investigators. OBJECTIVE: Develop evidence-based rapid guidelines intended to support HCP in their decisions about infection prevention when caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19. METHODS: IDSA formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel including front-line clinicians, infectious disease specialists, experts in infection control and guideline methodologists with representation from the disciplines of preventive care, public health, medical microbiology, pediatrics, critical care medicine and gastroenterology. The process followed a rapid recommendation checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. Then a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. RESULTS: The IDSA guideline panel agreed on eight recommendations and provided narrative summaries of other interventions undergoing evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: Using a combination of direct and indirect evidence, the panel was able to provide recommendations for eight specific questions on the use of PPE for HCP providing care for patients with suspected or known COVID-19. Where evidence was lacking, attempts were made to provide potential avenues for investigation. There remain significant gaps in the understanding of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and PPE recommendations may need to be modified in response to new evidence.","output":"Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on Infection Prevention for Health Care Personnel Caring for Patients with Suspected or Known COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: It has been widely reported that the mental well-being has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the imposed social isolation restrictions. It is essential to investigate, comprehend and acknowledge the profound influence Covid-19 has had on anxiety levels and explore approaches that people have used to manage this in order to inform future interventions and promote self-care behaviours to improve mental wellbeing. The aim of this study was to explore the anxiety experienced by adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and how they manage it. Methods: A specifically designed questionnaire containing open and closed questions was disseminated using social media in 4 countries including the UK. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used and data collected from the free-text questions were analysed using the thematic analysis. Ethical approval was obtained from St Marys University Research Ethics Committee. Results: To date n = 382 adult respondents aged 18 plus completed the survey. Analysis is on-going, full results will be available by the symposium date. Preliminary analysis indicated that the most common self-care behaviours used for anxiety self-management pre and during the pandemic were walks, virtual family/social peer support, cooking and aerobic exercise. Additionally, it was apparent that both a lack of a sustained reciprocation of ongoing family/social support was a key predictor for the proclivity of anxiety-inducing thoughts to be experienced and reduced family/social support led to negative thought processes and feelings such as isolation, loneliness and uncertainty about the future. Individuals who continually engaged in activity generally reported more positive mood states irrespective of the social isolation environment. Conclusion: This study highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental wellbeing and stresses the significance of ongoing peer support during social isolation. Facilitating self-care and opportunity for peer support may be an effective strategy for interventions to improve mental wellbeing during times of social isolation.

Secondly, a systematic review/meta-analysis of studies was conducted to assess the prevalence of miscarriage in COVID-19 patients diagnosed during pregnancy. Meta-analysis of proportions was used to combine data, and pooled proportions were reported. Seventeen case series and observational studies and 10 prevalence meta-analyses were selected for the review. The estimate of the overall miscarriage rate in pregnant women with COVID-19 was 15.3% (95% CI 10.94 to 20.59) and 23.1 (95% CI 13.17 to 34.95) using fixed and random effect models, respectively. Based on the data in the current literature, the miscarriage rate (<22 weeks gestation) in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection is in the range of normal population. Well-designed studies are urgently needed to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of miscarriage during periconception and early pregnancy.","output":"COVID-19 and miscarriage: from immunopathological mechanisms to actual clinical evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The exhaustive automatic detection of symptoms in social media posts is made difficult by the presence of colloquial expressions, misspellings and inflected forms of words.

The Covid-19-related symptom list was built based on the aggregation of different data sources. French Covid-19-related tweets were automatically extracted using a dedicated data broker during the first wave of the pandemic in France. The fuzzy matching parameters were finetuned using all symptoms from MedDRA and then evaluated on a subset of 5000 Covid-19-related tweets in French for the detection of symptoms from our Covid-19-related list.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed age restrictions on levonorgestrel EC and made it available over-the-counter to everyone in 2013. Despite improved availability and accessibility since the change in FDA regulations, community pharmacies have not uniformly embraced the policy. West Virginia is a rural state with high rates of poverty and teen pregnancy. DESIGN: The investigators called community pharmacies in West Virginia to assess the availability and accessibility of levonorgestrel EC in addition to the pharmacy staff's knowledge of effectiveness for this cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study sample consisted of 509 community pharmacies throughout the state. OUTCOME MEASURES: A structured script was employed to conduct phone calls to community pharmacies with items assessing availability, accessibility, and knowledge of effectiveness. RESULTS: At the time of the phone calls, levonorgestrel EC was reported to be available in 48.9% of the community pharmacies in West Virginia. Chain pharmacies were more likely to report EC as being in stock (0.76) than independent pharmacies (0.15.). Other measures of accessibility also favored chain pharmacies versus independent pharmacies. The overall accessibility of EC at West Virginia community pharmacies was derived from a binary composite variable of \\"completely accessible\\" or \\"not completely accessible\\" by combining 5 predetermined items. Overall, EC was completely accessible to callers in 0.27 of all pharmacies with significant differences by pharmacy type (0.47 of chain pharmacies as compared with 0.03 of independent pharmacies). CONCLUSION: Accessible EC could reduce unintended pregnancy and help break the state's generational cycle of poverty and poor educational, social, and health outcomes.

DESIGN: Retrospective, single-centre cohort study. SETTING: Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Among a cohort of 308 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, 138 patients died while 170 patients recovered and were discharged from the hospital. The data were collected until 27 February 2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records using data collection forms. RESULTS: The percentage of patients with elevated interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) increased with severity of disease (p<0.0001 for all). IL-2R (p<0.0001), IL-6 (p<0.0001), IL-8 (p=0.0001), IL-10 (p<0.0001) and TNF (p<0.0001) were also twofold to 20-fold higher in patients who died compared with those who recovered. Also, IL-6 and IL-10 increased in both the progressive patient groups: moderate (p=0.0026) and severe (p<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, higher levels of IL-2R (OR 1.001, 95% CI 1.000 to 1.002, p=0.031) and IL-6 (OR 1.013, 95% CI 1.003 to 1.024, p=0.015) on admission were associated with increasing odds of in-hospital death, independent of other covariates, including severity of disease and lymphocyte count. CONCLUSION: Increased proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, TNF and IL-10, showed an obvious association with both COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality. Thus, our study indicates that cytokines are valuable in predicting the severity of COVID-19 and helps in distinguishing critically ill patients from the less affected ones.","output":"Cytokines and their relationship with the severity and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak began at the end of 2019 and has evolved to a pandemic threatening various industries sustainability.

Health systems worldwide have moved quickly to implement telemedicine in diverse settings to reduce infection, but little is understood about how best to connect patients who are acutely ill with nearby clinical team members, even in the next room. OBJECTIVE: To inform these efforts, this paper aims to provide an early example of inpatient telemedicine implementation and its perceived acceptability and effectiveness. METHODS: Using purposive sampling, this study conducted 15 semistructured interviews with nurses (5/15, 33%), attending physicians (5/15, 33%), and resident physicians (5/15, 33%) on a single COVID-19 unit within Stanford Health Care to evaluate implementation outcomes and perceived effectiveness of inpatient telemedicine. Semistructured interview protocols and qualitative analysis were framed around the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework, and key themes were identified using a rapid analytic process and consensus approach. RESULTS: All clinical team members reported wide reach of inpatient telemedicine, with some use for almost all patients with COVID-19. Inpatient telemedicine was perceived to be effective in reducing COVID-19 exposure and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) without significantly compromising quality of care. Physician workflows remained relatively stable, as most standard clinical activities were conducted via telemedicine following the initial intake examination, though resident physicians reported reduced educational opportunities given limited opportunities to conduct physical exams. Nurse workflows required significant adaptations to cover nonnursing duties, such as food delivery and facilitating technology connections for patients and physicians alike. Perceived patient impact included consistent care quality, with some considerations around privacy. Reported challenges included patient-clinical team communication and personal connection with the patient, perceptions of patient isolation, ongoing technical challenges, and certain aspects of the physical exam. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical team members reported inpatient telemedicine encounters to be acceptable and effective in reducing COVID-19 exposure and PPE use. Nurses adapted their workflows more than physicians in order to implement the new technology and bore a higher burden of in-person care and technical support. Recommendations for improved inpatient telemedicine use include information technology support and training, increased technical functionality, and remote access for the clinical team.","output":"Inpatient Telemedicine Implementation as an Infection Control Response to COVID-19: Qualitative Process Evaluation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACTDomestic and family violence is a social and public health issue typically positioned in policy frameworks as a consequence of gendered social and economic structures.

In this study, a Performance Class-Based learning PSO (PCB-PSO) algorithm is proposed, that not only increases and maintains swarm diversity but also improves exploration and exploitation while speeding up convergence simultaneously. In the PCB-PSO algorithm, each particle belongs to a class based on its fitness value and particles might change classes at evolutionary stages or search step based on their updated position. The particles are divided into an upper, middle and lower. In the upper class are particles with top fitness values, the middle are those with average while particles in the bottom class are the worst performing in the swarm. The number of particles in each group is predetermined. Each class has a unique learning strategy designed specifically for a given task. The upper class is designed to converge towards the best solution found, Middle class particles exploit the search space while lower class particles explore. The algorithms strength is its flexibility and robustness as the population of each class allows us to prioritize a desired swarm behavior. The Algorithm is tested on a set of 8 benchmark functions which have generally proven to be difficult to optimize. The algorithm is able to be on par with some cutting edge PSO variants and outperforms other swarm and evolutionary algorithms on a number of functions.

Preservation of health and well-being in the elderly are challenging, and on the same note generalized changes in the musculoskeletal system contribute to this scenario. Musculoskeletal changes with ageing are referred to as sarcopenia. Reduced muscle mass and physical performance are hallmarks of sarcopenia, exclaimed with difficulty in independent activity and poor quality of life. Knowing that there is a hiatus in our knowledge as regards to the prevalence of sarcopenia in Hungary, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia in a community dwelling outpatient postmenopausal Hungarian cohort using the EWGSOP2 consensus recommendation. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, women arriving for routine bone densitometry examination at the Regional Osteoporosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen were invited to participate in the study. A total of a 100 community-dwelling women were recruited who confirmed to the inclusion criteria of self-reported postmenopausal status,  50 years of age and gave written informed consent. The study procedures included the self-administered SARC-F questionnaire, followed by assessment of muscle strength, muscle quantity and physical preformance. Muscle strength was determined with the hand grip strength (HGS), appendicular skeletal muscle mass was assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and physical performance was determined by the gait speed (GS) test. RESULTS: As per the EWGSOP2 definition, the percentage of study participants with probable sarcopenia (low muscle strength), sarcopenia (low muscle strength and low muscle quantity) and severe sarcopenia (low muscle strength, muscle quantity and low physical performance) was 36, 31 and 8%, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that height, weight, HGS and GS were all independent predictors of appendicular skeletal muscle mass. CONCLUSION: The 31% prevalence of sarcopenia in the studied post-menopausal women highlights the need for adequate assessment of the condition in the elderly.

While past research has focused on identifying prevalence rates for the disorder among substance-impaired drivers, there is a dearth of research focused on identifying the mechanisms by which the disorder actually functions to increase risk for the behavior among young adults who were formerly adjudicated for a serious offense. There are cognitive, affective, and social mechanisms that may help to explain this relationship. METHOD: Impulse control, hostility, and deviant peer association are examined as mechanisms that explain the relationship in each of these domains, respectively. The Pathways to Desistance data were utilized in analyses, comprising the responses of 1,354 youth who were adjudicated for a serious offense just prior to baseline measurements. Generalized structural equation modeling was used to examine the direct effects of antisocial personality disorder on substance-impaired driving risk and the hypothesized mechanism variables were then included in the model to determine which of them provided significant pathways through which the main relationship operated. RESULTS: Results indicated that meeting criteria for a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder was associated with increased risk of substance-impaired driving at follow-up. This relationship was attenuated to non-significance upon inclusion of the mechanism variables and reduced in magnitude by 20%. This attenuation was due almost entirely to impulse control. Practical Applications: This provides indication that intervention for substance-impaired driving offenders with antisocial personality disorder may be most effective when structured around improving impulse control for young adults who were previously involved with the juvenile/criminal justice system.","output":"Understanding mechanisms underlying the relationship between antisocial personality disorder and substance-impaired driving among young adults involved with the justice system as minors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Our goal was to evaluate the feasibility of transrectal rigid hybrid natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) sigmoidectomy (trNS) in a series of consecutive prospective patients with diverticular disease. The NOTES for left colectomy offers patients reduced pain and easier recovery. Limited data are available for trNS, which is considered safe for various indications. However, the technique is not standardized, and patients in the reported series are highly selected. STUDY DESIGN Patients scheduled for trNS were entered into a prospective registry on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary endpoint was trNS feasibility, and secondary endpoints were morbidity, pain, length of stay, and inflammatory response. A medial-to-lateral dissection with full mobilization of the splenic flexure and total intracorporeal anastomosis was performed. The rectum was covered with a wound protector for transrectal extraction. RESULTS Of 95 elective sigmoidectomies, 81% (n = 77) were enrolled for either transvaginal NOTES resection (n = 37) or trNS (n = 40). There was no difference in body mass index or indication between patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted sigmoidectomy (LAS), transvaginal resection, or trNS, although trNS patients were younger. Mainly because of a mismatch of bulky specimen and narrow pelvis, 17.5% of trNS were converted to LAS. Major morbidity was 10%, including 2 septic complications. During the study, the anastomosis technique was changed from double stapled end-to-end to side-to-end anastomosis. CONCLUSIONS Transrectal rigid hybrid natural orifice translumenal endoscopic sigmoidectomy is feasible and safe in a high proportion of unselected consecutive patients with diverticular disease undergoing elective treatment. Intracorporeal side-to-end anastomosis is the preferred technique, and trNS should be offered for elective sigmoidectomy presupposing advanced laparoscopic experience.","output":"Transrectal Rigid-Hybrid Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Sigmoidectomy for Diverticular Disease: A Prospective Cohort Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Healthy aging with dignity and aging in place are important concepts for most Taiwanese individuals, which can hopefully affect health policies. However, many elders have been encouraged to stay at home during the COVID-19 pandemic since January 2020. Consequently, most elders limited their social participation in a previous regular activity in the community center, which undermined the strategies for healthy aging. Few studies have explored how to promote or maintain holistic health and physical fitness for community elders during the COVID-19 worldwide. Therefore, this study aimed to establish and evaluate the impact of an innovative summer camp program for older adults in the rural community. Methods A quasi-experimental pre-post-test design was used. The innovative summer camp (ISC) was based on a standardized protocol of modified Baduanjin exercise combined with three recreation breathing games. Participants were recruited from three community centers around the western coastal Yunlin County between June and August 2020. ISC program was designed and demonstrated by the research team and conducted by each community care worker for 90 minutes per day, five days per week, for 12 weeks. The paired t-test was used to measure the physical biomarkers, pulmonary lung function, and health-related fitness changes. Results Sixty-eight participants completed this study. The findings indicated that the ISC program significantly improved elderly individuals physiological biomarkers and health-related fitness, including reduced body weight, waistline, systolic blood pressure, and increased forced vital capacity, biceps arm flexion, sit and stand from a chair, step with a knee up in situ, and stand on one foot with eyes open. Besides wearing a facemask during the activity, almost all participants reported that they felt happy, satisfied and hoped that this program can be continued in their community center. Conclusion This pilot study supported the finding that a three-month ISC program can improve physical biomarkers and health-related fitness.

Most infected staff exhibited some mild, non-specific symptoms so affected staff members may not have voluntarily self-isolated or had themselves tested on this basis. Similarly, for infected patients, most became symptomatic and were then isolated. Additional, enhanced aerosol infection control measures were implemented, including opening of all windows where available; universal masking for all staff, including in non-clinical areas and taking breaks separately; screening for asymptomatic infection among staff and patients, with appropriate isolation (at home for staff) if infected; performing a ventilation survey of the hospice facility. After these measures were instigated, the numbers of COVID-19 cases decreased to zero over the following three weeks.

Following government-implemented regulations, there has been concern over the apparent decline in emergency department (ED) attendances and the resultant health legacy. Therefore, we aimed to characterise the attendances to an Irish tertiary hospital ED following the implementation of these regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective observational study investigated all attendances to the Cork University Hospital ED from 15 February to 11 April in 2020 and 2017C2019. Attendances were stratified into four periods: Before COVID (BC) (15 February to 5 March), After COVID (AC) (6 March to 12 March), Educational Closure (EC) (13 March to 27 March) and Stay Home (SH) (28 March to 11 April), as per government regulations. Triage presentations of abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, headache and trauma were examined. Data were analysed by independent t-tests and (2) analysis. RESULTS: There were 8261 attendances to the ED in the 2020 time period compared with a mean of 10 389 attendances during the corresponding periods in 2017C2019. There was a significant decrease in daily attendances in 2020 compared with 2017C2019 in the AC (142 vs 188, p=0.02), EC (122 vs 184, p<0.001) and SH (121 vs 181, p<0.001) periods, including significant decreases in abdominal pain (AC: 9 vs 22, EC: 10 vs 19, SH: 11 vs 18, p<0.001), chest pain (AC: 9 vs 15, EC: 8 vs 15, SH: 9 vs 15, p<0.01), headache (AC: 5 vs 11, EC: 4 vs 9, SH: 4 vs 9, p<0.01) and trauma (AC: 3 vs 5, EC: 2 vs 6, SH: 3 vs 5, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the combination of government-imposed restrictions and perceived risk of attending an ED during a pandemic may contribute to reduced attendances. Public confidence in EDs is necessary to reduce collateral damage caused by failure to seek medical attention during a pandemic; adequate infrastructure to allow social distancing and isolation capacity in EDs is a necessity.","output":"Emergency department attendances during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective analysis of attendances following Irish governmental pandemic measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic brought profound change to the medical education system, and residency and fellowship recruitment was not spared.

EVIDENCE REVIEW PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effectiveness and the AHCPR Clinical Guidelines and Evidence Reports were explored from 1999 to 2019. Exclusion criteria were: poor or absent relevance regarding the aim of the consensus statements, studies prior to 1999, non-English language. Since the present pandemic context is completely new, unexpected and unexplored, there are not randomised controlled trials regarding clinical communication in a setting of complete isolation. Thus, a multiprofessional taskforce of physicians, nurses, psychologists and legal experts, together with some family members and former intensive care unit patients was established by four Italian national scientific societies.

Usually these cross-species transmissions are blocked by host restriction factors, which are proteins that can block virus replication at a specific step. In the natural virus host, the restriction factor activity is usually suppressed by a viral antagonist protein, but this is not the case for restriction factors from an unnatural host. However, due to ongoing viral evolution, sometimes the viral antagonist can evolve to suppress restriction factors in a new host, enabling cross-species transmission. Here we examine the classical case of this paradigm by reviewing research on APOBEC3 restriction factors and how they can suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). APOBEC3 enzymes are single-stranded DNA cytidine deaminases that can induce mutagenesis of proviral DNA by catalyzing the conversion of cytidine to promutagenic uridine on single-stranded viral (?)DNA if they escape the HIV/SIV antagonist protein, Vif.

In the absence of effective vaccines, we need effective treatments with low adverse effects that can treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19 disease. In this study, we determined the existence of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells within CD45RA(C) memory T cells in the blood of convalescent donors. Memory T cells can respond quickly to infection and provide long-term immune protection to reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Also, CD45RA(C) memory T cells confer protection from other pathogens encountered by the donors throughout their life. It is of vital importance to resolve other secondary infections that usually develop in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We found SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells in all of the CD45RA(C) subsets (CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+)) and in the central memory and effector memory subpopulations. The procedure for obtaining these cells is feasible, easy to implement for small-scale manufacture, quick and cost-effective, involves minimal manipulation, and has no GMP requirements. This biobank of specific SARS-CoV-2 memory T cells would be immediately available off-the-shelf to treat moderate/severe cases of COVID-19, thereby increasing the therapeutic options available for these patients.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-Specific Memory T Lymphocytes From COVID-19 Convalescent Donors: Identification, Biobanking, and Large-Scale Production for Adoptive Cell Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During Australia's unprecedented bushfires in 2019-2020, misinformation blaming arson resurfaced on Twitter using #ArsonEmergency. The extent to which bots were responsible for disseminating and amplifying this misinformation has received scrutiny in the media and academic research. Here we study Twitter communities spreading this misinformation during the population-level event, and investigate the role of online communities and bots. Our in-depth investigation of the dynamics of the discussion uses a phased approach -- before and after reporting of bots promoting the hashtag was broadcast by the mainstream media. Though we did not find many bots, the most bot-like accounts were social bots, which present as genuine humans. Further, we distilled meaningful quantitative differences between two polarised communities in the Twitter discussion, resulting in the following insights. First, Supporters of the arson narrative promoted misinformation by engaging others directly with replies and mentions using hashtags and links to external sources. In response, Opposers retweeted fact-based articles and official information. Second, Supporters were embedded throughout their interaction networks, but Opposers obtained high centrality more efficiently despite their peripheral positions. By the last phase, Opposers and unaffiliated accounts appeared to coordinate, potentially reaching a broader audience. Finally, unaffiliated accounts shared the same URLs as Opposers over Supporters by a ratio of 9:1 in the last phase, having shared mostly Supporter URLs in the first phase. This foiled Supporters' efforts, highlighting the value of exposing misinformation campaigns. We speculate that the communication strategies observed here could be discoverable in other misinformation-related discussions and could inform counter-strategies.","output":"Promoting and countering misinformation during Australia's 2019-2020 bushfires: A case study of polarisation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Similar to use during the H1N1 pandemic as a means of improved survival in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), there may be a role for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with severe ARDS secondary to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2 causing COVID) Limited data, however, exists for the use of ECMO in this population The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes between COVID and non- COVID patients receiving venovenous (VV) ECMO METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 15 COVID and 15 non-COVID patients receiving VV ECMO at Rush University Medical Center Patients were excluded if they were receiving ECMO at the time of data analysis The primary outcome was days requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) and ECMO Secondary outcomes included: discharge disposition, hospital length of stay (LOS) and survival Data collected included: demographics, co-morbidities, ECMO characteristics, MV and ECMO days, hospital LOS, discharge disposition, and survival RESULTS: In our cohort, the median age was 45 0 [36 0-51 0] versus 47 0 [36 0-52 0] in the COVID versus non-COVID groups, respectively Similarly, BMI and comorbidities were not different between groups A majority of patients in the COVID group were Hispanic (46 7%) versus the non-COVID group (33 3%) Inhaled epoprostenol was delivered prior to ECMO in 73 3% of COVID patients versus 20 0% of non-COVID patients A 31 French Protek was placed in all COVID ECMO patients versus 46 7% of non-COVID ECMO patients Days receiving MV were 12 0 [6 0-24 0] and 18 0 [12 0-35 0] and receiving ECMO were 30 0 [23 0-50 0] versus 27 0 days [19 0-56 0] in the COVID and non-COVID groups, respectively Hospital LOS was 37 0 [29 5-52 5] in the COVID group versus 46 0 [29 0-60 0] days in the non-COVID group Of note, two patients in the COVID group were hospitalized at the time of data analysis Survival was 93 3% in both ECMO groups and a majority of patients were discharged to a rehabilitation facility (53 3%) CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that ECMO may be a useful means of supporting patients with refractory hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID Future studies are needed to thoroughly evaluate the role of ECMO in this patient population","output":"Outcomes between COVID versus nonCOVID patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently described illness of humans that has spread widely over the past 6 months.

METHODS Both the CEDISC and the COINS were developed in Italian and tested for ease of use, comprehension, acceptability, the relevance of items and response options within a focus group session. Online cross-sectional validation survey was conducted among adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 or who developed Covid-19 disease, members of a closed Facebook discussion group in Italy. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with Promax oblique rotation; the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy and the Bartlett's test of sphericity were used to assess the suitability of the sample for factor analysis. Reliability was assessed as internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha and as test-retest reliability using weighted kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Precision was examined by Kendall's tau-b coefficient. RESULTS Overall, 579 participants completed the CEDISC, 519 also completed the COINS, 155 completed the retest for both scales after two weeks. The 12 items of the CEDISC converged over a 2-factor solution ('social life' and 'close relations') accounting for 49.2% of the variance (KMO = 0.894; Bartlett's test p < 0.001); the 13 items of the COINS converged over a 3-factor solution ('self-perception', 'close relations' and 'social life') accounting for 67.7% (KMO = 0.827; Bartlett's test p < 0.001). Cronbach's  was 0.848 for the CEDISC, and 0.837 for the COINS. The CEDISC showed three items (25%) with kappa between 0.61 and 0.80 and seven (58.4%) between 0.41 and 0.60, with only two items scoring 0.21 and 0.40; the COINS had ten items (76.9%) with kappa ranging from 0.41 to 0.60, and three items below 0.31. ICC was 0.906 (95% CI, 0.871-0.932) for the, CEDISC and 0.860 (95% CI, 0.808-0.898) for the COINS.

The N501Y substitution recapitulated the phenotype of enhanced viral transmission seen with the combined 8 Alpha spike mutations, suggesting it is a major determinant of increased transmission of this variant. Mechanistically, the N501Y substitution improved the affinity of the viral spike protein for cellular receptors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed for patients who had undergone LRN for a solid renal tumor greater than 7 cm in size on computed tomography (CT) scans between June 2008 and January 2016. Perioperative outcomes were compared between transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches. RESULTS There were 30 cases in the transperitoneal approach group and 34 cases in the retroperitoneal group. The mean tumor size was 9.0 cm in the transperitoneal approach group and 10.3 cm in the retroperitoneal group (P = .494). In the retroperitoneal approach group, the operation time was shorter, estimated blood loss (EBL) was lower, and time to start diet was shorter (P < .001, P = .037, and P = .002, respectively). The complication rate was comparable between the two approaches. CONCLUSIONS Retroperitoneal LRN for a large (>7 cm) solid renal tumor demonstrated a superior result in terms of operation time, estimated blood loss, and time to start diet than transperitoneal LRN.

The role of BTK in B cell receptor signaling is well defined and is known to play a key role in the proliferation and survival of malignant B cells. Moreover, BTK has been found to be expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage. BTK has been shown to contribute to a variety of cellular pathways in myeloid cells including signaling in the NLRP3 inflammasome, receptor activation of nuclear factor-ʦ and inflammation, chemokine receptor activation affecting migration, and phagocytosis. Myeloid cells are crucial components of the tumor microenvironment and suppressive myeloid cells contribute to cancer progression, highlighting a potential role for BTK inhibition in the treatment of malignancy. The increased interest in BTK inhibition in cancer has resulted in many preclinical studies that are testing the efficacy of using single-agent BTK inhibitors. Moreover, the ability of tumor cells to develop resistance to single-agent checkpoint inhibitors has resulted in clinical studies utilizing BTK inhibitors in combination with these agents to improve clinical responses. Furthermore, BTK regulates the immune response in microbial and viral infections through B cells and myeloid cells such as monocytes and macrophages. In this review, we describe the role that BTK plays in supporting suppressive myeloid cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), while also discussing the anticancer effects of BTK inhibition and briefly describe the role of BTK signaling and BTK inhibition in microbial and viral infections.","output":"Brutons tyrosine kinase: an emerging targeted therapy in myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection after coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination raises concerns about the emergence of vaccine escape variants.

The CDC has issued a recommended panel of PCR-based test sets that entail several primer/probe sets that target the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene, but also one that targets the human RNase P gene (h-RP) as a positive control for RNA extraction and/or reverse-transcription (RT) efficacy. We discovered that the CDC-recommended h-RP primer/probe set has a faulty design, because both PCR primers are located in the same exon, which allows for unwanted PCR-amplification of background genomic DNA (gDNA). By removing RNA from nose-swab samples by an RNase treatment, we showed that the presence of gDNA in samples resulted in false-positive signals for the h-RP test control. This is rather serious, because it could lead to false-negative test outcomes, since the CDC interpretation of an absent SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR signal plus a positive h-RP rRT-PCR signal is interpreted as 2019-nCoV not detected, whereas a false-positive h-RP rRT-PCR signal resulting from amplification of gDNA should be interpreted as Invalid Result and the procedure should be repeated. In order to overhaul the faulty h-RP rRT-PCR primer/probe set with minimal modification, we designed and tested several new h-RP reverse primers. Replacement of the CDC-recommended PCR reverse primer with our selected exon-exon junction reverse primer corrected the problem of false-positive results with this important SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test control and thus eliminated the problem of potential false-negative COVID-19 diagnoses.","output":"Overhauling a faulty control in the CDC-recommended SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test panel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reproductive number R (or R0, the initial reproductive number in an immune-na?ve population) has long been successfully used to predict the likelihood of pathogen invasion, to gauge the potential severity of an epidemic, and to set policy around interventions.

They were invited to complete a questionnaire, including demographic, physiological, and behavioural factors. Then, exhaled CO measurements were taken. These measurements were taken before and after smoking a single cigarette for smokers and only once for non-smokers. The average baseline exhaled CO concentration was 6.9  4.9 ppm for smokers and 1.9  0.5 ppm for non-smokers. The mean of exhaled CO half-life was around 273.3 min (4.6 h) for smokers. No difference was seen in exhaled CO half-life between light smokers and heavy smokers in the smoking group. Gender and cigarettes smoked weekly affected baseline exhaled CO in smokers. Even though height seemed to positively associate with exhaled CO half-life, the relationship disappeared when adjusting by gender and weight.

Host microRNAs (miRNAs) are widely involved in a variety of biological processes of coronavirus infection, including autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the mechanisms underlying miRNAs involved in autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been fully elucidated. In this study, the miRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were investigated based on raw data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, and potential novel biomarkers of autophagy were revealed by bioinformatics analyses. We identified 32 differentially expressed miRNAs and 332 differentially expressed mRNAs in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cytokine receptor related pathways were the most enriched pathways for differentially expressed miRNAs identified by pathway analysis. Most importantly, an autophagy interaction network, which was associated with the pathological processes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially with the cytokine storm, was constructed.

Some molecules, including hsa-miR-1291 and CXCR4, were considered potential targets to predict the emergence of severe symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To our knowledge, this study provided the first profile analysis of an autophagy interaction network in SARS-CoV-2 infection and revealed several novel autophagy-related biomarkers for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo.","output":"Construction of an autophagy interaction network based on competitive endogenous RNA reveals the key pathways and central genes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronaviruses (CoVs) called the attention of the world for causing outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), in Asia in 2002-03, and respiratory disease in the Middle East (MERS-CoV), in 2012. In December 2019, yet again a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first identified in Wuhan, China, was associated with a severe respiratory infection, known today as COVID-19. This new virus is highly transmissible, and quickly spread throughout China and 30 additional countries. As result, the World Health Organization (WHO) elevated the status of the COVID-19 outbreak from emergency of international concern to pandemic on March 11, 2020. The impact of COVID-19 on public health and economy fueled a worldwide race to approve therapeutic and prophylactic agents, but so far, there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines available. In current scenario, the development of in vitro systems for viral mass production and for testing antiviral and vaccine candidates proves to be an urgent matter. Research groups around the world are strongly focused on this, and the susceptibility of different cell lines to SARS-CoV-2 infection has already been demonstrated by molecular techniques. However, data on the biology of SARS-CoV-2 at the ultrastructural level in these in vitro models is still scarce. In this study, we documented, by transmission electron microscopy and real-time RT-PCR, the infection of Vero-E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 samples isolated from Brazilian patients. The infected cells presented cytopathic effects and SARS-CoV-2 particles were observed attached to the cell surface and inside cytoplasmic vesicles. The entry of the virus into cells occurred through the endocytic pathway or by fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. Assembled nucleocapsids were verified inside rough endoplasmic reticulum cisterns (RER). Viral maturation seemed to occur by budding of viral particles from the RER into smooth membrane vesicles. Therefore, the susceptibility of Vero-E6 cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the viral pathway inside the cells were demonstrated by ultrastructural analysis.","output":"Morphology and Morphogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis is a common disease in intensive care medicine representing almost one third of patient admissions. Its incidence has substantially increased over the past decades and overall mortality has declined during this period of time. It was reported that sepsis incidence increased from 82.7 to 240.4 per 100,000 population between 1979C2000. At the same time, sepsis global mortality decreased from 27.8 to 17.9% [1C3]. However, the absolute number of deaths significantly increased from 21.9 to 43.9 per 100,000 population. Male gender, some chronic diseases like diabetes, immunosuppressive states, human immunodeficiency virus infections, and malignancies are factors that increase the risk for sepsis. Some particular conditions like progressive number of organ dysfunctions, in-hospital-acquired infections and increasing age are associated with higher risk of death [1,4]. On the other hand, septic shock mortality only diminished from 61.6 to 53.1% [5]. This slight decline in mortality observed during recent decades could be attributable to improvements in supportive care and/or avoidance of iatrogenic complications. For example, the instrumentation of early goal resuscitation protocols not aiming at supranormal targets for cardiac output and oxygen delivery, and the use of lung protective strategies could explain at least in part this favorable change. Other strategies directed to treat the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the septic process like recombinant human-activated protein-C (rhAPC), have also contributed to improve survival. However, mortality remains unacceptably high and further improvement in sepsis management is needed.","output":"Sepsis: Clinical Approach, Evidence-Based at the Bedside"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to provide a feasibility bask for image processing for automatic throat swab robot sampling.

Secondary outcomes included chest computed tomography (CT), mortality, length of hospital stay, complications during treatment, and so on. Patients were followed up to 4 weeks after discharge (reexamination of viral RNA, chest CT, etc.). Results: Nucleic acid test negative conversion time in group B was shorter than that in group A (2.9 days [2.7-8.7] vs. 6.8 days [3.3-13.8]; p = 0.045).

Alcohol, because it fuels flames and its vapor can cause an explosion, is one of the most common causal agents of burns in Brazil. In late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sudden and substantial increase in the use of 70% alcohol (w/v) for antisepsis. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of alcohol burns during the COVID-19 pandemic in participating Burn Treatment Centers, as well as the severity and treatment of these burns. METHOD: Descriptive, cross-sectional, quantitative and retrospective study based on data obtained from medical records of patients treated in participating Burn Treatment Centers. Data collection included origin, gender, education level, occupation, circumstance of the accident, wound depth and type of treatment. RESULTS: Of eight participating centers, the Hospital da Restaura? ?o Gov. Paulo Guerra Burn Treatment Center experienced the highest number of alcohol burn patients (38.4%) and male gender accounted for 53.6% of all cases. Predominant occupations were those that involve domestic activities (29%) and 48.6% of patients had not completed elementary school. The most common cause was an accident during cooking (35.5%) followed by suicide attempt (18.3%). More than half (58.6%) of the patients had concomitant second and third degree burns and wound treatment of choice was surgical (43.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The predominant population in this study was male, had a lower level of education, resided in the northeast region and had an occupation carried out in a domestic environment. The latter may reflect the population's longer stay at home due to social constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. There were a large number of second and third degree burns and, as a consequence, a high number of cases in which surgical treatment was required.","output":"National multicentric study on the incidence of alcohol burns during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) enable patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) to achieve similar overall survival to the general population, but can cause side effects that negatively impact quality of life (QOL) and contribute to distress. Since most CP-CML patients remain on TKIs indefinitely, there is a need to develop targeted interventions to address their physical and psychosocial complications. Mindfulness meditation interventions have improved QOL and decreased distress, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain in patients with solid tumors;however, such interventions have not previously been evaluated in patients with CP-CML. In Being Present-CML, we sought to determine if a mindfulness meditation-based program is feasible and acceptable to patients with CP-CML, and to explore its preliminary efficacy. Methods: Being Present-CML is a prospective, single-arm clinical trial of an 8-week, online mindfulness meditation-based intervention effective in patients with gastrointestinal cancers (Atreya, et al. PLoS One, 2018). Participants were recruited from a single academic institution. Eligibility included adult patients with CP-CML taking TKIs. Participants were instructed to independently play audio-guided meditations at least 5 times per week on a secure website and to participate in once weekly, instructor-led meditation classes on Zoom in assigned cohorts. Qigong was incorporated into the classes to target fatigue, a common TKI side effect. Class content was recorded and uploaded to the website for those unable to attend live. Feasibility was assessed through measurement of recruitment and attrition. Adherence was determined by web capture. Acceptability was determined by feedback from study surveys and qualitative interviews. Preliminary efficacy was evaluated using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at baseline (week 0) and post-intervention (week 8) using the NCCN Distress Thermometer (DT) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) short forms for anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and sleep disturbance. A DT score 4 is consistent with moderate to severe distress. PROMIS scores use T-scores where the mean score for the general population is 50 (standard deviation [SD] +/-10);higher scores indicate worse symptoms. Descriptive statistics and two-tailed paired t-tests (p <0.05) were used to summarize the data. Results: Between October 2020-April 2021, 98 eligible participants were approached to participate in the study;88 (89.8%) patients agreed to learn more, and 37 (37.8%) patients provided consent. The median age was 51 (range 23-72), 51.5% (n=19/37) were male, and 89.1% (n=33/37) were non-Hispanic White. At time of study start, 83.7% (n=31/37) had a BCR-ABL1 PCR transcript 1% and a median time since diagnosis of 71 months (range 2-234) (Table 1). Of 37 participants, 29 (78.4%) completed end of study procedures;4 (10.8%) dropped out, and 4 (10.8%) did not complete week 8 surveys. The median number of audio meditations listened to per participant was 34 with an average of 4.3 per week. The median number of weekly classes attended and/or recordings viewed per participant was 7 (range 1-8). At baseline, participants had a median DT score of 5 (range 2-8). Average baseline PROMIS scores were slightly worse than the general population in depression (51.4, SD 8.8), anxiety (55.9, SD 7.8), sleep disturbance (51.8, SD 6.9), fatigue (53.9, SD 10.6), and pain interference (52.2, SD 9.9). By week 8, the median DT score improved to 3 (p=0.003) (Figure 1). Post-study PROMIS scores improved in sleep disturbance (p=0.001) and depression (p=0.01) (Figure 2), but not anxiety (p=0.12), fatigue (p=0.10), or pain interference (p=0.98). Of those who conducted post-study interviews, 77% (n=20/26) reported their symptoms during the study were not influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly all participants found the study helpful (Figure 3) and would recommend it to others (median score of 8 on a 1-10 scale;10=extremely likely). Concl sions: Patients with CP-CML taking TKIs found the mindfulness meditation-based intervention to be feasible and acceptable. PROM results suggest promise of clinical benefit in this patient population, including patients with well-controlled disease and a long history of CML. A randomized controlled trial is being planned to validate these findings.

METHODS: Access to General and Departmental OPD data along with treatment records was obtained and was segregated based on age, sex, and treatments performed. Treatments were divided into aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) and non-AGPs and further subdivided into palliative treatment (PT), pulp capping (PC), incision and drainage (ID), temporary filling (TF), pulpectomy (PU), and pulpotomy (PO). Data was analysed and subjected to chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 15052 patients approached general OPD during the period of 8 months of which 5698 (37.86%) were endodontic in origin and treatments offered were PT 858 (15.05%), PO 1560 (27.37%), PU 2018 (35.42%), TF 500 (8.78%), ID 164 (2.88%), and PC 598 (10.94%).

Design, Setting, and Participants: This pooled, repeated cross-sectional study used data from 14a?187a?762 households who participated in phase 1 of the population-representative US 2020 Household Pulse Survey (HPS). Households were invited to participate by email, text message, and/or telephone as many as 3 times.

Exposures: Indicators of race/ethnicity, sex, and income and their intersections. Main Outcomes and Measures: Unemployment; food insufficiency; mental health problems; no medical care received for health problems; default on last month's rent or mortgage; and class cancellations with no distance learning. Race/ethnicity, sex, income, and their intersections were used to measure distributional implications across historically marginalized populations; state-specific, time-varying population mobility was used to measure lockdown intensity.

This has highlighted the need for alternative, accurate, non-invasive strategies to safely assess disease activity. AIMS: The aim of this study is to describe the impact of point of care intestinal ultrasound (IUS) in a university-based tertiary care IBD urgent access clinic. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated a comprehensive care pathway which incorporated outpatient sigmoidoscopy and intestinal ultrasound with the purpose of directing further ambulatory clinical care and avoiding hospitalization or hospital-based investigations including endoscopy during the COVID pandemic for patients with established IBD with symptoms suggestive of a disease flare, or those at high risk of a new diagnosis of IBD. Non-invasive markers C Reactive Protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (fCal) were collected where available. Patients were pre-screened for influenza-like illness, as COVID-19 testing was not available for this population during the study period. Substantial management changes were defined as addition of any medications, biologic switch/ optimization, and or referral for surgical consultation. RESULTS: Between March 15(th) and June 30(th) 2020, a total of 72 patients were seen in the urgent access clinic. All patients were seen within 7 days of referral. The majority were female 57% (41/72) and/ or had Crohns disease 65.5% (47/72) (Table 1). Of these, 84.7% (61/72) underwent a substantial management change based on features of active inflammation detected by either IUS alone (53% 38/72) sigmoidoscopy alone (12.5% 9/72) or combination IUS with in-clinic sigmoidoscopy (32% 23/72) in addition to CRP and fCal. Three new diagnoses of IBD were made: one colonic Crohns and 2 with ulcerative colitis. One pregnant patient avoided all acute care utilization. Five patients were referred to colorectal surgery for urgent resection including two patients admitted directly for emergent operations. No patients required visits to the emergency department. Furthermore, there have been no unscheduled hospitalizations occurred in this cohort since inception March 23, 2020 til November 15(th) 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of IUS in a centralized, urgent access clinic pathway resulted in efficient and meaningful changes in IBD management while sparing the need for acute care services including ER visits, need for in-hospital endoscopy, and hospitalization. The pandemic highlights the utility of this patient-center tool and supports expansion of wider IUS adoption.

CAPA patients were older (mean age 66.58 vs. 59.25 years; P = 0.007) and had underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (13.7 vs. 6.1%; OR 2.75; P = 0.05). No differences in gender, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidities of diabetes and cancer were observed. CAPA patients were more likely to receive long-term corticosteroid treatment (15.0 vs. 5.3%; OR 3.53; P = 0.03). CAPA patients had greater severity of illness based on sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score with a higher all-cause in-hospital mortality rate (42.6 vs. 26.5%; OR 3.39; P < 0.001) and earlier ICU admission from illness onset (mean 11.00 vs. 12.00 days; P = 0.003). ICU length of stay (LOS), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) duration, the requirement of inotropic support and renal replacement therapy were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: CAPA patients are typically older with underlying COPD and received long-term corticosteroid treatment. Furthermore, CAPA is associated with higher SOFA scores, mortality, and earlier onset of ICU admission from illness onset.","output":"Comparing the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19-associate pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA): a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concentration of human population along coastlines has far-reaching effects on ocean and societal health. The oceans provide benefits to humans such as food, coastal protection and improved mental well-being, but can also impact negatively via natural disasters. At the same time, humans influence ocean health, for example, via coastal development or through environmental stewardship. Given the strong feedbacks between ocean and human health there is a need to promote desirable interactions, while minimising undesirable interactions. To this end, we articulate two scenarios for 2030. First, Business-as-Usual, named Command and (out of) Control, focuses on the anticipated future based on our current trajectory. Second, a more sustainable scenario called Living and Connecting, emphasises the development of interactions between oceans and society consistent with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We describe a potential pathway to achieving the Living and Connecting scenario, centred on improving marine citizenship, achieving a more equitable distribution of power among stakeholders, and more equitable access to resources and opportunities. The constituent actions of this pathway can be categorised into four groups: (i) improved approaches to science and health communication that account for societys diverse values, beliefs and worldviews, (ii) a shift towards more trusted relationships among stakeholders to enable two-way knowledge exchange, (iii) economic incentives that encourage behavioural changes necessary for achieving desired sustainability outcomes, and (iv) stronger regulations that simultaneously focus on ocean and human health. We contend that these changes will provide improved outcomes for both oceans and society over the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science.

METHOD We evaluated 271 HCWs from SARS units and 342 healthy control subjects, using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to assess stress levels and a structured list of putative psychological effects of SARS to assess its psychological effects. Healthy control subjects were balanced for age, sex, education, parenthood, living circumstances, and lack of health care experience. RESULTS Stress levels were raised in both groups (PSS = 18) but were not relatively increased in the HCWs. HCWs reported significantly more positive (94%, n = 256) and more negative psychological effects (89%, n = 241) from SARS than did control subjects. HCWs declared confidence in infection-control measures. CONCLUSIONS In HCWs, adaptive responses to stress and the positive effects of infection control training may be protective in future outbreaks.

There is minimal information on potential co-pathogens in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in the US. We analyzed pathogens, antimicrobial use, and healthcare utilization in hospitalized US patients with and without severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included patients with > 1 day of inpatient admission and discharge/death between March 1 and May 31, 2020 at 241 US acute care hospitals in the BD Insights Research Database. We assessed microbiological testing data, antimicrobial utilization in admitted patients with &#8805;24 h of antimicrobial therapy, and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: A total of 141,621 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 (17,003 [12.0%] positive) and 449,339 patients were not tested. Most (> 90%) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 had additional microbiologic testing performed compared with 41.9% of SARS-CoV-2-untested patients. Non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen rates were 20.9% for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients compared with 21.3 and 27.9% for SARS-CoV-2-negative and -untested patients, respectively. Gram-negative bacteria were the most common pathogens (45.5, 44.1, and 43.5% for SARS-CoV-2-positive, -negative, and -untested patients). SARS-CoV-2-positive patients had higher rates of hospital-onset (versus admission-onset) non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative or -untested patients (42.4, 22.2, and 19.5%, respectively), more antimicrobial usage (68.0, 45.2, and 25.1% of patients), and longer hospital LOS (mean [standard deviation (SD)] of 8.6 [11.4], 5.1 [8.9], and 4.2 [8.0] days) and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS (mean [SD] of 7.8 [8.5], 3.6 [6.2], and 3.6 [5.9] days). For all groups, the presence of a non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen was associated with increased hospital LOS (mean [SD] days for patients with versus without a non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen: 13.7 [15.7] vs 7.3 [9.6] days for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, 8.2 [11.5] vs 4.3 [7.9] days for SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, and 7.1 [11.0] vs 3.9 [7.4] days for SARS-CoV-2-untested patients). CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar rates of non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens in SARS-CoV-2-positive, -negative, and -untested patients, SARS-CoV-2 was associated with higher rates of hospital-onset infections, greater antimicrobial usage, and extended hospital and ICU LOS. This finding highlights the heavy burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare systems and suggests possible opportunities for diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship.","output":"A multicenter analysis of the clinical microbiology and antimicrobial usage in hospitalized patients in the US with or without COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widespread and contagious coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has become a burden in the global health domain.

However, data in patients with cancer are limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody levels after the third vaccination dose in 439 patients with cancer and 41 health care workers (HCW) at an academic center in Austria and a rural community hospital in Italy. Adverse events were retrieved from questionnaires. RESULTS: Overall, 439 patients and 41 HCW were included. SARS-CoV-2 infections were observed in 62/439 (14.1%) patients before vaccination and in 5/439 (1.1%) patients after 1 dose. Longitudinal analysis revealed a decrease of antibody levels between 3 and 6 months after second vaccination in patients with solid tumors (p<0.001) and hematological malignancies without anti-B cell therapies (p<0.001). After the third dose, anti-S levels increased as compared to the first/second dose. Patients receiving B cell-targeted agents had lower antibody levels than patients with hematological malignancies undergoing other treatments (p<0.001) or patients with solid tumors (p<0.001). Moreover, anti-S levels correlated with CD19+ (B cell) and CD56+ (NK cell) counts in peripheral blood. The most frequent adverse events after the third dose were local pain (75/160, 46.9%), fatigue (25/160, 15.6%), and fever/chills (16/160, 10.0%). Patients with cancer had lower anti-S levels than HCW (p=0.015).

The GLU-MCSB sorbents are insoluble in aqueous acidic solution and improve adsorption capacity. The adsorption process was carried out by considering various parameters, viz. adsorbent dose, contact time, pH and temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis of beads shows that degradation takes place in two stages. Fourier transform infra-red spectra of magnetic beads exhibit an absorption band at 606 cm-1 for Fe-O. The elemental analysis (energy dispersive X-ray analysis) and scanning electron microscopy were used to analyze the structure and characteristics of MCSB and GLU-MCSB. The Ni(II) removal efficiency attains a highest value of 95.12% with cross-linked GLU-MCSB in comparison to 79.5% with MCSB. Adsorption processes follow the pseudo-second-order rate kinetics model, which suggested that the rate-limiting step may be the chemical adsorption rather than the mass transport. The experimental data of adsorption fitted well with the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms with a high correlation coefficient (R2 > 0.9), showing that monolayer adsorption took place on the surface of GLU-MCSB absorbents. The negative values of entropy change, -175.64 and -163.30 J/(molK), and enthalpy change, -54.75 and -49.58 kJ/mol, for MCSB and GLU-MCSB suggest that the process is spontaneous and exothermic in nature.","output":"Adsorption of nickel (II) ions from wastewater using glutaraldehyde cross-linked magnetic chitosan beads: isotherm, kinetics and thermodynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged disrupting many socio-economical and healthcare aspects across the world This virus can be transmitted by symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals through saliva and contact Due to its airborne transmission, aerosols created by natural activities and during dental treatment of infected individuals have become a potential vehicle of transmission and threat The objective of this review was to assess the existing infection control measures taken in dental health-care settings and suggest modifications to reduce the transmission of novel coronavirus This is a general review publication Literature search was made at National Library of Medicine, Pubmed using key words such as dentistry and COVID, dentistry and COVID and infection control Publications related to behaviour, education, ethics, treatment and childcare were excluded Publications describing general aspects of infection control were reviewed Keyword Dentistry and COVID and Infection control generated 70 publications which were reviewed Infection control measures in dentistry are designed to minimise cross transmission mainly of blood borne pathogens The unique nature of COVID-19 including highly infectious and transmissibility, and the ability to survive for a long time in the environment requires special attention and modification to the existing infection control measures which are highlighted here In conclusion, a modified infection prevention and control (IPC) regime will protect the dental practitioner, assistant and staff, patients and the community During the pandemic, drastic measures are necessary, however, during an endemic period measures can be remodified as necessary ? 2020 The Author(s) Dentistry;Microbiology;Infection control;COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2;IPC ? 2020 The Author(s)","output":"Infection control in dentistry during COVID C 19 pandemic: what has changed?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 continues to spread, with the United States surpassing 29 million cases, health care workers are beginning to see patients who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 return seeking treatment for its longer-term physical and mental effects.

Relevant audiovisual materials were collected from a field investigation in four rural communities in southwestern China. Based on these data, the subjective and objective healing index data of subjects under comprehensive audiovisual conditions were collected and analyzed through laboratory experiments. The results revealed that type of street space affects healing potential, and the artificial-natural enclosed and natural semi-enclosed streets are the street types with the best healing effect. When the total sound pressure level was 55dB(A), the sound combination with birdsong accounting for 70% had a significant positive effect on improving the healing effect of rural community streets. In contrast, the sound combination with birdsong accounting for 50% or less had no significant effect on improving healing. The subjective healing perception of street space in rural communities was significantly positively correlated with aesthetic preferences. There was also a significant correlation between subjective healing perception and physiological index data in the audiovisual combination.

Compared to nucleic acid tests (NATs), antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) can be more accessible, but typically have lower sensitivity and specificity. By quantifying these trade-offs, we aimed to inform decisions about when an Ag-RDT would offer greater public health value than reliance on NAT. METHODS: Following an expert consultation, we selected two use cases for analysis: rapid identification of people with COVID-19 amongst patients admitted with respiratory symptoms in a hospital setting and early identification and isolation of people with mildly symptomatic COVID-19 in a community setting. Using decision analysis, we evaluated the health system cost and health impact (deaths averted and infectious days isolated) of an Ag-RDT-led strategy, compared to a strategy based on NAT and clinical judgement. We adopted a broad range of values for contextual parameters relevant to a range of settings, including the availability of NAT and the performance of clinical judgement. We performed a multivariate sensitivity analysis to all of these parameters. RESULTS: In a hospital setting, an Ag-RDT-led strategy would avert more deaths than a NAT-based strategy, and at lower cost per death averted, when the sensitivity of clinical judgement is less than 90%, and when NAT results are available in time to inform clinical decision-making for less than 85% of patients. The use of an Ag-RDT is robustly supported in community settings, where it would avert more transmission at lower cost than relying on NAT alone, under a wide range of assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their imperfect sensitivity and specificity, Ag-RDTs have the potential to be simultaneously more impactful, and have a lower cost per death and infectious person-days averted, than current approaches to COVID-19 diagnostic testing.

The physiological functions of sex hormones are complex. Sex hormones are not only pathologically correlated with many diseases of the reproductive system, but are etiological factors in some viral infectious diseases, including disease caused by infections of coronaviruses, herpesviruses, hepatitis viruses, and other kinds of human viruses, which either exhibit a male propensity in clinical practice, or crosstalk with androgen receptor (AR)-related pathways in viral pathogenesis. Due to the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the role of androgen/AR in viral infectious disease is highlighted again, majorly representing by the recent advances of AR-responsive gene of transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), which proteolytically activates the receptor-mediated virus entry by many coronaviruses and influenza virus, along with the role of androgen-mediated signaling for the transcription of hepatitis B virus (HBV), and the role of sex hormone responsive genes during Zika virus (ZIKV) pathogenesis, et al. Collectively, we propose to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of male sex hormones during multiple phases in the life cycle of different human viruses, which may be partly responsible for the sex-specific prevalence, severity and mortality of some diseases, therefore, may provide clues to develop more efficient prevention and treatment strategies for high-risk populations.","output":"Host Sex Steroids Interact With Virus Infection: New Insights Into Sex Disparity in Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is a robust legume; nevertheless, yield is always affected by drought, especially when it occurs during reproductive growth and seed filling. Considered a key crop in the effort to attain food security, and a suitable crop for a scenario of climate change, modern disregard for cowpea landraces is particularly detrimental as it causes genetic variability loss, compromising breeding efforts. To contribute to the evaluation of the cowpea germplasm, four Portuguese landraces (L1, L2, L3, L4) were compared with a commercial variety (CV) to evaluate their physiological responses to terminal drought and their inter-variation on productivity, under semi-controlled conditions. Despite no differences in relative water content (RWC) between the CV and the landraces under water deficit (WD), differences in leaf water potential () defined the CV as having an isohydric control of stomata in contrast with anisohydric control for landraces. There was an identical decrease in the photosynthetic rate for all plants under stress, caused by both stomatal and non-stomatal limitations, namely, damages at the level of photosystem II as indicated by fluorescence measurements. Instantaneous water use efficiency (iWUE) was improved with stress in L1 and L3. Maintenance of higher relative chlorophyll content for longer periods in the CV revealed a stay-green phenotype. The slim differences observed in terms of stomatal control, iWUE and progression of senescence between the CV and the landraces under WD led to quite important differences in terms of productivity, as inferred from improved yield (number of pods and number of grains per plant). This is a clear result of pragmatic on-farm selection. On one hand it shows that small differences in stomatal responses or water saving strategies under WD may lead to desirable outcomes and should therefore be considered during breeding. On the other hand, it suggests that other traits could be explored in view of drought adaptation.

The article reviews the information produced and published during the crisis. The author proposes a typology of information and categorizes messages based on their contextualization within the Caribbean environment. Design/methodology/approach The research method is developed around three main stages: a review of literature on leadership and information dissemination;synthesis of information to inform the typology;and discussion of the information reflecting the interplay between leadership and information dissemination. Findings The literature shows a legacy of deceit that dominates the history of healthcare for Blacks and Caribbean people. This heritage has helped to fashion individual attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic in the Caribbean. The research also highlights that in addressing the several typologies of information, varying leadership styles came to bare. The democratic leadership style was the most dominant among the Caribbean countries, while some illustrations of autocratic leadership were visible. Other leadership facets and traits fashion responses by the leaders in managing information dissemination during the crisis. The paper also observes a triangular system of information which highlights where influences exist between relationships (governments, media/NGOs and society) and how such relationships lend to shaping the behavior of others. Research limitations/implications Limitations on the research are based on the author's philosophy and interpretation. In addition, much of the information surrounding COVID-19 is novel and hence difficult to fact-check because of the unique nature of COVID-19. Practical implications This paper provides a better understanding of the typology of information during a crisis like COVID-19. The discussion on leveraging leadership strategy and competencies for dissemination of information during a crisis provides an optimistic perspective to guide leaders in managing information dissemination during a crisis. Social implications The typology is helpful in delineating the way society interprets information based on other crisis. It also helps with assessing the leadership styles and understanding potential tailor-made strategies. Originality/value The development of an information typology that provides insight into the influence that historical perspectives give to interpreting information in a health crisis in a Caribbean context. The research also looks at the strategies pursued by Caribbean leaders as they adopt novel and promising techniques to communicate during a crisis.","output":"Leadership and information dissemination: challenges and opportunities in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various studies have shown that certain flavonoids, flavonoid-containing plant extracts, and foods can improve human health.

We show that these memetic clips consist of three distinct genres of mothers working from home: (1) 'balancing mothers' who balance between work and childcare, (2) 'pedagogic mothers' who give childcare tips, and (3) 'commercially oriented' mothers who offer tutorials by means of product placement and advertisement. While these memes express what Mary Douglas called 'a joke in the social structure' without offering either relief or critique, they do create an online joking culture that offers temporary relief as well as awareness that others are in the same position.

These restrictions progressively produced changes to social behavior and global mobility patterns, evidently disrupting social and economic activities. Here, using maritime traffic data, collected via a global network of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers, we analyze the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures had on the shipping industry, which accounts alone for more than 80% of the world trade. We introduce the notion of a\\"maritime mobility index,\\"a synthetic composite index, to quantitatively assess ship mobility in a given unit of time. The mobility index calculation used in this study, has a worldwide extent and is based on the computation of cumulative navigated miles (CNM) of all ships reporting their position and navigational status via AIS. We compare 2020 mobility levels to those of previous years assuming that an unchanged growth rate would have been achieved, if not for COVID-19. Following the outbreak, we find an unprecedented drop in maritime mobility, across all categories of commercial shipping. The reduced activity is observable from March to June, when the most severe restrictions were in force, producing a variation of mobility quantified between -5.62% and -13.77% for container ships, between +2.28% and -3.32% for dry bulk, between -0.22% and -9.27% for wet bulk, and between -19.57% and -42.77% for passenger shipping.

Treatment with tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, was shown to lead to clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19. We, therefore, performed the present systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether the circulating levels of IL-6 is a reliable indicator of disease severity among patients affected with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar on April 19, 2020. RESULTS: Eleven studies provided data of IL-6 levels in patients with severe to critical COVID-19 (severe) and patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (non-severe). The included studies were of moderate to high quality. The mean patients' age was 60.9 years, ranging from 45.2 to 76.7 years in the severe group and 46.8 years, ranging from 37.9 to 61 years, in the nonsevere group. Fifty-two percent were male in the severe group, as compared to 46% in the non-severe group. An overall random effects meta-analysis showed significantly higher serum levels of IL-6 in the severe group than in the non-severe group with a mean difference of +23.1 pg/mL (95% CI: 12.42-33.79) and the overall effect of 4.24 (P-value < 0.001). Meta-regressions showed that neither age nor sex significantly influenced the mean difference of IL-6 between the groups.

Partitiviruses generally infect host fungi asymptomatically but infrequently exert significant effect(s) on morphology and virulence, thus being considered a potential source of biological control agents against pathogenic fungi. In this study, we performed a screening for mycoviruses of a collection of Thai isolates of rice fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia oryzae-sativae, a causal agent of rice aggregated sheath spot disease. As a result, 36% of tested isolates carried potentially viral double-stranded RNAs with sizes ranging from 2 to 3 kbp. By conventional cDNA library construction and RNA-seq, we determined six new alphapartitiviruses that infected three isolates: tentatively named Rhizoctonia oryzae-sativae partitivirus 1 to 6 (RosPV1-6). Furthermore, RT-PCR detection of each virus revealed their omnipresent nature in different R. oryzae-sativae isolates. Although virus-curing of basidiomycetous fungi is generally difficult, our repeated attempts successfully obtained virus-free (for RosPV1, RosPV2, and uncharacterized partitiviruses), isogenic strain of R. oryzae-sativae TSS190442.

RESEARCH AIMS (1) To determine the breastfeeding rate during the first 6 months of life in children of mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 infection at the time of birth; and (2) to assess the possible influence of being born in a center with Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative accreditation. METHODS This was a two-group comparative longitudinal observational study of infants born to mothers with COVID-19 at the time of birth, between March 13-May 31, 2020 (the first wave of the pandemic) in Spain. Fourteen Spanish hospitals participated, five (35.7%) were Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative accredited. Type of feeding was assessed prospectively at discharge, 1, 3, and 6 months of age. A total of 248 newborns were included in the study. RESULTS A total of 117 (47.3%) newborns were born in Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) accredited centers. These centers applied skin-to-skin contact with greater probability (OR = 1.9; 95% CI [1.18, 3.29]) and separated the newborns from their mothers less frequently (OR = 0.46; 95% CI [0.26, 0.81]) than non-accredited centers. No differences were observed in relation to the presence of a companion at the time of birth. At discharge, 49.1% (n = 57) of newborns born in BFHI-accredited centers received exclusive breastfeeding versus 35.3% (n = 46) in non-accredited centers (p = .03). No differences were observed in breastfeeding rates throughout follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The exclusive breastfeeding rate at discharge in children of mothers with COVID-19 infection at birth was higher in Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative accredited centers, which most frequently applied skin-to-skin contact at birth as well as rooming-in.","output":"Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative Breastfeeding Outcomes in Mothers with COVID-19 Infection During the First Weeks of the Pandemic in Spain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BK virus is a common opportunistic viral infection that could cause BK virus-associated nephropathy in renal transplant recipients. Thus, we retrospectively analyzed clinical and laboratory data associated with a higher risk of BK virus activation from 195 renal transplant recipients by the multivariate logistic regression analysis and performed the external validation. Results showed that patients with BK virus active infection were associated with a deceased donor, had lower direct bilirubin levels, a higher proportion of albumin in serum protein electrophoresis, and lower red blood cells and neutrophil counts. The multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the living donor, direct bilirubin, and neutrophil counts were significantly associated with BK virus activation. The logistic regression model displayed a modest discriminability with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.689 (95% CI: 0.607C0.771; P < 0.01) and also demonstrated a good performance in the external validation dataset (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.699, 95% CI: 0.5899C0.8081).

In the early response to the pandemic many countries restricted population movements and some health services were suspended or limited. In late 2020 and early 2021 some countries re-imposed restrictions. Health authorities need to balance the potential harms of additional SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to contacts associated with health services against the benefits of those services, including fewer new HIV infections and deaths. This paper examines these trade-offs for select HIV services. METHODS: We used four HIV simulation models (Goals, HIV Synthesis, Optima HIV and EMOD) to estimate the benefits of continuing HIV services in terms of fewer new HIV infections and deaths. We used three COVID-19 transmission models (Covasim, Cooper/Smith and a simple contact model) to estimate the additional deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 transmission among health workers and clients. We examined four HIV services: voluntary medical male circumcision, HIV diagnostic testing, viral load testing and programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission. We compared COVID-19 deaths in 2020 and 2021 with HIV deaths occurring now and over the next 50 years discounted to present value. The models were applied to countries with a range of HIV and COVID-19 epidemics. RESULTS: Maintaining these HIV services could lead to additional COVID-19 deaths of 0.002 to 0.15 per 10,000 clients. HIV-related deaths averted are estimated to be much larger, 19C146 discounted deaths per 10,000 clients. DISCUSSION: While there is some additional short-term risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with providing HIV services, the risk of additional COVID-19 deaths is at least 100 times less than the HIV deaths averted by those services. Ministries of Health need to take into account many factors in deciding when and how to offer essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work shows that the benefits of continuing key HIV services are far larger than the risks of additional SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","output":"The risks and benefits of providing HIV services during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex disease associated with chronic pain. Many patients treat their joint pain at a symptomatic level with over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications, often without the knowledge of their physicians. The aim of this study was to provide physicians with data about osteoarthritic patients habits of pain management and to examine the explanatory factors of various ways of self-treatment. Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 189 patients with hip or knee OA and scheduled for joint replacement surgery was carried out. Participants filled out a self-administered questionnaire consisting of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and questions about their methods of alleviating pain. Results: 2.6% of patients did not use anything to alleviate their pain, while 63% practiced a non-pharmacological method. Diclofenac was the most frequently used drug, followed by ibuprofen. Profession had the greatest impact on medication habits; patients doing manual work were significantly more likely to take OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and use topical analgesics. Conclusions: Patients utilized a wide variety of pain management techniques. They seemed to use well-known painkillers, even if their side effects were less desirable.

Detecting viral movement by sequence analysis is complicated by skewed geographic and seasonal distributions in viral isolates. We propose a probabilistic method that accounts for sampling bias through spatiotemporal clustering and modeling regional and seasonal transmission as a binomial process. Analysis of H3N2 not only confirmed East-Southeast Asia as a source of new seasonal variants, but also increased the resolution of observed transmission to a country level. H1N1 data revealed similar viral spread from the tropics. Network analysis suggested China and Hong Kong as the origins of new seasonal H3N2 strains and the United States as a region where increased vaccination would maximally disrupt global spread of the virus. These techniques provide a promising methodology for the analysis of any seasonal virus, as well as for the continued surveillance of influenza.","output":"Network Analysis of Global Influenza Spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: This study aimed to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected youth presentations to the Emergency Department's psychiatric service and how many warranted an inpatient and acute residential admission.

The immune system is crucial in defending and eliminating the virus and infected cells. However, immune dysregulation may result in the rapid progression of COVID-19. Here, we evaluated the subsets, phenotypic and functional characteristics of natural killer (NK) and T cells in patients with COVID-19 and their associations with disease severity. Methods: Demographic and clinical data of COVID-19 patients enrolled in Wuhan Union Hospital from February 25 to February 27, 2020, were collected and analyzed. The phenotypic and functional characteristics of NK cells and T cells subsets in circulating blood and serum levels of cytokines were analyzed via flow cytometry. Then the LASSO logistic regression model was employed to predict risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. Results: The counts and percentages of NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NKT cells were significantly reduced in patients with severe symptoms. The cytotoxic CD3-CD56dimCD16+ cell population significantly decreased, while the CD3-CD56dimCD16- part significantly increased in severe COVID-19 patients. More importantly, elevated expression of regulatory molecules, such as CD244 and programmed death-1 (PD-1), on NK cells and T cells, as well as decreased serum cytotoxic effector molecules including perforin and granzyme A, were detected in patients with COVID-19. The serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945; were significantly increased in severe patients. Moreover, the CD3-CD56dimCD16- cells were screened out as an influential factor in severe cases by LASSO logistic regression. Conclusions: The functional exhaustion and other subset alteration of NK and T cells may contribute to the progression and improve the prognosis of COVID-19.

The admission of large numbers of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease risks overwhelming the capacity to protect other patients from exposure. The delay between clinical suspicion and confirmatory testing adds to the complexity of the problem. METHODS: We implemented a triage tool aimed at minimising hospital acquired COVID-19 particularly to patients at risk of severe disease. Patients were allocated to triage categories defined by likelihood of COVID-19 and risk of a poor outcome. Category A (low-likelihood; high-risk), B (high-likelihood; high-risk), C (high-likelihood; low-risk) and D (low-likelihood; low-risk). This determined the order of priority for isolation in single-occupancy rooms with Category A the highest. Patients in other groups were cohorted when isolation capacity was limited with additional interventions to reduce transmission. RESULTS: 93 patients were evaluated with 79 (85%) receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis during their admission. Of those without a COVID-19 diagnosis: 10 were initially triaged to Category A; 0 to B; 1 to C and 4 to D. All high risk patients requiring isolation were, therefore, admitted to single-occupancy rooms and protected from exposure. 28 (30%) suspected COVID-19 patients were evaluated to be low risk (groups C & D) and eligible for cohorting. No symptomatic hospital acquired infections were detected in the cohorted patients.

In our validation study, sVNT IC50 titers and the neutralization rate measured at a single dilution (1:20) were well correlated with FRNT titers (r = 0.85 and 0.84, respectively). The median time to seroconversion of NAbs was 5.5 days post onset of symptoms. The rate of positive sVNT was 52% in the first week, reached 100% in the third week, and remained above 97% till 6 months post onset. Quantitatively, NAbs peaked in the fourth week and only a quarter of patients had an estimated peak titer of >1000. NAbs declined with a half-time of 61 days (95% CI: 49-80 days) within the first two months, and the decay deaccelerated to a half-time of 104 days (95% CI: 86-130 days) afterward.

It relies on ICU physical therapists for in-person intervention delivery, acute care therapists (including physical and occupational therapists, and therapy assistants) for primary outcomes assessments, and research coordinators (RCs) for 90-day telephone followup. Like many studies, CYCLE recruitment was abruptly interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, posing immediate threats to study internal validity. Amidst much uncertainty, we aimed to honor our research commitment to those enrolled before the pandemic. Methods: On March 17, 2020, the province of Ontario declared a state of emergency. Most participating CYCLE institutions halted enrolment to non-COVID research activities. We conducted a cross-sectional standardized email survey to determine the number of patients currently enrolled in the ICU or hospital and the status of patients pending 90-day assessment up to April 30, 2020. We assessed protocol fidelity in the following ways: For patients in ICU, we documented any attempt to provide the randomized intervention. For patients in hospital, we documented any attempt for physical outcomes assessments, prioritizing the primary outcome. For patients discharged from hospital, we documented whether a 90-day phone call was attempted. We also sought feedback to address needs identified by RCs to complete 90-day follow-up remotely. Results: As of March 17, 2020, we enrolled 197 patients in CYCLE overall, and 24 (12.2%) were in hospital or pending 90-day follow-up by April 30. From 15 active sites (12 Canada, 2 US, 1 Australia), 11 (73%) had 24 unique patients of immediate concern (4 ICU, 9 hospital, 16 for 90-day follow-up). All ICU (4/4) interventions and all 90-day calls (17/17) were attempted. Of hospital outcomes assessments, 89% (8/9) were attempted. One site could not complete primary outcomes assessment in hospital due to institutional pandemic policy. We developed guidance to conduct remote 90-day follow up calls from RC personal phones, considering study integrity, and patient and staff confidentiality. Conclusions: We used methodologically rigorous, time-sensitive strategies to address uncertainty during the first wave of the pandemic. We successfully retained almost all patients of immediate concern during the initial period of COVID-19.

Spain has been tourist place and host million foreign tourist. The tourism is highly depended on climate and thermal comfortness of the visiting place. This present research aimed to analyze the outdoor thermal comfort conditions in microclimates of the urban ancient plazas of the two important cities of Spain, namely Sevilla and Madrid on a hot humid stress day of the year. The microclimatic measurement, questionnaire survey, and simulation results were examined to evaluate the thermal comfort condition of six different urban plazas in Sevilla and Madrid to distinguish the supreme time to visit each ancient site. The results have suggested that the outdoor thermal comfort range for the tourist in the historical plazas of Sevilla and Madrid varies from 28.42 to 30.87 C and 24.5 to 29.82 C in the hot summer. Despite the high heat stress condition, the result of questionnaires survey shows that about 38.11% and 28.09% of tourists in Sevilla and Madrid, respectively, were satisfied with the thermal conditions. As witnessed from the result of the Envi-met simulation, Plaza de Santa Ana of Madrid and Plaza Nueva of Sevilla is the best place for visitors in the early morning hours. Additionally, during the peak hours, the thermal comfort of Alameda de Hercules of Sevilla and Plaza de Santa Ana of Madrid is the most suitable historical places for visitors, whereas in the evening hours, Plaza Nueva of Sevilla and Plaza de Mayor of Madrid with wider semi-open spaces and relatively suitable vegetation bring more favorable conditions for visitors.

Comparison of entire genomes, including 237 human, simian and non-primate mammal lentiviruses and 103 negative control viruses, led to identify 28 Conserved Lentiviral Sequences (CLSs). They were located mainly in the structural genes forming hot spots particularly in the gag and pol genes and to a lesser extent in LTRs and regulatory genes. The CLS pattern was the same throughout the different HIV-1 subtypes, except for some HIV-1-O strains. Only CLS 3 and 4 were detected in both negative control HTLV-1 oncornaviruses and D-particle-forming simian viruses, which are not immunodeficiency inducers and display a genetic stability. CLSs divided the virus genomes into domains allowing us to distinguish sequence families leading to the notion of species self besides that of lentiviral self.

We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and associated risk factors among incarcerated adult men in Quebec, Canada.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in 2021 in three provincial prisons, representing 45% of Quebecs incarcerated male provincial population. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity (Roche Elecsys? serology test). Participants completed self-administered questionnaires on sociodemographic, clinical, and carceral characteristics. The association of carceral variables with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was examined using Poisson regression models with robust standard errors. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated.Findings: Between January 19 and September 15, 2021, 246 of 1,100 (22%) recruited individuals tested positive across three prisons (range 15C27%). Seropositivity increased with time spent in prison since March 2020 (aPR 217, 95%CI 153C307 for all vs. little time), employment during incarceration (aPR 164, 95%CI 128C211 vs. not), shared meal consumption during incarceration (with cellmates: aPR 146, 95%CI 108C1.97 vs. alone;with sector: aPR 134, 95%CI 103C174 vs. alone), and incarceration post-prison outbreak (aPR 232, 95% CI 169C318 vs. pre-outbreak).Interpretation: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among incarcerated individuals was high and varied between prisons. Several carceral factors were associated with seropositivity, underscoring the importance of decarceration and occupational safety measures, individual meal consumption, and enhanced infection prevention and control measures including vaccination during incarceration.

Given the importance of these components in determining performance, it is of interest to understand the volume of evidence to support implementation in practice by coaches, practitioners, and athletes. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic mapping review to describe the current scale and density of research for testing, training and optimising performance in track cycling. METHODS All publications involving track cyclist participants were reviewed from four databases (PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Academic Search Complete, Cochrane Library) plus additional sources. Search results returned 4019 records, of which 71 met the inclusion criteria for the review. RESULTS The review revealed most published track cycling research investigated athlete testing followed by performance optimisation, with training being the least addressed domain. Research on the physical components of track cycling has been published far more frequently than for tactical or technical components, and only one study was published on the mental components of track cycling. No true experimental research using track cyclists has been published, with 51 non-experimental and 20 quasi-experimental study designs. CONCLUSIONS Research in track cycling has been growing steadily. However, it is evident there is a clear preference toward understanding the physical-rather than mental, tactical, or technical-demands of track cycling.

Consequently, many cancer patients are diagnosed late and outcomes are poor. Here, we propose to evaluate circulating tumour (ct) DNA analysis (liquid biopsy), a less invasive and faster approach to diagnose endemic EBV-driven lymphomas (EBVL) in East Africa. METHODS: We will evaluate the clinical utility of an already validated ctDNA test prospectively in a head-to-head comparison against histopathology. The primary endpoint is the time from presentation to the specialist centre to a final diagnosis of EBV- Lymphoma. Secondary endpoints include the sensitivity and specificity of liquid biopsy and health economic benefits over histopathology. One hundred forty-six patients will be recruited over 18 months. Patients will be eligible if they are 3C30 years of age and have provided written consent or assent as per IRB guidelines. Tissue and venous blood samples will be processed as per established protocols. Clinical data will be captured securely and in real-time into a REDCap database. The time from presentation to diagnosis will be documented. The sensitivity and specificity of the methods can be estimated within 5% error margin with 95% confidence level using 73 cases and 73 controls. Health-economic assessment will include micro-costing of ctDNA test and histopathology. All results will be reviewed in a multidisciplinary tumour board. DISCUSSION: The study evaluates the clinical utility of ctDNA in improving the speed of diagnostic pathways for EBVL in sub-Saharan Africa. Our results would provide proof-of-principle that ctDNA can be used as a diagnostic tool in areas without access to regular pathology, that transfer of the tool is feasible, and that it leads to an earlier and faster diagnosis. The potential clinical and economic impact of this proposal is thus significant. If successful, this study will provide appropriate, and cost-effective diagnostic tools that will promote earlier diagnosis of EBVL and potentially other cancers in countries with restricted healthcare resources.

Performance on post-curricular tests was compared between CTs who participated in the new curriculum to those who did not. METHODS The simulation-based curriculum was developed by content and education experts. Simulations sequentially taught the skills necessary for initiating and weaning from CPB as well as managing crises by adding fidelity and complexity to scenarios. Nine CTs were randomly assigned to the new curriculum (n=5) or the traditional curriculum (n=4). Skills were assessed using tests of medical knowledge and technical, communication (GRS) and critical thinking (SCT) skills. A two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test compared average scores between the two groups. Alpha of 0.05 was set to indicate statistically significant differences. RESULTS The resutls revealed that CTs in the new curriculum significantly outperformed CTs in the traditional curriculum on technical (18.2 vs 14.8, p=0.05) and communication (3.5 vs 2.2, p=0.013) skills.

Methods: We performed a Web-based, anonymous survey of ASOPRS members from November to December 2020. Statistical analyses were performed by using Fisher's exact and Chi-squared tests. Results: We received 196 unique survey responses from 963 invited participants (20.5% response rate).

Very few of those currently using telemedicine (14%) had used telemedicine before March 15, 2020 and a significant proportion (36%) were unsure or did not plan to use telemedicine post-pandemic. Telemedicine use was more common among participants with fewer years in practice (p < 0.01) and those who were university- versus self-employed (p < 0.01).

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, natural SARS-CoV-2 infections have mainly been confirmed in domestic and production animals, and in wild animals kept in captivity, although the numbers remain limited when compared to human cases. Recently, the first SARS-CoV-2 infections in presumably escaped minks found in the wild have been detected, further addressing the much-feared scenario of transmission of the virus to animals living in the wild and its consequences. Considering the most likely origin of the virus being a wild animal and the putative susceptibilities of free-ranging wild animal species to SARS-CoV-2, the risk of infection with possible establishment of the virus in these populations has to be investigated closely. The authors conclude that most attention should be given to surveillance and awareness-raising activities for SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild mustelids, bats, wild canids and felids, particularly these collected in wildlife rescue centres. People involved in frequent and close contact with wild animals should take all necessary precautionary measures to protect wild animals against exposure to the virus.

The major clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is interstitial pneumonia, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the disease causes a potent systemic hyperin-flammatory response, i.e., a cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which is associated with thrombotic complications. The complexity of the disease requires appropriate intensive treatment. One of promising treatment is statin administration, these being 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors that exert pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects. Recent studies indicate that statin therapy is associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19, which may be caused by direct and indirect mechanisms. According to literature data, statins can limit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and replication by inhibiting the main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The cytokine storm can be ameliorated by lowering serum IL-6 levels; this can be achieved by inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and modulating macrophage activity. Statins can also reduce the complications of COVID-19, such as thrombosis and pulmonary fibrosis, by reducing serum PAI-1 levels, attenuating TGF-? and VEGF in lung tissue, and improving endothelial function. Despite these benefits, statin therapy may have side effects that should be considered, such as elevated creatinine kinase (CK), liver enzyme and serum glucose levels, which are already elevated in severe COVID-19 infection.

OBJECTIVE: To provide a pooled estimate of GI symptoms, liver enzyme levels outside reference ranges, and fecal tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 among patients with COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: An electronic literature search was performed for published (using MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase) and preprint (using bioRxiv and medRxiv) studies of interest conducted from November 1, 2019, to March 30, 2020. Search terms included COVID-19, SARS-Cov-2, and/or novel coronavirus. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies were those including patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who reported GI symptoms. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data on patients with GI symptoms (ie, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting), liver enzyme level changes, and fecal shedding of virus were extracted. Quality of studies was examined using methodological index for nonrandomized studies. Pooled estimates (%) were reported with 95% CIs with level of heterogeneity (I(2)). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Study and patient characteristics with pooled detection rates for diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, liver enzyme levels outside reference ranges, and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in feces tests were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1484 records reviewed, 23 published and 6 preprint studies were included in the analysis, with a total of 4805 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.2 [14.8] years; 1598 [33.2%] women) with COVID-19. The pooled rates were 7.4% (95% CI, 4.3%-12.2%) of patients reporting diarrhea and 4.6% (95% CI, 2.6%-8.0%) of patients reporting nausea or vomiting. The pooled rate for aspartate aminotransferase levels outside reference ranges was 20% (95% CI, 15.3%-25.6%) of patients, and the pooled rate for alanine aminotransferase levels outside reference ranges was 14.6% (95% CI, 12.8%-16.6%) of patients. Fecal tests that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 were reported in 8 studies, and viral RNA shedding was detected in feces in 40.5% (95% CI, 27.4%-55.1%) of patients. There was high level of heterogeneity (I(2) = 94%), but no statistically significant publication bias noted.

The assessment included the Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire; symptoms score (0 = absent to 3 = severe) for burning, ocular dryness, foreign body sensation, watery eyes, tearing, photophobia, and ocular pain; fluorescein tear break-up time (TBUT); and corneal-conjunctival staining, performed at baseline (T0), after 7 (T7) and 28 (T28). Schirmer I-test, corneal endothelial cell count, intraocular pressure, and fundus examination were performed at T0 and T28. The main outcome measures were TBUT and corneal-conjunctival staining as markers of ocular surface homeostasis. For statistical analysis, Student's T-test and Wilcoxon test were used as appropriate. Results: No significant alterations of the safety parameters were found throughout the study. Further, at T28 a significant improvement of burning, ocular dryness, foreign body sensation, and watery eyes (T0 vs. T28 P < 0.03) were observed; corneal-conjunctival staining improved at T28 (T0 vs. T28 P < 0.0001), and TBUT improved already at T7 (T0 vs. T7 P = 0.0008) lasting so till the end of the study. The only adverse event was mild burning at instillation for the first 3 days of treatment in most of the patients.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has infected 70 million people and caused the death of 1.58 million people since the US Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization to develop a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 on December 11, 2020. COVID-19 is a global crisis that has impacted everything directly connected with human beings, including the environment. This review discusses the impacts of COVID-19 on the environment during the pandemic and post-COVID-19 era. During the first months of the COVID pandemic, global coal, oil, gas, and electricity demands declined by 8%, 5%, 2%, and 20%, respectively, relative to 2019. Stay-at-home orders in countries increased the concentrations of particles in indoor environments while decreasing the concentrations of PM(2.5) and NO(X) in outdoor environments. Remotely working in response to the COVID-19 pandemic increased the carbon, water, and land footprints of Internet usage. Microplastics are released into our environment from the mishandling and mismanagement of personal protective equipment that endanger our water, soils, and sediments. Since the COVID-19 vaccine cannot be stored for a long time and spoils rapidly, more awareness of the massive waste of unused doses is needed.

Among them, the FliC and FliD are considered to be suitable candidates. In this paper, the FliC and FliD protein polypeptide epitopes were mapped in silico and by using PEPSCAN procedure. We identified four promising epitopes: (117)QRMRTLS(123), (205)MSKAG(209) of FliC and (226)NKVAS(230), (306)TTKKPKD(312) of FliD protein.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, international multicenter study, we reviewed the electronic medical records and imaging of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from March 3, 2020, to June 25, 2020. Our inclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with acute neurologic manifestations and available chest CT and brain imaging. The 5 lobes of the lungs were individually scored on a scale of 0-5 (0 corresponded to no involvement and 5 corresponded to >75% involvement). A CT lung severity score was determined as the sum of lung involvement, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement). RESULTS: A total of 135 patients met the inclusion criteria with 132 brain CT, 36 brain MR imaging, 7 MRA of the head and neck, and 135 chest CT studies. Compared with 86 (64%) patients without acute abnormal findings on neuroimaging, 49 (36%) patients with these findings had a significantly higher mean CT lung severity score (9.9 versus 5.8, P < .001). These patients were more likely to present with ischemic stroke (40 [82%] versus 11 [13%], P < .0001) and were more likely to have either ground-glass opacities or consolidation (46 [94%] versus 73 [84%], P = .01) in the lungs. A threshold of the CT lung severity score of >8 was found to be 74% sensitive and 65% specific for acute abnormal findings on neuroimaging. The neuroimaging hallmarks of these patients were acute ischemic infarct (28%), intracranial hemorrhage (10%) including microhemorrhages (19%), and leukoencephalopathy with and/or without restricted diffusion (11%). The predominant CT chest findings were peripheral ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation. CONCLUSIONS: The CT lung disease severity score may be predictive of acute abnormalities on neuroimaging in patients with COVID-19 with neurologic manifestations.

Seven cytotoxic (CTL) and five helper T-cells (HTL) epitopes from ORF1ab were identified using NetCTLpan and NetMHCIIpan algorithms, respectively. These epitopes were generated from ORF1ab regions that are evolutionary stable as reflected by zero Shannons entropy and are presented by 56 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class I and 22 HLA Class II, ensuring good coverage for the Indonesian and world population. Having fulfilled other criteria such as immunogenicity, IFN inducing ability, and non-homology to human and microbiome peptides, the epitopes were assembled into a vaccine construct (VC) together with -defensin as adjuvant and appropriate linkers. The VC was shown to have good physicochemical characteristics and capability of inducing CTL as well as HTL responses, which stem from the engagement of the vaccine with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as revealed by docking simulations. The most promiscuous peptide (899)WSMATYYLF(907) was shown via docking simulation to interact well with HLA-A*24:07, the most predominant allele in Indonesia.

The main distinguishing feature of the current administration is the reversal of the trade balance in 2019;ii) Mexico moved towards a low growth regime at the end of 2018.

The majority of these lesions are benign but some progress to invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). There is a dearth of mouse models of these conditions. The orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 regulates development, differentiation, and inflammation. Germline Nr5a2 heterozygosity sensitizes mice to the oncogenic effects of mutant Kras in the pancreas. Here, we show that - unlike constitutive Nr5a2+/- mice - conditional Nr5a2 heterozygosity in pancreatic epithelial cells, combined with mutant Kras, (KPN+/- ) leads to a dramatic replacement of the pancreatic parenchyma with cystic structures and an accelerated development of high grade PanINs and PDAC. Timed histopathological analyses indicated that in KPN+/- mice PanINs precede the formation of cystic lesions and the latter precede PDAC. A single episode of acute caerulein pancreatitis is sufficient to accelerate the development of cystic lesions in KPN+/- mice. Epithelial cells of cystic lesions of KPN+/- mice express MUC1, MUC5AC, and MUC6 but lack expression of MUC2, CDX2 and acinar markers, indicative of a pancreato-biliary/gastric phenotype. In accordance with this, in human samples we found a non-significantly decreased expression of NR5A2 in mucinous tumours, compared with conventional PDAC. These results highlight that the effects of loss of one Nr5a2 allele are time- and cell context-dependent.

The hand gel was characterized by pH, viscosity, and spreadability. Results showed that this product has low viscosity, high spreadability and pH of 6.3, which is less likely to cause skin irritation. The antibacterial assessment (zone of inhibition) of the BKC-based hand sanitizer demonstrated antibacterial activities against nine out of eleven gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains, while the acceptability study on ten participants showed no signs of skin irritation nor redness upon its application.

Firstly, we performed a statistical analysis at the national level, carried out on a region-by-region basis, to compare the total number of deaths in 2020 to the average values of the previous five years. We focused on the last three weeks of March when the lockdown restrictions have been fully applied. We observed that the mortality rate has been much higher than the average recorded in recent years (2015-2019), both in Italy and Lombardy. Additionally, we estimated that the excess deaths in March 2020 are more than fourfold (325% in Italy) the official number of deaths due to Covid-19 reported by the Ministry of Health.

In this regard, electrochemical sensors and biosensors are considered promising tools for antioxidant research due to their high sensitivity, fast response time, and ease of miniaturization; thus, they are used in a variety of fields, including food analysis, drug screening, and toxicity research. Herein, we review the recent advances in sensors and biosensors for the detection of antioxidants, underlying principles, and emphasizing advantages, along with limitations regarding the ability to discriminate between the specific antioxidant or quantifying total antioxidant content. In this work, both direct and indirect methods for antioxidants detecting with electrochemical sensors and biosensors are analyzed in detail. This review aims to prove how electrochemical sensors and biosensors represent reliable alternatives to conventional methods for antioxidant analysis.","output":"A Review on Electrochemical Sensors and Biosensors Used in Assessing Antioxidant Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The familiar conveniences of information technologytime savings, mobility, economy, and flexibilityhave become necessities for working and communicating during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

Studies in patients with SLE and murine models of lupus reveal that the most critical anti-Sm autoantibodies are predominantly direct against D1(83-119), D2, and B/B epitopes. OBJECTIVES The present study aimed to analyze the induction of antigen-specific tolerance after prophylactic immunization with a DNA vaccine encoding the epitopes: D183-119, D2, B/B, and B/BCOOH in co-vaccination with IFN- or IL-10 in a murine model of lupus induced by pristane. MATERIAL AND METHODS To obtain endotoxin-free DNA vaccines, direct cloning techniques using pcDNA were performed: D183-119, D2, B/B, B/BCOOH, IFN-, or IL-10. Lupus was induced by 0.5 mL of pristane via intraperitoneal in BALB/c female mice. Immunoprecipitation with K562 cells was metabolically labeled with 35S and ELISA to detect serum antibodies or mice IgG1, IgG2a isotypes. ELISA determined IL-10 and IFN- from splenocytes supernatants. Proteinuria was assessed monthly, and lupus nephritis was evaluated by immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. RESULTS The prophylactic co-vaccination with D2/IL-10 reduced the expression of kidney damage observed by electron microscopy, direct immunofluorescence, and H & E, along with reduced level of anti-nRNP/Sm antibodies (P = 0.048). CONCLUSION The prophylactic co-vaccination of IL-10 with D2 in pristane-induced lupus ameliorates the renal damage maybe by acting as prophylactic DNA tolerizing therapy.","output":"The DNA co-vaccination using Sm antigen and IL-10 as prophylactic experimental therapy ameliorates nephritis in a model of lupus induced by pristane."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that produces numerous exoproducts during infection that help it evade the host immune system and procure nutrients from the host environment.

Here, we describe the validation of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based method for quantifying multiple AQ congeners in complex biological matrices. The assay was validated for selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, carryover, dilution integrity, recovery, matrix effects, and various aspects of stability (freeze-thaw, bench-top, long-term storage, and autosampler/post-preparative). Using authentic standards for 6 distinct AQ congeners, we report accurate quantitation within a linear range between 25 and 1000 nmol/L for all of the validated AQ standards. This method was successfully applied to quantify AQ concentrations in P. aeruginosa cell culture and in the lungs of mice infected with P. aeruginosa.

A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) - the causal agent in COVID-19 - affects olfaction directly, by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing demonstrated that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells, rather than in neurons. Immunostaining confirmed these results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in dorsally-located olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the mouse.

The study followed a cross-sectional design, where patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection during their pregnancy were surveyed for their preferences in nutritional supplementation and their profile compared with existing records from the institutional database. A cohort of 448 pregnant women with COVID-19 during 22 months of the pandemic was assembled, out of which 13.6% took a magnesium-only supplement, and 16.5% supplemented their diet with a combination of calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Around 60% of patients in the no-supplementation group had the SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD lower than 500 U/mL, compared with 50% in those who took magnesium-based supplements. A quantity of magnesium >450 mg in the taken supplements determined higher levels of antibody titers after COVID-19. Low magnesium dosage (<450 mg) was an independent risk factor for a weak immune response (OR-1.25, p-value = 0.003).

To detect cardiac involvement, trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE), as a widely available and cost-effective tool, is highly recommended and can provide important information that can affect the clinical management of COVID-19 patients. Despite that, considering the risk of equipment contamination and personnel exposure, mainly focused echocardiographic evaluations instead of complete examination are recommended and the use of portable devices easy to disinfect with offline reporting is highly suggested. Accordingly, cardiac imaging examination should be considered only when it could change the clinical management or be lifesaving for the patients. COVID-19, through different mechanisms, could affect different sections of the heart and it is useful to analyze them separately during an echocardiographic examination. Regarding the left ventricle, the SARS-CoV-2 infection could lead to acute myocardial infarction, tako-tsubo syndrome and in particular acute myocarditis. The impairment of the pulmonary circulation and the higher prevalence of pulmonary embolism in these patients explain and correlate with some pathological findings as right ventricular systolic dysfunction and direct or indirect signs of pulmonary hypertension, which could easily be assessed by echocardiography and with notable prognostic meaning.

Mathematical modelling has been used extensively to assess the rate of viral transmission from behavioural responses. Previous epidemics of SARS-Cov-2 have been characterised by superspreaders, a small number of individuals who transmit a disease to a large group of individuals, who contribute to the stochasticity (or randomness) of transmission compared to other pathogens such as Influenza. This growing evidence proves an urgent matter to understand transmission routes in order to target and combat outbreaks. Objective: To investigate the role of superspreaders in the rate of viral transmission with various levels of compliance. Method: A SEIRS inspired social network model is adapted and calibrated to observe the infected links of a general population with and without superspreaders on four compliance levels. Local and global connection parameters are adjusted to simulate close contact networks and travel restrictions respectively and each performance assessed. The mean and standard deviation of infections with superspreaders and non-superspreaders were calculated for each compliance level. Results: Increased levels of compliance of superspreaders proves a significant reduction in infections. Assuming long-lasting immunity, superspreaders could potentially slow down the spread due to their high connectivity. Discussion: The main advantage of applying the network model is to capture the heterogeneity and locality of social networks, including the role of superspreaders in epidemic dynamics. The main challenge is the immediate attention on social settings with targeted interventions to tackle superspreaders in future empirical work. Conclusion: Superspreaders play a central role in slowing down infection spread following compliance guidelines. It is crucial to adjust social distancing measures to prevent future outbreaks accompanied by population-wide testing and effective tracing.","output":"Computational modelling of COVID-19: A study of compliance and superspreaders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate community and health-care workers perspectives on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and on early pandemic responses during the first 2 weeks of national lockdown in Zimbabwe. METHODS: Rapid qualitative research was carried out between March and April 2020 via phone interviews with one representative from each of four community-based organizations and 16 health-care workers involved in a trial of community-based services for young people. In addition, information on COVID-19 was collected from social media platforms, news outlets and government announcements. Data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: Four themes emerged: (i) individuals were overloaded with information but lacked trusted sources, which resulted in widespread fear and unanswered questions; (ii) communities had limited ability to comply with prevention measures, such as social distancing, because access to long-term food supplies and water at home was limited and because income had to be earned daily; (iii) health-care workers perceived themselves to be vulnerable and undervalued because of a shortage of personal protective equipment and inadequate pay; and (iv) other health conditions were sidelined because resources were redirected, with potentially wide-reaching implications. CONCLUSION: It is important that prevention measures against COVID-19 are appropriate for the local context. In Zimbabwe, communities require support with basic needs and access to reliable information to enable them to follow prevention measures.

As other severe acute respiratory syndromes, it is a widely discussed topic whether seasonality affects the COVID-19 infection spreading. This study presents two different approaches to analyse the impact of social activity factors and weather variables on daily COVID-19 cases at county level over the Continental U.S. (CONUS). The first one is a traditional statistical method, i.e., Pearson correlation coefficient, whereas the second one is a machine learning algorithm, i.e., random forest regression model. The Pearson correlation is analysed to roughly test the relationship between COVID-19 cases and the weather variables or the social activity factor (i.e. social distance index). The random forest regression model investigates the feasibility of estimating the number of county-level daily confirmed COVID-19 cases by using different combinations of eight factors (county population, county population density, county social distance index, air temperature, specific humidity, shortwave radiation, precipitation, and wind speed). Results show that the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases is weakly correlated with the social distance index, air temperature and specific humidity through the Pearson correlation method. The random forest model shows that the estimation of COVID-19 cases is more accurate with adding weather variables as input data. Specifically, the most important factors for estimating daily COVID-19 cases are the population and population density, followed by the social distance index and the five weather variables, with temperature and specific humidity being more critical than shortwave radiation, wind speed, and precipitation.

Methods: The study involved 207 patients in advanced stages (IIICIV) of HNC. RTOG/EORTC scale was used to assess OM. The pre-treatment NLR was specified as the absolute neutrophil count divided by the absolute lymphocyte count. Results: Starting from second to seventh week of RT, we observed a significant, positive correlation between NLR values and OM grade. From the second to seventh week of RT, higher NLR values were related with significant increases (from 2- to over 24-fold) in the risk of occurrence of more severe OM (multivariate analysis confirmed its independent influence). Moreover, multivariate analysis for survival revealed that both higher TNM stage (HR = 1.84; p = 0.0043) and higher NLR values (HR = 1.48; p = 0.0395) were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion: NLR is a simple and accurate parameter that is useful in the evaluation of the risk of more severe OM, as well as an independent prognostic factor of OS in patients subjected to RT due to HNC.","output":"Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio as a Factor Predicting Radiotherapy Induced Oral Mucositis in Head Neck Cancer Patients Treated with Radiotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 cases began to rise in Ontario, Canada, in March 2020, increasing surge capacity in hospitals and intensive care units became a large focus of preparations.

This structure reflects higher transmission risks among household members than among non-household members. We explore strategic implementation choices that make use of household structure, and investigate strategies including two-step tracing, backwards tracing, smartphone tracing and tracing upon symptom report rather than test results. The primary model outcome is the effect of contact tracing, in combination with different levels of physical distancing, on the growth rate of the epidemic. Furthermore, we investigate epidemic extinction times to indicate the time period over which interventions must be sustained. We consider effects of non-uptake of isolation/quarantine, non-adherence, and declining recall of contacts over time. Our results find that, compared to self-isolation of cases without contact tracing, a contact tracing strategy designed to take advantage of household structure allows for some relaxation of physical distancing measures but cannot completely control the epidemic absent of other measures. Even assuming no imported cases and sustainment of moderate physical distancing, testing and tracing efforts, the time to bring the epidemic to extinction could be in the order of months to years.

Studies in adult populations suggest that SNAP is associated with lower health care costs, although less is known in children. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of U.S. children (age <18 years) living in low-income households (< 200% of the federal poverty level) in the 2013-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We used multivariable regression, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical covariates, to model the effect of continuous SNAP enrollment on health expenditures as compared to non-enrollees at 12 and 24 months. RESULTS: The sample included 5,626 children, of whom 49.2% consistently received SNAP for the entire two-year survey period. Compared with SNAP non-recipients, SNAP-recipient households more often had incomes below 100% FPL (78.3% vs 37.9%), and children in SNAP-recipient households were more often publicly insured (94.9% vs 64.5%). Unadjusted expenditures were lower for children in SNAP-recipient households at 12 ($1222 vs $1603) and 24 months ($2447 vs $3009). However, when adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical differences, no statistically significant differences in health care expenditures, including emergency department, inpatient, outpatient, and prescription costs, were identified. CONCLUSION: SNAP participant children experience heightened social hardships across multiple domains. There were no differences in short term health care costs based on SNAP enrollment when accounting for differences in sociodemographic and clinical factors. Despite demonstrated child health benefits, we found that sustained enrollment in SNAP over a two-year period did not generate significant short- term health care cost reductions. Our findings suggest that although SNAP is intended to act as a benefit towards the health and well-being of its recipients, unlike among adults, it may not reduce health care costs among children.","output":"Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participation and health care expenditures in children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute phase protein with a significant importance for patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD). The central role of SAA in pathogenesis of IRD has been confirmed by recent discoveries, including its involvement in the activation of the inflammasome cascade and recruitment of interleukin 17 producing T helper cells. Clinical utility of SAA in IRD was originally evaluated nearly half a century ago. From the first findings, it was clear that SAA could be used for evaluating disease severity and monitoring disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and secondary amyloidosis. However, cost-effective and more easily applicable markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), overwhelmed its use in clinical practice. In the light of emerging evidences, SAA has been discerned as a more sensitive biomarker in a wide spectrum of IRD, especially in case of subclinical inflammation. Furthermore, a growing number of studies are confirming the advantages of SAA over many other biomarkers in predicting and monitoring response to biological immunotherapy in IRD patients. Arising scientific discoveries regarding the role of SAA, as well as delineating SAA and its isoforms as the most sensitive biomarkers in various IRD by recently developing proteomic techniques are encouraging the revival of its clinical use. Finally, the most recent findings have shown that SAA is a biomarker of severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this review is to discuss the SAA-involving immune system network with emphasis on mechanisms relevant for IRD, as well as usefulness of SAA as a biomarker in various IRD. Therefore, over a hundred original papers were collected through an extensive PubMed and Scopus databases search. These recently arising insights will hopefully lead to a better management of IRD patients and might even inspire the development of new therapeutic strategies with SAA as a target.","output":"Serum Amyloid A in Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases: A Compendious Review of a Renowned Biomarker"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intravenous administration of remdesivir for COVID-19 confines its utility to hospitalized patients.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study also collected data on COVID-19 infection and management. Here, we report a summary of COVID-19 outcomes from participants in this study and the impact of the pandemic on study operations. Methods: This prospective cohort study initiated in June, 2016 is enrolling patients (pts) undergoing diagnostic work up for suspected or newly diagnosed MDS or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in the setting of cytopenia. Study enrollment was paused from Mar. 27, 2020 to May 18, 2020 due to COVID-19. Previously untreated pts underwent a bone marrow assessment with a centralized histopathology review at enrollment for assignment to a longitudinal cohort (MDS, MDS/MPN overlap, idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with <30% blasts, or At-Risk (pts with sub-threshold dysplasia, select karyotype, or select genetic mutations) for follow-up every six months; or a cross-sectional cohort (other cytopenia or cancers) with no further follow-up. COVID-19 outcomes, including tests, status, hospitalizations and treatments for COVID-19, were collected for all eligible pts. Protocol deviations related to COVID-19 were also collected. Fisher's exact test was used for comparing the proportions of pts tested or positive between groups. Results: Of 758 eligible pts with available COVID-19 data, 507 (67%) were assigned to the longitudinal cohort and 251 (33%) to the cross-sectional cohort or are pending assignment. Among longitudinal pts, 74 (15%) had ICUS, 240 (47%) MDS, 47 (9%) MDS/MPN overlap, 11 (2%) AML with <30% blasts, and 135 (27%) At-Risk for MDS. The median age over all pts was 72 years (range=21-95) and 66% were male, 92% White, 4% Black, 2% Asian, and 2% other. Among 244 pts (32%) tested for COVID-19 (Table 1), 23 (9%) were positive. Twelve (>50% of the positive pts) were in Wisconsin, California (CA), and Missouri (Figure 1), with 8 identified from Sep. to Dec. 2020, which overlaps with third waves of COVID-19 reported in CA and in the Midwest. Tests from 17 (74%) of the 23 pts were based on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The proportion of pts positive were similar between pooled disease (ICUS, MDS, MDS/MPN, AML <30%), At-Risk, and cross-sectional groups (8%, 8%, 16%, respectively; Table 2) but the proportions tested differed significantly (39%, 28%, and 25%, respectively, p=0.004). Among all positive pts, 21 (91%) are recovering or have recovered (16 with sequelae), 1 (4%) died, and 1 outcome is unknown (Table 1). The one participant who died had MDS with excess blasts-1 (MDS-EB1, 5-9% blasts). Eight pts (35% of positive pts) required hospitalization (median duration of 7 days (range=2-17)) or treatment (tx) in response to COVID-19, 7 of whom required both. In the 8 pts who required tx for COVID-19, 4 reported Remdesivir-use, 3 of whom were diagnosed with MDS or MDS/MPN overlap. The study monthly accrual rates were similar when compared pre- vs. post-study pause (23 vs. 22 pts, respectively) but the rate of missed follow-up visits increased from 5% to 11% post-pause. About half (49%) of the 144 COVID-19-related study deviations occurred during the months the study was paused. Conclusions: In this analysis of 758 pts with MDS and related conditions, the largest reported for these diagnoses, the COVID-19 mortality rate (13%) in MDS was lower than has been reported in a smaller (n=61) case study (39%, Feld et al Blood 2020) but is similar to the rates for MDS observed annually each year prior to study pause (range=11-19%) and to the rate reported in a larger (n=2186) observational study of cancer patients (16%, Rivera et al Cancer Discov 2020). Infection rates were similar across disease groups. The pandemic also resulted in substantial study-specific challenges, including increased rate of deviations, the study being paused, and difficulty sourcing material for biospecimen processing. Data on vaccine efficacy and rates of pts with long-haul symptoms post-COVID may be of interest in future work.

In response to the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) outbreak in March 2020, telehealth follow\\\\up was established to comply with COVID\\\\19 preventive measures and allow service continuation. Here, we evaluate its implementation. METHODS: Pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 (until February 2020) clients who initiated SDART received a 2\\\\week ART supply and returned to the clinic for evaluation before being referred to long\\\\term ART maintenance facilities. If no adverse events (AEs) occurred, another 8\\\\week ART supply was provided while referral was arranged. During the first wave of COVID\\\\19 (MarchCMay 2020), clients received a 4\\\\week ART supply and the option of conducting follow\\\\up consultation and physical examination via video call. Clients with severe AEs were required to return to TRCAC; those without received another 6\\\\week ART supply by courier to bridge transition to long\\\\term facilities. This adaptation continued post\\\\first wave (MayCAugust 2020). Routine service data were analysed using data from March to August 2019 for the pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 period. Interviews and thematic analysis were conducted to understand experiences of clients and providers, and gain feedback for service improvement. RESULTS: Of 922, 183 and 321 eligible clients from the three periods, SDART reach [89.9%, 96.2% and 92.2% (p = 0.018)] and ART initiation rates [88.1%, 90.9% and 94.9% (p<0.001)] were high. ART uptake, time to ART initiation and rates of follow\\\\up completion improved over time. After the integration, 35.3% received the telehealth follow\\\\up. The rates of successful referral to a long\\\\term facility (91.8% vs. 95.3%, p = 0.535) and retention in care at months 3 (97.5% vs. 98.0%, p = 0.963) and 6 (94.1% vs. 98.4%, p = 0.148) were comparable for those receiving in\\\\person and telehealth follow\\\\up.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR, admitted to ICU between March and April 2020 were enrolled. At ICU admission, BALF were analyzed by flow cytometry. Univariate, multivariate and Spearman correlation analyses were performed. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were enrolled, median age of 64 years (IQR 58-69). The majority cells in the BALF were neutrophils (70%, IQR 37.5-90.5) and macrophages (27%, IQR 7-49) while a minority were lymphocytes, 1%, TCD3+ 92% (IQR 82-95). The ICU mortality was 32.8%.

The FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is a major modulator of the stress response and has recently emerged as a scaffolder regulating metabolic and autophagy pathways. However, the detailed protein-protein interactions linking FKBP51 to autophagy upon metabolic challenges remain elusive. We performed mass spectrometryCbased metabolomics of FKBP51 knockout (KO) cells revealing an increased amino acid and polyamine metabolism. We identified FKBP51 as a central nexus for the recruitment of the LKB1/AMPK complex to WIPI4 and TSC2 to WIPI3, thereby regulating the balance between autophagy and mTOR signaling in response to metabolic challenges. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MBH FKBP51 deletion strongly induces obesity, while its overexpression protects against high-fat diet (HFD)Cinduced obesity.

Traditional clinical training utilizes manual and tactile approaches to the physical examination. Telemedicine limits this approach and thus alternative adaptations are necessary to acquire information needed for sound clinical judgement and development of a treatment plan. Clinical assessment of pain is often challenging given the myriad of underlying etiologies contributing to the sensory experience. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in the use of virtual and telemedicine visits, further complicating the ease of assessing patients in pain. The increased reliance on telemedicine visits requires clinicians to develop skills to obtain objective information from afar. While eliciting a comprehensive history and medication assessment are performed in a standard fashion via telemedicine, a virtual targeted physical examination is a new endeavor in our current times. In order to appropriately diagnose and treat patients not directly in front of you, a pivot in education adaptations are necessary. OBJECTIVE: To summarize best care practices in the telemedicine physical exam while presenting an algorithmic approach towards virtual assessment for the pain practitioner. DESIGN: Review of the literature and expert multidisciplinary panel opinion. SETTING: Nationally recognized academic tertiary care centers. SUBJECTS: Multidisciplinary academic experts in pain medicine. METHODS: Expert consensus opinion from the literature review. RESULT: An algorithm for the virtual physical exam for pain physicians was created using literature review and multidisciplinary expert opinion.

Therefore, this study examined the prevalence and genetic diversity of the BToV in a total of 645 diarrheic fecal samples from 629 Korean native beef calf herds using RT-PCR and nested PCR with the primer pairs specific to a part of the BToV membrane (M) gene. Overall, 19 (2.9%) out of 645 diarrheic samples from 19 herds (6.9%) tested positive for BToVs by either RT-PCR or nested PCR. A comparison of the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) sequences of a part of the BToV M gene (409 bp) among the BToVs showed the Korean BToVs to have comparatively higher sequence homology to the Japanese and Dutch BToVs than to the American and Italian BToVs. Generally, the Korean BToV strains clustered with the Japanese and Dutch BToV strains. However, the American and Italian BToV strains clustered on a separate major branch, suggesting that these are more distantly related to other known BToV strains.

The pathogenesis of psoriasis is driven by a dysregulation of the immune system which leads to an altered cytokine production. Proinflammatory cytokines that are up-regulated in psoriasis include tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and IL-23 for which monoclonal antibodies have already been approved for clinical use. We have previously documented the therapeutic applicability of targeting TNF mRNA for RNA interference-mediated down-regulation by anti-TNF small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) delivered by lentiviral vectors to xenografted psoriatic skin. The present report aims at targeting mRNA encoding the shared p40 subunit (IL-12B) of IL-12 and IL-23 by cellular transduction with lentiviral vectors encoding anti-IL12B shRNAs. METHODS Effective anti-IL12B shRNAs are identified among a panel of shRNAs by potency measurements in cultured cells. The efficiency and persistency of lentiviral gene delivery to xenografted human skin are investigated by bioluminescence analysis of skin treated with lentiviral vectors encoding the luciferase gene. shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors are intradermally injected in xenografted psoriatic skin and the effects of the treatment evaluated by clinical psoriasis scoring, by measurements of epidermal thickness, and IL-12B mRNA levels. RESULTS Potent and persistent transgene expression following a single intradermal injection of lentiviral vectors in xenografted human skin is reported. Stable IL-12B mRNA knockdown and reduced epidermal thickness are achieved three weeks after treatment of xenografted psoriatic skin with lentivirus-encoded anti-IL12B shRNAs. These findings mimic the results obtained with anti-TNF shRNAs but, in contrast to anti-TNF treatment, anti-IL12B shRNAs do not ameliorate the psoriatic phenotype as evaluated by semi-quantitative clinical scoring and by immunohistological examination. CONCLUSIONS Our studies consolidate the properties of lentiviral vectors as a tool for potent gene delivery and for evaluation of mRNA targets for anti-inflammatory therapy. However, in contrast to local anti-TNF treatment, the therapeutic potential of targeting IL-12B at the RNA level in psoriasis is questioned.","output":"Targeting of human interleukin-12B by small hairpin RNAs in xenografted psoriatic skin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background There are more than 206 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection globally.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the level of knowledge of medical sciences students on the human microbiome, dysbiosis, and management of the impaired microbiome with a focus on allergic diseases and asthma. METHODS: An online survey was designed, validated, and distributed to 100 final-year students and interns majoring in clinical nutrition, public health, and clinical laboratory sciences at a single university in Saudi Arabia. The study period was from November 2020 to January 2021. RESULTS: The overall knowledge of the human microbiome was adequate among the participants, but their understanding of dysbiosis and management of the impaired microbiome was low to moderate. Knowledge of dysbiosis management was significantly higher in students majoring in clinical nutrition than in those majoring in public health and clinical laboratory sciences. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this study provides the first evidence that knowledge of specific domains of microbiome science among a cohort of medical sciences students in Saudi Arabia is insufficient. Large-scale studies are warranted to confirm these observations at a national level, and specific curriculum modifications are necessary to improve the knowledge of future healthcare professionals about clinical applications of microbiome science.

The objective of this study was to assess seven configurations of six convolutional deep neural network architectures for classification of CXRs as COVID-19 positive or negative. METHODS: The primary dataset consisted of 294 COVID-19 positive and 294 COVID-19 negative CXRs, the latter comprising roughly equally many pneumonia, emphysema, fibrosis, and healthy images. We used six common convolutional neural network architectures, VGG16, DenseNet121, DenseNet201, MobileNet, NasNetMobile and InceptionV3. We studied six models (one for each architecture) which were pre-trained on a vast repository of generic (non-CXR) images, as well as a seventh, a DenseNet121 model which was pre-trained on a repository of CXR images. For each model, we replaced the output layers with custom fully connected layers for the task of binary classification of images as COVID-19 positive or negative. Performance metrics were calculated on a hold-out test set with CXRs from patients who were not included in the training/validation set. RESULTS: When pre-trained on generic images, the VGG16, DenseNet121, DenseNet201, MobileNet, NasNetMobile, and InceptionV3 architectures respectively produced hold-out test set areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROCs) of 0.98, 0.95, 0.97, 0.95, 0.99, and 0.96 for the COVID-19 classification of CXRs.

Examination of inflamed lymph nodes also plays a particular important role, as lymphadenitis may reflect a more widespread infection. Such lesions in sheep are mainly caused by pyogenic bacteria but also mycobacteria are occasionally found. Meat inspection data from 2017 to 2018 from southern Poland, especially from the Ma?opolska region, indicate that purulent or caseous lymphadenitis involving the mediastinal and tracheobronchial lymph nodes (MTLNs) is a common finding. The primary aim of the current study was to determine the aetiology of these lesions. Furthermore, it was investigated how presence of lesions was correlated with age and grazing strategy of affected sheep. RESULTS Post-mortem examination revealed purulent or caseous lymphadenitis in the MTLNs of 49 out of 284 animals (17.3%). Subsequent microbiological examination revealed the presence of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (34.7%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (34.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.2%), Enterococcus spp. (2.0%), Trueperella pyogenes (2.0%), and -haemolytic strains of Escherichia coli (2.0%). Mycobacterium spp. and Rhodococcus equi were not detected. In older sheep, the probability of the presence of purulent or caseous lymphadenitis was higher than in younger, and the risk was increasing by 1.5% with each month of life. Sheep grazing locally had 4.5-times greater risk of having purulent or caseous lymphadenitis than individuals summer grazing in the mountains. CONCLUSION The most common aetiological agents of purulent or caseous lymphadenitis in the MTLNs of sheep in the Ma?opolska region were C. pseudotuberculosis and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. Particular attention during post-mortem examination should be paid to the carcasses of older sheep and sheep grazing on permanent pastures, as they seem more prone to develop purulent or caseous lymphadenitis.","output":"Microbiological assessment of sheep lymph nodes with lymphadenitis found during post-mortem examination of slaughtered sheep: implications for veterinary-sanitary meat control."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary sequelae following COVID-19 pneumonia have been emerging as a challenge; however, suitable cell sources for studying COVID-19 mechanisms and therapeutics are currently lacking.

This study examines geriatric patients with proximal femur fractures during the COVID-19 pandemic, shifts in secondary disease profile, the impact of the pandemic on hospitalization and further treatment. Methods: In a retrospective monocentric study, geriatric proximal femur fractures treated in the first six months of 2020 were analyzed and compared with the same period of 2019. Pre-traumatic status (living in a care home, under supervision of a legal guardian), type of trauma, accident mechanism, geriatric risk factors, associated comorbidities, time between hospitalization and surgery, inpatient time and post-operative further treatment of 2 groups of patients, aged 65-80 years (Group 1) and 80+ years (Group 2) were investigated. Results: The total number of patients decreased (70 in 2019 vs. 58 in 2020), mostly in Group 1 (25 vs. 16) while the numbers in Group 2 remained almost constant (45 vs. 42). The percentage of patients with pre-existing neurological conditions rose in 2020. This corresponded to an increase in patients under legal supervision (29.3%) and receiving pre-traumatic care in a nursing home (14.7%). Fractures were mostly caused by minor trauma in a home environment. In 2020, total number of inpatient days for Group 2 was lower compared to Group 1 (p = 0.008). Further care differed between the years: fewer Group 1 patients were discharged to geriatric therapy (69.6% vs. 25.0%), whereas in Group 2 the number of patients discharged to a nursing home increased. Conclusions: Falling by elderly patients is correlated to geriatric comorbidities, consequently there was no change in the case numbers in this age group. Strategic measures to avoid COVID-19 infection in hospital setting could include reducing the length of hospital stays by transferring elderly patients to a nursing home as soon as possible and discharging independent, mobile patients to return home.","output":"Geriatric Proximal Femur Fractures During the Covid-19 Pandemic-Fewer Cases, But More Comorbidities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transformation in a political system regarding number of parties is a significant phenomenon which creates ample grounds for scholarly discourse The Pakistani political system witnessed a change in the party politics where it transformed from a two-party system to a three-party system in a relatively short time period Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf emerged on the political scene and after just two elections was able to form a government Challenging the status quo political forces through organizational mobilization, ideology, counter narrative, and redeeming civil military balance , PTI successfully achieved the systemic transformation in political structure of Pakistan The change in a complex political fabric was attempted across various spectrums of party dynamics and electoral mechanics both at the federal and provincial legislatures employing diverse strategies The challenge at hand is the translation of those mechanics of change into political realities and policy orientations while dealing with structural intricacies, domestic compulsions of economy, and external relations China has less experience dealing with this change in the political system and this new important player in Pakistan's politics PTI also lacks experience managing external relations which has implications for both the important stakeholders Undergoing political transition dealing with resistance to change from political actors and managing external relations will define the future of political stability and its impact over China-Pakistan relations","output":"The Novel Changes in Pakistans Party Politics: Analysis of Causes and Impacts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital technology offers opportunities for child mental health capacity building, which is a priority for Majority World Countries (MWC).

The USEPA guidance references a document from 2002 that summarizes practices required for protection of workers handling class B biosolids to minimize exposure to pathogens including viruses. While there is no documented evidence that residuals or biosolids of any treatment level contain infectious SARS-CoV-2 or are a source of transmission of this current pandemic strain of coronavirus, this review summarizes and examines whether the provided federal guidance is sufficient to protect workers in view of currently available data on SARS-CoV-2 persistence and transmission. No currently available epidemiological data establishes a direct link between wastewater sludge or biosolids and risk of infection from the SARS-CoV-2. Despite shedding of the RNA of the virus in feces, there is no evidence supporting the presence or transmission of infectious SARS-CoV-2 through the wastewater system or in biosolids. In addition, this review presents previous epidemiologic data related to other non-enveloped viruses. Overall, the risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, or any pathogen, decreases with increasing treatment measures. As a result, the highest risk of exposure is related to spreading and handling untreated feces or stool, followed by untreated municipal sludge, the class B biosolids, while lowest risk is associated with spreading or handling Class A biosolids.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of SARS-CoV-2 testing and admission data at 5 hospitals in the Maryland/Washington DC area. Using age-stratified logistic regression models, we quantified the impact of male sex on the risk of the composite outcome of severe disease or death (World Health Organization score 5C8) and tested the impact of demographics, comorbidities, health behaviors, and laboratory inflammatory markers on the sex effect. RESULTS: Among 213 175 SARS-CoV-2 tests, despite similar positivity rates, males in age strata between 18 and 74 years were more frequently hospitalized. For the 2626 hospitalized individuals, clinical inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, ferritin, absolute lymphocyte count, and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio) were more favorable for females than males (P < .001). Among 18C49-year-olds, male sex carried a higher risk of severe outcomes, both early (odds ratio [OR], 3.01; 95% CI, 1.75 to 5.18) and at peak illness during hospitalization (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.78 to 3.74). Despite multiple differences in demographics, presentation features, comorbidities, and health behaviors, these variables did not change the association of male sex with severe disease. Only clinical inflammatory marker values modified the sex effect, reducing the OR for severe outcomes in males aged 18C49 years to 1.81 (95% CI, 1.00 to 3.26) early and 1.39 (95% CI, 0.93 to 2.08) at peak illness.

Previous studies revealed that epicardial fat thickness (EFT) correlates with OSA severity. Interestingly, female patients display a stronger EFT-OSA correlation than males. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between EFT and different clinical characteristics in pre- and post-menopausal women diagnosed with OSA. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with OSA were divided into pre/early peri-menopausal (Group 1) and post/late peri-menopausal (Group 2) according to the menopause status. EFT was obtained from parasternal long-axis echocardiographic images. We also collected general clinical characteristics of patients involved in this study, and performed spearman correlation analysis to explore the correlations between EFT and the general clinical characteristics. We further applied Multiple stepwise linear regression analysis to explore the predictors for EFT in both groups. RESULTS: A total number of 23 and 59 patients were enrolled in Group 1 and Group 2 respectively. EFT in Group 2 was significantly higher than that of Group 1. In both groups, EFT was positively correlated with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), percentage of total sleep time when blood oxygen saturation was less than 90% (T90), oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and glucose; while EFT was negatively correlated with mean and lowest SaO2 (oxygen saturation) levels. However, EFT was positively correlated with total cholesterol (TC) only in Group 1 and body mass index (BMI) only in Group2, respectively. Multiple stepwise linear regression analysis showed that AHI was independently associated with EFT in Group 1. However, both AHI and BMI were independent predictors of EFT in Group 2. CONCLUSION: EFT was notably correlated with menopausal status in women with OSA. AHI was the independent predictor of EFT in women with OSA.

METHODS: CGF is the latest generation of platelet concentrate. Twenty-four DID devices inserted into the tibias of 8 goats were evenly divided into the CGF and control groups. Following 10 days of distraction and a 12-week consolidation period, all 8 animals were euthanized to retrieve their tibias. The distraction gap between each segment was measured at 5 points, and the average value was taken as the computed tomography (CT) value of the distraction gap at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after distraction. The vascular density and trabecular bone volume of each DID distraction gap were determined and statistically compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The CT value of the distraction gap increased gradually in control groups at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after distraction to 319.3  14.6, 449.3  34.4, and 614.0  15.6 HU in the control group and 368.3  8.8, 544.5  12.3, and 661.0  8.1 HU in the CGF group.

During the outbreak of COVID-19, a number of cancer patients in Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic in China, had experienced long-lasting city lockdown and delay of immunotherapies. Here, we retrospectively analyzed 24 HNC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in our cancer institute prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 who were re-evaluated after the restoration of regular medical care. Of these 24 patients, 10 patients had achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), 12 patients had achieved stable disease (SD), and 2 patients had received just one cycle treatment without efficacy evaluation before treatment delay. The median delay was 3.75 months (range 1.73-8.17 months).

SARS-CoV-2 load was quantified by ddPCR in paired plasma and respiratory samples. To assess significant differences between patients with and patients without viremia, Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon test were used for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. RESULTS: Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in 8 patients (19.5%), with a median (IQR) value of 694 (209-1023) copies/mL. Viremic patients were characterized by an higher mortality rate (50.0% vs 9.1%; p = 0.018) respect to patients without viremia.

During this period, vaccines were developed in a much shorter period than thought possible, with the initiation of the pertinent vaccination. However, oral cavities have come under renewed scrutiny worldwide because saliva, a mixture of salivary secretions, pharyngeal secretions, and gingival crevicular fluid, have not only been shown to contain infective viral loads, mediating the route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via droplet, aerosol, or contagion, but also used as a sample for viral RNA testing with a usefulness comparable to the nasopharyngeal swab. The oral cavity is an important portal for ingress of SARS-CoV-2, being an entryway to the bronchi, alveoli, and rest of the lower respiratory tract, causing inflammation by viral infection. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, coupled with proteases responsible for viral entry have been found to be expressed on the tongue and other oral mucosae, suggesting that the oral cavity is the site of virus replication and propagation. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the aspiration of oral bacteria (such as periodontal pathogens) along with saliva into the lower respiratory tract may be a complicating factor for COVID-19 because chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes are known COVID-19 comorbidities with a greater risk of disease aggravation and higher death rate. These comorbidities have a strong connection to chronic periodontitis and periodontal pathogens, and an oral health management is an effective measure to prevent these comorbidities. In addition, oral bacteria, particularly periodontal pathogens, could be proinflammatory stimulants to respiratory epithelia upon its exposure to aspirated bacteria.

Unfortunately, RBD is poorly immunogenic. While most subunit vaccines are commonly formulated with adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity, we found that clinically-relevant adjuvants Alum, AddaVax, and CpG/Alum were unable to elicit neutralizing responses following a prime-boost immunization. Here we show that sustained delivery of an RBD subunit vaccine comprising CpG/Alum adjuvant in an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel elicited potent anti-RBD and anti-spike antibody titers, providing broader protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern compared to bolus administration of the same vaccine and vaccines comprising other clinically-relevant adjuvant systems.

In this paper, we compare through simulations the performance of six screening plans based on poorly sensitive individual tests, in detecting infection outbreaks at the level of single classes in a typical European school context. The performance evaluation is done by simulating different epidemic dynamics within the class during the four weeks following the day of the initial infection. The plans have different costs in terms of number of individual tests required for the screening and are based on recurrent evaluations on all students or subgroups of students in rotation. Especially in scenarios where the rate of contagion is high, at an equal cost, testing half of the class in rotation every week appears to be better in terms of sensitivity than testing all students every two weeks. Similarly, testing one-fourth of the students every week is comparable with testing all students every two weeks, despite the first one is a much cheaper strategy. In conclusion, we show that in the presence of natural clusters in the population, testing subgroups of individuals belonging to the same cluster in rotation may have a better performance than testing all the individuals less frequently.

The quality of its IT systems, together with access to the results of mass screening with Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, makes it possible to analyse the impact of various concurrent factors on the likelihood of contracting the disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Through data mining techniques with the sociodemographic and clinical variables recorded in patients medical histories, a decision tree-based logistic regression model has been proposed which analyses the significance of demographic and clinical variables in the probability of having a positive PCR in a sample of 7,314 individuals treated in the Primary Care service of the public health system of Catalonia. The statistical approach to decision tree modelling allows 66.2% of diagnoses of infection by COVID-19 to be classified with a sensitivity of 64.3% and a specificity of 62.5%, with prior contact with a positive case being the primary predictor variable. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a classification tree model may be useful in screening for COVID-19 infection. Contact detection is the most reliable variable for detecting Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases.

With technological progress, robots become increasingly autonomous. We hypothesized that high levels of robot autonomy would increase both positive and negative robot-related evaluations, resulting in more attitudinal ambivalence.

Autonomy did not impact objective ambivalence. However, subjective ambivalence was higher towards the robot high versus low in autonomy.

A pilot study of iQuit Mindfully was conducted in spring 2020, right in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic among low-income and predominantly African American smokers. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study examined the acceptability and feasibility of delivering Mindfulness-Based Addiction Treatment via mHealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were adult cigarette smokers (N=23, 35% [8 of 23] female, 83% African American, 78% [18 of 23] annual income &lt;$24,000). They were randomly assigned to either 8 weeks of iQuit Mindfully as a fully automated standalone intervention or iQuit Mindfully in combination with therapist-led in-person group treatment. For participant safety, in-person mindfulness groups were transitioned online and assessments took place online. Survey questions asked participants about changes in their stress, smoking habits and quit attempts, as well as their perceptions of the mindfulness and text messaging intervention in the context of the pandemic. RESULTS: Most participants (71%, 15 of 21) indicated a change in stress due to the pandemic, with 93% (14 of 15) of those indicating higher stress. Participants shared concerns about finances, homelessness, health and social isolation. Most (81%, 17 of 21) believed that smoking increases risk for contracting COVID-19, and although that was motivating for some, others expressed lower motivation to quit because of higher stress. Most (86%, 18 of 21) said that practicing mindfulness was helpful during the pandemic. Mean ratings of the helpfulness of text messages and the extent they would recommend the program to others were 7.1 (median 8 on 10-point scale, SD=2.9) and 8.2 (median 9, SD=2.5), respectively. Through open-ended program evaluations, participants shared details about how mindfulness practice and the text messages helped them to manage stress and feel a sense of social support during the pandemic. Moreover, 53% (10 of 19) of participants achieved 7-day abstinence from smoking, with no differences between conditions.

This study screens some African plants derived alkaloids and terpenoids as potential inhibitors of coronavirus 3CLpro using in silico approach. Bioactive alkaloids (62) and terpenoids (100) of plants native to Africa were docked to the 3CLpro of the novel SARS-CoV-2. The top twenty alkaloids and terpenoids with high binding affinities to the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were further docked to the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The docking scores were compared with 3CLpro-referenced inhibitors (Lopinavir and Ritonavir). The top docked compounds were further subjected to ADEM/Tox and Lipinski filtering analyses for drug-likeness prediction analysis. This ligand-protein interaction study revealed that more than half of the top twenty alkaloids and terpenoids interacted favourably with the coronaviruses 3CLpro, and had binding affinities that surpassed that of lopinavir and ritonavir.

Methods: Herein, through an extensive search of the literature, we reviewed the potential of some bioactive compounds from medicinal plants as therapeutic agents against COVID-19. The results of this review still require further investigation to clinically validate them, either in vitro or in vivo, in order to find the effective antiviral drugs from medicinal plants for COVID-19 treatment. Results: From a total of 60 identified medicinal plants, 50 of them have possible effects as therapeutic agents against particular target proteins encoded by the coronavirus genes such as Nsp1, Nsp3 (Nsp3b, Nsp3c, PLpro and Nsp3e), Nsp7-Nsp8, Nsp9-Nsp10, Nsp14-Nsp16 complexes, 3CL(pro), E protein, ORF7a, Spike (S) glycoprotein, C-terminal RNA binding domain (CRBD), N-terminal RNA binding domain (NRBD), helicase and RdRp. The most common bioactive compounds from the medicinal plants as therapeutic agents for COVID-19 treatment were flavonoid compounds.

Growing evidence shows that exposure to the natural environment (e.g., blue-green spaces) can improve human health and wellbeing. In this narrative review, we synthesized the evidence about nature's contributions to health and wellbeing during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that during the pandemic, people experienced multiple types of nature, including both outdoors and indoors. Frequency of visits to outdoor natural areas (i.e., public parks) depended on lockdown severity and socio-cultural contexts. Other forms of nature exposure, such as spending time in private gardens and viewing outdoor greenery from windows, may have increased. The majority of the evidence suggests nature exposure during COVID-19 pandemic was associated with less depression, anxiety, stress, and more happiness and life satisfaction. Additionally, nature exposure was correlated with less physical inactivity and fewer sleep disturbances. Evidence was mixed regarding associations between nature exposure and COVID-related health outcomes, while nature visits might be associated with greater rates of COVID-19 transmission and mortality when proper social distancing measures were not maintained. Findings on whether nature exposure during lockdowns helped ameliorate health inequities by impacting the health of lower-socioeconomic populations more than their higher-socioeconomic counterparts for example were mixed.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Our approach modifies previous protocols to minimize spontaneous cell death and terminal differentiation, eliminate cell stress-inducing keratinocyte selection steps, and reduce total protocol duration and cost. Independent donor-derived PSC lines were converted into ESPCs through the addition of relevant morphogens and a ROCK inhibitor. Results for the 209.2 PSC line highlight consistencies in 2D and also variable features in 3D epidermis compared to the previously published FA-PSC lines. 209.2 PSC-derived ESPCs exhibited a basal cell phenotype while maintaining the capacity to form epidermal organotypic rafts with morphology consistent with fetal epidermis. Transcriptional analyses demonstrated 209.2 ESPCs express epidermis-selective markers and not early endoderm markers, thus supporting an immature stage of p63+ epidermal development. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol provides an accelerated path for the generation of human ESPCs and 3D epidermal models to study normal epidermal development and homeostasis, elucidate mechanisms of epidermal disease pathogenesis, and provides a platform for developing personalized therapies.","output":"Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into epidermal stem and progenitor cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crowd models can be used for the simulation of people movement in the built environment. Crowd model outputs have been used for evaluating safety and comfort of pedestrians, inform crowd management and perform forensic investigations. Microscopic crowd models allow the representation of each person and the obtainment of information concerning their location over time and interactions with the physical space/other people. Pandemics such as COVID-19 have posed several questions on safe building usage, given the risk of disease transmission among building occupants. Here we show how crowd modelling can be used to assess occupant exposure in confined spaces. The policies adopted concerning building usage and social distancing during a pandemic can vary greatly, and they are mostly based on the macroscopic analysis of the spread of disease rather than a safety assessment performed at a building level. The proposed model allows the investigation of occupant exposure in buildings based on the analysis of microscopic people movement. Risk assessment is performed by retrofitting crowd models with a universal model for exposure assessment which can account for different types of disease transmissions.

This opinion paper hence aims to discuss aspects related to the opportunity of monitoring anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after COVID-19 vaccination, highlighting the pros and cons of this strategy. In summary, the advantages of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing in recipients of COVID-19 vaccination encompass an assessment of baseline seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-vaccinated individuals;early identification of low or non-responders to COVID-19 vaccination;and timely detection of faster decay of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. In contrast, potential drawbacks to date include an unproven equivalence between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer, neutralizing activity, and vaccine efficiency;the lack of cost-effective analyses of different testing strategies;the enormous volume of blood drawings and increase of laboratory workload that would be needed to support universal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing. A potential solution entails the identification of cohorts to be prioritized for testing, including those at higher risk of being infected by variants of concern, those at higher risk of unfavorable disease progression, and subjects in whom vaccine immunogenicity may be expectedly lower and/or shorter.","output":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Testing in Recipients of COVID-19 Vaccination: Why, When, and How?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To study whether a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) can be of assistance to radiologists in differentiating Coronavirus disease (COVID)-positive from COVID-negative patients using chest X-ray (CXR) through an ambispective clinical study. To identify subgroups of patients where artificial intelligence (AI) can be of particular value and analyse what imaging features may have contributed to the performance of AI by means of visualisation techniques. METHODS: CXR of 487 patients were classified into [4] categories-normal, classical COVID, indeterminate, and non-COVID by consensus opinion of 2 radiologists. CXR which were classified as \\"normal\\" and \\"indeterminate\\" were then subjected to analysis by AI, and final categorisation provided as guided by prediction of the network. Precision and recall of the radiologist alone and radiologist assisted by AI were calculated in comparison to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the gold standard. Attention maps of the CNN were analysed to understand regions in the CXR important to the AI algorithm in making a prediction. RESULTS: The precision of radiologists improved from 65.9 to 81.9% and recall improved from 17.5 to 71.75 when assistance with AI was provided. AI showed 92% accuracy in classifying \\"normal\\" CXR into COVID or non-COVID. Analysis of attention maps revealed attention on the cardiac shadow in these \\"normal\\" radiographs. CONCLUSION: This study shows how deployment of an AI algorithm can complement a human expert in the determination of COVID status. Analysis of the detected features suggests possible subtle cardiac changes, laying ground for further investigative studies into possible cardiac changes. KEY POINTS: a? Through an ambispective clinical study, we show how assistance with an AI algorithm can improve recall (sensitivity) and precision (positive predictive value) of radiologists in assessing CXR for possible COVID in comparison to RT-PCR. a? We show that AI achieves the best results in images classified as \\"normal\\" by radiologists. We conjecture that possible subtle cardiac in the CXR, imperceptible to the human eye, may have contributed to this prediction. a? The reported results may pave the way for a human computer collaboration whereby the expert with some help from the AI algorithm achieves higher accuracy in predicting COVID status on CXR than previously thought possible when considering either alone.","output":"Artificial Intelligence-assisted chest X-ray assessment scheme for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, 37.7 million (30.2C45.1 million) people were living with HIV globally, with 27.5 million (26.5C27.7 million) accessing antiretroviral therapy.

We conducted two instances of analytic hierarchy processes (AHP) to elicit how the public weighs different principles and criteria for vaccine allocation. Within further discrete choice experiments, respondents were asked to split a limited supply of vaccine doses between a hypothetical high-income and a hypothetical low-income country. AHP weights in the United States and Germany were 37.4% (37.2-37.5) and 49.4% (49.2-49.5) for medical urgency, 32.7% (32.6-32.8) and 25.4% (25.2-25.5) for equal access for all by, 13.7% (13.6-13.8) and 13.3% (13.2-13.4) for production contribution, and 16.3% (16.2-16.4) and 12.0% (11.9-12.1) for free market rules, respectively, with 95% CI shown in parentheses.

However, barriers that preclude the implementation of technology driven programs for the assessment and intervention of adults at risk of cognitive decline need to be better understood. This study investigated these outstanding issues, as well as considering the impact that the COVID-19 Pandemic has had on such barriers. Methods: A sample of 105 participants completed an online survey. Their ages ranged from 18 to 92 years. Of these,72%were female,83%had higher education and beyond, 42% were working, 42% were retired, and 14% were unemployed. The questionnaires assessed IT experience alongside awareness, attitudes, and stigmas regarding the use of technologies, particularly those used to support cognitive and mental health. Questionnaires also explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these technology-related factors. We compared these across groups of young (n=45), middle age (n=12) and older adults (n=48). Results: Relative to younger participants, older participants were less aware of, and held stronger stigmas against healthcare technologies, even though they reported more IT experience. IT awareness was associated to more positive (r=0.619, p<0.001) and less negative IT Attitudes (r=-0.271, p=0.015), more acceptability (r=-0.374, p=0.001) and receptiveness towards technologies (r=-0.610, p<0.001). Male participants appeared to be more aware of such technologies than female participants. However, relative to men, women had increased the number of ways and frequency with which they used technologies since the COVID-19 pandemic started, and older people in general felt more inclined to endorse the need to learn more about healthcare technologies. Conclusions: Having more accumulated IT experience throughout our lives may not necessarily lead to better acceptance of healthcare technologies. More awareness about such specific technologies will help overcome stigmas, and challenging environments such as those imposed by the COVID-19 pandemicmay lead to positive changes in perception and acceptance of such technologies.

In practice, these are two different hospitals. Within the territories, the branches also differ from each other. When analyzing resistance in ICUs, it was revealed that within each hospital in each department, albeit similar in structure and profile of patients, there is a different level of resistance of strains.

RECENT FINDINGS: We propose a typology for the strategies used by different viruses to address p53 functions: hit and run (e.g. IAV, ZIKV), hide and seek (e.g. HIV1), kidnap and exploit (e.g. EBV, HSV1), dominate and suppress (e.g. HR HPV). We discuss the mechanisms by which SARS nsp3 protein targets p53 for degradation and we speculate on the significance for Covid-19 pathogenesis and risk of cancer.

It describes the key components that each must possess as well as other important factors to consider when assessing the ability of each to deliver vaccines to the children and adolescents they serve. It also highlights the need for sufficient funding and reimbursement for vaccine-related costs in these settings, the importance of orienting staff, providers, and practices to offering preventive care services through education and evidenced-based approaches, and the necessity of effective, efficient coordination of vaccination efforts across sites. By expanding the scope of non-primary care settings to include vaccine delivery and striving to capture all vaccination opportunities in these locations, the proportion of children and adolescents receiving on-time doses will undoubtedly increase.

METHODS: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT capacities were restricted at many clinics in early 2020. All patients receiving c-/m-ECT in March and April 2020 at our department (n = 53, unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) were followed up for six months to investigate the impact of treatment modifications imposed by the pandemic. Based on individual decisions, c-/m-ECT was either (a) continued without modification, (b) continued with reduced frequency, or (c) discontinued. RESULTS: Both reduced frequency and discontinuation of c-/m-ECT were associated with significant clinical deterioration as measured by CGI-I (Clinical Global Impression Scale - Global Improvement) during the six-month follow-up when compared to the subgroup of patients without any treatment modification (p = 0.005, p = 0.011). Furthermore, patients with discontinued or reduced c-/m-ECT showed significantly higher rates of rehospitalizations (p = 0.028) and new acute courses of ECT (p = 0.018).

We report patient characteristics of our first series of COVID-19 survivors admitted to the post-acute venue of an LTAC hospital. Methods: Single-center observational descriptive report of patients recovering from acute infectious complications of COVID-19 pneumonia requiring long-term respiratory support. Results: From 28 April to 7 September 2020, 41 patients were admitted to BRH for continued recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia. Median age: 68 [44-94] years, 25/41 (61%) male, 33/41 (80.5%) with tracheostomy, 21/41 (51.2%) on invasive mechanical ventilation, 9/41 (22%) receiving hemodialysis. All mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis interventions were initiated at the transferring hospital. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report to characterize CCI and medically complex COVID-19 patients transferred to the post-acute venue of an LTAC hospital. Patients on average spent over six weeks in the transferring hospital mostly in the ICU, are largely elderly, carry the known risk factors for COVID-19 infection, and experienced respiratory failure necessitating prolonged mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. Our findings suggest that these patients will continue to require considerable medical interventions and treatments, including weaning from mechanical ventilation, owing to the numerous sequelae of the infection and the burden of acute-on-chronic diseases. As ICU survival rates improve, this research further emphasizes the important role of the LTAC hospital in responding to the COVID-19 crisis. ? 2021 Hassenpflug MS et al.","output":"Post-COVID recovery: Characteristics of chronically critically ill patients admitted to a long-term acute care hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A robust testing program is necessary for containing the spread of COVID-19 infections before a vaccine becomes available. However, due to an acute shortage of testing kits (especially in low-resource developing countries), designing an optimal testing program/strategy is a challenging problem to solve. Prior literature on testing strategies suffers from two major limitations: (i) it does not account for the trade-off between testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and (ii) it primarily focuses on static testing strategies, which leads to significant shortcomings in the testing programs effectiveness. In this paper, we address these limitations by making five novel contributions. (i) We formally define the optimal testing problem and propose the DOCTOR POMDP model to tackle it. (ii) We solve the DOCTOR POMDP using a scalable Monte Carlo tree search based algorithm. (iii) We provide a rigorous experimental analysis of DOCTORs testing strategies against static baselines - our results show that when applied to the city of Santiago in Panama, DOCTORs strategies result in ~40% fewer COVID-19 infections (over one month) as compared to state-of-the-art static baselines. (iv) In addition, we analyze DOCTORs testing policy to derive insights about the reasons behind the optimality of DOCTORs testing policy. (v) Finally, we characterize conditions (of the real world) under which DOCTORs optimization would be of most benefit to government policy makers, and thus requires significant attention from researchers in this area.

MATERIAL AND METHODS In this cross-sectional study, 3351 college students from China were surveyed through questionnaires about their sociodemographic and COVID-19 characteristics, the needs of school support, and their experiences with anxiety and depression. RESULTS Anxiety and depression were reported by 6.88% and 10.50% of students, respectively. Married, higher education, non-medical, and urban students had significantly higher risks of anxiety or depression. Additionally, symptoms such as cough and fever, especially when following a possible contact with suspected individuals, quarantine history of a personal contact, going out 1-3 times a week, not wearing a mask, and spending 2-3 hours browsing COVID-19-related information were significantly associated with the occurrence of anxiety or depression. Those who used methods to regulate their emotional state, used a psychological hotline, and who had visited a psychiatrist showed higher anxiety or depression. Those who used online curricula and books, used preventive methods for COVID-19, and who had real-time information about the epidemic situation of the school showed lower anxiety and depression.

However, the definition of well-being and the evidence base behind such guidelines remain unclear. AIMS: The aims of the study are to assess the applicability of well-being guidelines in practice, identify unaddressed healthcare workers' needs and provide recommendations for supporting front-line staff during the current and future pandemics. METHOD: This paper discusses the findings of a qualitative study based on interviews with front-line healthcare workers in the UK (n = 33), and examines them in relation to a rapid review of well-being guidelines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 14). RESULTS: The guidelines placed greater emphasis on individual mental health and psychological support, whereas healthcare workers placed greater emphasis on structural conditions at work, responsibilities outside the hospital and the invaluable support of the community. The well-being support interventions proposed in the guidelines did not always respond to the lived experiences of staff, as some reported not being able to participate in these interventions because of understaffing, exhaustion or clashing schedules. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers expressed well-being needs that aligned with socio-ecological conceptualisations of well-being related to quality of life. This approach to well-being has been highlighted in literature on support of healthcare workers in previous health emergencies, but it has not been monitored during this pandemic. Well-being guidelines should explore the needs of healthcare workers, and contextual characteristics affecting the implementation of recommendations.","output":"Mental health and well-being of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: contrasting guidelines with experiences in practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Access to health services and adequate care is influenced by sex, ethnicity, socio-economic position (SEP) and burden of co-morbidities. However, it is unknown whether the COVID-19 pandemic further deepened these already existing health inequalities. Methods: Participants were from five longitudinal age-homogenous British cohorts (born in 2001, 1990, 1970, 1958 and 1946). A web and telephone-based survey provided data on cancelled surgical or medical appointments, and the number of care hours received during the UK COVID-19 national lockdown. Using binary or ordered logistic regression, we evaluated whether these outcomes differed by sex, ethnicity, SEP and having a chronic illness. Adjustment was made for study-design, non-response weights, psychological distress, presence of children or adolescents in the household, keyworker status, and whether participants had received a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts and meta-regression evaluated the effect of age as a moderator. Findings: 14891 participants were included. Females (OR 1.40, 95% confidence interval [1.27,1.55]) and those with a chronic illness (OR 1.84 [1.65-2.05]) experienced significantly more cancellations during lockdown (all p<0.0001). Ethnic minorities and those with a chronic illness required a higher number of care hours during the lockdown (both OR approx. 2.00, all p<0.002). Age was not independently associated with either outcome in meta-regression. SEP was not associated with cancellation or care hours. Interpretation: The UK government's lockdown approach during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have deepened existing health inequalities, impacting predominantly females, ethnic-minorities and those with chronic illnesses.

This case series reports the demographic and clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children seen at a district hospital in Sierra Leone. This is a report of nine COVID-19 paediatric cases managed at a secondary level hospital in Kambia District, Northern Sierra Leone. Each child was detected by contact tracing after an infected adult was identified by the COVID-19 response team. The clinical symptoms at presentation, clinical courses, and treatments instituted and patient outcomes are discussed in the context of the facilities available at a typical West African district hospital. Nine out of 30 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection who presented to the hospital from 24 April to 20 September 2020 and who were admitted to the isolation center of the hospital were in the paediatric age group. The mean age (SD) and median (IQR) of the children were 69.0  51.7months and 84.0 (10.5, 108.0) months, respectively; five (55.6%) were males. The children were asymptomatic or only had mild illnesses and none required intranasal oxygen or ventilatory support. In the five symptomatic children, the most common symptoms were fever (40%) and cough (40%). All children had normal haemoglobin, platelet and white blood cell (WBC) count. Four children had a positive malaria test and were treated with a complete course of anti-malaria medications. No child received steroid or had specific anti-COVID-19 treatment. All children stayed in the isolation center for 14 days and were re-tested for COVID-19 two weeks after initial diagnosis. No complications have been reported in any of them since discharge.

By augmenting the immune response with these medications, immune-related adverse effects can occur, and often include dermatological toxicity, hepatotoxicity, endocrinopathies, and much more rarely, pneumonitis. Case Presentation: An 80-year-old with past medical history of bronchial asthma, hypertension, 30 pack year smoking history discontinued over 2 decades ago, and metastatic melanoma (MM) on neoadjuvant nivolumab presented to our hospital in September of 2020 with 5 days of worsening shortness of breath. He denied any fever, cough, chest discomfort, palpitation, nausea, vomiting, epigastric/abdominal pain, leg pain, or palpitations. He had been diagnosed with stage IIIc MM in March of 2020 and underwent surgical resection of his left hallux and had completed 5 cycles of immunotherapy with Nivolumab.

Biomarkers were screened out of hematological parameters for risk stratification. Method Confirmed COVID-19 adult patients in Suzhou were included. The patient data was collected, and the results of laboratory examinations were compared between the mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 groups. A ROC was calculated to compare the diagnostic performance of candidate indexes, and dynamic levels of hematological indexes were compared between the two groups. Result 75 patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 46.6  14 years, and 45 patients were male. All patients were classified into two groups: the mild/moderate group and the severe group. WBC, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels of the severe group were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the mild/moderate, and the lymphocyte was lower. The ROC test showed that the hematological parameters had a larger AUC than that of inflammatory factors. There was a significant difference in lymphocyte and fibrinogen levels between the two groups on day 1 (P < 0.05).

The public health system and medical care community in the United States have wrestled with developing new and more accurate methods for earlier detection of threats to the health of the public. The benefits and challenges of using Emergency Department data for surveillance are described in this chapter through examples from one biosurveillance system, the North Carolina Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT). ED data are a proven tool for biosurveillance, and the ED data in NC DETECT have proved to be effective for a variety of public health uses, including surveillance, monitoring and investigation. A distinctive feature of ED data for surveillance is their timeliness. With electronic health information systems, these data are available in near real-time, making them particularly useful for surveillance and situational awareness in rapidly developing public health outbreaks or disasters. Challenges to using ED data for biosurveillance include the reliance on free text data (often in chief complaints). Problems with textual data are addressed in a variety of ways, including preprocessing data to clean the text entries and address negation. The use of ED data for public health surveillance can significantly increase the speed of detecting, monitoring and investigating public health events.

The relative importance of these goals in driving carnivore movement likely changes across temporal scales, but our understanding of these dynamics remains limited. Here we quantified how drivers of movement and habitat selection changed with temporal grain for two large carnivore species living in human-dominated landscapes, providing insights into commonalities in carnivore movement strategies across regions. We used high-resolution GPS collar data and integrated step selection analyses to model movement and habitat selection for African lions (Panthera leo) in Laikipia, Kenya and pumas (Puma concolor) in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California across eight temporal grains, ranging from 5 minutes to 12 hours. Analyses considered landscape covariates that are related to energetics, resource acquisition, and anthropogenic risk. For both species, topographic slope, which strongly influences energetic expenditure, drove habitat selection and movement patterns over fine temporal grains but was less important at longer temporal grains. In contrast, avoiding anthropogenic risk during the day, when risk was highest, was consistently important across grains, but the degree to which carnivores relaxed this avoidance at night was strongest for longer-term movements. Lions and pumas modified their movement behavior differently in response to anthropogenic features: lions sped up while near humans at fine temporal grains, while pumas slowed down in more developed areas at coarse temporal grains. Finally, pumas experienced a trade-off between energetically efficient movement and avoiding anthropogenic risk. Temporal grain is an important methodological consideration in habitat selection analyses, as drivers of both movement and habitat selection changed across temporal grain. Additionally, grain-dependent patterns can reflect meaningful behavioral processes, including how fitness-relevant goals influence behavior over different periods of time. In applying multi-scale analysis to fine-resolution data, we showed that two large carnivore species in very different human-dominated landscapes balanced competing energetic and safety demands in largely similar ways. These commonalities suggest general strategies of landscape use across large carnivore species.","output":"Temporal scale of habitat selection for large carnivores: balancing energetics, risk and finding prey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytidine triphosphate synthase (CTPS) catalyzes the final step in pyrimidine de novo synthesis.

Although the function of these structures has not been thoroughly investigated in plants, altered enzyme activity and effects on cell structure are reported in other organisms. CTPS activity is required for cell cycle progression and growth. Furthermore, drought can lead to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by this, to DNA damage.

This article proposes a novel lightweight sharing scheme for permitting Internet users to quickly and safely access the SMIs from a hospital using an Internet computer anywhere but without relying on a virtual private network or another complex deployment. Methods: A four-level endpoint network penetration scheme based on the existing hospital network facilities and information security rules was proposed to realize the secure and lightweight sharing of SMIs over the Internet.

Cationic polymer condensed nucleic acids have been used with surface coated porous scaffolds and are able to promote long term gene expression. However, due to surface loading of the scaffold, there is a limit to the amount of nucleic acid that can be loaded, resulting in decreasing expression rate over time. In addition, surface coated scaffolds are generally non-injectable. Here, we demonstrate that cationic polymer condensed nucleic acids can be effectively loaded into injectable granular hydrogel scaffolds by stabilizing the condensed nucleic acid into a lyophilized powder, loading the powder into a bulk hydrogel, and then fragmenting the loaded hydrogel. The resulting hydrogel microparticles contain non-aggregated nucleic acid particles, can be annealed post-injection to result in an injectable microporous hydrogel, and can effectively deliver nucleic acids to embedded cells with a constant expression rate. Due to the nature of granular hydrogels, we demonstrate that mixtures of loaded and unloaded particles and spatially resolved gene expression can be easily achieved.

One concern is that treatment of renal anemia might increase stroke risk. We studied risk factors for stroke in a prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized, controlled trial of intravenous iron treatment strategies in HD. Methods: We analyzed data from the Proactive IV Iron Therapy in Haemodialysis Patients (PIVOTAL) trial, focusing on variables associated with risk of stroke. The trial randomized 2141 adults who had started HD <12 months earlier and who were receiving an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) to high-dose IV iron administered proactively or low-dose IV iron administered reactively in a 1:1 ratio. Possible stroke events were independently adjudicated. We performed analyses to identify variables associated with stroke during follow-up and assessed survival following stroke. Results: During a median 2.1 years of follow-up, 69 (3.2%) patients experienced a first postrandomization stroke. Fifty-seven (82.6%) were ischemic strokes, and 12 (17.4%) were hemorrhagic strokes. There were 34 postrandomization strokes in the proactive arm and 35 postrandomization strokes in the reactive arm (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 1.44; P=0.66). In multivariable models, women, diabetes, history of prior stroke at baseline, higher baseline systolic BP, lower serum albumin, and higher C-reactive protein were independently associated with stroke events during follow-up. Hemoglobin, total iron, and ESA dose were not associated with risk of stroke. Fifty-eight percent of patients with a stroke event died during follow-up compared with 23% without a stroke.

Clay minerals are a class of nanolayered silicates that have good biocompatibility, high specific surface area, chemical inertness, colloid, and thixotropy, and are attractive practical and potential nanomaterials in medicine. These properties enable the usage of nanoclays as drug carriers for the delivery of antibiotics, antihypertensive drugs, anti-psychotic, and anticancer drugs. The review examines the latest advances in nanoclay-based drug delivery systems and related applications in gene therapy and tissue engineering. Clay minerals, particularly montmorillonite, kaolinite, and halloysite are used to delay and/or target drug release or even improve drug dissolution due to their surface charge. Chemical modification of clay minerals such as intercalation of ions into the interlayer space of clay minerals or surface modification of clay minerals is a strategy to tune the properties of nanoclays for the loading and release of a drug. The modified nanoclay can take up drugs by encapsulation, immobilization, ion exchange reaction, or electrostatic interactions. Controlled drug release from the drug-clay originates from the incorporation and interactions between the drug and inorganic layers, including electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Montmorillonite has proven non-toxic through hematological, biochemical, and histopathological analyses in rat. Montmorillonite can also act as a potent detoxifier. Halloysite nanotubes can bind synthetic and biological components such as chitosan, gelatin, and alginate innate nanocarriers for the improved loading and controlled release of drugs, proteins, and DNA. The peculiar properties of clay nanoparticles lead to promising applications in drug delivery, gene delivery, tissue engineering, cancer and stem cell isolation, and bioimaging.","output":"Nanoclay-based drug delivery systems and their therapeutic potentials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter addresses applications of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) in health care facilities, including laboratories and animal or veterinary facilities.

In this respect, one of the most widely studied drugs is Favipiravir. Our aim in this work was to study the adsorption behavior of Favipiravir drug on the surface of first-row transition metals (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) decorated on boron phosphide (B12P12) nanocage to develop an excellent drug carrier through the density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT). The interaction of the drug with different transition metals decorated B12P12 nanodusters was studied in order to examine the most suitable nanocage for the drug carrier. A narrow band gap with red-shifting in absorption spectrum was observed for the drug-adsorbed metal-decorated B12P12 nanodusters. Excellent adsorption energies were found in Favipiravir-adsorbed metal-decorated nanodusters (E-ad = 151 to 212 kJ mol(-1)). Negative values of Gibbs free energy and enthalpy of the reaction suggested that the adsorption of the drug on metal-decorated B12P12 nanodusters is an exothermic and spontaneous phenomenon. Different geometrical parameters such as molecular electrostatic potential, the alignment of frontier molecular orbitals, Q(NBO), dipole moment, and global indices of reactivity are considered for drug adsorption. Results of different analyses indicated that metal decoration on B12P12 nanodusters is an efficient approach for Favipiravir adsorption.

Target temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest can improve neurological outcome. A combination of ECPR and TTM, both implemented as soon as possible on scene, appears to have promising results in OHCA. To date, it is still unknown whether the implementation of TTM and ECPR on scene affects the time course and value of neurological biomarkers. METHODS: 69 ECPR patients were examined in this study. Blood samples were collected between 1 and 72 h after ECPR and analyzed for S100, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), lactate, D-dimers and interleukin 6 (IL6). Cerebral performance category (CPC) scores were used to assess neurological outcome after ECPR upon hospital discharge. Resuscitation data were extracted from the Regensburg extracorporeal membrane oxygenation database and all data were analyzed by a statistician. The data were analyzed using non-parametric methods. Diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers was determined by area under the curve (AUC) analysis. Results were compared to the relevant literature. RESULTS: Non-hypoxic origin of cardiac arrest, manual chest compression until ECPR, a short low-flow time until ECPR initiation, low body mass index (BMI) and only a minimal need of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation support were associated with a good neurological outcome after ECPR. Survivors with good neurological outcome had significantly lower lactate, IL6, D-dimer, and NSE values and demonstrated a rapid decrease in the initial S100 value compared to non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: A short low-flow time until ECPR initiation is important for a good neurological outcome. Hypoxia-induced cardiac arrest has a high mortality rate even when ECPR and TTM are performed at the emergency scene. ECPR patients with a higher BMI had a worse neurological outcome than patients with a normal BMI.

Random effects models were fit for each outcome measure. Effect sizes were reported as pooled median differences of medians (MDMs), mean differences (MDs), or odds ratios (ORs). EXPERT OPINION: Ten studies with 2,281 patients met inclusion criteria (COVID-19: 861 [37.7%], ARDS: 1420 [62.3%]).

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 32 patients with a history of cancer who were referred to our hospital between January 31, 2020 and May 25, 2020. We evaluated the association between clinical outcomes and potential prognostic factors using univariate analyses. Results: The median age was 74.5 (range, 24C90) years and 22 patients (69%) were men. A total of 11 patients (34%) died. Our analyses demonstrated that the mortality was significantly associated with lymphocyte count, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein on admission. The median period between illness onset and the first effective negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR result was 22 days (interquartile range, 18C25) in survivors. Of four patients with hematological malignancy who developed COVID-19 within the rest period of chemotherapy, three died and the other patient, who received bendamustine plus rituximab therapy, had the longest duration of viral shedding (56 days). Conclusion: Our study suggested that the risk factors for mortality previously reported in general COVID-19 patients, including lymphocytopenia, were also effective in cancer patients.

While our understanding of this new virus is rapidly increasing, gaps remain in our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 can effectively suppress host cell antiviral responses. Recent work on other viruses has demonstrated a novel mechanism through which viral proteins can mimic critical regions of human histone proteins. Histone proteins are responsible for governing genome accessibility and their precise regulation is critical for a cells ability to control transcription and respond to viral threats. Here, we show that the protein encoded by ORF8 (Orf8) in SARS-CoV-2 functions as a histone mimic of the ARKS motif in histone 3. Orf8 is associated with chromatin, binds to numerous histone-associated proteins, and is itself acetylated within the histone mimic site. Orf8 expression in cells disrupts multiple critical histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) including H3K9ac, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3 and promotes chromatin compaction while Orf8 lacking the histone mimic motif does not. Further, SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cell lines and postmortem patient lung tissue cause these same disruptions to chromatin. However, deletion of the Orf8 gene from SARS-CoV-2 largely blocks its ability to disrupt host-cell chromatin indicating that Orf8 is responsible for these effects. Finally, deletion of the ORF8 gene affects the host-cell transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple cell types and decreases the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived lung alveolar type 2 (iAT2) pulmonary cells. These findings demonstrate a novel function for the poorly understood ORF8-encoded protein and a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 disrupts host cell epigenetic regulation. Finally, this work provides a molecular basis for the finding that SARS-CoV-2 lacking ORF8 is associated with decreased severity of COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 encoded protein contains a histone mimic, disrupts chromatin regulation, and enhances replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anti-viral activities of long-chain inorganic polyphosphates (PolyPs) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infection were investigated.

To date, most studies on vehicle carbon emissions have focused on diesel and electric vehicles (EVs). Emission assessment methodologies are usually developed for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) which are non-durable household goods such as packaged foods, beverages, and toiletries instead of vehicle products. There is an increase in the number of articles addressing the product carbon footprint (PCF) of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the recent years, while relatively little research focuses on both vehicle PCF and fuel cycle.

A homology-based model predicted small carbohydrate-combining sites with a metal-binding site for ligand binding (Ca(2+) binding site) in MrCTL and beta-sheets connected by short loops and beta-bends forming a dome-shaped beta-barrel structure representing the LTL domain of MrERGIC-53. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction detected MrCTL and MrERGIC-53 transcripts in all examined tissues, with particularly high levels observed in hemocytes, hepatopancreas, and mucosal-associated tissues, such as the stomach and intestine. Further, the expression levels of MrCTL and MrERGIC-53 transcripts were remarkably altered after V. harveyi challenge, suggesting putative function in host innate immunity.

Some features of these RNAs suggest that they are similar to defective interfering (DI) RNAs, and would be the first to be reported for the potexvirus group. The prototype 1.2-kb RNA is 1172 nucleotides in length excluding a probable poly(A) tail and is composed of two noncontiguous regions corresponding to 757 nucleotides of the 5 and 415 nucleotides of the 3 terminal of CYMV's gRNA. The sequence of the prototype 1.2-kb RNA reveals that the two terminal gRNA regions present in this RNA encode a single open reading frame (ORF) joining the N-terminus of the 191-kDa nonstructural product and the C-terminus of the coat protein to form a 35-kDa 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product. The coding properties of this prototype RNA have been confirmed by translation in vitro of native and synthetic transcripts of the 1.2-kb RNAs, both of which direct the synthesis of the anticipated 35-kDa product which reacts with anti-CYMV antiserum. Three additional 1.2-kb RNA species, each of which contains a unique junction site, have been characterized. In all cases, a fusion ORF encoding a 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product is encoded on the RNA. The presence of a fusion ORF in all members of the 1.2-kb RNA species analyzed suggests that maintenance of this ORF may be important for the survival of this class of RNA within the plant.

PubMed platform was used for data collection, searching for the keywords propolis, virus, antiviral, antimicrobial and coronavirus. KEY FINDINGS: Propolis is safe and exerts antiviral and immunomodulatory activity; however, clinical trials should investigate its effects on individuals with viral diseases, in combination or not with antiviral drugs or vaccines. SUMMARY: Regarding COVID-19, the effects of propolis should be investigated directly on the virus in vitro or on infected individuals alone or in combination with antiviral drugs, due to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory action. Propolis administration simultaneously with vaccines should be analyzed, due to its adjuvant properties, to enhance the individuals immune response.

Thus, the identification of Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) in 1996 in a debilitated bat found by a member of the public precipitated both public health consternation and a revision of lyssavirus taxonomy. Subsequent observational studies sought to elaborate the occurrence and frequency of ABLV infection in Australian bats. This paper describes the taxonomic diversity of bat species showing evidence of ABLV infection to better inform public health considerations. Blood and/or brain samples were collected from two cohorts of bats (wild-caught and diagnostic submissions) from four Australian states or territories between April 1996 and October 2002. Fresh brain impression smears were tested for ABLV antigen using fluorescein-labelled anti-rabies monoclonal globulin (CENTOCOR) in a direct fluorescent antibody test; sera were tested for the presence of neutralising antibodies using a rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test. A total of 3,217 samples from 2,633 bats were collected and screened: brain samples from 1,461 wild-caught bats and 1086 submitted bats from at least 16 genera and seven families, and blood samples from 656 wild-caught bats and 14 submitted bats from 14 genera and seven families. Evidence of ABLV infection was found in five of the six families of bats occurring in Australia, and in three of the four Australian states/territories surveyed, supporting the historic presence of the virus in Australia. While the infection prevalence in the wild-caught cohort is evidently low, the significantly higher infection prevalence in rescued bats in urban settings represents a clear and present public health significance because of the higher risk of human exposure.","output":"Evidence of Australian bat lyssavirus infection in diverse Australian bat taxa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate chloroplast DNA variation in a hyperdiverse community of tropical rainforest trees in French Guiana, focusing on patterns of intraspecific and interspecific variation.

OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study was to determine the impact and accuracy of different LUS protocols proposed in COVID-19. METHODS: Patients were evaluated with a standard sequence of LUS scans in 72 intercostal spaces along 14 anatomic lines in the chest. A scoring system of LUS findings was reported and then analyzed separately according to each proposed LUS protocol zones. This score was then correlated to a validated Pulmonary Inflammation Index (PII) on chest Computed Tomography (CT). RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were enrolled. The most frequent pattern was ground-glass opacities in the chest X-ray (53.1%), chest CT (59.1%) and subpleural or lobar consolidations (40.8%) in the posteroinferior areas (p < 0.001) on LUS. The Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was significantly correlated with almost every protocol analyzed except the 8-zone (p = 0.119) and the 10-zone protocol that only included one posterior point (p = 0.052). The highest ICC was obtained with a 12-zone protocol (ICC 0.500; p = 0.027) and decreased as more points were included. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study results suggest that performing an ultrasound protocol with 12-zone scanning, including the superior and inferior areas of the anterior, lateral and posterior regions of the chest was consistent with higher ICC and higher degree of concordance with CT.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the immunogenicity and safety of the influenza vaccine at reduced or full intradermal doses with full intramuscular doses to inform policy design in the event of vaccine shortages. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies published from 2010 until June 5, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: All comparative studies across all ages assessing the immunogenicity or safety of intradermal and intramuscular influenza vaccinations were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted by a single reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved through consensus. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included geometric mean titer, seroconversion, seroprotection, and adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 30 relevant studies were included; 29 studies were randomized clinical trials with 13 759 total participants, and 1 study was a cohort study of 164 021 participants.

Yet the increase in living alone has been one of the most marked demographic trends of the post-apartheid period. The trend, which has occurred alongside the persistence in individual labor migration patterns and a decline in rates of union formation, has been driven by changes among working-age adults, rather than among older adults. This is the first empirical study to investigate the mental health implications of living alone among all adults in South Africa using national longitudinal data. The data come from five waves of the panel household survey, the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS), conducted from 2008 to 2017. Information on depressive symptoms was collected from all adults (15 years and older), who were asked the ten questions which make up the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CES-D 10). Adults who lived alone reported significantly higher depression scores than other adults, in the pooled ordinary least squares models, and in the fixed effects model, which controlled for any unobservable, time-invariant differences between the two groups of adults. Vulnerability to depression was moderated by adults preferences to continue living in their area of residence (as a measure of their social integration), but the positive relationship remained sizeable and significant across all models. The findings shed light on a further dimension of the migrant labor system in South Africa, which has not received adequate attention in the empirical literature, viz. the mental health implications for adults of solo migration, and they provide further motivation for the provision of affordable and safe family housing in local areas of employment.","output":"Living alone and depression in a developing country context: Longitudinal evidence from South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we consider long range models that help in predicting the impact of virus transmission over a period of a few months, .

In two studies conducted among individuals in Belgium and the U.S., we therefore examined the relationship between superstitious beliefs, locus of control, and feeling at risk of Covid-19. Across both countries, we found that superstition is positively, and internal locus of control negatively, related with feeling at risk of Covid-19. Moreover, in Belgium, the effect of superstition was less pronounced for individuals with a higher level of internal locus of control. The absence of an interaction effect between superstition and locus of control in the U.S. could be explained by this country's higher level of superstitious beliefs and lower level of internal locus of control combined with a stronger feeling of being at risk of Covid-19 or cultural differences such as Belgium's higher uncertainty avoidance compared to the U.S.","output":"Superstitious beliefs, locus of control, and feeling at risk in the face of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Suicide continues to be a global health concern, affecting all continents.

We calculated the classical herd immunity level plus a version reflecting the heterogeneity of connections in the network by running the model forward in time until the epidemic completed. Results. Necessary levels of herd immunity vary greatly from county to county. A population weighted average for the United States is 47.5% compared to a classically estimated level of 77.1%. Conclusions. Common thinking argues that the nation needs to achieve at least 60% herd immunity to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 357 participants in Fiji, and structural equation modeling to analyze the collected data. Findings: Results indicate that expected personal outcomes is positively associated with customers' attitudes while expected community-related outcomes negatively impact customers' attitudes. Factors such as attitude, subjective norms, scarcity, time pressure and perceived competition were found to positively influence customers' panic buying intention. Furthermore, scarcity and time pressure were confirmed to positively influence perceived competitiveness while perceived social detection risk negatively influences customer's panic buying intention. Practical implications: The findings highlight the need for better measures to ensure that every customer has access to goods and services and is not deprived of such necessities in times of a crisis. These results will assist store managers and policymakers in introducing better management, social policies and resource utilization mechanisms to mitigate panic buying during the pandemic. Originality/value: This study's findings contribute to the literature on customer's panic buying behavior during a global pandemic. Research in this area remain scarce, inconsistent and inconclusive. Novel insights are generated as this study is the first to combine the theory of planned behavior, privacy calculus theory and protection motivation theory. Applying these theories allows new relationships to be tested to better understand customer behavior during a global pandemic. With most studies on customer behavior during crises and disasters in developed countries, this study generates new insights by exploring customer behavior in a developing country. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Exploring panic buying behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic: a developing country perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine against fatal virus works in monkeys.","output":"Nasal solution joins SARS race"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"First, the authors believed that elevated levels of liver injury markers, particularly aspartate aminotransferase (AST), may reflect true hepatic injury in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide an attractive method to overcome many of these hurdles to rapidly produce therapeutics for emerging diseases. METHODS: In this study, we deployed a platform to generate, test, and develop fully human antibodies to Zaire ebolavirus. We obtained specific anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) antibodies by immunizing VelocImmune mice that use human immunoglobulin variable regions in their humoral responses. RESULTS: Of the antibody clones isolated, 3 were selected as best at neutralizing EBOV and triggering FcRIIIa. Binding studies and negative-stain electron microscopy revealed that the 3 selected antibodies bind to non-overlapping epitopes, including a potentially new protective epitope not targeted by other antibody-based treatments. When combined, a single dose of a cocktail of the 3 antibodies protected nonhuman primates (NHPs) from EBOV disease even after disease symptoms were apparent. CONCLUSIONS: This antibody cocktail provides complementary mechanisms of actions, incorporates novel specificities, and demonstrates high-level postexposure protection from lethal EBOV disease in NHPs.

In Canada, despite high vaccine uptake of the first wave of vaccinations, there are signs of declining uptake of vaccine boosters. Likewise, recommended COVID-19 mitigation behaviors such as mask wearing, distancing, and hand hygiene have been challenging to sustain over the pandemic. The aim of the Canadian COVID-19 Experiences Survey (CCES) is to use a variety of social-cognitive and neurocognitive variables to predict the uptake and sustaining of vaccinations, boosters, and COVID-19 mitigation behaviors across the Canadian population through the second and third years of the pandemic. Methods and analyses: Vaccine hesitant and fully vaccinated adults (N=1,958) were recruited to the 35-minute CCES web survey, using quota sampling, with sampling weights being applied to ensure representativeness of the Canadian population. In Wave 1, conducted between 28 September and 21 October, 2021, 43.3% (n=848) reported not having received any vaccinations, 50.2% (n=983) reported being fully vaccinated, and 6.5% (n=127) reported having had one vaccination with no intention of having a second dose. Social cognitive variables being measured include intentions, beliefs, reasons, and attitudes. Neurocognitive variables being measured include executive dysfunction, delay discounting, and temporal orientation.

METHODS: An IRB-approved prospective registry was set up at ICH on March 13, 2020, for all breast cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or radiologic signs. Registered data included patient history, tumor characteristics and treatments, COVID-19 symptoms, radiological features, and outcome. Data extraction was done on April 25, 2020. COVID-19 patients were defined as those with either a positive RNA test or typical, newly appeared lung CT scan abnormalities. RESULTS: Among 15,600 patients actively treated for early or metastatic breast cancer during the last 4 months at ICH, 76 patients with suspected COVID-19 infection were included in the registry and followed. Fifty-nine of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on viral RNA testing (N = 41) or typical radiologic signs: 37/59 (63%) COVID-19 patients were treated for metastatic breast cancer, and 13/59 (22%) of them were taking corticosteroids daily. Common clinical features mostly consisted of fever and/or cough, while ground-glass opacities were the most common radiologic sign at diagnosis. We found no association between prior radiation therapy fields or extent of radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung lesions. Twenty-eight of these 59 patients (47%) were hospitalized, and 6 (10%) were transferred to an intensive care unit. At the time of analysis, 45/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had been cured, 10/59 (17%) were still followed, and 4/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19. All 4 patients who died had significant non-cancer comorbidities. In univariate analysis, hypertension and age (> 70) were the two factors associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission and/or death.

A recent study found that TRIM7 inhibits human enteroviruses through ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of viral 2BC protein by targeting the 2C moiety of 2BC protein. Here, we report the crystal structures of TRIM7 in complex with 2C, where the C-terminal region of 2C is inserted into a positively charged groove of the TRIM7 PRY-SPRY domain. Structure-guided biochemical studies revealed the C-terminus glutamine residue of 2C as the primary determinant for TRIM7 binding. Such a glutamine-end motif binding mechanism can be successfully extended to other substrates of TRIM7. More importantly, leveraged by this finding, we were able to identify norovirus and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, and physiological proteins, as new TRIM7 substrates. We further show that TRIM7 may function as a restriction factor to promote the degradation of the viral proteins of norovirus and SARS-CoV-2, thereby restoring the Type I interferon immune response and inhibiting viral infection. Several crystal structures of TRIM7 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 proteins are also determined, and a conserved C-terminus glutamine-specific interaction is observed.

Yet the gradual spread of the virus in Lebanon has allowed healthcare facilities critical time to prepare. Simulation is the most practical avenue not only for preparing the staff but also for troubleshooting systems latent safety threats (LSTs) and for understanding these challenges via Hollnagels safety ICII approaches. METHODS: This is a quality improvement initiative: daily in situ simulations were conducted across various departments at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), a tertiary medical care center in Beirut, Lebanon. These simulations took place in the hospital with native multidisciplinary teams of 3C5 members followed by debriefing with good judgment using the modified PEARLS (Promoting Excellence and Reflective Learning in Simulation) for systems integration. All participants completed the simulation effectiveness tool (SET-M) to assess the simulation. Debriefings were analyzed qualitatively for content based on the Safety Model and LST identification, and the SET-Ms were analyzed quantitatively. RESULTS: Twenty-two simulations have been conducted with 131 participants. SET-M results showed that the majority (78C87%) strongly agreed to the effectiveness of the intervention. We were able to glean several clinical and human factor safety ICII components and LSTs such as overall lack of preparedness and awareness of donning/doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), delayed response time, lack of experience in rapid sequence intubation, inability to timely and effectively assign roles, and lack of situational awareness.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients with CAP caused by S. pneumoniae who were admitted to the 32-bed medico-surgical ICU of a community and referral university hospital between 2002 and 2011. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on variables available at admission. RESULTS: Among the 77 adult patients with severe CAP caused by S. pneumoniae who required ICU management, 12 patients died (observed mortality rate 15.6 %). Univariate analysis indicated that septic shock and low C-reactive protein (CRP) values at admission were associated with an increased risk of death.

Designing intervention trials with novel agents with the potential to confer a period of HIV remission without ART remains a key scientific and community goal. We detail the rationale, design, and outcomes of a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of two HIV-specific long-acting broadly neutralising antibodies (bNAbs): 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS, which target CD4 binding site and V3 loop respectively, on post-treatment viral control. METHODS: RIO is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded prospective phase II study. Eligible individuals will have started ART within 3 months of primary HIV infection and have viral sequences that appear to be sensitive to both bNAbs. It will randomise 72 eligible participants 1:1 to the following arms via a two-stage design. In Stage 1, arm A participants are given dual long-acting (LS-variants) bNAbs infusions, followed by intensively monitored Analytical Treatment Interruption (ATI) (n = 36); in arm B, participants receive placebo infusions followed by ATI. The primary endpoint will be time to viral rebound within 36 weeks after ATI. Upon viral rebound, the participant and researcher are unblinded. Participants in arm A recommence ART and complete the study. Participants in arm B are invited to restart ART and enroll into Stage 2 where they will receive open-label LS bNAbs, followed by a second ATI 24 weeks after. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include adverse events, time to undetectable viraemia after restarting ART, immunological markers, HIV proviral DNA, serum bNAb concentrations in blood, bNAb resistance at viral rebound, and quality of life measures. DISCUSSION: The two-stage design was determined in collaboration with community involvement. This design allows all participants the option to receive bNAbs. It also tests the hypothesis that bNAbs may drive sustained HIV control beyond the duration of detectable bNAb concentrations. Community representatives were involved at all stages. This included the two-stage design, discussion on the criteria to restart ART, frequency of monitoring visits off ART, and reducing the risk of onward transmission to HIV-negative partners.

OBJECTIVES: To assess whether recombinant human ADAMTS-13 inhibits endothelial injury and organ failure in a rat trauma-transfusion model. METHODS: Blood products were prepared from syngeneic rat blood according to blood bank standards. Polytrauma was induced in rats by crush injury to the intestines and liver and by fracture of the femur. The rats were hemorrhaged until a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 mmHg was reached. Rats were randomized to receive transfusion of RBCs, FFPs, and platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio to achieve a MAP of 70 mmHg, with or without the addition of ADAMTS-13 (50 g/kg).

The amount of leakage of dextran-FITC from the vascular system to the parenchyma in lungs was quantified. To assess inflammation, IL-6 and IL-8 levels were determined. Organ damage was assessed by histopathology. RESULTS: All rats were severely shocked, with no significant differences in shock parameters between groups. Rats treated with ADAMTS-13 showed signs of a more effective shock reversal (higher blood pressure, lower lactate levels) compared to controls. Also, ROTEM parameters of clot formation in rats receiving ADAMTS-13 improved compared to controls, which was mainly platelet-dependent. Syndecan-1 levels relative to baseline trended to be lower in ADAMTS-13 treated rats compared to controls (107 vs 149%, p = 0.08). ADAMTS-13 reduced albuminuria (1.7 vs 4.4 g/L, p < 0.01) and organ-specific inflammation (pulmonary IL-6 243 vs 369 pg/mL, p = 0.08; splenic IL-6 253 vs 307, p = 0.03) compared to controls, but did not improve histopathological scores. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ADAMTS-13 in a rat trauma-transfusion model improves parameters of shock, platelet-driven coagulation, endothelial damage, and organ inflammation. These results suggest that ADAMTS-13 is important in mediating outcome of trauma. Whether ADAMTS-13 can be used as a therapeutic adjunct to treat bleeding trauma patients remains to be determined.","output":"Therapeutic application of recombinant human ADAMTS-13 improves shock reversal and coagulation status in a trauma hemorrhage and transfusion rat model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preterm birth (PTB) and its complications are the leading causes of under-five year old child deaths, accounting worldwide for an estimated one million deaths annually. The etiology of PTB is complex and multifactorial. Exposures to environmental metals or metalloids are pervasive and prenatal exposures to them are considered important in the etiology of PTB. We conducted a scoping review to determine the extent of prenatal exposures to four metals/metalloids (lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic) and their association with PTB. We reviewed original research studies published in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, POPLINE and the WHO regional indexes from 2000 to 2019; 36 articles were retained for full text review. We documented a higher incidence of PTB with lead and cadmium exposures. The findings for mercury and arsenic exposures were inconclusive. Metal-induced oxidative stress in the placenta, epigenetic modification, inflammation, and endocrine disruptions are the most common pathways through which heavy metals and metalloids affect placental functions leading to PTB. Most of the studies were from the high-income countries, reflecting the need for additional data from low-middle-income countries, where PTB rates are higher and prenatal exposure to metals are likely to be just as high, if not higher.","output":"Prenatal Environmental Metal Exposure and Preterm Birth: A Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has raised a global concern and calls for an urgent response.

As an alternative outlook to the thinking of totalitarian singularity and individualism, community-in its possible and impossible making-can offer more meaningful engagement with the other human being by being responsible and extending care towards the Other. The thinking of a shared community life is the facticity of one's own being-together-in-common without the dismissal of individual differences as can be seen in the works of Jean-Luc Nancy, and there is an ethical demand that comes from the face-to-face ethical relationship with the Other as argued by Emmanuel Levinas.","output":"The Possibility/Impossibility of Ethical Community during the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Philosophical Reflection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the turn of the century seven new respiratory viruses have infected man and two of these have resulted in worldwide epidemics. Both SARS Coronavirus which quickly spread to 29 countries in February 2003 and H1N1 swine influenza that recently spread from Mexico to 30 countries in three weeks represent major pandemic threats for mankind. Diagnostic assays are required to detect novel influenza strains with pandemic potential. OBJECTIVE: In this report we evaluate the ability of a multiplex PCR test (xTAG(?)RVP) to detect new, non-seasonal influenza viruses including the H1N1 swine influenza A/swine/California/04/2009. STUDY DESIGN: Laboratory based study using retrospective and prospective specimens. RESULTS: This multiplex PCR test detected the present of non-seasonal (non-H1, non-H3) influenza in 20 of 20 patients infected with H1N1 swine flu virus. In addition to detecting the current swine flu the xTAG(?) RVP test detected the H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 high pathogenicity avian influenza virus that circulated in South East Asia in 2003 as well as 17 out of 17 influenza A viruses representing 11 HA subtypes isolated from birds, swine and horses not yet seen in the human population. CONCLUSION: Based on these results we believe that this molecular test can perform an important role as a sentinel test to detect novel non-seasonal influenza A viruses in patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) and therefore act as an early warning system for the detection of future pandemic influenza threats.","output":"Multiplex PCR tests sentinel the appearance of pandemic influenza viruses including H1N1 swine influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We improved the quality and reduced the time to produce machine learned models for use in small molecule antiviral design.

Reactive movements in response to a loss of balance are altered in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and are critical for fall prevention. Further, falls are more common while attention is divided. Although divided attention has been shown to impact postural responses in healthy older adults, the impact of dividing attention on reactive balance, and the natural prioritization across postural and cognitive tasks in people with PD is largely unknown. Objectives. To characterize (1) the impact of a secondary cognitive task on reactive postural control and (2) the prioritization across stepping and cognitive tasks in people with PD. Methods. Sixteen people with PD and 14 age-matched controls underwent step-inducing, support-surface perturbations from stance, with and without an auditory Stroop secondary cognitive task. Cognitive, neuromuscular, and protective stepping performance were calculated for single and dual task scenarios. Results. In PD and control participants, cognitive reaction times (P = .001) and muscle onset latency (P = .007), but not protective step outcomes (P > .12 for all) were worse during dual tasking compared with single-task scenarios. Both PD and control groups prioritized the protective stepping task over the cognitive task. Overall, people with PD exhibited worse first-step margin of stability (a measure of protective step performance) than controls (P = .044). Conclusion. This study provides preliminary evidence that people with PD, like age-matched controls, exhibit cognitive and neuromuscular, but not protective step, dual-task interference. The lack of dual-task interference on step performance indicates a postural prioritization for PD and healthy older adults during dual-task protective stepping.","output":"Backward Protective Stepping During Dual-Task Scenarios in People With Parkinson's Disease: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To describe a case of sudden visual loss from acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) as the presenting manifestation of active Covid-19 infection. CASE REPORT: During the quarantine period of the COVID-19 pandemic, a 70-year-old man presented with a 1-day history of a paracentral scotoma of the left eye (OS) associated with diaphoresis. Four days later, the patient developed fever (38 C) followed by cough. Oral and nasal swab PCR testing was positive for COVID-19. Visual acuity in the day of presentation was 20/20 in OD and 20/100 in OS. Multimodal retinal imaging was unremarkable in OD but cross-sectional OCT displayed focal hyperreflectivity at the level of the outer nuclear layer associated with disruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ). The corresponding en face OCT revealed an inferonasal hyperreflective parafoveal lesion. At 1 month of follow-up, tracked OCT of the macula showed resolution of the hyperreflective signal, thinning of the outer nuclear layer, and near-complete recovery of EZ integrity.

Here we showed that PRV infection markedly blocked SGs formation induced by sodium arsenate (AS) and DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT). Accordantly, the phosphorylation of eIF2 was markedly inhibited in PRV-infected cells, although two eIF2 kinases double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) were activated during PRV infection. Furthermore, we also found that the dephosphorylation of eIF2 occurred at the early stage of virus infection but without the elevated production of GADD34 and PP1. Moreover, inhibition of PP1 activity by salubrinal could counteract PRV-mediated eIF2 dephosphorylation partially and inhibit virus replication.

Main Methods HEK293 cells were transfected with a control plasmid, or plasmids expressing ORF8, ORF10, or M protein, and assayed for cell number and markers of apoptosis at 24 h, and expression of interferon and interferon-stimulated genes at 14 h. Key findings A significant reduction in cell number, and increase in early and late apoptosis, was found after 24 h in cells where expression of viral genes was combined with 1-2 M CBD treatment, but not in control-transfected cells treated with CBD, or in cells expressing viral genes but treated only with vehicle. CBD (2 M) augmented expression of IFN, IFN1 and IFN2/3, as well as the 2-5-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family members OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and OASL, in cells expressing ORF8, ORF10, and M protein. CBD also augmented expression of these genes in control cells not expressing viral genes, without enhancing apoptosis. Significance Our results demonstrate a poor ability of HEK293 cells to respond to SARS-CoV-2 genes alone, but suggest an augmented innate anti-viral response to these genes in the presence of CBD. Furthermore, our results indicate that CBD may prime components of the innate immune system, increasing readiness to respond to viral infection without activating apoptosis, and therefore could be studied for potential in prophylaxis.","output":"Effect of cannabidiol on apoptosis and cellular interferon and interferon-stimulated gene responses to the SARS-CoV-2 genes ORF8, ORF10 and M protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic continues and antiviral agents and vaccines are currently under investigation.

Nearly all Universities around the globe were affected. Further, young people and University students in particular, are known to be vulnerable for developing mental disorders. This study aims to examine the mental health social and emotional well-being and perceived burdens of University students during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Germany. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional and anonymous online survey among University students assessed mental health status with standardized measures (depressive symptoms, alcohol and drug consumption, and eating disorder symptoms), attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic and perceived burdens, and social and emotional aspects of the pandemic (social support, perceived stress, loneliness, and self-efficacy). Results: In total, N = 3,382 German University students participated. Nearly half of the students (49%) reported that they are worried or very much worried about the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority supports the governmental lockdown measures (85%). A Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) sum score of 10 or above, indicating clinically relevant depressive symptoms, was reported by 37% (n = 1,249). The PHQ-9 sum score was on average 8.66 (SD = 5.46). Suicidal thoughts were indicated by 14.5% of the participants. Levels of depressive symptoms differed significantly for the different self-rated income changes during the pandemic (increase, decrease, no change in income). Further, levels of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation differed significantly for students from different faculties. Multiple regression analyses revealed that not being a parent, having no indirect social contact one or two times a week, higher perceived stress, higher experienced loneliness, lower social support, and lower self-efficacy significantly predicted higher scores of depressive symptoms, also higher hazardous alcohol use, and higher levels of eating disorder symptoms. Other aspects of lifestyle such as social and cultural activities, dating, and hobbies were reported to be negatively affected during the pandemic. Conclusion: The present study implies that University students are vulnerable and due to elevated depressive symptoms at risk, being hit hard by the pandemic, but are in general coping adaptively. Low-threshold online interventions promoting help-seeking and also targeting various mental health conditions might bridge the gap the COVID-19 pandemic opened up recently.","output":"Mental Health, Social and Emotional Well-Being, and Perceived Burdens of University Students During COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Synthetic corticosteroids are among the most widely prescribed anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs available.

In recognition of the challenges currently faced by family scientists, we share our perspectives about conducting family research in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are two primary issues we address in this article. First, we present a range of potential solutions to challenges in research, resulting from the pandemic, and discuss strategies for preserving ongoing research efforts. We discuss approaches to scaling back existing protocols, share ideas for adapting laboratory-based measures for online administration (e.g., using video chat platforms), and suggest strategies for addressing missing data and reduced sample size due to lower participation rates and funding restrictions. We also discuss the importance of measuring COVID-19 relevant factors to use as controls or explore as moderators of primary hypotheses. Second, we discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic represents a scientifically important context for understanding how families adjust and adapt to change and adversity. Increased stress precipitated by the pandemic, varying from acute stress associated with job loss to more chronic and enduring stress, will undoubtedly take a toll. We discuss ways that family scientists can contribute to pandemic-related research to promote optimal family functioning and protect the health of family members.","output":"Family Science in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Solutions and New Directions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East coronavirus is causing alarm among researchers and international health officials.

No journal article has previously performed a comprehensive assessment of this subject. INTRODUCTION: Multiple case reports and other references demonstrate a causal association between suicidal risk and LAD. Suicide risk is greater in outdoor workers and veterans, both with greater LAD exposure. Multiple studies demonstrate many infections and the associated proinflammatory cytokines, inflammatory-mediated metabolic changes, and quinolinic acid and glutamate changes alter neural circuits which increase suicidality. A similar pathophysiology occurs in LAD. METHOD: A retrospective chart review and epidemiological calculations were performed. RESULTS: LAD contributed to suicidality, and sometimes homicidality, in individuals who were not suicidal before infection. A higher level of risk to self and others is associated with multiple symptoms developing after acquiring LAD, in particular, explosive anger, intrusive images, sudden mood swings, paranoia, dissociative episodes, hallucinations, disinhibition, panic disorder, rapid cycling bipolar, depersonalization, social anxiety disorder, substance abuse, hypervigilance, generalized anxiety disorder, genitalCurinary symptoms, chronic pain, anhedonia, depression, low frustration tolerance, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Negative attitudes about LAD from family, friends, doctors, and the health care system may also contribute to suicide risk. By indirect calculations, it is estimated there are possibly over 1,200 LAD suicides in the US per year. CONCLUSION: Suicidality seen in LAD contributes to causing a significant number of previously unexplained suicides and is associated with immune-mediated and metabolic changes resulting in psychiatric and other symptoms which are possibly intensified by negative attitudes about LAD from others. Some LAD suicides are associated with being overwhelmed by multiple debilitating symptoms, and others are impulsive, bizarre, and unpredictable. Greater understanding and a direct method of acquiring LAD suicide statistics is needed. It is suggested that medical examiners, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other epidemiological organizations proactively evaluate the association between LAD and suicide.","output":"Suicide and Lyme and associated diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As written language contains more complex syntax than spoken language, exposure to written language provides opportunities for children to experience language input different from everyday speech. We investigated the distribution and nature of relative clauses in three large developmental corpora: one of child-directed speech (targeted at pre-schoolers) and two of text written for children - namely, picture books targeted at pre-schoolers for shared reading and children's own reading books. Relative clauses were more common in both types of book language. Within text, relative clause usage increased with intended age, and was more frequent in nonfiction than fiction. The types of relative clause structures in text co-occurred with specific lexical properties, such as noun animacy and pronoun use. Book language provides unique access to grammar not easily encountered in speech. This has implications for the distributional lexical-syntactic features and associated discourse functions that children experience and, from this, consequences for language development.","output":"The nature and frequency of relative clauses in the language children hear and the language children read: A developmental cross-corpus analysis of English complex grammar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives. To avoid worsening from mild, moderate, and severe diseases and to reduce mortality, it is necessary to identify the subpopulation that is more vulnerable to the development of COVID-19 unfavorable consequences. This study aims to investigate the demographic information, prevalence rates of common comorbidities among negative and positive real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) patients, and the association between SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold (Ct) at hospital admission, demographic data, and outcomes of the patients in a large population in Northern Iran. Methods. This large retrospective cross-sectional study was performed from 7 March to 20 December 2020. Demographic data, including gender, age, underlying diseases, clinical outcomes, and Ct values, were obtained from 8,318 cases suspected of COVID-19, who were admitted to four teaching hospitals affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences (MUBABOL), in the north of Iran. Results. Since 7 March 2020, the data were collected from 8,318 cases suspected of COVID-19 (48.5% female and 51.5% male) with a mean age of 53 +/- 25.3 years. Among 8,318 suspected COVID-19 patients, 3,250 (39.1%) had a positive rRT-PCR result;1,632 (50.2%) patients were male and 335 (10.3%) patients died during their hospital stay. The distribution of positive rRT-PCR revealed that most patients (464 (75.7%)) had a Ct between 21 and 30 (Group B). Conclusion. Elderly patients, lower Ct, patients having at least one comorbidity, and male cases were significantly associated with increased risk for COVID-19-related mortality.

We conducted this study to compare the outcomes of influenza patients treated with veno-venous-ECMO (VV-ECMO) to COVID-19 patients treated with VV-ECMO, during the first wave of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Patients in our institution with ARDS due to COVID-19 or influenza who were placed on ECMO between August 1, 2010 and September 15, 2020 were included in this comparative, retrospective study. To improve homogeneity, only VV -ECMO patients were analyzed. The clinical characteristics and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. Results: 28 COVID-19 patients and 17 influenza patients were identified and included. ECMO survival rates were 68% (19/28) in COVID-19 patients and 94% (16/17) in influenza patients (p=0.04). 30-day survival rates after ECMO decannulation were 54% (15/28) in COVID-19 patients and 76% (13/17) in influenza patients (p=0.13). COVID-19 patients spent a longer time on ECMO compared to flu patients (21 days vs. 12 days, p=0.025), and more COVID-19 patients (26/28 vs. 2/17) were on immunomodulatory therapy prior to ECMO initiation (p<0.001). COVID-19 patients had higher rates of new infections during ECMO (50% vs. 18%, p=0.03) and bacterial pneumonia (36% vs 6%, p=0.024). Conclusions: COVID-19 patients who were treated in our institution with VV-ECMO had statistically lower ECMO survival rates than influenza patients.

Although age has been identified as the most important risk factor (particularly for mortality), the contribution of underlying comorbidities is often assessed using a pre-defined list of chronic conditions. Furthermore, the count of individual risk factors has limited applicability to population-based stratify-and-shield strategies. We aimed to develop and validate a COVID-19 risk stratification system that allows allocating individuals of the general population into four mutually-exclusive risk categories based on multivariate models for severe COVID-19, a composite of hospital admission, transfer to intensive care unit (ICU), and mortality among the general population. The model was developed using clinical, hospital, and epidemiological data from all individuals among the entire population of Catalonia (North-East Spain; 7.5 million people) who experienced a COVID-19 event (i.e., hospitalization, ICU admission, or death due to COVID-19) between March 1 and September 15, 2020, and validated using an independent dataset of 218,329 individuals with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), who were infected after developing the model. No exclusion criteria were defined. The final model included age, sex, a summary measure of the comorbidity burden, the socioeconomic status, and the presence of specific diagnoses potentially associated with severe COVID-19. The validation showed high discrimination capacity, with an area under the curve of the receiving operating characteristics of 0.85 (95% CI 0.85C0.85) for hospital admissions, 0.86 (0.86C0.97) for ICU transfers, and 0.96 (0.96C0.96) for deaths.

The respiratory system consists of an air conduction portion and a respiratory portion. The direct initiating factor of the common cold is low temperature, especially relative coldness. When people feel cold or chilly, vascular constriction around the inlet area of air occurs, resulting in a reduction of mucus secretion containing various antiviral soluble mediators and followed by an explosive increase in the nasal viral flora. A relatively low temperature and dryness are good conditions for viral proliferation and invasion to the body. The first symptom of the common cold is usually a runny nose, followed by a sore throat and/or systemic fever. Acute symptoms of the common cold are usually terminated within 3 days, at the longest 5~7 days. The mortality rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has reached around 10%. A novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus caused the occurrence of more than 130,000 patients and dead cases of more than 800 people. H5N1 avian influenza showed an extremely high mortality rate, even though its infectivity is low. A new serotype of AI (H7N9) has appeared in some areas of China. Vitamin C can prevent the onset of a cold. Vitamin C can even prevent influenza virus from spreading down from the upper respiratory tract to the lower one. In addition, levels of interferon (IFN) in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid are markedly low in vitamin C-insufficient mice.

Cytokine storm is also associated with immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), a complication of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, a highly effective treatment for refractory hematological malignancies. We investigated whether COVID-19-related encephalopathy, ICANS, and other encephalopathies associated with cytokine storm, share clinical and investigative findings. METHODS: Narrative literature review. RESULTS: Comparisons between COVID-19-related encephalopathy and ICANS revealed several overlapping features. Clinically, these included dysexecutive syndrome, language disturbances, akinetic mutism and delirium. EEG showed a prevalence of frontal abnormalities. Brain MRI was often unrevealing. CSF elevated cytokine levels have been reported. A direct correlation between cytokine storm intensity and severity of neurological manifestations has been shown for both conditions. Clinical recovery occurred spontaneously or following immunotherapies in most of the patients. Similar clinical and investigative features were also reported in other encephalopathies associated with cytokine storm, such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, sepsis, and febrile infection-associated encephalopathies. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19-related encephalopathy and ICANS are characterized by a predominant electro-clinical frontal lobe dysfunction and share several features with other encephalopathies associated with cytokine storm, which may represent the common denominator of a clinical spectrum of neurological disorders.

METHODS: Using de-identified EHR data from the Geisinger-Regeneron DiscovEHR partnership, we compared patients with confirmed RT-PCR positive tests for the four common coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) or influenza (A and B) performed from June 2016 to February 2019. RESULTS: Overall, 52,833 patients were tested for coronaviruses and influenza viruses. For patients >=21 years old, 1,555 and 3,991 patient encounters had confirmed positive coronavirus and influenza tests, respectively. Both groups had similar ICU admission rates (7.2% vs. 6.1%, p=0.12), though patients with coronavirus had significantly more pneumonia (15% vs. 7.4%, p<0.001) and a higher death rate within 30 days of testing (4.9% vs. 3.0%, p<0.001). After controlling for other covariates, coronavirus infection still had a higher risk of death and pneumonia than influenza (OR 1.64 and 2.05, p<0.001), with no significant difference in ICU admission rates.

As a result, caregivers of children newly diagnosed with severe and life-threatening food allergic reactions experience clinically significant symptoms of psychological distress, including fatigue, anxiety, depressed mood, social isolation, and substantially reduced quality of life. Despite this recognition, there is a lack of caregiver-centered self-management interventions to address these concerns. OBJECTIVE: In this protocol, we propose to develop and conduct feasibility testing of a technology-enhanced, self-management, mobile health, smartphone app intervention called Food Allergy Symptom Self-Management with Technology for Caregivers (FASST) designed to meet the psychosocial health needs of caregivers of children with a new diagnosis of food allergy. METHODS: This pilot study uses qualitative work (Phase I) to inform a 4-week longitudinal randomized controlled trial (Phase II). In Phase I, 10 caregivers of children (18 years old) with established food allergy (1 year from diagnosis) will participate in semistructured interviews to inform the development of the FASST app. In Phase II, 30 caregivers of children (18 years old) with a newly diagnosed food allergy (90 days from diagnosis) will be randomized 2:1 to receive the FASST intervention (n=20) or control condition (basic app with educational resources; n=10). Process measures include feasibility, caregiver acceptability, adherence, and satisfaction. Outcome measures include caregiver fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep, self-efficacy, and quality of life measured at baseline, week 4, and 3 months post study completion. RESULTS: Phase I study activities have been completed, and Phase II participant enrollment into the randomized controlled trial is expected to commence in 2021.

In the USA, the public's reaction to social distancing has been mixed, evident in a high number of people flocking to beaches, bars and shops as coronavirus cases soar. Public health officials have issued strong warnings about the danger people face but the problem persists. To fill this gap, informed by the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this research explores why many people refuse to practice social distancing. Design/methodology/approach: Two studies were conducted during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the first study, a sample of 750 respondents was recruited from a US online consumer panel to complete a structured survey questionnaire. The data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. In the second study, an open-ended questionnaire was administered to 50 US online participants to further uncover people's in-depth perceptions and perspectives toward the pandemic and social distancing. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Findings: The results from the first study show that risk-taking attitude, authoritarianism and subjective norm are significant predictors of social distancing intention and behavior, through perceived severity of COVID-19. Four themes emerged from the second study, which are consistent with the proposed conceptual framework in the first study. Originality/value: Theoretically, the authors findings first contribute to the emerging marketing literature that focuses on creating sustained positive changes and improving the well-being of consumers, communities and societies. Secondly, their findings corroborate with previous findings documented in the social influence literature by showing that during the times of uncertainty and confusion such as COVID-19, social norms (not forced by laws and regulations) play the most critical role in influencing a voluntary, socially beneficial behavior (such as social distancing). Third, this study extends the application of the TPB into the realm of social distancing behavior. The three main components of the TPB, namely attitude, behavioral control and subjective norm, are shown to predict social distancing behavior. Practically, the results of this research have important implications for public health policies on how to encourage positive public health behavior amid pandemics such as COVID-19. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Social distancing behavior during COVID-19: a TPB perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herein, we report the asymmetric Ru/cinchonine dual catalysis that provides straightforward access to enantioselective synthesis of C-3 substituted phthalides via tandem C-H activation/Michael addition cascade.

The following groups of drugs were identified in one or more studies to affect vitamin D status in some way: anti-epileptics, laxatives, metformin, loop diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, statins, calcium channel blockers, antagonists of vitamin K, platelet aggregation inhibitors, digoxin, potassium-sparing diuretics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, proton pump inhibitors, histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists, bile acid sequestrants, corticosteroids, antimicrobials, sulphonamides and urea derivatives, lipase inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine, highly active antiretroviral agents, and certain chemotherapeutic agents. Given that the quality of the data is heterogeneous, newer, more robustly designed studies are required to better define likely interactions between vitamin D and medications. This is especially so for cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4)-metabolized medications. Nevertheless, this review suggests that providers of health care ought to be alert to the potential of vitamin D depletions induced by medications, especially in elderly people exposed to multiple-drug therapy, and to provide supplementation if required.","output":"A Literature Review of the Potential Impact of Medication on Vitamin D Status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To study the early X-ray and CT findings of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS Chest radiography and CT were performed in 28 patients with SARS within one to three days after onset of the disease. CT examinations included conventional spiral CT and high-resolution CT (HRCT). The radiographic and CT findings of these patients were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Abnormal CT findings were noted in all the patients, but abnormal chest radiographic findings in 17 cases (60.7%, 17/28). CT showed single small focal patchy opacities in 23 patients (82.1%, 23/28), including oval ground-glass opacities in 20 patients, lobular distribution ground-glass opacities in 2 and small patchy consolidation in one. Multi-focal ground-glass opacities were found in 2 patients and extensive opacities in three. In the 28 patients, a total of 31 lesions were found in the upper (7, 22.6%), middle (3, 9.7%), and lower lobes (21, 67.7%). The diameter of the lesions ranged from 20 to 35 mm.

The laser scribed graphene (LSG) on the thin polyimide film was functionalized using pyrenebutanoic acid, succinimide ester (PBSE) to improve the electrochemical activity of the biosensors. The LSG was further decorated with platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) to promote the electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of UA. Glucose oxidase was immobilized on the PtNPs modified surface for selective detection of glucose. The fabricated biosensors were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical methods (cyclic voltammetry and amperometry measurements). Outstanding electrocatalytic activities toward oxidation of UA and glucose were demonstrated. A wide detection range of 5 M to 480 M UA with a high sensitivity of 156.56a? A/mMcm2 and a calculated detection limit (LOD) of 0.018 M (S/N = 3) were achieved for the UA biosensor. The glucose biosensor exhibited a detection range of 5 M to 3200 M with a sensitivity of 12.64 A/mMcm2 and an LOD of 2.57 M (S/N = 3).

In 2020, 140 wild poliovirus (WPV) cases were confirmed, representing a 99.99% reduction since 1988. WPV type 1 transmission remains endemic in only two countries (Pakistan and Afghanistan), but outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) occurred in 33 countries during 2019-2020 (1,2). Poliovirus transmission is detected primarily through syndromic surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among children aged <15 years, with confirmation by laboratory testing of stool specimens. Environmental surveillance supplements AFP surveillance and plays an increasingly important role in detecting poliovirus transmission. Within 2 weeks of COVID-19 being declared a global pandemic (3), GPEI recommended continuing surveillance activities with caution and paused all polio supplementary immunization activities (4). This report summarizes surveillance performance indicators for 2019 and 2020 in 42 priority countries at high risk for poliovirus transmission and updates previous reports (5). In 2020, 48% of priority countries* in the African Region, 90% in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and 40% in other regions met AFP surveillance performance indicators nationally. The number of priority countries rose from 40 in 2019 to 42 in 2020.? Analysis of 2019-2020 AFP surveillance data from 42 countries at high risk for poliovirus transmission indicates that national and subnational nonpolio AFP rates and stool specimen adequacy declined in many priority countries, particularly in the African Region, suggesting a decline in surveillance sensitivity and quality. The findings in this report can be used to guide improvements to restore a sensitive surveillance system that can track poliovirus transmission and provide evidence of interruption of transmission.","output":"Surveillance to Track Progress Toward Polio Eradication - Worldwide, 2019-2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1136/fmch-2020-000361.].","output":"Correction: Contributions and challenges of general practitioners in China fighting against the novel coronavirus crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To examine the independent and incremental value of CT-derived quantitative burden and attenuation of COVID-19 pneumonia for the prediction of clinical deterioration or death METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of a prospective international registry of consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and chest CT imaging, admitted to four centers between January 10 and May 6, 2020 Total burden (expressed as a percentage) and mean attenuation of ground glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation were quantified from CT using semi-automated research software The primary outcome was clinical deterioration (intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or vasopressor therapy) or in-hospital death Logistic regression was performed to assess the predictive value of clinical and CT parameters for the primary outcome RESULTS: The final population comprised 120 patients (mean age 64  16 years, 78 men), of whom 39 (32 5%) experienced clinical deterioration or death In multivariable regression of clinical and CT parameters, consolidation burden (odds ratio [OR], 3 4;95% confidence interval [CI]: 1 7, 6 9 per doubling;P = 001) and increasing GGO attenuation (OR, 3 2;95% CI: 1 3, 8 3 per standard deviation, P = 02) were independent predictors of deterioration or death;as was C-reactive protein (OR, 2 1;95% CI: 1 3, 3 4 per doubling;P = 004), history of heart failure (OR 1 3;95% CI: 1 1, 1 6, P = 01), and chronic lung disease (OR, 1 3;95% CI: 1 0, 1 6;P = 02) Quantitative CT measures added incremental predictive value beyond a model with only clinical parameters (area under the curve, 0 93 vs 0 82, P = 006) The optimal prognostic cutoffs for burden of COVID-19 pneumonia as determined by Youden's index were consolidation of greater than or equal to 1 8% and GGO of greater than or equal to 13 5% CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative burden of consolidation or GGO on chest CT independently predict clinical deterioration or death in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia CT-derived measures have incremental prognostic value over and above clinical parameters, and may be useful for risk stratifying patients with COVID-19","output":"Quantitative Burden of COVID-19 Pneumonia on Chest CT Predicts Adverse Outcomes: A Post-Hoc Analysis of a Prospective International Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The RBD (receptor binding domain) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus S (spike) protein mediates viral cell attachment and serves as a promising target for therapeutics development.

In addition to situational factors such as occupation, family status, and health, personality traits may affect how individuals experienced the initial crisis. METHODS Using data from the pairfam COVID-19 survey, an online survey of the participants of the German Family Panel pairfam conducted from May to July 2020, as well as personality data from the pairfam panel data, this study analyzes whether the Big Five personality traits influence the degree to which young and middle-aged individuals (16-49 years old) felt negatively affected by and were able to see any benefits of the initial COVID-19 lockdown in Germany. RESULTS While neuroticism is linked to a more negative perception of the restrictions to daily life, openness to experiences is associated with more positive perceptions of the situation. Like neuroticism, extraversion is also associated with a more negative perception, but only among respondents without a partner. For respondents with a romantic partner, no association was found.

Cases of rhabdomyolysis as the initial presentation of SLE are rare, and there are no reported cases of SLE presenting hyponatremia-associated rhabdomyolysis as the first manifestation. Herein, we report a case of SLE with lupus nephritis in a patient with acute hyponatremia-associated rhabdomyolysis. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 44-year-old woman was admitted with complaints of altered consciousness, myalgia, and red-brownish urine that first appeared three days prior. Peripheral blood tests revealed elevated creatine kinase (19,013 IU/L) and myoglobin (5099 U/L) levels and severe hyponatremia (111 mEq/L) with no azotemia. Urinalysis showed nephritic sediments. DIAGNOSIS: Whole-body bone scintigraphy showed increased uptake of radiotracer in the both upper and lower extremities. Serological evaluation revealed the presence of anti-nuclear (speckled pattern, 1:640), anti-double stranded DNA, and anti-Smith antibodies and absence of anti-Jo-1 antibody. A kidney biopsy demonstrated mesangial proliferative (class II) lupus nephritis. INTERVENTIONS: Fluid therapy, including intravenous administration of 3% NaCl, was initiated. After three consecutive days of intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/d), oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/d), mycophenolate mofetil, and hydroxychloroquine were administered. OUTCOMES: On day 28, the patient was discharged with marked resolution of SLE-associated symptoms and laboratory findings. Lupus reactivation was not present during the subsequent six-month follow-up. LESSONS: Hyponatremia-associated rhabdomyolysis can be the first manifestation of SLE. Moreover, prompt fluid therapy and timely administration of immunosuppressive agents in SLE patients presenting with hyponatremia and rhabdomyolysis can significantly help alleviate disease activity and improve clinical outcomes.","output":"Systemic lupus erythematosus presenting as hyponatremia-associated rhabdomyolysis: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ever since the transmission of novel coronavirus through human-to-human hit the world As this disease is spreading every day, hospitalisation of individuals increased Consequence of this, there is a sudden surge of millions of gloves, masks, hand sanitizers and the other essential equipment in each month Disposal of these commodities is a big challenge for hospitals and COVID-centre, as they may became the reason of creating pollution and infect the surroundings Increasing hospitalisation cases of COVID-19 results in raising bio-waste which creates pollution Observing the scenario, a mathematical model with four compartments is constructed in this article The threshold value indicates the intensity of pollution that emerged from bio-waste Stability of the equilibrium point gave the necessary condition Optimal control theory is outlined to achieve the purpose of this chapter by reducing pollution Outcomes are analytically proven and also numerically simulated ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"Bio-waste Management During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After encoding, memories go through a labile state followed by a stabilization process known as consolidation. Once consolidated they can enter a new labile state after the presentation of a reminder of the original memory, followed by a period of restabilization (reconsolidation). During these periods of lability the memory traces can be modified. Currently, there are studies that show a rapid stabilization after 30 min, while others show that stabilization occurs after longer periods (e.g. 6 h). Here we investigate the effect of an interference treatment on declarative memory consolidation, comparing distinct time intervals after acquisition. On day 1, participants learned a list of non-syllable pairs (List 1). Immediately after, 30 min, 3 h or 8 h later, they received an interference list (List 2) that acted as an amnesic agent. On day 2 (48 h after training) participants had to recall List 1 first, followed by List 2. We found that the List 1 memory was susceptible to interference when the List 2 was administered immediately or 3 h after learning; however, shortly after acquisition (e.g. 30 min) the List 1 memory becomes transiently protected against interference. We propose the possibility that this rapid memory protection could be induced by a fast and transient neocortical integration (where the memory is transiently protected) becoming partially independent from the hippocampus followed by a hippocampal re-engagement where the memory becomes susceptible to interferences again.

Motivated by this notion, this article proposes a deep learning based framework for automating the task of monitoring social distancing using surveillance video. The proposed framework utilizes the YOLO v3 object detection model to segregate humans from the background and Deepsort approach to track the identified people with the help of bounding boxes and assigned IDs. The results of the YOLO v3 model are further compared with other popular state-of-the-art models, e.g. faster region-based CNN (convolution neural network) and single shot detector (SSD) in terms of mean average precision (mAP), frames per second (FPS) and loss values defined by object classification and localization. Later, the pairwise vectorized L2 norm is computed based on the three-dimensional feature space obtained by using the centroid coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box. The violation index term is proposed to quantize the non adoption of social distancing protocol. From the experimental analysis, it is observed that the YOLO v3 with Deepsort tracking scheme displayed best results with balanced mAP and FPS score to monitor the social distancing in real-time.","output":"Monitoring COVID-19 social distancing with person detection and tracking via fine-tuned YOLO v3 and Deepsort techniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Panic buying is an emerging phenomenon observed during, but not restricted to, pandemic Aim We aimed to evaluate the nature, extent, and impact of panic buying as reported in the media Methods This study was conducted by collecting the information from the English media reports published till 22nd May 2020 A structured format was developed to collect data Searching was done by using the keyword panic buying We have excluded the social media posts discussing the panic buying Results The majority of media reporting was from the USA (40 7 %), and about 46 % of reports highlighted the scarce item Approximately 82 % of the reports presented the causes of panic buying whereas almost 80 % report covered the impact of it About 25 7 % of reports highlighted the rumor about panic buying and only 9 3 % of reports blamed the government Only 27 1 % reports described the remedial measures, 30 8 % reports conferred the news on the psychology behind panic buying and 67 3 % news displayed the images of empty shelves Conclusion A high proportion of reports on panic buying have been found from the developed countries discussing the causes & impact of panic buying on the basis of expert opinion","output":"Panic buying: An insight from the content analysis of media reports during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This studys aim was to reveal the burnout, depression, anxiety, stress, and hopelessness levels of HCWs in the pandemic period.

Conclusion While such techniques are not guaranteed to mitigate stress, psychology studies have shown that awareness of and attention to these components of a healthy lifestyle have the potential to reduce the adverse effects of increasing professional demands.","output":"Maintaining Resilience in Todays Medical Environment: Personal Perspectives on Self-Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Motivation The COVID-19 pandemic has massively disrupted international trade and global value chains Impacts, however, differ across regions and industries This article contributes to a better understanding of the scale of disruptions to industries and value chains integral to economy and livelihoods in developing countries, and what role policy can play to mitigate harm Purpose This paper aims to: (1) Analyse and characterise disruptions to the global apparel value chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on how developing countries have been impacted, and;(2) Identify key policies to support a resilient, inclusive and sustainable recovery Approach and methods We review COVID-19 related reports published by international and non-governmental organisations, international trade and production statistics, industry surveys, and media reports We frame our analysis predominantly within the Global Value Chains literature Findings The global apparel value chain has been severely disrupted by the pandemic, owing to direct effects of sickness on workers in factories, reduced output of materials ? cloth, thread, etc ? used to fabricate clothing, and to reduced demand for apparel in high- income countries Developing countries are suffering disproportionately in terms of profits, wages, job security, and job safety Women worker in the apparel chain have been hit especially hard, not only because most workers in the chain are women, but also because they have experienced increasing unpaid care work and higher risk of gender-based violence Policy implications Five key areas of policy to support a resilient, inclusive and sustainable recovery stand out: (1) delivering emergency responses to ensure firm survival and the protection of workers? livelihoods;(2) reformulating FDI attraction strategies and promoting market diversification;(3) supporting technology adoption and skills development;(4) deploying labour standards to improve workers? conditions and strengthening social protection systems;and (5) adopting gender-sensitive responses","output":"COVID-19s impacts on global value chains, as seen in the apparel industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective systems for the analysis of molecular data are fundamental for monitoring the spread of infectious diseases and studying pathogen evolution. The rapid identification of emerging viral strains, and/or genetic variants potentially associated with novel phenotypic features is one of the most important objectives of genomic surveillance of human pathogens and represents one of the first lines of defense for the control of their spread. During the COVID 19 pandemic, several taxonomic frameworks have been proposed for the classification of SARS-Cov-2 isolates. These systems, which are typically based on phylogenetic approaches, represent essential tools for epidemiological studies as well as contributing to the study of the origin of the outbreak. Here we propose an alternative, reproducible and transparent phenetic method to study changes in SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity over time. We suggest that our approach can complement other systems and facilitate the identification of biologically relevant variants in the viral genome. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we present comparative genomic analyses of more than 175,000 genomes. Our method delineates 22 distinct SARS-CoV-2 haplogroups, which, based on the distribution of high frequency genetic variants, fall into 4 major macro haplogroups. We highlight biased spatio-temporal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 genetic profiles and show that 7 of the 22 haplogroups (and of all of the 4 haplogroup clusters) showed a broad geographic distribution within China by the time the outbreak was widely recognised-suggesting early emergence and widespread cryptic circulation of the virus well before its isolation in January 2020. General patterns of genomic variability are remarkably similar within all major SARS-CoV-2 haplogroups, with UTRs consistently exhibiting the greatest variability, with s2m, a conserved secondary structure element of unknown function in the 3' UTR of the viral genome showing evidence of a functional shift. While several polymorphic sites that are specific to one or more haplogroups were predicted to be under positive or negative selection, overall our analyses suggest that the emergence of novel types is unlikely to be driven by convergent evolution and independent fixation of advantageous substitutions, or by selection of recombined strains. In the absence of extensive clinical metadata for most available genome sequences, and in the context of extensive geographic and temporal biases in the sampling, many questions regarding the evolution and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 isolates remain open. However, our data indicate that the approach outlined here can be usefully employed in the identification of candidate SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants of clinical and epidemiological importance.","output":"Comparative genomics reveals early emergence and biased spatio-temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research on pre-impact fall detection with wearable inertial sensors (detecting fall accidents prior to body-ground impacts) has grown rapidly in the past decade due to its great potential for developing an on-demand fall-related injury prevention system. However, most researchers use their own datasets to develop fall detection algorithms and rarely make these datasets publicly available, which poses a challenge to fairly evaluate the performance of different algorithms on a common basis. Even though some open datasets have been established recently, most of them are impractical for pre-impact fall detection due to the lack of temporal labels for fall time and limited types of motions. In order to overcome these limitations, in this study, we proposed and publicly provided a large-scale motion dataset called KFall, which was developed from 32 Korean participants while wearing an inertial sensor on the low back and performing 21 types of activities of daily living and 15 types of simulated falls. In addition, ready-to-use temporal labels of the fall time based on synchronized motion videos were published along with the dataset. Those enhancements make KFall the first public dataset suitable for pre-impact fall detection, not just for post-fall detection. Importantly, we have also developed three different types of latest algorithms (threshold based, support-vector machine, and deep learning), using the KFall dataset for pre-impact fall detection so that researchers and practitioners can flexibly choose the corresponding algorithm. Deep learning algorithm achieved both high overall accuracy and balanced sensitivity (99.32%) and specificity (99.01%) for pre-impact fall detection. Support vector machine also demonstrated a good performance with a sensitivity of 99.77% and specificity of 94.87%. However, the threshold-based algorithm showed relatively poor results, especially the specificity (83.43%) was much lower than the sensitivity (95.50%). The performance of these algorithms could be regarded as a benchmark for further development of better algorithms with this new dataset. This large-scale motion dataset and benchmark algorithms could provide researchers and practitioners with valuable data and references to develop new technologies and strategies for pre-impact fall detection and proactive injury prevention for the elderly.","output":"A Large-Scale Open Motion Dataset (KFall) and Benchmark Algorithms for Detecting Pre-impact Fall of the Elderly Using Wearable Inertial Sensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis of an unknown aetiology. A small proportion of children exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) or infected by Yersinia reproducibly develop principal symptoms of KD in various ethnic areas, but not in all studies. These microbes provoke a rapid cell\\\\damaging process, called pyroptosis, which is characterised by a subsequent release of proinflammatory cellular components from damaged endothelial and innate immune cells. In agreement with these molecular events, patients with KD show elevated levels of damage\\\\associated molecular patterns derived from cell death. In addition, an overwhelming amount of oxidative stress\\\\associated molecules, including oxidised phospholipids or low\\\\density lipoproteins, are generated as by\\\\products of inflammation during the acute phase of the disease. These molecules induce abnormalities in the acquired immune system and activate innate immune and vascular cells to produce a range of proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, proteases and reactive oxygen species. These responses further recruit immune cells to the arterial wall, wherein inflammation and oxidative stress closely interact and mutually amplify each other. The inflammasome, a key component of the innate immune system, plays an essential role in the development of vasculitis in KD. Thus, innate immune memory, or trained immunity, may promote vasculitis in KD.

The conflicting results could be partially explained by different population critically ill vs non critically ill, different definition of thrombotic events, follow up period was variable, and different prophylaxis that were used. Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) is another coronavirus had been initially reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. A genome scan has shown a 50% similarity between COVID-19 and MERS-COV 2.A common features of covid-19 and MERS-COV including transmissibility, and MERS-COV clinical presentation have been identified 3. However, data about thrombotic complications in patients with MERS-COV are limited. The aim of this study was to compare the rate of thrombotic events between patients with COVID-19 and MERS-COV. Methods: Patients : We included all confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) in 3 major hospitals in Saudi Arabia between February and July 2020. We included all confirmed cases of MERS-COV who were admitted to ICU from these centers between March to May 2014. Patients were excluded if they were transferred in or out from one of these three hospital to another hospitals. Data were collected retrospectively from the first day of admission until discharge or death. Outcome: The primary outcome was the rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The secondary outcomes were the rate of arterial events, the rate of composite events (venous and arterial) and the rate of bleeding. VTE included all symptomatic or incidentally diagnosed cases of pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and thrombosis in unusual sites (cerebral, mesenteric, portal, splenic, hepatic, and renal veins). All VTEs were confirmed radiographically by appropriate imaging. Screening for VTE in asymptomatic patients was not performed. If more than on type of VTE occurred in the same patient, it was considered one event. Arterial events included cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), mesenteric ischemia, and limb ischemia and were confirmed by the appropriate imaging modality. Myocardial infarction (MI) was diagnosed based on the suspicion of the attending physician using clinical criteria as well as biomarker elevations or electrocardiographic changes. Composite events were defined as any VTE or arterial event. Bleeding events were classified as major and nonmajor based on the definition of international society of thrombosis and hemostasis (ISTH) 4. Informed consent was waived. Statistical analysis: Characteristics and outcomes were compared between COVID-19 and MERS-COV groups using chi-square test, fisher exact test or t-test. The rates of thrombosis and bleeding are summarized as proportions, with the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI). A P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) Result: After exclusion, 234 COVID-19 and 58 MERS-COV patients were included. The majority of patients with COVID-19 (98%, n=230) and more than (67% ,n =39 ) of those with MERS-COV group received pharmacological prophylaxis. The most frequently prescribed regimen in both groups was enoxaparin (40 mg twice per day). Over a median length of stay in the COVID-19 group of 22 days, the rate of VTE 9.8%(CI; 6.6-14.3) and was 3.4%(CI; 0.95-11.7) in the MESR-COV group over median length of stay of 10 days. The rate of arterial events were 5.9 % (CI;3.6-9.7) and 8.6% (CI;3.7-18.6) in COVID-19 and MERS-COV respectively. Table 1 and 2. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study compared thrombotic risk between COVID-19 and MERS-COV. We found a similar rate of composite thrombotic events (venous and arterial ) between COVID-19 and MERS-COV with higher rate of venous thrombosis in COVID-19 and higher rate arterial thrombosis in MERS-COV. This may indicate that not only COVID-19 is a prothrombotic disease, but MERS-COV may have similar risk of thrombotic complication . These result needs to be confirmed in a larger studies.

They are typically slow-growing tumors associated with abnormal glucagon secretion, resulting in one or more non-specific clinical features, such as necrolytic migratory erythema (NME), diabetes, diarrhea, deep vein thrombosis, weight loss, and depression. Here, we report the case of a 44-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, presenting with a pruritic and painful disseminated cutaneous eruption of erythematous plaques, with scales and peripheral pustules, misdiagnosed as disseminated pustular psoriasis and treated for 2 years with oral retinoid and glucocorticoids.

These symptoms, together with an inadequate response to therapy of the skin lesions, led to the reassessment of the initial diagnosis. Laboratory tests confirmed elevated plasma glucagon levels (>1000 pg/mL) and computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a 35/44 mm tumor in the pancreatic tail. Due to considerable disease complications and the COVID-19 pandemic, the surgical removal of the tumor was delayed for nearly 2 years. During this time, somatostatin analogue therapy efficiently controlled the glucagonoma syndrome and likely prevented tumor progression.

Ideally, new sampling strategies should be simple to implement, technologically uncomplicated, and applicable to areas where emergence events are known to occur. To this end, xenosurveillance is a technique that makes use of blood collected by hematophagous arthropods to monitor and identify vertebrate pathogens. Mosquitoes are largely ubiquitous animals that often exist in sizable populations. As well, many domestic or peridomestic species of mosquitoes will preferentially take blood-meals from humans, making them a unique and largely untapped reservoir to collect human blood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We sought to take advantage of this phenomenon by systematically collecting blood-fed mosquitoes during a field trail in Northern Liberia to determine whether pathogen sequences from blood engorged mosquitoes accurately mirror those obtained directly from humans. Specifically, blood was collected from humans via finger-stick and by aspirating bloodfed mosquitoes from the inside of houses. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of RNA and DNA derived from these specimens was performed to detect pathogen sequences. Samples obtained from xenosurveillance and from finger-stick blood collection produced a similar number and quality of reads aligning to two human viruses, GB virus C and hepatitis B virus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study represents the first systematic comparison between xenosurveillance and more traditional sampling methodologies, while also demonstrating the viability of xenosurveillance as a tool to sample human blood for circulating pathogens.","output":"Xenosurveillance reflects traditional sampling techniques for the identification of human pathogens: A comparative study in West Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND To evaluate vaginal cuff closure times of a single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy using a newly developed Turkish-made laparoscopic needle holder (TMLNH) with a single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy using a laparoscopic needle holder with pistol handle (LNHPH).

There is a pressing need to improve our understanding of the immunology of this disease to contain the pandemic by developing vaccines and medicines for the prevention and treatment of patients. In this review, we aim to improve our understanding on the immune response and immunopathological changes in patients linked to deteriorating clinical conditions such as cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, autopsy findings and changes in acute-phase reactants, and serum biochemistry in COVID-19. Similar to many other viral infections, asymptomatic disease is present in a significant but currently unknown fraction of the affected individuals. In the majority of the patients, a 1-week, self-limiting viral respiratory disease typically occurs, which ends with the development of neutralizing antiviral T cell and antibody immunity. The IgM-, IgA-, and IgG-type virus-specific antibodies levels are important measurements to predict population immunity against this disease and whether cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses is taking place. High viral load during the first infection and repeated exposure to virus especially in healthcare workers can be an important factor for severity of disease. It should be noted that many aspects of severe patients are unique to COVID-19 and are rarely observed in other respiratory viral infections, such as severe lymphopenia and eosinopenia, extensive pneumonia and lung tissue damage, a cytokine storm leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure. Lymphopenia causes a defect in antiviral and immune regulatory immunity. At the same time, a cytokine storm starts with extensive activation of cytokine-secreting cells with innate and adaptive immune mechanisms both of which contribute to a poor prognosis. Elevated levels of acute-phase reactants and lymphopenia are early predictors of high disease severity. Prevention of development to severe disease, cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and novel approaches to prevent their development will be main routes for future research areas.

Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are involved in various neurobiological pathways, such as GABAergic signaling and neurotransmitter synthesis. Infectious agents are among the major amplifier of inflammatory reactions, hence, have an indirect role in the pathogenesis of NPDs. As such, some infections directly affect the central nervous system (CNS) and alter the genes that involved in neurobiological pathways and NPDs.

Accumulating evidence revealed the ameliorative effect of milk replacer administration in the gut microbial development of early-weaned ruminants. Yimeng black goats (YBGs) inhabiting Shandong, China show a complex intestinal microbial ecosystem, but studies of their gut microbiota are still insufficient to report. Here, this study was performed to investigate how the gut microbiota develops in weaned YBGs with the effect of age and milk replacer. RESULTS: Results indicated that both age and milk replacer were important factors to change the gut microbiota of YBGs. Although the alpha diversity of gut microbiota did not change with the age of YBGs, the taxonomic compositions significantly changed. The relative abundance of some beneficial bacteria such as Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Ruminiclostridium, Eubacterium and Barnesiella significantly decreased and subsequently increase with age, which contributes to maintain the stability of intestinal environment and realize the diversity of intestinal functions. The relative abundance of Porphyromonas, Brevundimonas, Flavobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Propionibacterium, Acinetobacter, Enterococcus and Clostridium belong to pathogenic bacteria in milk replacer-treated YBGs was significantly decreased. Additionally, some beneficial bacteria such as Ruminococcus, Ruminococcaceae, Christensenellaceae and Ruminiclostridium also display a trend of decreasing first followed by gradually increasing. CONCLUSIONS: This study first revealed the gut bacterial community alterations in YBGs with the effect of age and milk replacer. This study also characterized the gut microbial distribution in YBGs with different ages and provided better insight into microbial population structure and diversity of YBGs.

Throughout a keen analysis of the World Health Organization (WHO) most updated data, a gender-specific difference in the occurrence of infection was determined, which seems to correlate with patient's vitamin D status. Therefore, our purpose is to provide insights into the nutritional importance of vitamin D for its immunomodulatory effect, in order to help counteracting the COVID-19 pandemic. Novel interesting findings suggest that vitamin D, by inducing progesterone-induced blocking factor (PIBF), might regulate the immune response and also modulate cytokine IL-6, which appears to be increased in COVID-19 infections. Therefore, in addition to the standard recommendations to prevent the infection, supplementation of vitamin D might be considered an approach to help counteracting this global epidemic.","output":"Inhibitory effects of Vitamin D on inflammation and IL-6 release.

Complex neonatal surgery can impair adequate oxygen delivery and tissue oxygen consumption and increase the risk of neurodevelopmental delay. Coupled with conventional techniques, NIRS monitoring may enable targeted hemodynamic management of the circulation in both cardiac and noncardiac surgical procedures. In this narrative review, we discuss the application of perioperative NIRS in specific neonatal interventions, including surgical intervention for congenital heart defects, definitive closure of the patent ductus arteriosus, neurological and gastrointestinal disorders, and use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We identified areas for future research within disease-specific indications and offer a roadmap to aid in developing evidence-based targeted diagnostic and management strategies in neonates. IMPACT: There is growing recognition that perioperative NIRS monitoring, used in conjunction with conventional monitoring, may provide critical hemodynamic information that either complements clinical impressions or delivers novel physiologic insight into the neonatal circulatory and perfusion pathways.","output":"Near-infrared spectroscopy for perioperative assessment and neonatal interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although COPD is not one of the most common comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, it can be more fatal in this group. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and prognosis of COPD patients among the population with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with positive PCR test were included in our multicentered, retrospective study. Patients with airway obstruction (previous spirometry) were included in 'COPD group'. RESULTS: The prevalence of COPD in COVID-19 patients was 4.96%(53/1069). There was a significant difference between COPD and non-COPD COVID-19 patients in terms of gender, mean age, presence of dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia and presence of pneumonia. The mortality rate was 13.2% in COPD, 7% in non-COPD patients(p = 0.092). The significant predictors of mortality were higher age, lymphopenia (p < 0.001), hypoxemia (p = 0.028), high D-dimer level (p = 0.011), and presence of pneumonia (p = 0.043) in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our research is one of the first studies investigating characteristics of COPD patients with COVID-19 in Turkey. Although COPD patients had some poor prognostic features, there was no statistical difference between overall survival rates of two groups.

The disease spread globally quickly, causing the 2019C2021 COVID-19 pandemic. The meat industry became concerned over the possibility of transmitting the virus in the slaughterhouse environment. The level of air exchange strongly affects the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols within the slaughterhouses. The adsorption of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the surface of the frozen meat is dictated mainly by the interplay of electrostatic forces between the virion and tissue (pH) and environmental conditions (temperature and humidity) in the vicinity of adsorption micro-location. Suppose the virus contaminates the meat surface, whereby pH is 5.5 or less. In that case, it firmly adsorbs due to bonds established by protonated amine group and a hydrogen bond between the COOH group of the viral protein and oxygen in hydroxyl groups present on meat surfaces. The meat surface, coated with a thin water film, interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 virions by establishing strong hydrogen bonds. Although there is no proof of COVID-19 contraction by food consumption, the strong surface adsorption and ability of SARS-CoV-2 to survive meat freezing indicate a potential risk of virus transmission by meat.","output":"Surface adsorption and survival of SARS-CoV-2 on frozen meat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cell death is ascribed as an essential biological process that is fundamental for the development of an organism along with its survival.

Pyroptosis is a programmed procedure for cell death which is inflammatory in nature and this pathway gets activated via human caspase-4, human caspase-11 and human caspase-5. The activation of this process leads to release of pro-inflammatory mediators including cytokines, alarmins, IL-18 and IL-1. The pro-inflammatory mediators released via interaction of intracellular kinases direct the development of Rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized as disorder/disease that is auto-immune and chronic in nature. It involves erosions in marginal bone along with articular cartilage which is responsible for joint destruction. The cytokine along with its complex network is responsible for inflammation.

The optimal utilization of assessment in terms of validity, consistency, and authenticity (Bachman & Palmer, 2010) depends upon numerous factors, such as educational policies, desired learning outcomes, pedagogical approaches, and available resources. L2 assessment over the last several decades has diverged in two broad approaches, traditional assessment and alternative assessment. Although traditional L2 assessment is currently widespread around the globe, there are calls for exploring alternative assessment options. Among alternative assessment possibilities, portfolio assessment emerged in the last 15 years as being valuable due to its pedagogical usefulness, leading to its use in many teaching contexts. Portfolio assessment may be particularly relevant given temporary and permanent changes to educational practices due to the emphasis on remote learning during and as a consequence of COVID-19. Portfolio assessment has undergone considerable scrutiny over the years of its use, and this paper, building on the relevant scholarship, revisits how portfolios have withstood the challenge of being a sound alternative in assessment against the backdrop of post-modernist and constructivist approaches to L2 education.","output":"Revisiting second language portfolio assessment in a new age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this review article was to examine the turbulence of the current educational context in light of COVID-19 and the associated school closures, for disengaged high school students, often over-aged, who are nearing the end of their academic journeys.

Research is ongoing around the world to create vaccines and therapies to minimise rates of disease spread and mortality. Crucial to these efforts are molecular characterisations of neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Such antibodies would be valuable for measuring vaccine efficacy, diagnosing exposure, and developing effective biotherapeutics. Here, we describe our new database, CoV-AbDab, which already contains data on over 1400 published/patented antibodies and nanobodies known to bind to at least one betacoronavirus. This database is the first consolidation of antibodies known to bind SARS-CoV-2 as well as other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. It contains relevant metadata including evidence of cross-neutralisation, antibody/nanobody origin, full variable domain sequence (where available) and germline assignments, epitope region, links to relevant PDB entries, homology models, and source literature.

As part of a wider suite of surveys, the European Federation of Radiographer Societies (EFRS) wanted to investigate the extent and scope of practice for radiographers practising ultrasound across Europe. This report details the results of the initial survey, exploring the views of the EFRS countries' National Radiographer Societies. METHODS An electronic survey was sent to representatives of the 43 national radiographer societies who were members of the EFRS. Questions asked about radiographer practice in ultrasound within individual countries, scope of the role, particularly report writing, in addition to investigating current ultrasound education, barriers and opinions on priorities for radiographer ultrasound practice. RESULTS Forty individual responses were received, from a total of 27 countries, covering 62.8% of the EFRS member societies invited to participate. Radiologists or specialised medical practitioners performed ultrasound in the majority of countries. Radiographers practise ultrasound in 48% of countries and 11% have some limited involvement in ultrasound. Countries without radiographer engagement in ultrasound reported legislative issues or lack of acceptance from the medical professions (52%) and/or limited specific ultrasound education (39%) as predominant factors. In most countries where radiographers practise ultrasound, clinical reporting is a descriptive report or checklist approved by a medical doctor/radiologist. CONCLUSION The results highlight the scope of practice and barriers faced in some EFRS countries to enabling radiographers to develop their skills and competencies in ultrasound. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Priorities for radiographer societies to assist in the development of ultrasound as a pathway for radiographer progression in countries, where it is not yet available, include education programmes, acceptance by medical professionals and changes to legislation.","output":"The role of radiographers in ultrasound: A survey of the national societies within the European Federation of Radiographer Societies (EFRS)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified in 2012 as the causative agent of a severe, lethal respiratory disease occurring across several countries in the Middle East.

We retrospectively reviewed the data of AMI patients admitted to the Nihon University Itabashi Hospital after a COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 (COVID-19 period) and the same period from 2017 to 2019 (control period). The patients' characteristics, time course of admission, diagnosis, and treatment of AMI, and 30-day mortality were compared between the two period-groups for both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI), respectively. The AMI inpatients decreased by 5.7% after the COVID-19 outbreak. There were no differences among most patient backgrounds between the two-period groups. For NSTEMI, the time from the symptom onset to admission was significantly longer, and that from the AMI diagnosis to the catheter examination tended to be longer during the COVID-19 period than the control period, but not for STEMI. The 30-day mortality was significantly higher during the COVID-19 period for NSTEMI (23.1% vs. 1.9%, P = 0.004), but not for STEMI (9.4% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.77).

METHOD: Six weeks after the beginning of the confinement period, an online 10- question survey was sent to all members of the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacists. A single response per hospital was requested. The survey included questions on the provision of remote pharmaceutical care prior to the onset of the health crisis, patient selection criteria, procedures for home delivery of medications and the means used to deliver them, the number of patients who benefited from telepharmacy, and the number of referrals made. Finally, respondents were asked whether a teleconsultation was carried out before sending patients their medication and whether these deliveries were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 39.3% (n = 185) of all the hospitals in the National Health System (covering all of Spain's autonomous regions) responded to the survey. Before the beginning of the crisis, 83.2% (n = 154) of hospital pharmacy services did not carry out remote pharmaceutical care activities that included telepharmacy with remote delivery of medication. During the study period, 119,972 patients were treated, with 134,142 deliveries of medication being completed. Most hospitals did not use patient selection criteria. A total of 30.2% of hospitals selected patients based on their personal circumstances. Home delivery and informed delivery (87%; 116,129 deliveries) was the option used in most cases. The means used to deliver the medication mainly included the use of external courier services (47.0%; 87 hospitals) or the hospital's own transport services (38.4%; 71 hospitals). As many as 87.6% of hospitals carried out teleconsultations prior to sending out medications and 59.6% recorded their telepharmacy activities in the hospital pharmacy appointments record.

Through the analysis of individual factors of the adolescent addiction from the perspective of gender, age, and family environment, this study reveals that male users are more addicted to the use of applications (APP), and such addiction varies with age, and prolonged family members use of short video APP can also exacerbate the adolescent addiction degree. Furthermore, through verification of the theoretical model, it indicates that UGC perception and the degree of boredom in daily life have a significant positive effect on the level of addiction to short video applications, and the degree of boredom in daily life plays a significant mediating role between them. Based on the research on the influences of UGC on the adolescent immersive experience, this study proposes a mechanism of the adolescent addiction to the use of short video applications in the mobile Internet age to provide a better service guarantee for the adolescents.","output":"Adolescent Addiction to Short Video Applications in the Mobile Internet Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 virus, a member of the Coronaviridae family, causes Covid-19 pandemic disease with severe respiratory illness.

To this end, we describe how a computer-based monitoring system can support the delivery of the New Beginnings Program (NBP), a parent-focused evidence-based prevention program for divorcing parents. METHOD: We present NBP from a novel systems approach that incorporates social system informatics and engineering, both necessary when utilizing feedback loops, ubiquitous in implementation research and practice. Examples of two methodological challenges are presented: how to monitor implementation, and how to provide feedback by evaluating system-level changes due to implementation. RESULTS: We introduce and relate systems concepts to these two methodologic issues that are at the center of implementation methods. We explore how these system-level feedback loops address effectiveness, efficiency, and equity principles. These key principles are provided for designing an automated, low-burden, low-intrusive measurement system to aid fidelity monitoring and feedback that can be used in practice. DISCUSSION: As the COVID-19 pandemic now demands fewer face-to-face delivery systems, their replacement with more virtual systems for parent training interventions requires constructing new implementation measurement systems based on social system informatics approaches. These approaches include the automatic monitoring of quality and fidelity in parent training interventions. Finally, we present parallels of producing generalizable and local knowledge bridging systems science and engineering method. This comparison improves our understanding of system-level changes, facilitates a program's implementation, and produces knowledge for the field.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively investigated a cohort of 157 kidney transplant recipients (75% living and 25% deceased donors) seen at a public sector transplant hospital in India from March to December 2020 who had reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests that confirmed COVID-19. Demographic data, immunosuppression regimens, clinical profiles, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. In our center, maintenance immunosuppression was reduced according to disease severity and case-by-case evaluations. There were also 53 patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 symptoms who received home care to optimize the utilization of scarce resources during travel restrictions. RESULTS: In our kidney transplant recipient group, median age was 43 years (133 male; 24 female patients); recipients presented at a median of 4 years after transplant. The most common comorbidities included arterial hypertension (73%) and diabetes (24%); presenting symptoms at the time of COVID-19 positivity included cough (49%), fever (58%), and sputum production (32%). Clinical severity ranged from asymptomatic (4%), mild (45%), moderate (31%), and severe (20%) disease. Statistically significant risk factors for mortality included older age, dyspnea, severe disease, obesity, allograft dysfunction prior to COVID-19, acute kidney injury, higher levels of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, procalcitonin), abnormality in chest radiography, and intensive care/ventilator requirements (P < .05). Overall patient mortality was 9.5% (15/157) in hospitalized patients, 21% (15/71) in patients in the intensive care unit, 100% (15/15) in patients who required ventilation, and 0% among those in home treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate in kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 was higher than in the nonimmunosuppressed general population (1.2%) in India.

This study reports SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater influents and treated effluents of 11 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as well as untreated wastewater from 38 various locations, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in May and June 2020. Composite samples collected over twenty-four hours were thermally deactivated for safety, followed by viral concentration using ultrafiltration, RNA extraction using commercially available kits, and viral quantification using RT-qPCR. Furthermore, estimates of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different regions were simulated using Monte Carlo. Results showed that the viral load in wastewater influents from these WWTPs ranged from 7.50E+02 to over 3.40E+04 viral gene copies/L with some plants having no detectable viral RNA by RT-qPCR. The virus was also detected in 85% of untreated wastewater samples taken from different locations across the country, with viral loads in positive samples ranging between 2.86E+02 and over 2.90E+04 gene copies/L. It was also observed that the precautionary measures implemented by the UAE government correlated with a drop in the measured viral load in wastewater samples, which were in line with the reduction of COVID-19 cases reported in the population. Importantly, none of the 11 WWTPs effluents tested positive during the entire sampling period, indicating that the treatment technologies used in the UAE are efficient in degrading SARS-CoV-2, and confirming the safety of treated re-used water in the country.

Increased worry is also likely considering the substantial financial, educational and health concerns accompanying COVID-19. White matter (WM) integrity has been shown to be associated with anxiety and depression symptoms, including worry, as well being closely associated with sleep quality. This study aimed to investigate the associations between pre-COVID sleep quality, WM structural integrity and levels of worry and rumination about COVID. METHODS: N = 30 adolescent participants from Queensland, Australia, completed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scanning pre-COVID, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) pre and during COVID, and 9 items designed to measure 3 constructs, perceived impact of COVID, general worry, and COVID-specific worry and rumination. RESULTS: Sleep quality (PSQI total) was significantly poorer during COVID compared with pre-COVID. Sleep onset latency measured pre-COVID was significantly associated with COVID-specific worry and rumination. While the structural integrity of a number of WM tracts (measured pre-COVID) were found to be significantly associated with COVID-specific worry and rumination. Follow-up regression analysis using a model including pre-COVID sleep onset latency, structural integrity of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC), gender and change in PSQI explained a significant 47% of the variance in COVID-specific worry and rumination. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that adolescents with poor sleep quality and perturbed WM integrity may be at risk of heightened reactivity to future stressful events and interventions should focus on improving sleep onset latency.","output":"Can measures of sleep quality or white matter structural integrity predict level of worry or rumination in adolescents facing stressful situations?

Although there have been studies on the health risks of MPs to mammals, the impact of MPs on populations with intestinal immune imbalance has been greatly ignored. The vulnerability of the body with intestinal immune imbalance may increase the likelihood of its response to MPs, which is in urgent need of relevant research. Here, we compared the effects of 500a?g/L polystyrene microplastics (PSMPs) on healthy mice and mice with intestinal immune imbalance through colon photographs, histopathological analysis, expression of inflammatory cytokines, PSMPs distribution, microbial community analysis, and metabolomics analysis. The results demonstrated that intestinal immune imbalance aggravated the colonic response to PSMPs. PSMPs exposure significantly increased the expression of inflammation factors (TNF-, IL-1? and IFN-?3) in mice with intestinal immune imbalance. In addition, the exposure of PSMPs aggravated the histopathological damage of colonic mucosa in mice with intestinal immune imbalance, and exerted great disturbance on the colonic microbial community and metabolism. This may be due to the significant increase of PSMPs accumulation owing to the damage of intestinal barrier in mice with intestinal immune imbalance. In addition, the increase of several pathogenic bacteria including Bacteroides caused by intestinal immune imbalance also increased the toxicity of PSMPs.

The present study investigates a change in the number and characteristics of EMS missions in the early phase of the pandemic. METHODS: All EMS missions in the Northern Ostrobothnia region, Finland (population 295 500) between 1 March to 30 June 2020 were screened and analyzed as the study group. A control group was composed from the EMS calls between the corresponding months in the years 2016-2019. RESULTS: A total of 74 576 EMS missions were screened for the study. Within the first two months after the first COVID-19 cases in the study area, the decline in the number of EMS missions was 5.7% - 13% compared to the control group average. EMS time intervals (emergency call to dispatch, dispatch, en-route, on-scene and hospital handover) prolonged in the COVID-19 period. Dispatches concerning mental health problems increased most in the study period (+1.2%, p < 0.001). Only eleven confirmed COVID-19 infections were encountered by EMS in the study period.

However, little is known about the benefits of using virtual reality (VR) for this purpose. OBJECTIVE: To compare between desktop VR and face-to-face simulation in stress responses and performance outcomes of a team-based simulation training in managing clinical deterioration. DESIGN: A randomised controlled study METHOD: The study was conducted on 120 medical and nursing students working in interprofessional teams. The teams were randomly assigned to participate in a 2-h simulation using either the desktop VR or face-to-face simulation with simulated patient (SP). Biophysiological stress response, psychological stress, and confidence levels were measured before and after the simulation. Performance outcomes were evaluated after the simulation using a deteriorating patient scenario. RESULTS: The systolic blood pressure and psychological stress response were significantly increased among participants in VR and SP groups; however, no significant differences were found between the groups. There was also no significant difference in confidence and performance outcomes between participants in the VR and SP groups for both medical and nursing students. Although the psychological stress response was negatively correlated (r = ?0.43; p < 0.01) with confidence levels, there was no association between stress response and performance score. CONCLUSION: Despite being less immersive, the desktop VR was capable of inducing psychological and physiological stress responses by placing emotional, social, and cognitive demands on learners. Additionally, by ensuring close alignment between the simulation tasks and the clinical tasks (i.e. functional fidelity), the desktop VR may provide similar performance outcomes as conventional simulation training.

Here we show that Omicron BA.1 has higher affinity for ACE2 compared to Delta, and confers very significant evasion of therapeutic monoclonal and vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralising antibodies after two doses. mRNA vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and broadens neutralisation. Importantly, antiviral drugs remdesevir and molnupiravir retain efficacy against Omicron BA.1. We found that in human nasal epithelial 3D cultures replication was similar for both Omicron and Delta. However, in lower airway organoids, Calu-3 lung cells and gut adenocarcinoma cell lines live Omicron virus demonstrated significantly lower replication in comparison to Delta. We noted that despite presence of mutations predicted to favour spike S1/S2 cleavage, the spike protein is less efficiently cleaved in live Omicron virions compared to Delta virions. We mapped the replication differences between the variants to entry efficiency using spike pseudotyped virus (PV) entry assays. The defect for Omicron PV in specific cell types correlated with higher cellular RNA expression of TMPRSS2, and accordingly knock down of TMPRSS2 impacted Delta entry to a greater extent as compared to Omicron. Furthermore, drug inhibitors targeting specific entry pathways demonstrated that the Omicron spike inefficiently utilises the cellular protease TMPRSS2 that mediates cell entry via plasma membrane fusion. Instead, we demonstrate that Omicron spike has greater dependency on cell entry via the endocytic pathway requiring the activity of endosomal cathepsins to cleave spike. Consistent with suboptimal S1/S2 cleavage and inability to utilise TMPRSS2, syncytium formation by the Omicron spike was dramatically impaired compared to the Delta spike. Overall, Omicron appears to have gained significant evasion from neutralising antibodies whilst maintaining sensitivity to antiviral drugs targeting the polymerase. Omicron has shifted cellular tropism away from TMPRSS2 expressing cells that are enriched in cells found in the lower respiratory and GI tracts, with implications for altered pathogenesis.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike mediated immune escape and tropism shift"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: While the COVID-19 pandemic is currently impacting on health and social care in Ireland, this impact is most marked in metropolitan Dublin.

It was reported that before the pandemic, participants' online training was deemed to be rather ineffective, given the rate of 3.65 out of 10. However, despite the increase in e-learning use after COVID-19, many obstacles arose duringcthe adaptation process. According to our survey: lectures and training sessions were not conducted as per the curriculum (56.33%); both students and instructors' academic behavior and attitude changed (48.33%); engagement, satisfaction, and motivation in class were rated low (5.93, 6.33, and 6.54 out of 10 accordingly), compared to the desired ones. Still, participants accredited e-learning as a potential mandatory tool (77.67%) and pinpointed the qualifications that in their opinion will maximize educational impact. Conclusion: The study concluded that innovative restructuring of online education should be based on defined critical success factors (technical support, content enhancement, pedagogy etc.) and if possible, set priority levels, so that a more permanent e-learning practice is achievable. Also our study confirmed that students were overall satisfied with the e-learning support of the training method.","output":"Effectiveness and Preparedness of Institutions' E-Learning Methods During the COVID-19 Pandemic for Residents' Medical Training in Saudi Arabia: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The realization of true point-of-care (PoC) systems profoundly relies on integrating the bioanalytical assays into \\"on-chip\\" fluid handing platforms, with autonomous performance, reproducible functionality, and capacity in scalable production. Specifically for electrochemical immuno-biosensing, the complexity of the procedure used for ultrasensitive protein detection using screen-printed biosensors necessitates a lab-centralized practice, hindering the path towards near-patient use. This work develops a self-powered microfluidic chip that automates the entire assay of electrochemical immuno-biosensing, enabling controlled and sequential delivery of the biofluid sample and the sensing reagents to the surface of the embedded electrochemical biosensor. Without any need for active fluid handling, this novel sample-to-result testing kit offers antibody-antigen immunoreaction within 15 min followed by the subsequent automatic washing, redox probe delivery, and electrochemical signal recording. The redox molecules ([Fe(CN)6]3-/4-) are pre-soaked and dried in fiber and embedded inside the chip. The dimensions of the fluidic design and the parameters of the electrochemical bioassay are optimized to warrant a consistent and reproducible performance of the autonomous sensing device. The uniform diffusion of the dried redox into the injected solution and its controlled delivery onto the biosensor are modeled via a two-phase flow computational fluid dynamics simulation, determining the suitable time for electrochemical signal measurement from the biosensor. The microfluidic chip performs well with both water-based fluids and human plasma with the optimized sample volume to offer a proof-of-concept ultrasensitive biosensing of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins spiked in phosphate buffer saline within 15 min. The on-chip N-protein biosensing demonstrates a linear detection range of 10 to 1000 pg mL-1 with a limit of detection of 3.1 pg mL-1. This is the first self-powered microfluidic-integrated electrochemical immuno-biosensor that promises quantitative and ultrasensitive PoC biosensing. Once it is modified for its design and dimensions, it can be further used for autonomous detection of one or multiple proteins in diverse biofluid samples.","output":"Immuno-biosensor on a chip: a self-powered microfluidic-based electrochemical biosensing platform for point-of-care quantification of proteins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic many vaccines have been developed and evaluated in human clinical trials.

We also qualified a pseudovirus neutralization assay which evaluates functional antibody titers capable of inhibiting the entry and replication of a lentivirus containing the Spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2. To complete the suite of assays we qualified a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) methodology using the 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 to assess neutralizing titers of antibodies in plasma from normal healthy donors and convalescent COVID-19 individuals.","output":"Qualification of ELISA and neutralization methodologies to measure SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity using human clinical samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease which has continued to be a public health issue in Malaysia. This paper investigates the impact of singular use of vaccination and its combined effort with treatment and adulticide controls on the population dynamics of dengue in Johor, Malaysia. In a first step, a compartmental model capturing vaccination compartment with mass random vaccination distribution process is appropriately formulated. The model with or without imperfect vaccination exhibits backward bifurcation phenomenon. Using the available data and facts from the 2012 dengue outbreak in Johor, basic reproduction number for the outbreak is estimated. Sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate how the model parameters influence dengue disease transmission and spread in a population. In a second step, a new deterministic model incorporating vaccination as a control parameter of distinct constant rates with the efforts of treatment and adulticide controls is developed. Numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the impact of the three control measures by implementing several control strategies. It is observed that the transmission of dengue can be curtailed using any of the control strategies analysed in this work.

By means of a multivariate approach based on Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis, we manage to derive three clusters representing different behaviour models to which the different European countries belong in the different periods of the first wave: pre-pandemic, summer relaxation and deep-lockdown scenarios. These results bring a two-fold contribution: on the one hand, they may help us to understand differences and similarities among European countries during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and guide future quantitative or qualitative studies; on the other, our findings suggest that with minor exceptions (such as Sweden and Poland), different countries adopted very similar policy strategies, which are likely to be due more to the unfolding of the pandemic than to specific governmental strategies.","output":"Fighting the COVID pandemic: national policy choices in non-pharmaceutical interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Experts agree that vaccination is the most effective way to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control.

Also, group-based motivational interviewing was used to develop weekly health goals for participants. During COVID-19, lessons were delivered online. The program was modified using lectures with visual material, when participants returned to classrooms. Lessons focused on MyPlate, portion sizes, the food pyramid, vitamins and minerals in foods, and learning to eat less of unhealthy food groups. Exercise lessons featured information about importance of exercise, introduction to different types of exercise, and knowledge about how exercise benefits the body. Staff completed implementation logs. Height and weight of participants were examined at regular intervals. Parents completed surveys and participants completed group interviews to assess program impact. RESULTS: Two participants lost a significant amount of weight and others maintained their weight during COVID-19. Participants and parents were satisfied with the program and reported knowledge and behavior change.

Although saliva has been found to be a comparable clinical matrix for detection of SARS-CoV-2, evaluations of diagnostic and analytic performance across platforms for this specimen type are limited. Here, we compared two methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva: the Roche cobas(R) 6800/8800 SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR Test and the Agena Biosciences MassARRAY(R) SARS-CoV-2 Panel/MassARRAY(R) System.

Furthermore, across individual target components of each assay, T2 and N2 targets had the lowest limits of detection for each platform, respectively. Together, we demonstrate that saliva represents an appropriate specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection in two technologies that have high agreement and differ in analytical sensitivities overall and across individual component targets.

A total of 15 pigs were subjected to laparoscopic-assisted cryoablation on both kidneys. After intervention, each animal was randomized to a postoperative follow-up period of 1, 2, or 4 weeks, after which computed tomography perfusion and magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed. Immediately after imaging, open bilateral nephrectomy was performed allowing for histopathological examination of the cryolesions. On computed tomography perfusion and magnetic resonance imaging examinations, rim enhancement was observed in the transition zone of the cryolesion 1week after laparoscopic-assisted cryoablation. This rim enhancement was found to subside after 2 and 4 weeks of follow-up, which was consistent with the microscopic examinations revealing of fibrotic scar tissue formation in the peripheral zone of the cryolesion. On T2 magnetic resonance imaging sequences, a thin hypointense rim surrounded the cryolesion, separating it from the adjacent renal parenchyma. Microscopic examinations revealed hemorrhage and later hemosiderin located in the peripheral zone. No nodular or diffuse contrast enhancement was found in the central zone of the cryolesions at any follow-up stage on neither computed tomography perfusion nor magnetic resonance imaging. On microscopic examinations, the central zone was found to consist of coagulative necrosis 1 week after laparoscopic-assisted cryoablation, which was partially replaced by fibrotic scar tissue 4 weeks following laparoscopic-assisted cryoablation. Both computed tomography perfusion and magnetic resonance imaging found the renal collecting system to be involved at all 3 stages of follow-up, but on microscopic examination, the urothelium was found to be intact in all cases. In conclusion, cryoablation effectively destroyed renal parenchyma, leaving the urothelium intact.

The capsid of coronavirus is a protein shell within which a positive strand of RNA is present which enables the virus to control the machinery of human cells. It has several variants, e.g., SARS, MERS, and now a new variant identified in 2019, which is a novel coronavirus that causes novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Preventive measures and vaccination are the only treatment against coronavirus. Some of these include Remdesivir (GS-5734), Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, and Theaflavin. A topological index (TI) is a mathematical function that assigns a numerical value to a (molecular) graph and predicts many physical, chemical, biological, thermodynamical, and structural features of that network.

The restrictions such as lockdowns, remote-working, and-schooling significantly altered the consumers behaviors and demand structure especially due to a large number of people working at home. Accurate demand forecasts and detailed production plans are crucial for cost-efficient generation and transmission of electricity. In this research, the restrictions and their corresponding timing are classified and mapped with the Turkish electricity demand data to analyze the impact of the restrictions on total demand using a multiple linear regression model. In addition, the model is utilized to forecast the electricity demand in pandemic conditions and to analyze how different types of restrictions impact the total electricity demand. It is found that among three levels of COVID-19 restrictions, age-specific restrictions and the complete lockdown have different effects on the electricity demand on weekends and weekdays. In general, new scheduling approaches for daily and weekly loads are required to avoid supply-demand mismatches as COVID-19 significantly changed the consumer behavior, which appears as altered daily and weekly load profiles of the country.

Here we propose a network model for SARS epidemics and discuss why superspreaders emerged and why SARS spread especially in hospitals, which were key factors of the recent outbreak. We suggest that superspreaders are biologically contagious patients, and they may amplify the spreads by going to potentially contagious places such as hospitals. To avoid mass transmission in hospitals, it may be a good measure to treat suspected cases without hospitalizing them. Finally, we indicate that SARS probably propagates in small-world networks associated with human contacts and that the biological nature of individuals and social group properties are factors more important than the heterogeneous rates of social contacts among individuals.

Unfortunately, its methods and language can be misused and improperly applied. A repertoire of methods, techniques, arguments, and tactics are used by some people to manipulate science, usually in the service of powerful interests, and particularly those with a financial stake related to toxic agents. Such interests work to foment uncertainty, cast doubt, and mislead decision makers by seeding confusion about cause-and-effect relating to population health. We have compiled a toolkit of the methods used by those whose interests are not aligned with the public health sciences. Professional epidemiologists, as well as those who rely on their work, will thereby be more readily equipped to detect bias and flaws resulting from financial conflict-of-interest, improper study design, data collection, analysis, or interpretation, bringing greater claritynot only to the advancement of knowledge, but, more immediately, to policy debates. METHODS: The summary of techniques used to manipulate epidemiological findings, compiled as part of the 2020 Position Statement of the International Network for Epidemiology in Policy (INEP) entitled Conflict-of-Interest and Disclosure in Epidemiology, has been expanded and further elucidated in this commentary. RESULTS: Some level of uncertainty is inherent in science. However, corrupted and incomplete literature contributes to confuse, foment further uncertainty, and cast doubt about the evidence under consideration. Confusion delays scientific advancement and leads to the inability of policymakers to make changes that, if enacted, wouldsupported by the body of valid evidenceprotect, maintain, and improve public health. An accessible toolkit is provided that brings attention to the misuse of the methods of epidemiology. Its usefulness is as a compendium of what those trained in epidemiology, as well as those reviewing epidemiological studies, should identify methodologically when assessing the transparency and validity of any epidemiological inquiry, evaluation, or argument. The problems resulting from financial conflicting interests and the misuse of scientific methods, in conjunction with the strategies that can be used to safeguard public health against them, apply not only to epidemiologists, but also to other public health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: This novel toolkit is for use in protecting the public. It is provided to assist public health professionals as gatekeepers of their respective specialty and subspecialty disciplines whose mission includes protecting, maintaining, and improving the publics health.

Questions/Purposes: Our goal was to identify COVID-19-related stressors that patients associated with worsening rheumatic disease symptoms. Methods: With approval of their rheumatologists, patients at an academic medical center were interviewed with open-ended questions about the impact of COVID-19 on daily life. Responses were analyzed with qualitative methods using grounded theory and a comparative analytic approach to generate categories of stressors. Results: Of 112 patients enrolled (mean age 50 years, 86% women, 34% non-white or Latino, 30% with lupus, 26% with rheumatoid arthritis), 2 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients reported that coping with challenges due to the pandemic both directly and indirectly worsened their rheumatic disease symptoms. Categories associated with direct effects were increased fatigue (i.e., from multitasking, physical work, and taking precautions to avoid infection) and worsening musculoskeletal and cognitive function. Categories associated with indirect effects were psychological worry (i.e., about contracting SARS-COV-2, altering medications, impact on family, and impact on job and finances) and psychological stress (i.e., at work, at home, from non-routine family responsibilities, about uncertainty related to SARS-CoV-2, and from the media). Patients often reported several effects coalesced in causing more rheumatic disease symptoms. Conclusion: Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with rheumatic disease-related physical and psychological effects, even among patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2.

The aim of this paper is to model the effect of ionic and macromolecular solutes on droplet drying and solute concentration. METHODS: Deliquescence-efflorescence concepts and Kohler theory were used to simulate the evolution of solute concentrations and water activity in respiratory droplets, starting from efflorescence data on mixed NaCl/KCl aerosols and osmotic pressure data on respiratory macromolecules. RESULTS: In NaCl/KCl solutions total salt concentrations were shown to reach 10-13 M at the efflorescence RH of 40-55%, depending on the K:Na ratio. Dependence on K:Na ratio implies that the evaporation curves differ between aerosols derived from saliva and from airway surfaces. The direct effect of liquid droplet size through the Kelvin term was shown to be smaller and restricted to the evolution of breath emissions. Modelling the effect of proteins and glycoproteins showed that salts determine drying equilibria down to the efflorescence RH, and macromolecules at lower RH. CONCLUSION: Differences in solute composition between airway surfaces and saliva are predicted to lead to different drying behaviour of droplets emitted by breathing, speech and coughing. These differences may influence the inactivation of viruses.","output":"Drying of virus-containing particles: modelling effects of droplet origin and composition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The viral epidemic caused by the new Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the new Coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19).

To this end, patients are identified as a key stakeholder of the healthcare decision making process, instead of passively following their doctor's guidance. As this joint decision-making process requires constant and high-quality communication between the patient and his/her healthcare providers, novel methodologies and tools have been proposed to promote richer and preemptive communication to facilitate earlier recognition of potential complications.

This infection was first reported in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, and afterward, it became a global pandemic spreading rapidly around the world. As the virus spreads through human to human contact, it has affected our lives in a devastating way, including the vigorous pressure on the public health system, the world economy, education sector, workplaces, and shopping malls. Preventing viral spreading requires early detection of positive cases and to treat infected patients as quickly as possible. The need for COVID-19 testing kits has increased, and many of the developing countries in the world are facing a shortage of testing kits as new cases are increasing day by day. In this situation, the recent research using radiology imaging (such as X-ray and CT scan) techniques can be proven helpful to detect COVID-19 as X-ray and CT scan images provide important information about the disease caused by COVID-19 virus. The latest data mining and machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be applied along with X-ray and CT scan images of the lungs for the accurate and rapid detection of the disease, assisting in mitigating the problem of scarcity of testing kits. Methods: Hence a novel CNN model called CoroDet for automatic detection of COVID-19 by using raw chest X-ray and CT scan images have been proposed in this study. CoroDet is developed to serve as an accurate diagnostics for 2 class classification (COVID and Normal), 3 class classification (COVID, Normal, and non-COVID pneumonia), and 4 class classification (COVID, Normal, non-COVID viral pneumonia, and non-COVID bacterial pneumonia). Results: The performance of our proposed model was compared with ten existing techniques for COVID detection in terms of accuracy. A classification accuracy of 99.1% for 2 class classification, 94.2% for 3 class classification, and 91.2% for 4 class classification was produced by our proposed model, which is obviously better than the state-of-the-art-methods used for COVID-19 detection to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the dataset with x-ray images that we prepared for the evaluation of our method is the largest datasets for COVID detection as far as our knowledge goes. Conclusion:The experimental results of our proposed method CoroDet indicate the superiority of CoroDet over the existing state-of-the-art-methods.

Based on experimental data, a recent study suggested that the influenza virus could promote SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. A previous study reported that influenza A virus inhibits RSV replication in an animal model. Another recent study revealed that although the replication of rhinovirus is not affected by SARS-CoV-2, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by rhinovirus, indicating that rhinovirus infection protects against SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are required to confirm these findings and evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the activity of these viruses.","output":"The Importance of Monitoring Viral Respiratory Infections During the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Presently the world is witnessing most devastating pandemic in the history of mankind caused due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS-CoV-2.

If initial-onset VKH is treated early and relentlessly the disease can be controlled and even cured in a substantial number of cases. We are reporting on a patient treated early and in a sustained fashion who was inflammation free for seven years but who presented a reactivation 6 weeks after the second dose of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old woman presented with severe initial-onset VKH disease which was brought under control using steroidal and non-steroidal Immunosuppression (mycophenolic acid and cyclosporine) with additional infliximab infusions because of the persistence of subclinical choroiditis identified on ICGA. Under infliximab alone disease had been inflammation free with no subclinical disease and absence of sunset glow fundus for 6 years. However, following anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, severe resurgence of the disease occurred with exudative retinal detachments. Disease was rapidly brought again under control with oral prednisone (1 mg/kg) therapy and a new loading scheme of infliximab therapy. CONCLUSION: VKH disease results from an autoimmune process directed against melanocyte associated antigens which can be controlled when early and sustained immunosuppressive treatment is introduced. It seems that anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can be at the origin of reactivation of long-time controlled disease.","output":"Reactivation of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease under control for more than 6 years, following anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the relationship between attachment style and fear of contamination during the COVID-19 pandemic, hypothesizing that anxiously attached participants would be more distressed when their safe space was threatened by someone leaving and returning.

Here, we analyzed the development of resistance to miltefosine upon experimental selection in a L. infantum strain. Time to miltefosine resistance emergence was ~six months and label-free quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomics analyses revealed that this process involves a remodeling of components of the membrane and mitochondrion, with significant increase in oxidative phosphorylation complexes, particularly on complex IV and ATP synthase, accompanied by increased energy metabolism mainly dependent on ?-oxidation of fatty acids. Proteins canonically involved in ROS detoxification did not contribute to the resistant process whereas sterol biosynthesis enzymes could have a role in this development. Furthermore, changes in the abundance of proteins known to be involved in miltefosine resistance such as ABC transporters and phospholipid transport ATPase were detected.

DESIGN: We performed a laboratory study to assess the ability of 2 commercially available portable GUV devices to inactivate 2 common cold coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on the surface of whole N95 respirators and coupons cut from those respirators. We experimentally contaminated N95 respirators with coronavirus cultures and then assessed viral inactivation after GUV exposure by plaque assay, the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay, and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: We found that GUV could efficiently inactivate coronaviruses on the surface of N95 masks, with an average reduction in viral titers of 5-log for HCoV-229E, 3-log for HCoV-OC43, and 5-log for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the GUV susceptibility of HCoV-229E was similar on coupons and whole N95 respirators. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that diverse human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, are susceptible to GUV inactivation, and 2 scalable portable GUV devices were effective in inactivating coronaviruses on N95 respirators.

He rarely experienced mild akathisia-like symptoms on his feet before the diagnosis. The patient claimed that he exhibited mild degradation of the symptoms in the previous cisplatin (CDDP) + PEM treatment without the need for pharmacotherapy. Symptoms notably worsened approximately 7 days after the first cycle of CBDCA + PEM and did not disappear. Furthermore, symptoms worsened during the daytime and became milder at night.

We decided to administer 75 mg pregabalin twice daily, resulting in significant symptom improvement. He also complained that he felt the symptoms 10 h after the previous pregabalin dose, suggesting that pregabalin was effective, and its effect weakened or disappeared as time progressed.

Evidence suggests that even in low-level air pollution environments there is a risk for an increase in adverse respiratory symptoms. We examined whether variations in daily air pollution levels of nitrogen dioxide, ozone, or particulate matter in Berlin, Germany were associated with hospital admissions of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma patients in a time series analysis. METHODS: We calculated single and multi-pollutant models, investigated possible lags in effect, and analysed the influence of meteorological variables on the results. Data from January 2005 through December 2015 were used to quantify the concentrationCresponse. RESULTS: The risk ratio for asthma patients to be hospitalised on the same day of NO(2) exposure was 1.101 per 10 g/m(3) NO(2) increase (95% CI: 1.013 to 1.195), for COPD patients 1.123 (95% CI: 1.081 to 1.168). Neither the exposure to ozone (95% CI: 0.904 to 1.020), PM(10) (95% CI: 0.990 to 1.127), nor PM(2.5) (95% CI: 0.981 to 1.148) was associated with an increased risk ratio for asthma patients to be hospitalised. Risk ratios for the hospital admission of COPD patients were also not increased due to ozone (95% CI: 0.981 to 1.033), PM(10) (95% CI: 0.988 to 1.032), or PM(2.5) (95% CI: 0.966 to 1.019) exposure.

The present study aimed to investigate the influence of socio-demographic factors on HSB among Bangladeshi residents during the first wave of COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was performed with Bangladeshi residents (60% male and 40% female; age range: 10C60 years or above) from May to July 2020. Information was collected from the participants who resided in slum areas or did not have internet access through face-to-face surveys, maintaining spatial distancing and proper preventive measures. A self-reported and structured questionnaire, including socio-demographic and HSB, was undertaken, and the data was analyzed using a convenience sampling method. Finally, among the 947 participants, 20 were selected using a stratified random sampling technique for in-depth-interview (IDI). The linear regression analysis was performed to determine the influence of socio-demographic factors on HSB. Results: Only about 4.2% of respondents did not wear masks, but nearly half of the participants (46.6%) did not use hand gloves. The mean score of HSB was 9.98 (SD = 2.01) out of 16, with a correct overall rate of 62.4%. As per regression analysis, higher HSBs were found among participants who reported older age (>50 years) (9.96  2.45), educated unemployed students (10.1  1.95), higher education (10.5  1.76), and higher-income (10.4  1.59); in contrast, participants living in slum areas (8.18  2.34) and whose source of income was business (8.46  2.04) exhibited lower HSBs. Females, compared to men, showed better HSB in every aspect, apart from online food ordering. Qualitative data showed that the younger generation is more aware because of their access to information and persuaded the older generations to follow health-seeking protocols. The results also showed that some lower-income slum-dwellers have access to information and healthcare through their employers. IDIs also found cultural, religious, and mental-health affect peoples adherence to health-seeking guidelines and regulations. Conclusions: The findings suggest that socio-demographic factors significantly influenced HSBs during COVID-19 in the Bangladeshi population.

Nevertheless, many of them still depend on health care assistance to manage their illnesses. Patient portals are used to provide continued health care (remotely) and offer self-management tools during COVID-19 and potentially after. However, little is known about the factors influencing portal use and users satisfaction among patients who are chronically ill during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine predictors of patient portal use among patients who are chronically ill, the willingness to recommend the portal to others, and the likelihood of future use among portal nonusers. METHODS: An online self-administered questionnaire was distributed among patients who are chronically ill via social media in May 2020. The questionnaire consisted of four parts: (1) demographics including age and hours of daily internet use; (2) physical health status including COVID-19 infection, perceived level of control, and hospital visits; (3) mental health status including depression and life satisfaction; and (4) portal use including response waiting time and awareness. Descriptive, correlation, univariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors that affect portal use, users willingness to recommend, and nonusers likelihood of future portal use. RESULTS: A total of 652 patients responded, and 461 valid questionnaires were included. Among the 461 patients, 67% (n=307) were identified as patient portal users. Of the nonusers, 55% (85/154) reported not being aware of the existence of a patient portal at their hospital. Significant predictors of portal use include level of control (P=.04), hospital visit time (P=.03), depression scale (P=.03), and status of life satisfaction (P=.02). Among portal users, waiting time to get a response via the portal (P<.001) and maximum acceptable waiting time (P<.001) were the strongest predictors for willingness to recommend the portal; among nonusers, the model predicted that those who were not aware of patient portals (P<.001) and were willing to wait moderately long (P<.001) were most likely to use the portal in the future. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into factors that influence portal use and willingness to recommend, based on which health care providers can improve the adoption of patient portals and their services. It suggests that health care providers should leverage efficient operations management to improve responsiveness and reduce waiting time to enhance user satisfaction and willingness to recommend use. Health care organizations need to increase portal awareness among nonusers and train their patients to increase both use and longer adoption of patient portals. Factors including depression and life satisfaction can influence portal use; therefore, future studies on determinants of portal use and nonuse in this specific population are needed.","output":"Factors Affecting Portal Usage Among Chronically Ill Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Netherlands: Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer immunotherapy has dramatically changed the approach to cancer treatment.

We investigated how IAV may increase the risk for COVID-19 lung disease, focusing on the receptor Angiotensin Convertase Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the protease TMPRSS2, which cooperate to uptake SARS-CoV-2 intracellular. We found, using single cell RNA sequencing of distal human non-diseased lung homogenates, that at baseline, ACE2 is minimally expressed in basal, goblet, ciliated, and secretory epithelial cells populating small airways. We focused on human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC), central to the pathogenesis of lung injury following viral infections. Primary SAEC from non-diseased donor lungs apically infected (at air-liquid interface) with IAV (up to 3105a? pfu; a??1 MOI) markedly (8-fold) boosted the expression of ACE2, paralleling that of STAT1, a transcription factor activated by viruses. IAV increased the apparent electrophoretic mobility of intrac?ellular ACE2 and generated an ACE2 fragment (90a? kDa) in apical secretions, suggesting cleavage of this receptor. IAV also increased the expression of two proteases known to cleave ACE2, sheddase ADAM17 (TACE) and TMPRSS2 and increased the TMPRSS2 zymogen and its mature fragments, implicating proteolytic autoactivation. These results indicate that IAV amplifies the expression of molecules necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the distal lung. Further, posttranslational changes in ACE2 by IAV may increase the vulnerability to lung injury such as ARDS during viral co-infections. These findings support prevention and treatment efforts of influenza infections during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Influenza virus infection increases ACE2 expression and shedding in human small airway epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With reduced community mobility, household infections may become increasingly important in SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. METHODS: We investigate the intra-household transmission of COVID-19 through the secondary-attack rate (SAR) and household reproduction number (R(h)). We estimate these using (i) data from 29 prior studies (FebruaryCAugust 2020), (ii) epidemiologically linked confirmed cases from Singapore (JanuaryCApril 2020) and (iii) widespread-testing data from Vo (FebruaryCMarch 2020). For (i), we use a Bayesian random-effects model that corrects for reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction (RTCPCR) test sensitivity and asymptomatic cases. We investigate the robustness of R(h) with respect to community transmission rates and mobility patterns. RESULTS: The corrected pooled estimates from prior studies for SAR and R(h) are 24% (20C28%) and 0.34 (0.30C0.38), respectively. Without corrections, the pooled estimates are: SAR = 18% (14C21%) and R(h) = 0.28 (0.25C0.32). The corrected estimates line up with direct estimates from contact-tracing data from Singapore [R(h) = 0.32 (0.22C0.42)] and population testing data from Vo [SAR = 31% (28C34%) and R(h) = 0.37 (0.34C0.40)]. The analysis of Singapore data further suggests that the value of R(h) (0.22C0.42) is robust to community-spread dynamics; our estimate of R(h) stays constant whereas the fraction of infections attributable to household transmission (R(h)/R(eff)) is lowest during outbreaks (5C7%) and highest during lockdowns and periods of low community spread (25C30%). CONCLUSIONS: The three data-source types yield broadly consistent estimates for SAR and R(h). Our study suggests that household infections are responsible for a large fraction of infections and so household transmission may be an effective target for intervention.","output":"Constructing and adjusting estimates for household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from prior studies, widespread-testing and contact-tracing data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we document 47,381 individuals from 38 species, including 31 protected species sold between May 2017 and November 2019 in Wuhans markets.

The ED encounter represents a missed opportunity to initiate medication assisted treatment (MAT) for patients with AUD. The aims of this study are to identify barriers and facilitators to the treatment of AUD in the ED, and to design interventions to address identified barriers. METHODS: Using an implementation science approach based on the Behavior Change Wheel framework, we conducted qualitative interviews with staff to interrogate their perspectives on ED initiation of AUD treatment. Subjects included physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, clinical social workers, and pharmacists. Interviews were thematically coded using both inductive and deductive approaches and constant comparative analysis. Themes were further categorized as relating to providers capabilities, opportunities, or motivations. Barriers were then mapped to corresponding intervention functions. RESULTS: Facilitators at our institution included time allotted for continuing education, the availability of clinical social workers, and favorable opinions of MAT based on previous experiences implementing buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Capability barriers included limited familiarity with naltrexone and difficulty determining which patients are candidates for therapy. Opportunity barriers included the limited supply of naltrexone and a lack of clarity as to who should introduce naltrexone and assess readiness for change. Motivation barriers included a sense of futility in treating patients with AUD and stigmas associated with alcohol use. Evidence-based interventions included multi-modal provider education, a standardized treatment algorithm and order set, selection of clinical champions, and clarification of roles among providers on the team. CONCLUSIONS: A large evidence-practice gap exists for the treatment of AUD with Naltrexone, and the ED visit is a missed opportunity for intervention. ED providers are optimistic about implementing AUD treatment in the ED but described many barriers, especially related to knowledge, clarification of roles, and stigma associated with AUD. Applying a formal implementation science approach guided by the Behavior Change Wheel allowed us to transform qualitative interview data into evidence-based interventions for the implementation of an ED-based program for the treatment of AUD.

Responses to COVID-19 have varied in intensity and breadth, but generally have included domestic and international travel limitations, closure of non-essential businesses, and repurposing of health services. While these interventions have focused on testing, treatment, and mitigation of COVID-19, there have been reports of interruptions to diagnostic, prevention, and treatment services for other public health threats. We conducted a scoping review to characterize the impact of COVID-19 on HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, sexual and reproductive health, and malnutrition. METHODS: A scoping literature review was completed using searches of PubMed and preprint servers (medRxiv/bioRxiv) from January 1(st) to October 31(st), 2020, using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms related to SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 and HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, sexual and reproductive health, and malnutrition. Empiric studies reporting original data collection and mathematical models were included, and available data synthesized by region. Studies were excluded if they were not written in English. RESULTS: A total of 1604 published papers and 205 preprints met inclusion criteria, including 8.2% (132/1604) of published studies and 10.2% (21/205) of preprints: 7.3% (68/931) on HIV, 7.1% (24/339) on tuberculosis, 11.6% (26/224) on malaria, 7.8% (13/166) on sexual and reproductive health, and 12.1% (16/132) on malnutrition. Thematic results were similar across competing health risks, with substantial indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and response on diagnostic, prevention, and treatment services for HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, sexual and reproductive health, and malnutrition. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 emerged in the context of existing public health threats that result in millions of deaths every year. Thus, effectively responding to COVID-19 while minimizing the negative impacts of COVID-19 necessitates innovation and integration of existing programs that are often siloed across health systems. Inequities have been a consistent driver of existing health threats; COVID-19 has worsened disparities, reinforcing the need for programs that address structural risks.

The main results are the following: first, higher lump-sum targeted fiscal transfers to HTM households and public consumption spending in one region, financed by issuing public debt, reduce the recessionary effects both domestically and abroad (via the trade channel). Second, the monetary union-wide recession is mitigated more effectively if both regions implement a fiscal expansion and the central bank limits the increase in long-term rates by purchasing sovereign bonds. Third, fiscal measures are less effective if sovereign bond yields increase relatively more in one region because investors perceive its bonds as risky.

Abnormal liver tests, mainly transaminase elevations, have been reported in hospitalized patients. We describe a syndrome of cholangiopathy in patients recovering from severe COVID-19 characterized by marked elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) accompanied by evidence of bile duct injury on imaging. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted to our institution from March 1, 2020, to August 15, 2020, on whom the hepatology service was consulted for abnormal liver tests. Bile duct injury was identified by abnormal liver tests with serum ALP > 3x upper limit of normal and abnormal findings on magnetic resonance cholangiopacreatography. Clinical, laboratory, radiological, and histological findings were recorded in a Research Electronic Data Capture database. RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified, 11 men and 1 woman, with a mean age of 58 years. Mean time from COVID-19 diagnosis to diagnosis of cholangiopathy was 118 days. Peak median serum alanine aminotransferase was 661 U/L and peak median serum ALP was 1855 U/L. Marked elevations of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and D-dimers were common. Magnetic resonance cholangiopacreatography findings included beading of intrahepatic ducts (11/12, 92%), bile duct wall thickening with enhancement (7/12, 58%), and peribiliary diffusion high signal (10/12, 83%). Liver biopsy in 4 patients showed acute and/or chronic large duct obstruction without clear bile duct loss. Progressive biliary tract damage has been demonstrated radiographically.

Forty-eight clinical and laboratory features were screened with LASSO method. Further multi-tree extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning-based model was used to rank importance of features selected from LASSO and subsequently constructed death risk prediction model with simple-tree XGBoost model. Performances of models were evaluated by AUC, prediction accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. RESULTS: Six features, including disease severity, age, levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and interleukin-10 (IL-10), were selected as predictors for COVID-19 mortality. Simple-tree XGBoost model conducted by these features can predict death risk accurately with >90% precision and >85% sensitivity, as well as F1 scores >0.90 in training and validation sets.

As per hospital guidelines, the patient was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate 625mg three times daily and doxycycline 100mg once daily. Hydroxycholoroquine was not given in view of G6PD deficiency. There was no evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis and a short-acting insulin sliding scale was initiated at 2U/hr. Continuous positive pressure ventilation was offered for next 72 hours, however the patient failed to improve and required transfer to intensive care unit for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Computer tomography scan of pulmonary artery excluded embolism. The patient was fed via nasogastric tube post intubation. On day 8, the patient experienced a sudden drop in haemoglobin levels from 132 g/dl on day 1 to 68 g/dl, requiring multiple blood transfusions. The blood results demonstrated evidence of haemolysis with a rise in total and direct bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The peripheral blood smear showed numerous bite cells with polychromasia suggesting an acute haemolytic crisis in the context of G6PD deficiency. A medication review revealed no evidence of drug-induced haemolysis. Later the patient was started on dexamethasone 6mg once daily (day 11) and on remdesivir 100mg once daily (day 15). During this time, the patients insulin infusion requirements had progressively increased from 2U/hr to 8U/hr (equivalent to 192 units/24 hr). On day 22, the patients clinical condition deteriorated with septicaemia requiring extended course of antibiotics. At this time, continuous insulin infusion was stopped and intermediate acting insulin (insulatard 36U twice daily;later increased to 48U twice daily) was started. In the next 10 days, the patient made good clinical recovery from sepsis with stable haemoglobin and blood sugar levels. He was extubated and transferred for rehabilitation.

We evaluated mortality predictors of COVID\\\\19 in a large cohort of hospitalized patients in the US. DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter cohort of inpatients diagnosed with COVID\\\\19 by RT\\\\PCR from March 1\\\\April 1,2020 was performed, and outcome data evaluated from March 1\\\\April 17, 2020. Measures included demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, laboratory values, and imaging on admission. Primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, time to death, and development of acute kidney injury in the first 48\\\\hours. RESULTS: 1305 patients were hospitalized during the evaluation period. Mean age was 61.016.3, 53.8% were male and 66.1% African\\\\American. Mean BMI was 33.28.8 kg/m2. Median Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 2 (1\\\\4), 72.6% of patients had at least one comorbidity, with hypertension (56.2%) and diabetes mellitus (30.1%) being the most prevalent. ACE\\\\I/ARB use and NSAIDs use were widely prevalent (43.3% and 35.7% respectively). Mortality occurred in 200 (15.3%) of patients with median time of 10 (6\\\\14) days.

Purpose To describe the time course and severity of findings of COVID-19 at chest radiography and correlate these with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, nucleic acid. Materials and Methods This is a retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 confirmed by using RT-PCR and chest radiographic examinations who were admitted across four hospitals and evaluated between January and March 2020. Baseline and serial chest radiographs (n = 255) were reviewed with RT-PCR. Correlation with concurrent CT examinations (n = 28) was performed when available. Two radiologists scored each chest radiograph in consensus for consolidation, ground-glass opacity, location, and pleural fluid. A severity index was determined for each lung. The lung scores were summed to produce the final severity score. Results The study was composed of 64 patients (26 men; mean age, 56 years  19 [standard deviation]). Of these, 58 patients had initial positive findings with RT-PCR (91%; 95% confidence interval: 81%, 96%), 44 patients had abnormal findings at baseline chest radiography (69%; 95% confidence interval: 56%, 80%), and 38 patients had initial positive findings with RT-PCR testing and abnormal findings at baseline chest radiography (59%; 95% confidence interval: 46%, 71%). Six patients (9%) showed abnormalities at chest radiography before eventually testing positive for COVID-19 with RT-PCR. Sensitivity of initial RT-PCR (91%; 95% confidence interval: 83%, 97%) was higher than that of baseline chest radiography (69%; 95% confidence interval: 56%, 80%) (P = .009). Radiographic recovery (mean, 6 days  5) and virologic recovery (mean, 8 days  6) were not significantly different (P = .33). Consolidation was the most common finding (30 of 64; 47%) followed by ground-glass opacities (21 of 64; 33%). Abnormalities at chest radiography had a peripheral distribution (26 of 64; 41%) and lower zone distribution (32 of 64; 50%) with bilateral involvement (32 of 64; 50%).

INTRODUCTION: The epidemic of pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus rapidly spread all over the world. World Health Organization called the condition as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 has become a life-threatening public health emergency internationally. COVID-19 mostly presents by respiratory tract symptoms including fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. The disease progression causes pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pathophisyology of cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 have not been well known yet. Myocardial dysfunction may occur in cytokine-originated immune reactions. Myocardial performance index (MPI) is a feasible parameter that reflects systolic and diastolic cardiac functions. PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the MPI in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The study consisted of 40 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who had mild pneumonia and had not needed intensive care treatment. Transthoracic echocardiographic examination was performed in all patients at the acute stage of infection and after clinical recovery. The average time interval between the baseline and recovery echocardiography exam was about 28  3,4 days. Blood samples were studied on day 0 and on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. Immunofluorescence assay was used for COVID-19 antibody titers. Respiratory secretions were sent for RT-PCR tests. RESULTS: The mean age was 54  11 years ( male 26 (65% ) ). Statistically significant higher MPI (0.56  0.09 versus 0.44  0.07, p < 0.001), longer isovolumic relaxation time (112.3  13.4 versus 91.8  12.1ms, p < 0.001), longer deceleration time (182.1  30.6 versus 161.5  43.5ms, p = 0.003), shorter ejection time (279.6  20.3 versus 298.8  36.8ms, p < 0.001) and higher E/A ratio (1.53  0.7 versus 1.22  0.4, p < 0.001), were observed during acute period of infection compared to ones after clinical recovery. Compared with basal values, no significant change in left ventricular systolic ejection fraction was observed after clinical recovery (60.3 3.2% versus 61.7  2.4%, p > 0.05). Isovolumic contraction time was similar at acute infection and after clinical recovery ( 44.3  7.8 versus 40.6  9.7ms, p > 0.05) CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study suggests global reversible LV dysfunction in COVID-19 patients with preserved LV systolic function based on tissue Doppler derived MPI. This could be due to isolated subclinical diastolic dysfunction. To our knowledge, this study is the first echocardiographic follow-up study that evaluated the systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle in COVID -19 patients. The underlying mechanism and its clinical significance can be established by further studies.","output":"The evaluation of myocardial performance index in patients with COVID-19: An echocardiographic follow-up study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction As the COVID-19 pandemic spread throughout the world, it was seen that patients who presented with critical disease had a higher incidence of thrombotic complications, associated with a poor prognosis. Currently prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended for all patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization as part of the supportive management. However, since a higher incidence of thrombosis despite prophylactic anticoagulation has been reported, some recommendations indicate that an increase to intermediate or therapeutic dosing should be considered. The full spectrum of complications and outcomes related to this strategy are still unknown. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study using the COVID-19 registry of the ARMII study group, based in Centro Medico ABC, a private hospital in Mexico City. We included all patients admitted from March 12 to July 31, 2020, who received prophylactic anticoagulation at standard (enoxaparin 40mg QD), intermediate (0.5 mg/kg QD or 40 mg BID), or therapeutic doses (1mg/kg BID), a decision taken by the attending physician based on clinical and laboratory criteria. Patients with previous or presenting with thrombosis were excluded. We compared the three groups to identify baseline characteristics and conducted multivariable logistic regressions to measure the association of anticoagulation profiles and adverse outcomes. Results Out of total 322 patients, we identified 81 (25%) who received standard dose, 164 (51%) who received intermediate and 77 (24%) on therapeutic doses. Age and sex were distribuited similarly among groups; patients with intermediate and therapeutic doses were more overweight and obese, but this was not significant (p=0.052). On admission, patients who received intermediate and therapeutic doses had lower oximetry registry when compared with standard doses (89%, 88% and 92% respectively, p=0.008). Three severity scales, NEWS, MULBSTA and CALL, were higher in patients with intermediate and therapeutic doses (p=0.01, p=0.02 and p=0.005, respectively). Regarding laboratory values, patients on therapeutic doses had higher leucocytes on admission (median 6 x 109L, 6 and 8, p=0.05) but lower lymphocyte absolute counts (median 1240 cells/mm3, 935 and 920, p<0.001). Patients who were given higher doses of anticoagulation had higher levels of C-reactive protein, DHL, and ferritin (p<0.001) and higher levels of IL-6 (p=0.02). Levels of D-dimer were also higher in this group (p<0.001). Patients with therapeutic doses of anticoagulation were more likely to present major bleeding when compared to intermediate or standard prophylactic doses (9% vs 1% vs 0%, p=0.0006) and clinically relevant bleeding (12% vs 2% vs 5%, p=0.01). (Table 1) The incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the entire cohort was 5%, while the incidence of major bleeding was 2.5%. There were no differences between the different doses of anticoagulation; no patients presented deep venous thrombosis. During follow-up, a total of 21 patients died, representing 6.5% of the study population. Independent factors that predicted death included age, CRP and D-dimer levels on admission, history of hypertension and requirement of mechanical invasive ventilation. When adjusting for these confounders, therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with a lower risk of death (OR 0.079 95% CI 0.008-0.76). When restricting the analysis for patients who required mechanical ventilation, anticoagulation was also associated with a lower risk of death (OR 0.031 95% CI 0.002-0.54) but not for intermediate doses (OR 0.10 95% CI 0.01-1.06). (Figure 1) Conclusions Anticoagulation might not play a causal role in the risk of requiring mechanical ventilation, but the decision to increase doses might reflect patients who present with more severe disease. In our cohort, the majority of the patients were receiving intermediate prophylactic doses and the incidence of PE is lower than in worldwide reports. Therapeutic doses of anticoagulation were not associated with a lower risk of PE, but were associated with lower risk of death. However, therapeutic doses were also associated with a higher risk of major and clinically significant bleeding. Randomized-controlled clinical trials are needed to understand the role of higher doses of prophylactic anticoagulation in COVID-19.

Methods used included analysis of systematic reviews from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Results. Promising measures for reducing mortality in Russia include promoting healthy behaviour (tobacco control, alcohol control, support for healthy diet, physical activity) and preventing death due to external causes. It is necessary to increase the effectiveness of disease management, including arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular accidents, hepatitis C, HIV. This could require intensifying digital transformation of health care, implementing modern teamwork approaches to the patients treatment and follow-up with greater involvement of nurses and other personnel. In terms of screening, it is essential to expand coverage and introduce modern, effective screening methods for colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, and neonatal screening. It is necessary to expand vaccination against COVID-19, vaccination of the elderly from Pneumococcus, and teenagers from HPV. Prevention of mortality from external causes should include sets of measures targeted at the prevention of suicides, traffic accidents, fires, drownings, etc., in addition to alcohol control measures. Finally, increasing health care financing, including medication provision, can bring additional years of life. Conclusions.

The MoS(2) sheets were prepared by hydrothermal method followed by an in situ growth of Au film onto the MoS(2)/FTO surface. Self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of cysteamine was synthesized onto the Au/MoS(2)/FTO which acts as a linker to covalently bind Ab-25(OH)D(3). The Ab-25(OH)D(3)-immobilized Cys/Au/MoS(2)/FTO was used to detect 25(OH)D(3) using differential pulse voltammetry. The electrochemical system provided an anodic peak current at a potential of +0.21 V vs. Ag/AgCl (satd. KCl) of ferricyanide/ferrocyanide redox couple. The detection principle relies on the inhibition of electron transfer at the electrode surface owing to the hindrance caused by the formation of immune complex between Ab-25(OH)D(3) and 25(OH)D(3).

METHODS: Adenoid samples and middle ear washes (MEW) were obtained from children with OME associated with adenoid hypertrophy undergoing adenoidectomy and tympanostomy, and compared to those obtained from patients undergoing cochlear implant surgery, as a control group. Specific DNA or RNA of 9 respiratory viruses (rhinovirus, influenza virus, picornavirus, syncytial respiratory virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, adenovirus and bocavirus) and 5 bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus) were extracted and quantified by real-time PCR. RESULTS: 37 OME and 14 cochlear implant children were included in the study. At the adenoid, virus and bacteria were similarly detected in both OME and control patients. At the middle ear washes, however, a higher prevalence of bacteria was observed in patients with OME (p = 0.01). S. pneumoniae (p = 0.01) and M. catarrhalis (p = 0.022) were the bacteria responsible for this difference. Although total virus detection was not statistically different from controls at the middle ear washes (p = 0.065), adenovirus was detected in higher proportions in adenoid samples of OME patients than controls (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Despite both OME and control patients presented similar rates of viruses and bacteria at the adenoid, children with OME presented higher prevalence of S. pneumonia, M. catarrhalis in middle ear and adenovirus in adenoids when compared to controls.

It is transmitted from direct inhalational exposure and bites from infected ticks, rabbits, rodents, birds, or domestic animals. About 200 cases of human tularemia are reported each year in the United States. We report an unusual case of tularemia without any known exposure with a recent Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection with an overlap of symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: A healthy 22 years old male with an uncomplicated COVID-19 infection a month ago presented with fever, nausea, vomiting for a week and a resolving inguinal rash with no recent travel, sick contacts, occupational or animal exposures. On admission, he was febrile up to 103.4, tachycardiac and tachypneic with coarse breath sounds in bilateral lungs, right cervical adenopathy without any rash or erythema on the skin. His initial labs were WBC 16.6 k/mcl, platelets 154 k/mcl, elevated inflammatory markers (ESR 64mm/hr, CRP 164mg/ml), mild transaminitis (AST/ALT 43/89 uL), negative COVID-19 PCR, initial troponin of 1.6 which peaked to 3.6 and a procalcitonin 12.6. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, a chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed bilateral basilar heterogenous opacities, echocardiography showed regional wall motion abnormalities with preserved ejection fraction and right internal jugular vein thrombosis on the upper extremity doppler ultrasound. On hospital day 2, he developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure and septic shock requiring mechanical ventilation. Initial differential diagnosis was concerning for acute viral illness, viral myocarditis, murine typhus, bacterial pneumonia, and COVID-19 inflammatory syndrome. A complete viral and autoimmune workup was negative except for a positive Francisella tularemia antibody. He completed 10 days of oral doxycycline and was discharged home on room air on three months of rivaroxaban. DISCUSSION: Pneumonic tularemia presents with initial non-specific symptoms followed by fever, chest pain, productive cough with nodular infiltrates with pleural effusion on imaging, it can be challenging to diagnose with overlapping symptoms with COVID-19. In our case, the initial history and imaging findings could have been consistent with viral myocarditis and post COVID-19 hypoxia.Yet, the ability to wean off oxygen and the rapid improvement in symptoms with initial treatment without steroids was more consistent with some other viral or bacterial etiology of disease. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with superimposed bacterial and fungal infections. Limited data is available on the covid-19 inflammatory syndrome with superimposed zoonotic infections. However, clinicians must be vigilant of other febrile illnesses and alternative diagnoses whose symptoms overlap with COVID-19. REFERENCE #1: Patel HM.

This study intended to examine the anti-inflammatory activity of cannabis on immune response markers associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) inflammation. An extract fraction from C. sativa Arbel strain (FCBD) substantially reduced (dose dependently) interleukin (IL)-6 and -8 levels in an alveolar epithelial (A549) cell line. FCBD contained cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG) and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), and multiple terpenes.

Treatment with FCBD induced macrophage (differentiated KG1 cell line) polarization and phagocytosis in vitro, and increased CD36 and type II receptor for the Fc region of IgG (Fc?3RII) expression. FCBD treatment also substantially increased IL-6 and IL-8 expression in macrophages. FCBD:std, while maintaining anti-inflammatory activity in alveolar epithelial cells, led to reduced phagocytosis and pro-inflammatory IL secretion in macrophages in comparison to FCBD. The phytocannabinoid formulation may show superior activity versus the cannabis-derived fraction for reduction of lung inflammation, yet there is a need of caution proposing cannabis as treatment for COVID-19.","output":"Cannabis compounds exhibit anti-inflammatory activity in vitro in COVID-19-related inflammation in lung epithelial cells and pro-inflammatory activity in macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides a historical framework on food safety for more contemporary details to rest on, focusing primarily on the past 100 years or so (with a touch of ancient history) as particular issues that affect how the safety of the food we eat have been appreciated, have evolved or at times have been successfully dealt with, or have newly emerged or reemerged, in large part because of the impact of technology, trade, and travel.","output":"Perspectives in Foodborne Illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in drastic changes to the practice of medicine, requiring healthcare systems to find solutions to reduce the risk of infection.

The WHO recommended social distancing and human-to-human contact was discouraged to control the transmission. It has put many countries in a state of lockdown and sporting events (including the 2020 Olympics) have been affected. Participation in sports and exercise, typically regarded as healthy activities, were also debated. The local professional football leagues, governed by the Hong Kong Football Association, ultimately postponed all matches after much deliberation on the transmission risk for the spectators and on-field players. Large spectating crowds are well-known to be infectious hazards, but the infection risk for on-field players is less recognized. To address this question, we performed a small-scale investigation that showed, in a 90 min match, the average duration of close contact between players was 19 min and each player performed an average of 52 episodes of infection-risky behaviours. This suggests that the infection risk was high for the players, even without spectators. Aside from watching professionals exercise, many people opted to hike in the countryside during the weekends to avoid city crowds. This led to a widespread discussion on the issue of masked versus unmasked hiking. We performed a laboratory study to investigate the physiological effect of wearing a facemask during simulated hiking and found that it significantly elevated heart rate and perceived exertion. The clinical implication is that hikers need to realize masks increase the physiological burden, especially in those with multiple underlying comorbidities. Elite athletes, especially those training for the upcoming Olympics, needed to balance and reschedule their training regime since the risk of deconditioning versus the risk of infection was a genuine dilemma for themselves and their team. We described the multiple infection-control measures imposed by the national team training centre to help strike this balance.

The role of neddylation in enterovirus 71 (EV71) replication remains poorly defined. Here, we showed that the structural protein VP2 of EV71 can be modified by neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 (NEDD8) in an E3 ligase X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)-dependent manner. Mutagenesis and biochemical analyses mapped the neddylation site at lysine 69 (K69) of VP2 and demonstrated that neddylation reduced the stability of VP2. In agreement with the essential role of VP2 in viral replication, studies with EV71 reporter viruses with wild-type VP2 (enhanced green fluorescent protein [EGFP]-EV71) and a K69R mutant VP2 (EGFP-EV71-VP2 K69R) showed that abolishment of VP2 neddylation increased EV71 replication. In support of this finding, overexpression of NEDD8 significantly inhibited the replication of wild-type EV71 and EGFP-EV71, but not EGFP-EV71-VP2 K69R, whereas pharmacologic inhibition of neddylation with the NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 promoted the replication of EV71 in biologically relevant cell types. Our results thus support the notion that EV71 replication can be negatively regulated by host cellular and pathobiological cues through neddylation of VP2 protein. IMPORTANCE Neddylation is a ubiquitin-like posttranslational modification by conjugation of neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 (NEDD8) to specific proteins for regulation of their metabolism and biological activities. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that EV71 VP2 protein is neddylated at K69 residue to promote viral protein degradation and consequentially suppress multiplication of the virus. Our findings advance knowledge related to the roles of VP2 in EV71 virulence and the neddylation pathway in the host restriction of EV71 infection.","output":"Neddylation of Enterovirus 71 VP2 Protein Reduces Its Stability and Restricts Viral Replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUBJECTIVE: Skeletal muscle indexes are known to be one of the important prognostic indicators in many clinical situations.

We collected data of confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the epidemic in mainland China. We fitted a generalized linear model using city-level COVID-19 cases and severe cases as the outcome, and long-term average air pollutant levels as the exposure. Our analysis was adjusted using several variables, including a mobile phone dataset, covering human movement from Wuhan before the travel ban and movements within each city during the period of the emergency response. Other variables included smoking prevalence, climate data, socioeconomic data, education level, and number of hospital beds for 324 cities in China. After adjusting for human mobility and socioeconomic factors, we found an increase of 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.8%C52.0%), 32.3% (95% CI: 22.5%C42.4%), and 14.2% (7.9%C20.5%) in the number of COVID-19 cases for every 10-g/m(3) increase in long-term exposure to NO(2), PM(2.5), and PM(10), respectively.

Protecting healthcare workers including nurses against COVID-19 is crucial, and vaccination could be a viable future option. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a global challenge. Nurses, as a trustworthy and creditable source of vaccine-related information, may build public confidence in vaccination. Hence, research on vaccine hesitancy among nurses is warranted. OBJECTIVES: This study estimated nurses influenza vaccination behaviors and intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine when available, and examined their corresponding 5C psychological antecedents (confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility). To investigate the impact of COVID-19-related work demands, the mediation effects of work stress on the association between work demands and COVID-19 vaccination intention were also examined. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey SETTINGS: Nurses were invited to participate via the promotion of a professional nursing organization and by personal referrals during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong between mid-March and late April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 1,205 eligible nurses (mean age = 40.79, SD = 10.47; 90% being female) were included in the analyses. METHODS: Demographics, influenza vaccination, intention to have COVID-19 vaccine, the 5C vaccine hesitancy components, work stress and COVID-19-related work demands (insufficient supply of personal protective equipment, involvement in isolation rooms, and unfavorable attitudes towards workplace infection control policies) were reported in the survey. RESULTS: The influenza vaccine uptake rate and the proportion intending to take COVID-19 vaccine were 49% and 63%, respectively. Influenza vaccination was associated with working in public hospitals and all 5C constructs (more confidence, more collective responsibility and less complacency, constraints, and calculation), whereas stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention was associated with younger age, more confidence, less complacency and more collective responsibility. COVID-19-related demands were associated with greater work stress, and hence stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSION: The potential uptake rate of COVID-19 vaccine among nurses was suboptimal to achieve herd immunity. The 5C constructs were useful in predicting influenza vaccination and, to a lesser extent, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine. The uncertain attributes such as effectiveness, side effects, and effective duration of the COVID-19 vaccine may contribute to this discrepancy. With less work stress among nurses in the post-pandemic period, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine will likely drop. The 5C constructs should be infused in vaccination campaigns. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, the nursing profession may not be ready to accept it. More research work is needed to boost the uptake rate.

Objectives Assess the risk of contracting COVID-19 through exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via cash acting as a fomite in payment transactions. Methods A quantitative microbial risk assessment was conducted for a worst-case scenario assuming an infectious person at the onset of symptoms, when virion concentrations in coughed droplets are at their highest. This person then contaminates a banknote by coughing on it and immediately hands it over to another person, who might then be infected by transferring the virions with a finger from the contaminated banknote to a facial mucous membrane. The scenario considered transfer efficiency of virions on the banknote to fingertips when droplets were still wet and after having dried up and subsequently being touched by finger printing or rubbing the object. Results Accounting for the likelihood of the worst-case scenario to occur by considering 1) a local prevalence of 100 COVID-19 cases/100,000 persons, 2) a maximum of about 1/5th of infected persons transmit high virus loads and 3) the numbers of cash transactions/person/day, the risk of contracting COVID-19 via person-to-person cash transactions was estimated to be much lower than once per 39,000 days (107 years) for a single person. In the general populace, there will be a maximum of 2.6 expected cases/100,000 persons/day. The risk for a cashier at an average point of sale was estimated to be much less than once per 430 working days (21 months). Discussion The worst-case scenario is a rare event, therefore, for a single person, the risk of contracting COVID-19 via person-to-person cash transactions is very low.

The UPR is comprised of three signaling pathways activated downstream of the ER membrane proteins IRE1, ATF6, and PERK. Once activated, these proteins initiate transcriptional and translational signaling that functions to alleviate ER stress, adapt cellular physiology, and dictate cell fate. Imbalances in UPR signaling are implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous, etiologically-diverse diseases including many neurodegenerative diseases, protein misfolding diseases, diabetes, ischemic disorders, and cancer. This has led to significant interest in establishing pharmacologic strategies to selectively modulate IRE1, ATF6, or PERK signaling to both ameliorate pathologic imbalances in UPR signaling implicated in these different diseases, and to define the importance of the UPR in diverse cellular and organismal contexts. Recently, there has been significant progress in the identification and characterization of UPR modulating compounds, providing new opportunities to probe the pathologic and potentially therapeutic implications of UPR signaling in human disease. Here, we describe currently available UPR modulating compounds, specifically highlighting the strategies used for their discovery and specific advantages and disadvantages in their application for probing UPR function. Furthermore, we discuss lessons learned from the application of these compounds in cellular and in vivo models to identify favorable compound properties that can help drive the further translational development of selective UPR modulators for human disease.","output":"Small molecule strategies to harness the unfolded protein response: where do we go from here?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Analyze and evaluate the typical four medical alliances governance modes in China, and construct a set of medical alliances governance mode that adapt to the current status of medical resource allocation in China.

We aimed to investigate the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in health-care and non-health-care (eg, community) settings. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimum distance for avoiding person-to-person virus transmission and to assess the use of face masks and eye protection to prevent transmission of viruses. We obtained data for SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome from 21 standard WHO-specific and COVID-19-specific sources. We searched these data sources from database inception to May 3, 2020, with no restriction by language, for comparative studies and for contextual factors of acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and equity. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We did frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses and random-effects meta-regressions. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020177047. FINDINGS: Our search identified 172 observational studies across 16 countries and six continents, with no randomised controlled trials and 44 relevant comparative studies in health-care and non-health-care settings (n=25 697 patients). Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 m (n=10 736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 018, 95% CI 009 to 038; risk difference [RD] ?102%, 95% CI ?115 to ?75; moderate certainty); protection was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 202 per m; p(interaction)=0041; moderate certainty). Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 015, 95% CI 007 to 034, RD ?143%, ?159 to ?107; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12C16-layer cotton masks; p(interaction)=0090; posterior probability >95%, low certainty). Eye protection also was associated with less infection (n=3713; aOR 022, 95% CI 012 to 039, RD ?106%, 95% CI ?125 to ?77; low certainty). Unadjusted studies and subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings. INTERPRETATION: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 m or more and provide quantitative estimates for models and contact tracing to inform policy. Optimum use of face masks, respirators, and eye protection in public and health-care settings should be informed by these findings and contextual factors. Robust randomised trials are needed to better inform the evidence for these interventions, but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence might inform interim guidance.

Following caesarean delivery, bilateral uterine and non-uterine parasitic arteries were embolized with GS in the first four cases (GS group) and primarily with NBCA mixed with iodized oil in the subsequent eight cases (NBCA group). Procedure time for embolisation and hysterectomy and total blood loss were compared between the two groups using Welch's t-test. RESULTS Although procedure time for embolisation tended to be longer in the NBCA group than in the GS group (111  47 min versus 71  32 min, p=.11), that for hysterectomy was significantly reduced in the NBCA group when compared to the GS group (158  42 min versus 236  39 min, p=.02).

Infectious Diseases OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), often manifests a coagulopathy in severely ill patients, which may cause hemorrhage and/or thrombosis of varying severity. This report comprises the cases of 3 patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy who were evaluated with thromboelastography (TEG) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to enable personalized anticoagulant therapy. CASE REPORTS: Three patients presented with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, who developed thrombohemorrhagic coagulopathy. Case 1: A 72-year-old woman on long-term warfarin therapy for a history of venous thromboembolism developed a right upper lobe pulmonary embolus, despite an international normalized ratio of 6.4 and aPTT of 120.7 s. TEG enabled successful anticoagulation with heparin, and her pulmonary infarct was no longer present 2 weeks later. Case 2: A 55-year-old woman developed a rectus sheath hematoma while on heparin, and TEG demonstrated increased fibrinolysis despite COVID-19 patients more commonly undergoing fibrinolytic shutdown. Case 3: A 43-year-old woman had significant thrombus burden while severely hypocoagulable according to laboratory testing.

Additionally, the influence of SPECT/CT on patient management was evaluated. METHODS From October 2011 to October 2012, all gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm patients undergoing restaging with somatostatin receptor scintigraphy on a modern SPECT/CT device were enrolled in this study. The protocol consisted of planar imaging at 4, 24, and 48 h; low-dose SPECT/CT at 24 and 48 h; diagnostic CT at 24 h using a triple-phase delay after administration of contrast; and diagnostic SPECT/CT at 24 h. All components of the imaging data were reassessed by 3 masked interpreters. The results were compared with a reference standard based on all clinical, imaging, and histopathology follow-up data available (follow-up range, 24-36 mo; mean, 29.9 mo). The reference standard was defined by a study-specific interdisciplinary tumor board that also reassessed treatment decisions. RESULTS Thirty-one patients were eligible for analysis (18 men and 13 women; mean age, 60.4 y). Ten had no imaging signs of disease and remained disease-free during follow-up. Twenty-one had persistent or recurrent disease (82 lesions: 24 in the liver, 21 in the lymph nodes, 16 in bone, 12 in the pancreas, and 9 in other locations). The respective lesion detection rates for interpreters 1, 2, and 3 were 51.9%, 49.4%, and 71.6% for low-dose SPECT/CT at 24 h; 51.9%, 55.6%, and 67.9% for low-dose SPECT/CT at 48 h; 63.0%, 70.4%, and 85.2% for diagnostic CT; and 77.8%, 84.0%, and 88.9% for diagnostic SPECT/CT. Interobserver agreement was moderate for diagnostic SPECT/CT ( = 0.44), diagnostic CT ( = 0.43), low-dose SPECT/CT at 48 h ( = 0.61), and low-dose SPECT/CT at 24 h ( = 0.55). For planar imaging, interobserver agreement was fair after 48 h ( = 0.36) and 24 h ( = 0.38) and moderate after 4 h ( = 0.42). Every lesion detectable on planar imaging or low-dose SPECT/CT was also detectable on diagnostic SPECT/CT. The CT and SPECT components of diagnostic SPECT/CT strongly complemented each other, as 34 of 82 lesions (41.4%) were detected on only the CT component or only the SPECT component. Therapeutic management was influenced by the diagnostic SPECT/CT interpretation in 8 of 31 patients (25.8%). CONCLUSION The highest detection rates were achieved by diagnostic SPECT/CT. Thus, a more patient-friendly 1-d protocol is feasible. Furthermore, multiphase SPECT/CT affected management in about a quarter of patients.","output":"Significance of a Single-Time-Point Somatostatin Receptor SPECT/Multiphase CT Protocol in the Diagnostic Work-up of Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 variants raise concern regarding the mortality caused by COVID-19 epidemics.

For these methods to be successful, a potential cause of infection must be suspected. More recently, multiplex PCR and multiplex RT-PCR were used to enable more broad-range testing based on panels of suspected pathogens. PCRCelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI/MS) has emerged as a technology that is capable of identifying nearly all known human pathogens either from microbial isolates or directly from clinical specimens. Assay primers are strategically designed to target one or more of the broad pathogen categories: bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, or viral. With broad-range amplification followed by detection of mixed amplicons, the method can identify genetic evidence of known and unknown pathogens. This unique approach supports a higher form of inquiry, asking the following question: What is the genetic evidence of known or unknown pathogens in the patient sample? This approach has advantages over traditional assays that commonly target the presence or absence of one or more pathogens with known genetic composition.

We employed a convenience sampling method to select participants; 124 007 participants aged 65 years and older were recruited from January to December 2018 at local community health centres in Shenzhen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Data on treatment, control and influencing factors of hypertension were obtained from a standard questionnaire, physical measurements and biochemical analyses. RESULTS Prevalence of hypertension was 55.8% among the sample population. Among this group of hypertensive patients, those undergoing hypertension treatment and those with hypertension under control were 54.4% and 32.3%, respectively. Employing multivariate analysis, significant associations were found between treatment and older age, junior high school education and above (OR=1.25, p0.05), being widowed rather than being married or cohabiting (OR=1.28, p0.05), engaging in physical activity (OR=1.14, p0.05), ex-smoker (OR=1.19, p0.05), habitual drinker (OR=0.72, p0.05), history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (OR=2.20, p0.05) and comorbidities, with a higher probability for those with obesity (OR=1.89, p0.05), central obesity (OR=1.10, p0.05), diabetes (OR=1.49, p0.05) or dyslipidaemia (OR=1.20, p0.05).

These concerns are best addressed using a biopsychosocial approach to assessment, treatment and prevention drawing on medical, behavioral and psychological science. At an academic health center in the United States, The Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service was launched in 2019 to provide evaluation, education, treatment and prevention interventions using an integrated practice model. The interdepartmental program currently includes an Advanced Practice Nurse from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology as well as two clinical health psychologists from the Department of Psychiatry all with expertise in women's health and women's sexual medicine. Our interprofessional team collaborates closely with providers in women's primary care, medical, gynecologic and radiation oncology, urogynecology, colorectal surgery, among others. Review lessons learned from interdepartmental program design, funding, implementation, and evaluation of the Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service in an academic health center, summarize the types of sexual health concerns among women who presented to the integrated service, and highlight recommendations to generalize and/or adjust the program model to other types of health settings. Review the program implementation and evaluation process for the Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service, summarize the data on the women seen for care from April 23 2019 through June, 2021 (e.g., the number of unduplicated patients evaluated, their age, sexual health concerns, and treatment offered, etc), and outline program challenges and strategies to sustain and expand the initiative during and following the COVID-19 pandemic through virtual and in-person care. The Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service saw 198 women from April 23 2019 through June, 2021. Patients ranged in age from 21 to 72 (mean: 45 years). While most patients (33%) referred themselves to this program, other women were referred by obgyns, medical oncologists, women's primary care providers and gynecologic oncologists. Primary sexual health concerns included one or more of the following issues: pain (100), low desire (76), difficulty with orgasm (19), difficulty with arousal (12) and other (55). Additional findings will be presented on the types of treatment offered as well as patient and referring provider satisfaction with the new integrated sexual health consult service. Our interdepartmental Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service implemented a highly successful program that integrates sexual medicine, behavioral health, health psychology and sexual therapy to ensure access to state-of-the-art interprofessional education and care for women across the life span in all their diversities. We were able to sustain and expand this program through telehealth and in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and anticipate further growth in patient referrals and treatment modalities moving forward. Providers across disciplines also routinely refer to and collaborate with the program. Several components of the model are generalizable or adjustable to other women's health settings.

However, there is a general consensus that the obligatory virus entry receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is not expressed in olfactory receptor neurons, and the timing of arrival of the virus in brain targets is inconsistent with a neuronal transfer along olfactory projections. We determined whether nervus terminalis neurons and their peripheral and central projections should be considered as a potential alternative route from the nose to the brain. Nervus terminalis neurons in postnatal mice were double-labeled with antibodies against ACE2 and two nervus terminalis markers, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and choline acetyltransferase (CHAT). We show that a small fraction of CHAT-labeled nervus terminalis neurons, and the large majority of GnRH-labeled nervus terminalis neurons with cell bodies in the region between the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb express ACE2 and cathepsins B and L. Nervus terminalis neurons therefore may provide a direct route for the virus from the nasal epithelium, possibly via innervation of Bowmans glands, to brain targets, including the telencephalon and diencephalon. This possibility needs to be examined in suitable animal models and in human tissues.","output":"Expression of the ACE2 Virus Entry Protein in the Nervus Terminalis Reveals the Potential for an Alternative Route to Brain Infection in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current approaches to de novo design of proteins harboring a desired binding or catalytic motif require pre-specification of an overall fold or secondary structure composition, and hence considerable trial and error can be required to identify protein structures capable of scaffolding an arbitrary functional site.

In the second missing information recovery approach, we start from the desired functional site and jointly fill in the missing sequence and structure information needed to complete the protein in a single forward pass through an updated RoseTTAFold trained to recover sequence from structure in addition to structure from sequence.

Patient became more alert over the next 3 days, but could not be weaned off from IV dextrose/continuous feeds, GIR up to 15 mg/kg/min. He was transferred to our institution. Critical sample at BG of 45 mg/dl showed high insulin level (6.9 uU/ml) and C-peptide (1.25 ng/dl); low beta-OH butyrate <0.2 mmol/L; and free fatty acids (0.25 mmol/L); all suggestive of hyerperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH). Cortisol and GH robust at 10.5 mcg/dl and 7.13 ng/ml. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. Dads swab also positive. Mom was asymptomatic and not tested. ID was consulted, recommended supportive management and close observation. Pt was started on Diazoxide 10mg/kg/day divided q8h, and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) 5mg/day. Patients status gradually improved - BG stabilized, feeds were compressed, IV fluids and O2 supplementation weaned off, and was discharged after 8 days with average BG in the 70-80s range. Diazoxide and HCT were successfully weaned off in the following 3 mos. To this day patient remains well, no recurrence of hypoglycemia. Discussion/Conclusion: There is a dearth of information on SARS-CoV-2 infection in newborns. The few studies available show favorable outcomes in this population, with typical mild-moderate respiratory symptoms and fever, while some newborns are asymptomatic. Our patient required oxygen tx and developed HH requiring Diazoxide therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of HH in the newborn with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hyerperinsulinism is the most common cause of hypoglycemia in infants. These newborns are at risk of developing significant neurologic morbidity, which can be dose dependent. Prompt diagnosis and aggressive management are important to reduce such risk. Perinatal stress is likely the underlying mechanism leading to HH in newborns with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patient is also SGA. Both perinatal stress and SGA can lead to inappropriately elevated insulin levels and resultant hypoglycemia. HH in both of these conditions is effectively managed by Diazoxide. Our case illustrates that although most newborns do well with SARS-CoV-2 infection, a high index of suspicion for HH should be maintained in such newborns, particularly in those with at least one other risk factor for HH such as SGA. More studies are needed to elucidate underlying pathology and tease out actual incidence of hypoglycemia in neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"A Novel Case of Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia in a Neonate With SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the extent to which COVID-19 affects corporate trade credit policy.

The cases number of infectious diarrhea was significantly associated with seasonal variation of meteorological factors, and the burden of disease mainly occurred among children aged 0C2 years old. Moreover, when the reference value was set at 16.7C, Tmax had a significant lag-effect on cases of infectious diarrhea among children under 5 years old in Jiangsu Province, which was increased remarkably in cold weather with the highest risk at 8C. The results of DLNM analysis implicated that the lag-effect of Tmax varied among the 13 cities in Jiangsu and had significant differences in 8 cities. The highest risk of Tmax was presented at 5 lag days in Huaian with a maximum RR of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.29).

We used a non-statistical nominal group technique to generate evaluations of the plausibility, formal validity (verification) and predictive validity of the simulation. A health-effect assessment structure was used as a framework for data collection. FINDINGS The unpredictability of social order during disasters was not adequately addressed by simulation methods; even minor disruptions of the social order may invalidate key infrastructural assumptions underpinning current pandemic simulation models. Further, a direct relationship between model flexibility and computation time was noted. Consequently, simulation methods cannot, in practice, support integrated modifications of microbiological, epidemiological and spatial submodels or handle multiple parallel scenarios. CONCLUSION The combination of incomplete surveillance data and simulation methods that neglect social dynamics limits the ability of national public health agencies to provide policy-makers and the general public with the critical and timely information needed during a pandemic.","output":"Population-based simulations of influenza pandemics: validity and significance for public health policy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past ten years, cardiac MRI has become an indispensable tool for acute myocarditis diagnosis.

Little is known about such ancient epidemics and a deep evolutionary perspective on current pathogenic threats is lacking. The study of past epidemics has typically been limited in temporal scope to recorded history, and in physical scope to pathogens that left sufficient DNA behind, such as Yersinia pestis during the Great Plague. Host genomes however offer an indirect way to detect ancient epidemics beyond the current temporal and physical limits. Arms races with pathogens have shaped the genomes of the hosts by driving a large number of adaptations at many genes, and these signals can be used to detect and further characterize ancient epidemics. Here, we detect the genomic footprints left by ancient viral epidemics that took place in the past ~50,000 years in the 26 human populations represented in the 1,000 Genomes Project. By using the enrichment in signals of adaptation at ~4,500 host loci that interact with specific types of viruses, we provide evidence that RNA viruses have driven a particularly large number of adaptive events across diverse human populations. These results suggest that different types of viruses may have exerted different selective pressures during human evolution.

Whereas targeted approaches only provide information for the selected markers, thus hampering the determination of out-of-the-box markers, the common bottleneck of untargeted metabolomics is the identification of detected biomarkers. In this study, we developed a strategy based on derivatization and LC-MS/MS detection in a precursor ion scan for the untargeted determination of a specific part of the metabolome (carbonyl-containing metabolites). The usefulness of this guided metabolomics approach has been demonstrated by elucidating carbonyl-containing biomarkers of COVID-19 severity. First, the LC-MS/MS behavior of 63 model compounds after O-benzylhydroxylamine derivatization was studied. A precursor ion scan of m/z 91 was selected as a suitable approach for the untargeted detection of carbonyl-containing metabolites. The method was able to detect 300 potential carbonyl-containing molecules in plasma, including mono-/di-/tricarbonylic compounds with satisfactory intra-day and inter-day repeatability and RSDs commonly <15%. Additionally, the semiquantitative nature of the precursor ion scan method was confirmed by comparison with a fully validated targeted method. The application of the guided metabolomics method to COVID-19 plasma samples revealed the presence of four potential COVID-19 severity biomarkers. Based on their LC-MS/MS behavior, these biomarkers were elucidated as 2-hydroxybutyrate, 2,3-dihydroxybutyrate, 2-oxobutyrate and 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate. Their structures were confirmed by comparison with reference materials. The alterations of these biomarkers with COVID-19 severity were confirmed by a target analysis of a larger set of samples. Our results confirm that guided metabolomics is an alternative approach for the untargeted detection of selected families of metabolites; this approach can accelerate their elucidation and provide new perspectives for the establishment of health/disease biomarkers.","output":"Untargeted detection of the carbonyl metabolome by chemical derivatization and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in precursor ion scan mode: Elucidation of COVID-19 severity biomarkers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 67-year-old male diabetic patient with systemic arterial hypertension was admitted to the emergency department with a necrotic ulcer in the left external malleolus and no palpable popliteal or pedal pulses Arterial Duplex ultrasound identified femoropopliteal occlusion, with popliteal refilling below the knee and a patent peroneal artery An endovascular procedure was performed, requiring retrograde access to the popliteal artery to re-establish blood flow and deploy a popliteal stent Technical success was achieved and the patient underwent debridement of the wound Two days later, about 48 hours after the operation, the patient began to exhibit respiratory symptoms, with coughing and dyspnea He immediately underwent a chest CT that identified ground glass opacities, the crazy-paving pattern, and bilateral air bronchogram in the lungs A reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was positive for SARS-Cov-2 The patient was moved to an intensive care unit and put on mechanical ventilation Both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were administered Despite appropriate treatment, the patient died 4 days after he was diagnosed with COVID-19 Resumo Paciente do sexo masculino, 67 anos, diabtico, hipertenso, foi admitido no pronto-socorro com histrico de lcera necrtica no malolo externo esquerdo, sem pulsos poplteos e distais palpveis A ultrassonografia Doppler arterial identificou oclus?o femoropopltea, com reenchimento da artria popltea infragenicular e perviedade da artria fibular Foi realizado procedimento endovascular, com necessidade de acesso retrgrado na artria popltea para restabelecer o fluxo sanguneo e realizar implante de stent poplteo O sucesso tcnico foi alcan?ado e, em seguida, o paciente foi submetido ao desbridamento da ferida No segundo dia, cerca de 48 horas de ps-operatrio, o paciente apresentou quadro respiratrio com tosse e dispneia Foi submetido a uma tomografia computadorizada do trax, que identificou opacidades em vidro fosco e broncograma areo bilateralmente nos pulm?es, com teste de reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivo para SARS-Cov-2 O paciente foi transferido para uma unidade de terapia intensiva, necessitando de ventila??o mecanica Recebeu hidroxicloroquina e azitromicina Apesar do tratamento em suporte intensivo, o paciente morreu 4 dias aps o diagnstico de COVID-19","output":"COVID-19 diagnosis in a patient with critical limb ischemia: complications and clinical outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) reduces grower pig performance. The amino acid (AA) requirements and lysine:metabolizable energy ratio (Lys:ME) of health-challenged pigs for optimum performance are poorly understood. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of increasing standardized ileal digestible (SID) Lys:ME (g SID Lys per Mcal ME) on growth performance during a PRRSV challenge. In Exp. 1, a total of 379 barrows (51.3  0.3 kg body weight [BW]) were allotted to one of six diets (1.87 to 3.41 Lys:ME) for a 35-d growth study. In Exp. 2, a total of 389 barrows (29.2  0.23 kg BW) were allotted to one of six diets (2.39 to 3.91 Lys:ME) for a 49-d growth study. These isocaloric diets represented 80% to 130% of National Research Council (NRC) SID Lys requirement. For each experiment, pigs were randomly allotted across two barns of 24 pens each with seven to nine pigs per pen (four pens per diet per health status). On day 0, one barn was inoculated with live PRRSV, one barn sham inoculated (control), and all pigs were started on experimental diets. Pen growth performance and feed intake were recorded weekly and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) was calculated. Breakpoint analysis was used to determine the Lys:ME that maximized average daily gain (ADG) and G:F over the 35 or 49-d test periods for Exp. 1 and 2, respectively. In Exp. 1, increasing Lys:ME increased ADG (quadratic P = 0.01) and G:F (linear and quadratic P = 0.04) in control pigs over 35 d. In PRRSV-infected pigs, ADG and G:F increased linearly with increasing Lys:ME (P < 0.01). The Lys:ME for optimum ADG and G:F during PRRSV challenge was 2.83 and 3.17, respectively, compared to 2.24 and 2.83, respectively, in control pigs using a one-slope broken-line model. In Exp. 2, pigs in the control barn became naturally infected after 21 days post inoculation. Before infection, ADG and G:F increased with increasing Lys:ME in control and PRRSV-infected pigs (linear and quadratic P < 0.05), and optimum ADG and G:F were achieved at 3.02 and 2.92 Lys:ME, respectively, in PRRSV-infected pigs compared to 2.82 and 3.22 Lys:ME, respectively, in control pigs. Over the 49-d period, increasing Lys:ME improved ADG (P < 0.01, linear and quadratic) and G:F (linear P < 0.01) in naturally infected pigs. The response was similar in experimental infection for ADG (P < 0.01, linear and quadratic) and G:F (linear P = 0.01). The optimum ratio for ADG (2.86 vs. 3.12 Lys:ME) and G:F (3.18 vs. 3.08 Lys:ME) were similar between natural and experimental infection.

STUDY DESIGN Case series with planned data collection. METHODS An analysis was undertaken of 314 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism undergoing parathyroid surgery in a tertiary academic practice between January 2009 and April 2013. There were 187 patients with single-gland disease; 68 failed to meet inclusion criteria, resulting in a study population of 119 patients. Preoperative parathyroid hormone, calcium, ionized calcium, 25-OH-vitamin D, creatinine, and glomerular filtration rate values were determined, along with postoperative calcium, ionized calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels. Patients were divided into two groups based on their postoperative parathyroid hormone values: elevated parathyroid hormone and normal parathyroid hormone. RESULTS Thirty (25.2%) patients achieved postoperative normocalcemia but had elevated parathyroid hormone levels. This group had significantly higher preoperative levels of parathyroid hormone (P =.002) and creatinine (P =.007), and a lower glomerular filtration rate (P =.002) than patients with normal postoperative parathyroid hormone levels. The preoperative 25-OH-vitamin D level was not significantly associated with an elevated parathyroid hormone (odds ratio [OR]: 1.56). Preoperative impaired renal function, specifically an abnormal glomerular filtration rate (OR: 12.8), was significantly associated with an elevated parathyroid hormone. CONCLUSIONS Parathyroid hormone remains elevated in 25% of patients who are cured (eucalcemic) after surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism.

Caveolin-1 is the most important structural protein of caveolae, a membrane invagination widely known for its role in endocytosis and subsequent cytoplasmic transportation. Caveolae/caveolin-1 is tightly associated with a wide range of biological processes, including cholesterol homeostasis, cell mechano-sensing, tumorigenesis, and signal transduction. Intriguingly, the versatile roles of caveolae/caveolin-1 in virus infections have increasingly been appreciated. Over the past few decades, more and more viruses have been identified to invade host cells via caveolae-mediated endocytosis, although other known pathways have been explored. The subsequent post-entry events, including trafficking, replication, assembly, and egress of a large number of viruses, are caveolae/caveolin-1-dependent. Deprivation of caveolae/caveolin-1 by drug application or gene editing leads to abnormalities in viral uptake, viral protein expression, or virion release, whereas the underlying mechanisms remain elusive and must be explored holistically to provide potential novel antiviral targets and strategies. This review recapitulates our current knowledge on how caveolae/caveolin-1 functions in every step of the viral infection cycle and various relevant signaling pathways, hoping to provide a new perspective for future viral cell biology research.","output":"Multifaceted Functions of Host Cell Caveolae/Caveolin-1 in Virus Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We estimate the short- to medium term impact of six major past pandemic crises on the CO2 emissions and energy transition to renewable electricity.

This study aimed to investigate the association between work-related stress and aggravation of pre-existing disease in workers during the first state of COVID-19 emergency in Japan. METHODS: Data were obtained from a large internet survey conducted between August 25 and September 30, 2020 in Japan. Participants who reported that they had a job as well as current history of disease(s) (ie, pre-existing conditions) were included (n = 3,090). Aggravation of pre-existing disease during the state of emergency was self-reported. Work-related stress from April 2020 (since the state of COVID-19 emergency) was assessed according to a job demandCcontrol model. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association. RESULTS: Aggravation of pre-existing diseases was reported by 334 participants (11%). The numbers of participants with high demand and low control were 112 (18%) and 100 (14%), respectively. Compared to medium demand, high demand was significantly associated with aggravation of pre-existing diseases (odds ratio 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.30C2.42). Low control compared to medium control was also significantly associated with aggravation of pre-existing diseases (odds ratio 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.02C1.92). CONCLUSION: Work-related stress during the first state of COVID-19 emergency was associated with aggravation of pre-existing disease during that period.","output":"The Association of Work-related Stress According to the DemandCControl Model With Aggravation of Pre-existing Disease During the First State of COVID-19 Emergency in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives. To investigate whether the imposition of fines can mitigate the spread of COVID-19.Methods. We used quasi-experimental difference-in-difference models.

This paper aims to assess the pandemics mobility impacts and whether these may have increased the already existing inequality between men and women. In particular, the variation of mode choice in a pre-COVID and post-COVID scenario is investigated, focusing on the use of transport mode defined as Smart Mobility. The analysis is performed on data collected in thirteen European countries between July and September 2020 through a survey designed using an intersectional approach. Responses are analyzed to highlight correlations between different factors affecting mobility changes: some interest is reserved to the modes used according to the journey scope (work, errand, shopping). Overall, results reveal more people walking for their daily journeys, while a significant decrease in the use of public transport is observed. Although these changes affect women more, the main reason behind this is the need for more safety in terms of low risk of contagion, irrespective of gender.

It has been shown that sleep arousal serves as a good indicator for scoring sleep quality. However, patients are conventionally asked to perform overnight polysomnography tests to collect their physiological data, which are used for the manual judging of sleep arousals. Even worse, not only is this process time-consuming and cumbersome, the judgment of sleep-arousal events is subjective and differs widely from expert to expert. Therefore, this work focuses on designing an automatic sleep-arousal detector that necessitates only a single-lead electroencephalogram signal. Based on the stacking ensemble learning framework, the automatic sleep-arousal detector adopts a meta-classifier that stacks four sub-models: one-dimensional convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, merged convolutional and recurrent networks, and random forest classifiers. This meta-classifier exploits both advantages from deep learning networks and conventional machine learning algorithms to enhance its performance. The embedded information for discriminating the sleep-arousals is extracted from waveform sequences, spectrum characteristics, and expert-defined statistics in single-lead EEG signals. Its effectiveness is evaluated using an open-accessed database, which comprises polysomnograms of 994 individuals, provided by PhysioNet.

Currently, clinical detection of UTI is mainly focused on urine culture; however, the diagnostic value of urine culture remains limited due to the time-consuming procedure and low detection rate, especially in patients who have used antibiotics. Generally, treatment for UTI relies on empirical medication rather than pathogen diagnosis, which leads to the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents and a significant increase in resistant strains. Comparatively, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is capable of overcoming the disadvantages of clinical culture, and identifying pathogens for further treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital with a high fever and chills. None of his autoimmune disease or thyroid function related indicators were positive, and he had no risk of endocarditis. His white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin 6, and neutrophil proportion were markedly elevated. He was initially diagnosed as having an infection of unknown etiology. Since empirical treatment of Sulperazon and Metronidazole did not relieve his symptoms, both the blood and urine specimens were examined using traditional culture, serological testing, and mNGS assay. Traditional culture and serological testing produced negative results, while the mNGS assay revealed the presence of a potential pathogen, Enterococcus faecalis, in the urine specimen, which was further confirmed by both Sanger sequencing and qPCR analysis. A CT scan of the patient's whole abdomen showed stones in the right kidney. Once targeted antibiotic therapy was administered, the patient recovered quickly. CONCLUSIONS: Our case illustrated that mNGS, as a novel culture-independent approach, demonstrated the capability of rapid, sensitive, and accurate pathogen identification.

It has previously been determined by periodic agreements between the State and a pharma industry lobby body. A new deal is due in July 2021 and it is therefore timely to re-examine Irelands threshold, how it is set and transparency around adherence to it. Previous research has noted a series of problems with the threshold, including that it is likely too high relative to the opportunity cost of unmet need within Irelands health system. This means reimbursement at the threshold may do net harm to population health. The high threshold may also mean the Irish health system is failing to satisfy existing legislation on healthcare resource allocation. Recent COVID-19-related pressures on healthcare capacity and public spending appear to increase the urgency for an evidence-based revision of threshold to better reflect opportunity costs within the Irish healthcare system. Despite these problems, the prospects for reform of the threshold do not appear strong as the political and institutional incentives may favour the status quo. At the very least, the State should provide greater transparency regarding how the threshold is set and adhered to.

PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 114 consecutive patients (82% male) underwent RARC and urinary diversion between April 2013 and December 2015 [ileal conduit (97 patients) and orthotopic neobladder (17)]. Surgery was performed by two surgeons within a designated regional cancer centre. No exclusion criteria were applied. All patients were managed on the Exeter Enhanced Recovery Pathway (ERP) in a unit where embedded enhanced recovery practice was already established. Data were collected prospectively on the national cystectomy registry - the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) Complex Operations Dataset. RESULTS RARC was technically feasible in all but one case. The mean operating time was 3-5 h with an overall transfusion rate of 8.8%. There were higher-grade complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III-IV) in 18.4% of patients, with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.9%. The median (range) LOS after RARC was 7 (3-68) days, with a re-admission rate of 18.4%. CONCLUSIONS The present series shows that RARC can be safely implemented in a unit experienced in robot-assisted surgery (RAS). Case-selection in this setting is not deemed necessary. There are benefits in terms of lower transfusion rates and reduced LOS. The side-effect profile appears to differ from that of open RC, and despite the fact that complication rate is equivalent; 'technical' complications are over-represented in the RAS group. As such, they should improve with experience, recognition, and modification of surgical technique.

RESULTS A total of 62 nurses responded to the survey; average age 37.5 years, 31 (60.8%) were female, mostly from Italy, France and United Kingdom. All hospitals underwent many changes, such as the opening of new dedicated wards and the restriction of family visits. The number of ICU beds doubled during the pandemic (p<0.01), as well as the number of nurses per shift from 10.2 (SD 7.3) before to 17.9 (SD 13.6) during the pandemic (p<0.01). However, changes in the nurse-to-patient ratio were not significant: from 1:1.5 to 1:2 (p=0.05). Among nursing care activities, clinical risk management (n=14, 22.6%), psychological support for patients (n=22, 35.5%) and family's involvement (n=31, 50%) resulted as more challenging; 64.5% of nurses suffered from protective equipment shortages, and 66.1% experienced psychological burden. CONCLUSION These findings can help to reflect on how to better prepare both nurses and health care institutions for other events that may threaten clinical practice and require major and innovative efforts.","output":"[How hospitals, Intensive Care Units and nursing care of critically ill patients have changed during the Covid-19 outbreak?

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of billing data. SETTING: A large-volume practice with both community and tertiary care providers. METHODS: As part of a quality initiative, billing data were queried to identify children <18 years of age who underwent tympanostomy tube placement between January 2019 and December 2020. Patient age, practice location, and case numbers were gathered. RESULTS: The study included data from 2652 patients. Prior to state-mandated clinic and operating room restrictions, there were no significant differences in the number of tympanostomy tubes placed (P = .64), including month-to-month comparisons, the distribution of patients being cared for at community vs tertiary care sites (P = .63), or patient age at the time of surgery (P = .97) between 2019 and 2020. After resumption of outpatient clinical and elective surgical activities, the number of tympanostomy tubes placed decreased significantly between 2019 and 2020 (831 vs 303 cases, P = .003), with a persistent month-to-month difference. In addition, patients undergoing tube placement were older (4.5 vs 3.2 years, P < .001). The distribution of cases performed in the community setting decreased during this time period as well (P < .001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of pediatric tympanostomy tube placement has significantly decreased. The age of patients undergoing surgery has increased, and more children are being cared for in a tertiary setting.

Therefore, immunization against SARS-CoV-2 with effective vaccines is an important component of health-maintenance strategies for these patients. This study evaluated the humoral and cellular responses to messenger RNA (mRNA) SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Observational prospective, multi-center cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred five patients treated at three dialysis units at the Hospital Clnic of Barcelona (Spain) were vaccinated from February 3 to April 4, 2021 and followed until April 23, 2021. EXPOSURE: Immunization with either the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. OUTCOMES: Seroconversion, defined as the detection of IgG antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the S1 spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 (antiCS1-RBD IgG), and the identification of activated CD4(+) T cells 3 weeks after completing vaccination. Anti-S1-RBD IgG levels were also analyzed as a secondary outcome. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Univariate and multivariable logistic and multiple linear regression models were used to evaluate the associations between vaccination and study outcomes. RESULTS: 97.7% of 175 vaccinated patients who were seronegative at baseline developed a response (humoral, cellular, or both). 95.4% of these patients seroconverted, while 62% of those tested for a cellular immunity had a positive response. Greater age and immunosuppressive treatment were associated with lower antibody levels. LIMITATIONS: Mandatory vaccine administration by health authorities. Anti-S1-RBD IgG levels were reported up to 150 U/mL and cellular immune responses were characterized qualitatively. Antibody assay and cellular response assessment may not be comparable with previously published laboratory approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Immunization with mRNA vaccines generated a humoral and cellular immune response in a high proportion of patients with kidney failure receiving maintenance dialysis. These findings as well as the high risk of infection and poor clinical outcomes among these patients make their vaccination a health priority.","output":"Humoral and Cellular Responses to mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines Administered to Hemodialysis Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies have suggested that some individuals experience neuropsychiatric symptoms following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.

Throughout her hospital stay, the patient had no neuropsychiatric symptoms. During her last week of stay, she was solely getting oxygen at home before presenting to the emergency department (ED) with severe psychosis. Her COVID-19 test in ED presentation was negative, and all potential etiologies for psychosis were ruled out. She was effectively treated for two weeks with 10 mg haloperidol and 1000 mg sodium valproate daily, followed by outpatient care. While variables such as a family history of bipolar disorder, psychosocial stressors, and steroid medication may have contributed to the patient's presentation, these circumstances alone did not result in neuropsychiatric symptoms in the past.

Within 24 h of admission, the patient had an IABP placed which rapidly improved her haemodynamics. Two days later, IABP was removed and within 6 days of admission, apical ballooning and LVOT obstruction had fully recovered.

Although previous investigations have advocated the idea that learning and generalizing depend upon separate processes, the same basic learning mechanisms may account for both. In language learning experiments, these mechanisms have typically been studied in isolation of broader cognitive phenomena such as memory, perception, and attention. Here, we show how learning and generalization in language is embedded in these broader theories by testing learners on their ability to chunk nonadjacent dependencies-a key structure in language but a challenge to theories that posit learning through the memorization of structure. In two studies, adult participants were trained and tested on an artificial language containing nonadjacent syllable dependencies, using a novel chunking-based serial recall task involving verbal repetition of target sequences (formed from learned strings) and scrambled foils. Participants recalled significantly more syllables, bigrams, trigrams, and nonadjacent dependencies from sequences conforming to the language's statistics (both learned and generalized sequences). They also encoded and generalized specific nonadjacent chunk information. These results suggest that participants chunk remote dependencies and rapidly generalize this information to novel structures. The results thus provide further support for learning-based approaches to language acquisition, and link statistical learning to broader cognitive mechanisms of memory.

BACKGROUND: The experience of being a newly qualified nurse is stressful and isolating. Support from colleagues and peers can enhance perceptions of competence and confidence in newly qualified nurses, improve well-being and aid retention. However, despite initiatives such as preceptorship, support needs may remain unmet in busy clinical environments. Online support has potential to offer a partial solution to professional isolation, but there is a lack of research into how technology can support nurses' emotional and social well-being. DESIGN: A qualitative exploratory study was designed, employing semi-structured focus groups, analysed using thematic analysis. The study is reported in accordance with the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research checklist. METHODS: Eight focus groups, supplemented by one individual interview, were conducted with newly qualified nurses between June 2018-January 2019. FINDINGS: Two main themes arose. The first was Drowning, a lot of the time with two sub-themes: (i) Feelings and emotions about being a Newly Qualified Nurse: 'Absolutely terrified' and (ii) Support within the role: 'Somebody you can count on'. The second was Potential advantages and disadvantages of online modality: 'Somebody is going to get in that phone!' which included three sub-themes (i) Potential advantages, (ii) Potential disadvantages and (iii) Preferences and recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that if barriers can be overcome, then online support has potential to contribute to newly qualified nurses' well-being. Further research is needed to explore technical and ethical issues around online support and evaluate its effectiveness for newly qualified nurses.

The secondary objective was to assess geographical variation in amphetamine-type stimulant use in Northern Rural, Northern Urban, Southern Rural and Southern Urban Areas of Ontario. Methods: A retrospective cohort study on 32,674 adults receiving OAT from ~70 clinics was conducted between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2020, in Ontario, Canada. Patients were divided into four groups base on the proportion of positive urine drug screening results for amphetamine-type stimulants during treatment: group 1 (0C25%), group 2 (25C50%), group 3 (50C75%), and groups 4 (75C100%). A Fractional logistic regression model was used to evaluate differences over time in amphetamine-type stimulant use with urine drug screening results. A Cox Proportional Hazard Ratio model was used to calculate the impact of amphetamine-type stimulant use on retention in OAT and adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, drug use and clinical factors. Lastly, a logistic regression model was used on a subgroup of patients to assess the impact of geography on amphetamine-type stimulant use in Northern Rural, Northern Urban, Southern Rural and Southern Urban Areas of Ontario. Results: There were significant differences in amphetamine-type stimulant positive urine drug screening results year-over-year from 2015 to 2020. Significant differences were observed between amphetamine-type stimulant groups with regards to sociodemographic, clinical and drug use factors. Compared to those with no amphetamine-type stimulant use, the number of days retained in OAT treatment for amphetamine-type stimulant users was reduced (hazard ratio 1.19; 95% confidence interval = 1.07C1.17; p < 0.001). Lastly, an adjusted logistic regression model showed a significant increase in the likelihood of amphetamine-type stimulant use in Northern Rural regions compared to Southern Urban areas. Conclusion: There was a significant increase in amphetamine-type stimulant use among individuals in OAT from 2014 to 2020, associated with decreased OAT retention. Research is required to determine if tailored strategies specific to individuals in OAT who use amphetamine-type stimulants can improve OAT outcomes.","output":"Negative Impact of Amphetamine-Type Stimulant Use on Opioid Agonist Treatment Retention in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An increasing number of T1a renal cell carcinomas are being diagnosed in recent years, in part due to incidental detection from the increased use of cross-sectional imaging.

GAMs can efficiently combine different types of fixed, random and smooth terms in the linear predictor of a regression model to account for different types of effects.

GAMs do this via the smoothing functions and take each predictor variable in the model and separate it into sections delimited by 'knots', and then fit polynomial functions to each section separately, with the constraint that there are no links at the knots - second derivatives of the separate functions are equal at the knots.","output":"Generalized additive models to capture the death rates in Canada COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The quarantine of identified close contacts has been vital to reducing transmission rates and averting secondary infection risk before symptom onset and by asymptomatic cases. The effectiveness of this contact tracing strategy to mitigate transmission is sensitive to the adherence to quarantines, which may be lower for longer quarantine periods or in vaccinated populations (where perceptions of risk are reduced). This study develops a simulation model to evaluate contact tracing strategies based on the sequential testing of identified contacts after exposure as an alternative to quarantines, in which contacts are isolated only after confirmation by a positive test. The analysis considers different number and types of tests (PCR and lateral flow antigen tests (LFA)) to identify the cost-effective testing policies that minimize the expected infecting days post-exposure considering different levels of testing capacity. This analysis suggests that even a limited number of tests can be effective at reducing secondary infection risk: two LFA tests (with optimal timing) avert infectiousness at a level that is comparable to 14-day quarantine with 90\\\\% adherence;adding a third test (PCR or LFA) reaches the efficiency of a 95\\\\% quarantine adherence.

Garnet-type ceramic electrolyte with high stability against metallic Li has drawn much attention, but it also suffers from huge interfacial resistance and Li dendrite penetration due to the unavoidable formation of carbonate passivation layer and limited interface contact. Herein, we propose a facile and effective method of flame vapor deposition to spray candle soot coating on garnet surface. It enables the reduction of carbonate layer and the conversion to highly lithiophilic interlayer especially when contacting with molten Li. The lithiophilicity is rooted in the enrichment of graphitic polycrystalline domains in candle soot, which can be chemically or electrochemically lithiated to form ionic/electronic dual conductive network containing LiC6 moieties. The candle soot interlayer binds Li metal with garnet electrolyte tightly with gradual transition of Li-ion conductivity, leading to a significant reduction of area specific resistance to 50 ?cm2 at 60 with high cycling and current endurance. Garnet based symmetric cells and solid-state full cells conducting this strategy exhibit impressive electrochemical reversibility and durability under the preservation of compact interface and smooth Li plating/striping. The modified Li/garnet/FeF3 batteries exhibit a discharge capacity as high as 500 mAh?g-1 and long-term cyclability for at least 1500 cycles (with capacity preserved at 281.7 and 201 mAh?g-1 at 100 and 200 A?cm-2 respectively).

Outpatient diagnosis and treatment of metabolically stable young persons with new-onset T1D have been shown to be equivalent to inpatient. We describe an approach to outpatient management of newly diagnosed T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic using an interdisciplinary team, telemedicine, and diabetes technologies including rapid implementation of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Methods: Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, new-onset cases of T1D were tracked. After laboratory confirmation of diagnosis and metabolic stability, patients and families were referred for ambulatory initiation of insulin therapy and diabetes education. These cases were reviewed using data extracted from the electronic health record, comments from multidisciplinary team members, and cloud-based glucose data. Results: We report on seven young people with new-onset T1D without diabetic ketoacidosis from April to June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ages ranged 9-23 years with presenting hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values 10-14.5%. Initial evaluation was generally face-to-face, followed by frequent telemedicine visits. Five patients had a family history of T1D. Two patients had access to at-home HbA1c kits prompting evaluation in the absence of symptoms. Four patients required emergency department evaluation.

Thus, understanding client's knowledge about SARS-COV2 causes, roots of transmissions, and prevention strategies are urgently warranted. Although there were global studies reported knowledge and preventive practices of COVID-19, but the information is not representative and inclusive for Ethiopia. Thus, the current study is done to identify the knowledge and the prevention strategies for COVID-19 among clients in South Wollo, Ethiopia. METHODS: An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 21 to 30, 2020 among clients seeking service in Dessie town health facilities. A total of 81 clients were included from the selected health facilities with simple random sampling technique. We developed measuring tools by adopting from World Health Organization and center for disease prevention recommendation manual for assessing service providers' knowledge and preventive practices. For data entry Epi-data 3.1 version was employed and further data management and analysis was performed using STATA Version 14. Student T-test and one way ANOVA were computed to see the mean difference in knowledge and practice between and among the group. Chi-square test was also done to portray the presence of association between different co-variants with client's knowledge and preventive practices. RESULTS: Findings of the study showed that more than half (56.8%) of the participants had good knowledge about its symptoms, way of spread and prevention of the virus. Furthermore, 65.4% of clients demonstrated five or more preventive practice measures of COVID-19. The mean preventive practice score with standard deviation was (4.751.28 from 6 components). In the current study, knowledge had no significant difference among sex, education status, and monthly income. However, COVID-19 transmission knowledge was significantly higher among urban residents. Thus, clients who were knowledgeable about way of transmission and symptoms of COVID-19 had significantly higher COVID-19 preventive practice. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that clients' knowledge and preventive practice of COVID-19 were not optimal. Clients with good knowledge and urban residents had practiced better prevention measures of the pandemic, signifying that packages and programs directed in enhancing knowledge about the virus is useful in combating the pandemic and continuing safe practices.","output":"Knowledge and practice of clients on preventive measures of COVID-19 pandemic among governmental health facilities in South Wollo, Ethiopia: A facility-based cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic has led to the intense mobilization of all health professionals, including those involved in research. From the very beginning, research ethics committees (RECs) have been called upon and mobilized to carry out the scientific and ethical evaluations of research projects to achieve a sound analysis of their risk/benefit balance. The aim of this article is to present an ethical reflection on the challenges and consequences of the fast-track procedure for the evaluation of COVID-19 research projects in the context of a public health emergency. Indeed, a large number of protocols of reduced rigor were hastily prepared without collaboration between researchers and in the absence of national regulation. As a result, a number of ethical dilemmas have emerged concerning the opposing needs of pragmatism imposed by the emergency context and the ethical principles that should govern the conduct of research. Moreover, the dispersion of these individual projects, aggravated by excessive media coverage of specific treatments, has resulted in a weakened impact of the research in the epidemic context. This article provides suggestions for the ethical management of ongoing and upcoming research, giving RECs the opportunity to adapt their evaluations to avoid allowing the pragmatism of the emergency context to subvert the inviolability of the epistemological and ethical principles of research on humans.

Given the biological, behavioural and environmental variables relevant to infectivity, this might be pertinent to almost any infected individual who is not physically isolated from others. Nor is the term confined to individuals with a propensity to spread infectious disease: it can potentially be used to describe events, policies or settings. This article explores the use of the term and considers circumstances in which the wide definition can be problematic. One problem is that it can lead to undeserved apportionment of moral blame to alleged super-spreaders.

The host-constrained perception of viruses implies preference of genetic exchange between viruses and cellular organisms of their host superkingdoms and viral origins from host cells either via escape or reduction. However, viruses frequently establish non-lytic interactions with organisms and endogenize into the genomes of bacterial endosymbionts that reside in eukaryotic cells. Such interactions create opportunities for genetic exchange between viruses and organisms of non-host superkingdoms. Here, we take an atypical approach to revisit virus-cell interactions by first identifying protein fold structures in the proteomes of archaeoviruses, bacterioviruses, and eukaryoviruses and second by tracing their spread in the proteomes of superkingdoms Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. The exercise quantified protein structural homologies between viruses and organisms of their host and non-host superkingdoms and revealed likely candidates for virus-to-cell and cell-to-virus gene transfers. Unexpected lifestyle-driven genetic affiliations between bacterioviruses and Eukarya and eukaryoviruses and Bacteria were also predicted in addition to a large cohort of protein folds that were universally shared by viral and cellular proteomes and virus-specific protein folds not detected in cellular proteomes. These protein folds provide unique insights into viral origins and evolution that are generally difficult to recover with traditional sequence alignment-dependent evolutionary analyses owing to the fast mutation rates of viral gene sequences.","output":"Do Viruses Exchange Genes across Superkingdoms of Life?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The teaching-service-community integration is an important strategy for achieving changes in the training of human resources in health, in order to train professionals with a profile to work in the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS, as per its Portuguese acronym).

We report a case of combined superior mesenteric arterial and venous occlusion associated with COVID-19 infection. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 45-year-old man who was a health care worker who presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. The clinical examination was unremarkable, but imaging revealed acute mesenteric ischemia caused by superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein occlusion. Imaging of the chest was suggestive of COVID-19 infection, which was later confirmed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of his nasopharyngeal swab. To date, only 1 case of combined superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis caused by COVID-19 has been reported. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: During the COVID-19 pandemic it is important to keep mesenteric ischemia in the differential diagnosis of unexplained abdominal pain.

Most of what we know about sex during COVID-19 lockdowns is largely based on solitary sexual practices, which may not answer the critical question around how the pandemic may be shaping sexual practices among young people. Against this backdrop, this study explored how the COVID-19 pandemic may be shaping BBVs/STIs risk and protective practices among a sample of onshore African and Asian international students in Sydney, Australia. Methods: This phenomenological qualitative study involved semi-structured telephone and face-to-face interviews with 16 international university students in Sydney, between September 2020CMarch 2021. Generated data were coded using NVivo and analysis was guided by reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Participants reported elevated mental health distress because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some participants reported engaging in casual sexual hook-ups as a strategy to mitigate the mental health distress they were experiencing. Some of these sexual hook-ups were condomless partly because COVID-related disruptions impacted condom accessibility. Additionally, the preventive practices of some participants who were sexually active during the lockdowns were focused on preventing COVID-19, while the risk of BBVs/STIs were downplayed.

PURPOSE Our aim was to analyze the outcomes after flow diversion among MCA, anterior communicating artery, and distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of 3 databases was performed for studies published from 2005 to 2018. STUDY SELECTION According to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we included studies reporting flow diversion of distal anterior circulation aneurysms. DATA ANALYSIS Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool aneurysm occlusion and complication rates. From the individual patient data, univariate and multivariate analyses were used to test predictors of occlusion and complications. DATA SYNTHESIS We included 27 studies (484 aneurysms). The long-term adequate occlusion rate (O'Kelly-Marotta scale, C-D) was 82.7% (295/364; 95% CI, 77.4%-87.9%; I2 = 52%). Treatment-related complications were 12.5% (63/410; 95% CI, 9%-16%%; I2 = 18.8%), with 5.4% (29/418; 95% CI, 3.2%-7.5%; I2 = 0%) morbidity. MCA location was an independent factor associated with lower occlusion (OR = 0.5, P = .03) and higher complication rates (OR = 1.8, P = .02), compared with anterior communicating artery and distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms. The Pipeline Embolization Device (versus other stents) gave better occlusion rates (OR = 2.6, P = .002), whereas large/giant aneurysms were associated with higher odds of complications (OR = 2.2, P = .03). The rates of occlusion and narrowing of arteries covered by flow-diverter stents were 6.3% (29/283; 95% CI, 3.5%-9.1%; I2 = 4.2%) and 23.8% (69/283; 95% CI, 15.7%-32%; I2 = 80%), respectively. Symptoms related to occlusion and narrowing of the jailed arteries were 3.5% (6/269; 95% CI, 1.1%-5%; I2 = 0%) and 3% (6/245; 95% CI, 1%-4%; I2 = 0%), respectively.

Different organizations have recommended performing polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) as part of the preoperative screening of surgical patients. We aimed to determine the performance of PCR testing to detect asymptomatic carriers. METHODS: Observational study carried out at a tertiary care center. We compared the results of preoperative real-time reverse-transcription-PCR test (RT-PCR) performed on a cohort of patients pending surgery with the results we would have expected assuming the epidemiological data released by government offices. RESULTS: We registered no positives in the 2,722 preoperative RT-PCR tests performed in our health care area between epidemiological Weeks 18 to 21, meaning a cumulative incidence trending to zero. Assuming public epidemiological data, the probabilistic projection of potential asymptomatic individuals ranged from 0.27  10e-4 (according to official data of new cases diagnosed by PCR) to 4.69  10e-4 if we assumed cases confirmed by IgG test in our province. Assuming a RT-PCR sensitivity of 95%, to obtain a positive result we should perform 38,461 and 2,028 tests respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In scenarios of very low prevalence and despite high sensitivity scores, indiscriminate preoperative RT-PCR screening is of a questionable effectiveness for detecting asymptomatic carriers. Our findings evidence the difficulty of establishing reliable predictive models for the episodic and rapidly evolving incidence of infections such as has characterized the SARS CoV2 pandemic.","output":"Utility of preoperative polymerase chain reaction testing during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: The challenge of evolving incidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Research shows that compassion from others and from the self may enable university students to face, overcome, and bounce back from adversity and generate a greater sense of thriving and meaning in life. However, the underlying processes are largely unknown. The present study aimed to examine the associations of compassion with psychological distress, flourishing, and meaning in life among university students and explore the mechanisms underlying these associations. METHODS: A total of 536 Hong Kong university students completed questionnaires measuring their experiences of compassion from others, self-compassion, resilience, psychological distress, flourishing, and meaning in life. RESULTS: Serial mediation analyses showed that compassion from others was associated positively with self-compassion, which was, in turn, linked to greater resilience and consequently lower levels of psychological distress and higher levels of flourishing and meaning in life. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal the associations of compassion from others and self-compassion with the well-being and life meaning of university students. The findings highlight the importance of being open and receptive to love and kindness from others.

We assessed the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 during the first wave of the epidemic in Korea. METHODS: Using a modified World Health Organization clinical record form, we obtained clinical data for 3,060 patients with COVID-19 treated at 55 hospitals in Korea. Disease severity scores were defined as: 1) no limitation of daily activities; 2) limitation of daily activities but no need for supplemental oxygen; 3) supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula; 4) supplemental oxygen via facial mask; 5) non-invasive mechanical ventilation; 6) invasive mechanical ventilation; 7) multi-organ failure or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy; and 8) death. Recovery was defined as a severity score of 1 or 2, or discharge and release from isolation. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 43 years of age; 43.6% were male. The median time from illness onset to admission was 5 days. Of the patients with a disease severity score of 3C4 on admission, 65 (71.5%) of the 91 patients recovered, and 7 (7.7%) died due to illness by day 28. Of the patients with disease severity scores of 5C7, 7 (19.5%) of the 36 patients recovered, and 8 (22.2%) died due to illness by day 28.

In the At trimer, the astatines originally bonded to N1 in the halogen bond donating guanines have moved to the adjacent O6 atom, enabling O-AtN, N-AtO, and N-AtAt halogen bonds. The brominated and chlorinated R-II trimers contain two N-XN and two N-XO halogen bonds, whereas in the iodinated and astatinated trimers, one of the N-XN halogen bonds is lost. The corresponding R-II dimers keep the same halogen bond patterns. The G-quartets display a rich diversity of symmetries and halogen bond patterns, including N-XN, N-XO, N-XX, O-XX, and O-XO halogen bonds (the latter two facilitated by the transfer of halogens from N1 to O6).

Considering the current and futuristic importance of the public health cadre, we described them and reviewed their transdisciplinarity status based on MlPH admissibility criteria 1995 to 2021. METHODS: Using a search strategy, we abstracted information available in the public domain on MlPH programmes and their admissibility criteria. We categorized the admission criteria based on specified disciplines into Health science, Non-health science and Non-health non-science categories. We described the MlPH programmes by location, type of institution, course duration, curriculum, pedagogical methods, specializations offered, and nature of admission criteria statements. We calculated descriptive statistics for eligible educational qualifications for MlPH admission. RESULTS: Overall, 76 Indian institutions (Medical colleges21 and Non-medical coleges55) offered 92 MlPH programmes (Private58 and Public34). We included 89 for review. These programmes represent a 51% increase (n = 47) from 2016 to 2021. They are mostly concentrated in 21 Indian provinces. These programmes stated that they admit candidates of but not limited to graduation in any life sciences, 3-year bachelors degree in any discipline, graduation from any Indian universities, and graduation in any discipline. Among the health science disciplines, Modern medicine (n = 89; 100%), Occupational therapy (n = 57; 64%) is the least eligible.

Methods: A sample of N = 8088 persons working in the German-speaking healthcare sector participated in the VOICE/egePan online survey, which addressed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. We used 15 self-constructed items, based on the work of Matsuishi et al. (2012), to identify potential COVID-19-specific topics. Results: N = 7542 records of healthcare workers were analyzed. Of these, 60.80% reported, retrospectively, an increase in stress since the outbreak of the pandemic. Problem areas tended to be indicated more frequently by the women surveyed than by the men. Nurses, paramedics and medical technicians reported the highest fear of infecting others while physicians reported the highest fear of physical or mental exhaustion. With respect to age, older respondents indicated less fear and felt more protected. Men and people living alone were more likely to use dysfunctional coping strategies. Migrants reported a higher fear of becoming infected or infecting others as well as they reported about increased levels of smoking.

The confirmation of the amorphous behavior and the presence of the various vibration modes and stretching modes have been analyzed using the XRD and FTIR techniques, respectively. The radiation shielding parameters of these glasses were reported using MCNP5 simulation. The effects of PbO on the MCNP5 parameters were investigated in detail. The mass attenuation coefficient (MAC) was simulated via MCNP5 code, and it was found that the MAC values from MCNP5 all follow the same trend as the XCOM data. The similarity means that the two simulations strongly agree with each other. The linear attenuation coefficient (LAC) was calculated for all the glasses. The glass sample with 55 mol% of the PbO has the greatest LAC at any energy, such as 0.317 at 10 MeV, the lowest investigated energy. From the LAC values, other parameters such as transmission factor (TF), lead equivalent thickness (d (lead)), and half-value layer (HVL) were reported. The results for the TF of the glasses revealed that the glass systems become more effective as their thickness increases. Glass sample with 35 mol % of the PbO recorded the highest TF at all energies due to its lack of PbO content, such as 15.533% for a thickness of 1 cm and 6.122% for 1.5-cm thickness at 0.3 MeV. The radiation protection efficiency (RPE) was also determined, and we found that the glasses with the greater PbO content and least MgO content have the highest RPE.

This retrospective study was conducted using the Korean Stroke Registry database from a single cerebrovascular specialty hospital. We categorized the COVID-19 pandemic (February 2020 to June 2021) into three waves according to the number of COVID-19 cases recorded and the subjective fear index of the general population and matched them with the corresponding pre-COVID-19 (January 2019 to January 2020) periods. The total number of acute stroke hospitalizations during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods was 402 and 379, respectively. The number of acute stroke hospitalizations recorded during the regional outbreak of COVID-19 was higher than that recorded during the corresponding pre-COVID-19 period (97 vs. 80). Length of hospital stay was significantly longer during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the pre-COVID-19 period (11.1 and 8.5 days, respectively; p = 0.003). There were no significant differences in the time from onset to hospital arrival, rate of acute intravenous/intra-arterial (IV/IA) treatments, and door-to-IV/IA times between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors provide an evaluation of the impact that Lean Six Sigma implementations have had on the ability of Dutch healthcare institutions to respond adequately to healthcare needs during the COVID-19 crisis. Findings: Process improvement in healthcare has had a tendency to cut capacity and flexibility which are needed to deal with excessive demand shocks, such as during a pandemic. The main reason for this failure seems to be an overly strong focus on cost reduction instigated by Lean Six Sigma during stable times. Research limitations/implications: Besides the research method being an inferential procedure, the research focuses on the Netherlands and so the generalizability might be limited. However, using Lean Six Sigma to improve healthcare processes has found broad acceptance, so the implications may well carry over to other countries. Practical implications: The authors call for a more comprehensive approach of process improvement within healthcare that takes flexibility and buffering in anticipation of excess variability and disruption into greater account. Therefore, this study provides a new perspective on how and to which aim Lean Six Sigma should be applied in healthcare. Originality/value: An assessment is given of the impact of Lean Six Sigma implementations on the ability to respond to the COVID-19 crisis. This is done by identifying the focus points of improvement projects and considering the impact on the resilience of healthcare operations. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"A reconsideration of Lean Six Sigma in healthcare after the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of the novel COVID-19 virus occurred during February 2020 onwards in almost all the European countries, including Spain. This study covers the correlation found between weather variables (Maximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature, Mean Temperature, Atmospheric Pressure, Daily Rainfall, Daily Sun hours) and the coronavirus propagation in Spain. A strong relationship is found when correlating the virus spread to the mean temperature, minimum temperature, and atmospheric pressure in different Spanish provinces. In this analysis we have used the ratio of the PCR COVID-19 positives with respect to the population size. A linear regression model using the mean temperature is implemented. Moreover, an analysis of variance is used to confirm the influence of mean temperature on the spread of virus. As a second measurement of the COVID-19 outbreak we have used the results of the antibodies tests carried out in Spain that provide an estimation of the heard immunity achieved. Based on this analysis, an estimation of the asymptomatic population is performed. All these results exhibit significant correlation with weather variables. The most affected provinces were Soria, Segovia and Ciudad Real, which are the coldest. On the opposite side, places such as Southern Spain, the Baleares, and Canary Islands showed a lower rate of spread. This might be related to the warmer climate and the insularity of these islands. Besides, the coastal influence and the daily sun hours might also influence the lower rates in the east and west regions in Spain.

While PCR is the gold standard method for detecting active SARS-CoV-2 infection, alternative high-throughput diagnostic tests are of significant value to meet universal testing demands. Here, we describe a new design of the MasSpec Pen technology integrated to electrospray ionization (ESI) for direct analysis of clinical swabs and investigate its use for COVID-19 screening. The redesigned MasSpec Pen system incorporates a disposable sampling device refined for uniform and efficient analysis of swab tips via liquid extraction directly coupled to a ESI source. Using this system, we analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs from 244 individuals including symptomatic COVID-19 positive, symptomatic negative, and asymptomatic negative individuals, enabling rapid detection of rich lipid profiles. Two statistical classifiers were generated based on the lipid information aquired. Classifier 1 was built to distinguish symptomatic PCR-positive from asymptomatic PCR-negative individuals, yielding cross-validation accuracy of 83.5%, sensitivity of 76.6%, and specificity of 86.6%, and validation set accuracy of 89.6%, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 85.3%. Classifier 2 was built to distinguish symptomatic PCR-positive patients from negative individuals including symptomatic PCR-negative patients with moderate to severe symptoms and asymptomatic individuals, yielding a cross-validation accuracy of 78.4% accuracy, specificity of 77.21%, and sensitivity of 81.8%. Collectively, this study suggests that the lipid profiles detected directly from nasopharyngeal swabs using MasSpec Pen-ESI MS allows fast (under a minute) screening of COVID-19 disease using minimal operating steps and no specialized reagents, thus representing a promising alternative high-throughput method for screening of COVID-19.","output":"Rapid Screening of COVID-19 Disease Directly from Clinical Nasopharyngeal Swabs using the MasSpec Pen Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and arbidol in treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the real world. Methods: The clinical data of 178 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from January 20 to February 10, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. According to patient's antiviral treatment regimens, 178 patients were divided into 4 groups including LPV/r group (59 patients), arbidol group (36 patients), LPV/r plus arbidol combination group (25 patients) and the supportive care group without any antiviral treatment (58 patients). The primary end point was the negative conversion time of nucleic acid of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by pharyngeal swab. Results: The baseline parameters of 4 groups before treatment was comparable. The negative conversion time of viral nucleic acid was (10.203.49), (10.114.68), (10.864.74), (8.443.51) days in LPV/r group, arbidol group, combination group, and supportive care group respectively (F=2.556, P=0.058). There was also no significant difference in negative conversion rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid, the improvement of clinical symptoms, and the improvement of pulmonary infections by CT scan (P>0.05). However, a statistically significant difference was found in the changing rates from mild/moderate to severe/critical type at day 7 ((2)=9.311, P=0.017), which were 24%(6/25) in combination group, 16.7%(6/36) in arbidol group, 5.4%(3/56) in LPV/r group and 5.2%(3/58) in supportive care group. Moreover, the incidence of adverse reactions in three antiviral groups was significantly higher than that in supportive care group ((2)=14.875, P=0.002).

However, existing preparedness assessments focus primarily on public health systems or specific legislative frameworks, and do not measure other essential capacities that enable and support public health preparedness and response. METHODS: We developed an Epidemic Preparedness Index (EPI) to assess national-level preparedness. The EPI is global, covering 188 countries. It consists of five subindices measuring each countrys economic resources, public health communications, infrastructure, public health systems and institutional capacity. To evaluate the construct validity of the EPI, we tested its correlation with proxy measures for preparedness and response capacity, including the timeliness of outbreak detection and reporting, as well as vaccination rates during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. RESULTS: The most prepared countries were concentrated in Europe and North America, while the least prepared countries clustered in Central and West Africa and Southeast Asia. Better prepared countries were found to report infectious disease outbreaks more quickly and to have vaccinated a larger proportion of their population during the 2009 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The EPI measures a countrys capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease events. Existing tools, such as the Joint External Evaluation (JEE), have been designed to measure preparedness within a country over time. The EPI complements the JEE by providing a holistic view of preparedness and is constructed to support comparative risk assessment between countries. The index can be updated rapidly to generate global estimates of pandemic preparedness that can inform strategy and resource allocation.","output":"Assessing global preparedness for the next pandemic: development and application of an Epidemic Preparedness Index"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When ultraviolet radiation is absorbed within the cutaneous tissues, it can trigger a number of phenomena that can have detrimental or beneficial consequences to an individual's health. Tanning is among the most visually noticeable of these phenomena. It may result in significant changes in skin pigmentation and thickness. These spectrally-dependent physiological responses, in turn, can elicit variations in the ultraviolet absorption profiles of the cutaneous tissues and, consequently, alter the occurrence of other ultraviolet-induced photobiological processes such as the breaking of DNA strands and the synthesis of previtamin D3. These tanning-elicited variations in the cutaneous tissues' absorption profiles is often tied to the increased presence of melanin throughout these tissues. However, during the tanning, shifts in the relative content of this pigment within certain skin layers can also be observed. In particular, the stratum basale, the innermost epidermal layer where melanogenesis takes place, can have its relative melanin content significantly reduced in comparison with other epidermal layers. Since the aforementioned photobiological phenomena are preferentially brought about within this layer, such pigmentation shifts may have a more pivotal role in skin photobiology than has been assumed to date. Accordingly, in this work, we investigate the impact of spectrally-dependent tanning-elicited physiological responses, with a particular focus on the inter-layer melanin distribution patterns, on the absorption profiles of the main cutaneous tissues. We also examine how variations in these absorption profiles may alter the outcomes of photo-triggered phenomena associated with the onset of different medical conditions. Our findings are expected to contribute to the advance of the current understanding about skin photobiology, which is indispensable for the success of photomedicine initiatives involving this highly complex organ.","output":"Tanning-Elicited Variations in the Ultraviolet Absorption Spectra of the Cutaneous Tissues: Skin Photobiology and Photomedicine Implications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the Institute of Informatics and Telematics in Pisa (Italy), a novel working group was born, called Human-Centered Technologies (HCT) One of the main objectives of HCT involves the definition of decision support systems, which help stakeholders and people in general to understand the Italian society, economy and health Within this context, we have implemented a strategy to assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Italian tourism industry in terms of tourism income and reduction in the number of tourist arrivals","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Italian Tourism During the First Quarter of 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The coexistence of heart failure (HF) and frailty leads to a worse prognosis. Frailty is generally diagnosed using the Fried criteria. To assess whether patients are frail according to the Fried scale, face-to-face physical examinations are required. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, to avoid the spread of the virus in hospitals, it is important to screen hospitalized patients for frailty without contact. Therefore, non-contact measurement methods, such as questionnaires, should be used to screen for frailty in clinical practice. The FRAIL scale is a questionnaire used to screen for frailty. There are no studies regarding the consistency of the FRAIL scale with the Fried criteria, the impact on mortality, and physical dysfunction in elderly patients with HF. PURPOSE: We investigated whether the FRAIL scale questionnaire is consistent with the Fried criteria, predicts all-cause mortality, and reflects physical dysfunction in patients with HF. METHODS: The present study was secondary analysis of FRAGILE-HF, a cohort study that enrolled participants from 2016 to 2018 and followed up for 1-year of discharge. A prospective multicenter cohort study in which 15 hospitals in Japan (8 university hospitals and 7 non-university teaching hospitals) participated. We prospectively enrolled 1332 consecutive hospitalized patients with HF 65 years old and analyzed 1028 patients after excluding 304 patients with missing data on the FRAIL scale. The FRAIL scale, the Fried model, and physical function were measured before discharge. The endpoint was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: According to the FRAIL scale, 459 (44.6%) and 491 (47.8%) were classified as frail and pre-frail, respectively. The Kappa coefficient between the FRAIL scale and the Fried criteria were 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34C0.44; P value: <0.001). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for frailty diagnosed by the Fried criteria of the FRAIL scale was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.71C0.76; P value: <0.001). A total of 118 deaths occurred during 1 year of follow-up. After adjusting for the MAGGIC score and log-BNP, The FRAIL scale predicted all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01C1.36; P value = 0.035). The FRAIL scale was also associated with various physical dysfunction that correlated with poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The FRAIL scale had moderate consistency with the Fried criteria, predicted all-cause mortality, and reflected clinically important physical dysfunction.

METHODS This single-center trial tested the thigh-length sleeve (TLS) and knee-length sleeve (KLS) in 47 healthy volunteers. Peak systolic velocity and total volume flow were measured at rest and during the 11-second compression cycle.

The primary aim of this preliminary systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effect of CRT for AN relative to control treatments in randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) on neuropsychological inefficiencies at end-of-treatment. Secondary aims were to assess the effect of CRT for AN on dropout, eating-disorder-related, and other psychological outcomes at end-of-treatment. Systematic review and meta-analytic procedures were conducted in accordance with PRISMA Guidelines. RCTs evaluating CRT for AN compared to a control treatment were identified via ProQuest, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SCOPUS. Seven RCTs and one quasi-RCT of CRT for AN were included. RCT quality ratings ranged from fair (n = 3) to good (n = 4). Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using Hedge's g. Study heterogeneity was assessed using I2 and publication bias was assessed with Begg's adjusted-rank correlation and the trim-and-fill method. CRT was not associated with improvement in central coherence compared to control treatments at end-of-treatment (g = 0.25, 95% CI = -0.35, 0.85, k = 3). Set-shifting outcomes were mixed due to heterogeneity of set-shifting measures across studies. CRT may prevent dropout; yet, more studies are needed to draw conclusions.

While self-reliance and community-support are often the norm in the daily life of residents in in peripheral communities, in an emergency they may be crucial for survival. Worldwide remote communities with limited response and medical infrastructure and resources may struggle to cope with the aftermath of an earthquake while potentially coping with a concurrent epidemic or extreme weather. In this work we focus on the effect of concurring disasters and seasonal stressors. In particular we discuss how various disasters would affect the Covid-19 infection rate, and we demonstrate that in Israel's periphery cities, heat-stress is a consistent and significant seasonal stressor that would hamper emergency and recovery operations. We also suggest that transient tourist population in these remote cities is expected to burden local emergency efforts and facilities. A seasonal over burden parameter is proposed to describe how seasonal tourism and weather conditions enhance the hardship and risk in a multi-hazard situation. A case study shows that high-resolution spatial analysis of risk and preparedness together with a temporal analysis of seasonal effects, may be used to detect specific neighborhoods with high or low resilience and capacity to cope with disasters.

DESIGN: Systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of Science and Scopus were searched from September 2009 to November 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies were included if they assessed pregnant women with active TB, drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) or TB/HIV coinfection and examined pregnancy, maternal, fetal/birth and TB or TB/HIV coinfection outcomes. Studies were also included if they examined family planning services among women initiating TB treatment. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data using PRISMA guidelines and conducted quality assessment using the Joanna-Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools. The level of evidence was reported using the Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice guidelines. RESULTS: 69 studies were included in this review. Case reports, case series, case controls, cohort studies, secondary data analyses and a service delivery improvement project conducted in 26 countries made up the totality of the evidence. Most studies reported pregnancy complications for mothers (anaemia, postpartum haemorrhage, deaths) and fetuses or newborns (low birth weight, premature birth, and spontaneous or induced abortions). Few studies discussed the value of offering family planning to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes. One study examined the effect of a provider training on contraceptive use with reported increased contraceptive use. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating family planning services within a TB treatment programme is essential to reduce adverse TB-associated maternal-child outcomes.

This paper draws from the catalogue of reports from journalists informed largely by an array of non-peer reviewed scientific literature documenting the relationship between fatness and COVID-19. Our method of enquiry is to examine fatness and COVID-19 through a problematisation lens that enables us to interrogate the scientific, political, and economic processes implicated in the production of fat bodies as problems. Fatness has been problematised in the COVID-19 pandemic. This has diverted responsibility for preparedness and well-being away from health systems and governments and onto the back of fat people and communities. This is unjust and unethical. In juxtaposition, fat activists around the world have challenged the problematisation of fatness and its effects, finding ways for fat people to subvert fat phobic institutions in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic by collectively organising to support one another. The ways in which fatness is being taken up in current COVID-19 pandemic responses diverts responsibility for health system preparedness and community resiliency to fat individuals. This is both unjust and also obstructs meaningful action to address the health inequities laid bare by COVID-19.

The prevalence of autoantibodies was higher in IPF compared to CTD-ILD. We identified a predictive autoimmune signature that was significantly associated with reduced transplant free survival in IPF. In particular, presence of autoantibodies to Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) was associated with a significantly reduced survival in patients with IPF (p=0.002), independent of the study cohort, suggesting clinical relevance as predictive biomarker. Conclusions: Unbiased proteomic profiling reveals that the overall prevalence of autoantibodies is similar in IPF and CTD-ILD patients and identifies novel IPF specific autoantigens associated with patient survival.","output":"A proteomics workflow reveals predictive autoantigens in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to a Digital New Deal study (Kornbluh and Goodman, 2020), participation and engagement with these pages increased by 102% since the 2016 US presidential election.

Community leaders, researchers, policymakers, and clinicians have mobilized to develop programs to address this issue. This study reviewed a wide range of mental health interventions targeting farmer mental health spanning over 50 years and examined their reported effectiveness and constraints. A total of ninety-two articles on farmer mental health were included in a final systematic review. Most articles were written concerning mental health literacy and peer and paraprofessional support interventions in the United States and Australia. Among the 56 studies reporting empirical evaluative data, 21 were mixed-method, 20 quantitative, 11 qualitative, and 5 literature synthesis. Non-experimental, self-reported, and qualitative data suggest efficacy of mental health literacy programs, peer and paraprofessional support, and community-based and agroecological interventions. However, most interventions were not subject to rigorous evaluation and only one intervention was evaluated using a control condition. The heterogeneity of existing studies and paucity of rigorous evaluation proscribes firm conclusions related to program-type efficacy. This review demonstrates that there is still a need for a stronger and broader evidence base in the field of farmer mental health interventions, which should focus on both holistic, multi-component programs and targeted approaches.","output":"Farmer Mental Health Interventions: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 lockdown policies that began in 2020 caused an unprecedented shock to developing countries agricultural activities, especially those in sub\\\\Saharan Africa and South Asia.

METHODS Multivariable analysis of demographic, behavioural and clinical data with self-reported sexual contact prior to attending for a gonorrhoea ToC evaluation among participants recruited into the 'Gentamicin for the Treatment of Gonorrhoea' trial in England, between October 2014 and November 2016. Associations with sexual contact were expressed as prevalence ratios (PR) and their corresponding 95% CI. RESULTS The median time to ToC was 15 days (interquartile range 14-20 days). 197/540 (37%) participants reported sexual contact in the time between treatment and ToC. Of these, 173/197 (88%) participants reported inconsistent condom use, including with previous partners (133/197 (68%)). A history of gonorrhoea (adjusted PR (aPR) 1.32 (1.03 to 1.69)) or syphilis (aPR 1.19 (1.08 to 1.32)), being in regular (aPR 1.71 (1.41 to 2.09)) sexual relationships, high number of partners in the last 3 months (aPR 1.77 (1.25 to 2.51))-'more than 5 partners' vs '0 to 1 partner', and attending for a ToC more than 14 days after treatment (aPR 1.40 (1.08 to 1. 81)) were associated with reporting sexual contact before the ToC appointment. However, age (aPR (1.00 (0.99 to 1.01)) and presenting with specific symptoms at baseline (aPR 1.17 (0.95 to 1.44)) were not associated with sexual contact by the ToC attendance.

A total of 64/127 (50.3%) of OHNS programs were selected based on a random number generator. The main outcome measure was the number of OHNS residents with access to robotic surgery training and assessment of operative experience in robotic surgery among those residents. RESULTS A total of 140 OHNS residents participated in the survey, of which 59.3% (n = 83) were male. Response rate was 40.2%. Respondents came from middle 50.0% (n = 70), southern 17.8% (n = 25), western 17.8% (n = 25), and eastern sections 14.3% (n = 20). Most respondents (94.3%, n = 132) reported that their institution utilized a robot for head and neck surgery.

Focusing on results from 17,250 epidemiological investigations performed during early stages of the pandemic outbreak in Israel, we show that the distribution of carriers of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, is spatially correlated with two satellite-derived surface metrics: night light intensity and landscape patchiness, the latter being a measure to the urban landscapes scale-dependent spatial heterogeneity. We find that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 carriers was significantly more likely to occur in patchy parts of the city, where the urban landscape is characterized by high levels of spatial heterogeneity at relatively small, tens of meters scales. We suggest that this spatial association reflects a scale-dependent constraint imposed by the citys morphology on the cumulative behavior of the people inhabiting it.

Using genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening, we identified 83 novel genes supporting infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) replication in human cells. Thirty of these hits can be placed in a network of interactions with viral proteins and are involved in RNA splicing, membrane trafficking, and ubiquitin conjugation. In addition, our screen reveals an unexpected role for valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) in early steps of infection. Loss of VCP inhibits a previously uncharacterized degradation of the nucleocapsid N protein.

Modeling vaccine refusers as free riders also likely distorts the ethical analysis of vaccine refusal and may lead to unsuccessful policy interventions.","output":"Vaccine Refusal Is Not Free Riding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To clarify the meaning of elevated cardiac troponin in elite soccer athletes previously infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and screened for cardiovascular involvement in the wake of competitive sport resumption. METHODS: We designed a retrospective cohort study with the collaboration of two Italian Serie A teams. Soccer players from both rosters (58 athletes) were systematically analysed. For every SARS-CoV-2 positive athlete, the Italian Soccer Federation protocol requested full blood tests including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), along with a complete cardiovascular examination. We extended the analysis to SARS-CoV-2 negative athletes. RESULTS: A total of 13/58 players (22.4%) suffered from SARS-CoV-2infection: all had a negative cardiovascular examination and 2/13 (15%) showed increased hs-cTnI values (120.8 pg/ml and 72,6 pg/ml, respectively; upper reference level 39.2 pg/ml), which did not track with inflammatory biomarkers. Regarding the 45/58 (77.6%) non infected athletes, a slight increase in hs-cTnI was observed in 2 (4.5%) subjects (values: 61 pg/ml and 75 pg/ml respectively). All hs-cTnI positive athletes (4/58, 7%) underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), that excluded any cardiac injury. CONCLUSIONS: In our retrospective study, SARS-CoV-2 infection in elite soccer athletes was not associated to clinical or biomarkers abnormalities. Increased hs-cTnI was rare and not significantly associated with previous SARS-COV2 infection nor with pathological findings at CMR, albeit elevated hs-cTnI was numerically more prevalent in the infected group.","output":"Interpretation of elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in elite soccer players previously infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on both national economies and everyday life.

Diaphragm pacing (DP) prevents ventilator induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD) while on mechanical ventilation (MV) and has been shown via functional electrical stimulation to improve phrenic nerve recovery. We report the largest experience of DP in lung transplantation recipients. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of an IRB approved prospective, non-randomized interventional experience at a single institution with two DP systems. A chronic DP system [NeuRx, Synapse Biomedical] was implanted laparoscopically in those with phrenic nerve injury or difficulty with weaning from MV remotely after their transplant. A temporary DP system [TransAeris, Synapse Biomedical] was implanted at the time of transplantation or laparoscopically. In both types of implantation, diaphragm stimulation ensued if needed to wean from MV or for nerve recovery. Results evaluated radiographically and with diaphragm electromyography (dEMG). Results: DP was utilized in16 patients with no device adverse events. Of those, 5 patients had chronic DP system: a) 1 patient one year post transplant shows no recovery of phrenic nerve injury, still pacing;b) 3 patients showed recovery of phrenic nerve/diaphragm function through pacing;c) 1 patient 2 years post-transplant sustained hip fracture requiring surgery, developed pneumonia and became tracheostomy MV dependent;DP allowed complete diaphragm recovery, decanullation of tracheostomy and removal of DP wires. 11 patients had temporary DP electrodes placed: a) 1 recipient(two months post-transplant) had DP use during ECMO for COVID- 19 sepsis and respiratory failure and subsequently expired when family withdrew therapy;b) 10 implanted at time of lung transplant.

The purpose of this paper was to explore patient perceptions and concerns around virtual care access. METHODS: Between February and April 2020, we conducted semi-structured interviews with participants from four chronic disease clinics (stroke, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, obstetrics medicine) in a mid-sized academic hospital in Southern Ontario, Canada. Consecutive sampling was done by including the patients receiving virtual care in those months. Caregivers were invited to participate in the event that patients were unable to participate in the interview. Thematic analysis was employed to identify overarching themes, and codes were reviewed and refined using a consensus process. RESULTS: We interviewed 31 participants (27 patients, four caregivers) that had taken part in virtual care. Our findings suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic served to isolate participants and had negatively impacted their access to health care. However, virtual care did provide a safe avenue for patients to receive care and served as a reassuring option during the pandemic. Low technological literacy and access were identified as barriers to virtual care. Greater awareness and patient engagement is needed in future research to improve access. CONCLUSION: Certain populations can be disproportionately affected by differential access to virtual care. Future studies should examine how social determinants intersect to impact virtual health care access in different patient populations.","output":"Virtual Care Access and Health Equity during the COVID-19 Pandemic, a qualitative study of patients with chronic diseases from Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, quick public health investigations of the relationships between behaviours and infection risk are essential.

Phenotype analysis of rasip1 mutants in zebrafish embryos reveals distinct functions of Rasip1 during sprouting angiogenesis, anastomosis and lumen formation. During angiogenic sprouting, loss of Rasip1 causes cell pairing defects due to a destabilization of tricellular junctions, indicating that stable tricellular junctions are essential to maintain multicellular organization within the sprout. During anastomosis, Rasip1 is required to establish a stable apical membrane compartment; rasip1 mutants display ectopic, reticulated junctions and the apical compartment is frequently collapsed. Loss of Ccm1 and Heg1 function mimics the junctional defects of rasip1 mutants. Furthermore, downregulation of ccm1 and heg1 leads to a delocalization of Rasip1 at cell junctions, indicating that junctional tethering of Rasip1 is required for its function in junction formation and stabilization during sprouting angiogenesis.","output":"Control of dynamic cell behaviors during angiogenesis and anastomosis by Rasip1."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The placebo effect can be defined as the improvement of symptoms in a patient after the administration of an innocuous substance in a context that induces expectations regarding its effects.

The possible integration of changes in different systems of the organism could favor the well-being of the individuals and go hand in hand with conventional treatment for multiple diseases.

We describe a patient with leptospirosis complicated by sHLH who succumbed to illness following multiorgan dysfunction. Case Description. A 74-year-old farmer presented with high-grade, unsettling fever for a week. Muddy water exposure and suggestive symptoms prompted investigation and management in the line of leptospirosis (IV ceftriaxone was instituted, and later, MAT (microscopic agglutination test) became positive). Subsequently, he developed severe acute hypoxemia requiring mechanical ventilation and acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy. Bone marrow biopsy and markedly elevated serum ferritin and triglyceride levels done on day 10 (with unresolving fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopaenia) confirmed the diagnosis of HLH. The routine cultures, retroviral studies, CMV, dengue, hanta and mycoplasma antibodies, tuberculosis and COVID-19 PCR, and malaria screening were all normal. There was no improvement of hypoxemia following intravenous methylprednisolone. He died on day 15 despite escalating organ support. CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis is a common zoonotic disease in the tropics with significant morbidity and mortality. In the case of severe leptospirosis, overlapping clinical features with sHLH make the diagnosis of the latter challenging. No assessment tools are available to date to predict the risk of developing sHLH in a patient having leptospirosis. Outcome following sHLH due to leptospirosis still remains majorly ominous.

Yet, perspectives and social opinions about it remain fractured, and collaborative action is faltering. Climate policy seeks to forge a singular sense of climate change, dominated by an information deficit model that focuses on transferring climate science to the lay public. Critics argue that this leaves out certain perspectives, including the plurality of meanings uncovered through participatory approaches. However, questions remain about how these approaches can better account for nuances in the psychological complexity of climate change, without getting stuck in the cul-de-sacs of epistemological relativism and post-truth politics. In this paper, I explore an approach through which we might find shared meaning at the interface of individual and collective views about climate change. I first present a conceptual framework that describes five psychological reasons why climate change challenges individual and collective meaning-making, and also provides a way to understand how meaning is organized within that. I then use this framework to inform the use of photo voice as a transformative (action-research) method, examining its ability to overcome some of the meaning-making challenges specific to climate change.

Controlling for air-pollution, rainfall, temperature, demographic factors that measure population density, the proportion of the elderly, and health infrastructure including per capita health spending and the proportion of respiratory cases, does not diminish the predictive power of BMI in influencing the spatial incidence and spread of the virus. The association between adult BMI and measures of spatial outcomes is especially pronounced among educated populations in urban settings, and impervious to conditioning on differences in testing rates across states. We find that among women, BMI proxies for a range of comorbidities (hemoglobin, high blood pressure and high glucose levels) that affects the severity of the virus while among men, these health indicators are also important, as is exposure to risk of contracting the virus as measured by work propensities. We conduct sensitivity checks and control for differences that may arise due to variations in timing of onset.

Cortical thickness from 4 to 36 months showed regional specific linear and non-linear trajectories and distinct maturation timing across the cortex. Intriguingly, we revealed a accumulation/ablation phenomenon of cortical maturation where the most profound development changes in cortical thickness occur in the accumulation or ablation zones surrounding the focal points (i.e., a center of a delineated regions where cortical thickness is thickest or thinnest) throughout the brain. We further examined maternal diet and inflammation in the context of these typical brain trajectories and known network architecture. A well-controlled NHP model of a maternal Western-style diet was used alongside measures of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the mothers during gestation. We observed that these accumulation and ablation zones of variable change might be most susceptible to environmental effects. The maternal factors, diet and inflammation during pregnancy were distinctively associated with different aspects of offspring cortical development reflected in regions related to distinctive functional networks.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of MDR infections, including infections caused by MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), was very high in Iran. This study is aimed at assessing the genetic diversity, antimicrobial resistance pattern, and biofilm formation in K. pneumoniae isolates obtained from patients with COVID-19 and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) in Iran. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, seventy K. pneumoniae isolates were obtained from seventy patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the ICU of Shahid Beheshti hospital, Kashan, Iran, from May to September, 2020. K. pneumoniae was detected through the ureD gene. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method, and biofilm was detected using the microtiter plate assay method. Genetic diversity was also analyzed through polymerase chain reaction based on enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC-PCR). The BioNumerics software (v. 8.0, Applied Maths, Belgium) was used for analyzing the data and drawing dendrogram and minimum spanning tree. Findings. K. pneumoniae isolates had varying levels of resistance to antibiotics meropenem (80.4%), cefepime-aztreonam-piperacillin/tazobactam (70%), tobramycin (61.4%), ciprofloxacin (57.7%), gentamicin (55.7%), and imipenem (50%). Around 77.14% of isolates were MDR, and 42.8% of them formed biofilm. Genetic diversity analysis revealed 28 genotypes (E1CE28) and 74.28% of isolates were grouped into ten clusters (i.e., clusters ACJ). Clusters were further categorized into three major clusters, i.e., clusters E, H, and J. Antimicrobial resistance to meropenem, tobramycin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin in cluster J was significantly higher than cluster H, denoting significant relationship between ERIC clusters and antimicrobial resistance. However, there was no significant difference among major clusters E, H, and J respecting biofilm formation. CONCLUSION: K. pneumoniae isolates obtained from patients with COVID-19 have high antimicrobial resistance, and 44.2% of them have genetic similarity and can be clustered in three major clusters.

The omega-3 helps in mitigating the risk of cardiovascular disease in humans. For industrial use, perilla seed is extracted for virgin oil, which is generally achieved by mechanical screw pressing. This process generates perilla cake that contains a fat content around 9C10%. In this study, we examined the effect of the supplementation of perilla cake in the pig diet on productive performance, pig carcass characteristics, meat quality, and fatty acid composition in fat tissue, and meat. The pig performance improved in terms of average daily gain after supplementation with perilla cake; however, the pig carcass and meat quality was unchanged. Moreover, the perilla cake supplement increased PUFA fatty acids and reduced the proportion of saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids in pork. The overall outcome of this study provides an alternative source of novel raw material for functional feed additives in livestock production. ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of perilla cake (PC) supplementation in a growing pig diet on overall growing performance, meat quality, and fatty acid profile. A total of 24 barrow grower crossbred pigs (Large White  Landrace)  Duroc with an initial average body weight of 26.33 kg were fed with a basal diet supplemented with PC at 0%, 5%, and 10% in (PC0, PC5, and PC10, respectively) for 12 weeks. At the end of the experimental period, pigs were slaughtered to determine carcass traits and meat quality. Back fat, abdominal fat, and longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle were collected to investigate fatty acid composition. The results show that the average daily gain (ADG) in the PC10 significantly increased. However, PC supplementation did not influence carcass traits and meat quality except the color as described by lightness (L*). Dietary PC supplementation significantly increased the -linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3 cis-9, 12, 15), whereas n6/n3 ratio decreased significantly in all tissues investigated. Thus, it can be concluded that the supplementation of PC in growing pig diet is a potential way to increase the fatty acid composition to that required for healthier meat.","output":"Effects of Dietary Perilla Cake Supplementation in Growing Pig on Productive Performance, Meat Quality, and Fatty Acid Profiles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A reduction in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) hospitalizations during the coronavirus pandemic has been previously documented. We aimed to describe the characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of AMI patients during the Covid-19 era compared to a recent previous registry. Methods: We conducted a prospective, multicenter, observational study involving 13 intensive cardiac care units (ICCUs) to evaluate consecutive AMI patients admitted throughout an 8-week period during the Covid-19 outbreak. Data were compared to the corresponding period in 2018 using an acute coronary syndrome survey conducted in all ICCUs in Israel. The primary end-point was defined as a composite of sustained ventricular arrhythmia, pulmonary congestion, and/or in-hospital mortality. Results: The study cohort comprised 1466 patients, of whom 774 (53%) were hospitalized during the Covid-19 outbreak. Overall, 841 patients were diagnosed with ST-elevation MI (STEMI): 424 (50.4%) during the Covid-19 era and 417 (49.6%) during the parallel period in 2018. No differences were detected in the admission rate of patients between the two study periods. STEMI patients admitted during the Covid-19 period tended to have fewer co-morbidities, but a higher Killip class (p value = 0.03). The median time from symptom onset to reperfusion was extended from 180 minutes (IQR 122-292) in 2018 to 290 minutes (IQR 161-1080, p<0.001) in 2020.

Conclusion: While the admission rate of AMI and STEMI in Israel remained similar during both the Covid-19 era and the corresponding period in 2018, total ischemic time extended significantly during the Covid-19 period, which translated into a more severe disease status upon hospital admission, and a higher rate of in-hospital adverse events.","output":"Acute myocardial infarction in the Covid-19 era: incidence, clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes - a multicenter registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we analyzed medical records of 40 patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), in order to explore the clinical efficacy of Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection in the treatment of COVID-19.

To prevent the microbiological contamination of livestock foods, synthetic preservatives, including nitrites, nitrates, and sorbates, have been widely used in the food industry due to their low cost and strong antibacterial activity. Use of synthetic chemical preservatives is recently being considered by customers due to concerns related to negative health issues. Therefore, the demand for natural substances as food preservatives has increased with the use of plant-derived and animal-derived products, and microbial metabolites. These natural preservatives inhibit the growth of spoilage microorganisms or food-borne pathogens by increasing the permeability of microbial cell membranes, interruption of protein synthesis, and cell metabolism. Natural preservatives can extend the shelf-life and inhibit the growth of microorganisms. However, they can also influence food sensory properties, including the flavor, taste, color, texture, and acceptability of food.

Only 253/880 (28.8%) procedures were performed by a trainee as the primary surgeon: 201/509 (39.4%) for urology, 21/235 (8.9%) for colorectal and 31/136 (22.8%) for upper GI. The likelihood of a trainee being the primary surgeon was reduced for major surgery (p<0.001) and for GI surgery when compared with urology (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Surgical training was facilitated at an elective surgery 'cold' site during the COVID-19 pandemic, but at lower levels than anticipated. Type of surgery influenced trainee participation. Surgical training should be incorporated into 'cold' site elective surgical services if trainees are to be prepared for the future.","output":"Surgical training during the COVID-19 pandemic at a designated 'cold' site: are we meeting the challenge?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contemporary medical reports from Britain and Germany on patients suffering from a pandemic infection between 1889 and 1891, which was historically referred to as the Russian flu, share a number of characteristics with COVID\\\\19.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified patients with a first-time acute cardiovascular admission in two periods: 1) January 2-October 16, 2019 and 2) January 2-October 15, 2020. Weekly incidence rates of a first-time cardiovascular admission, overall and according to subtypes, in the two periods were calculated. The incidence rate of first-time cardiovascular admissions overall was significantly lower during the first weeks of lockdown in 2020 compared with a similar period in 2019 but increased after the gradual reopening of the Danish society. A similar trend was observed for all subgroups of cardiovascular diseases. The mortality rate among patients admitted after March 12 was not significantly different in 2020 compared with 2019 (mortality rate ratio 0.98 [95% CI, 0.91-1.06]). CONCLUSIONS: In Denmark, we observed a substantial decrease in the rate of acute cardiovascular admissions, overall and according to subtypes, during the first weeks of lockdown. However, after the gradual reopening of the Danish society, the admission rates for acute cardiovascular diseases increased and returned to rates similar to those observed in 2019.

The GWAS approach has been successfully applied to primary glomerular disorders, providing numerous novel insights into the genetic architecture of IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. IgA nephropathy appears to have a highly complex polygenic architecture, with nearly 20 genome-wide significant loci of small to moderate effects discovered to date. In contrast, the genetic susceptibility to membranous nephropathy and steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome appears to be driven by a small number of large-effect loci. The MHC locus on chromosome 6p21 is strongly associated with genetic susceptibility to all major types of immune-mediated glomerulopathies. However, a distinct set of classical HLA alleles is associated with each individual disease type, pinpointing to specific immune mechanisms underlying each of these conditions. Additional insights from the discovery of non-HLA risk loci reinforced the role of innate and adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis of these disorders, and highlighted important susceptibility overlaps between glomerular and other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Despite these initial successes, much larger GWAS and sequencing studies are still needed for each individual glomerular disease type. Increased power will be critical to comprehensively test for genetic effects across the full spectrum of allelic frequencies, to detect gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, and to potentially improve the performance of polygenic risk predictors. Moreover, the existing studies are limited mostly to Europeans and East Asians, stressing the urgency to expand genetic discovery efforts to more diverse populations worldwide.","output":"GWAS-Based Discoveries in IgA Nephropathy, Membranous Nephropathy, and Steroid Sensitive Nephrotic Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use a county-level panel dataset from 2012 to 2018 to assess the impacts of various state policies on total and rural broadband availability in the United States.

However, electronic applications (apps) for the testing of ophthalmology vital signs, such as visual acuity, can be published and used without any verification of accuracy, validity, or reliability. Objective: To reassess the accuracy of visual acuity-testing apps and assess their viability for telehealth. Design, Setting, and Participants: The US Apple App Store was queried for apps for visual acuity testing. Anticipated optotype size for various visual acuity lines were calculated and compared against the actual measured optotype size on 4 different Apple hardware devices. No human participants were part of this study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean (SD) errors were calculated per device and across multiple devices. Results: On iPhones, 10 apps met inclusion criteria, with mean errors ranging from 0.2% to 109.9%. On the iPads, 9 apps met inclusion criteria, with mean errors ranging from 0.2% to 398.1%. Six apps met criteria and worked on both iPhone and iPad, with mean errors from 0.2% to 249.5%. Of the 6 apps that worked across devices, the top 3 most accurate apps were Visual Acuity Charts (mean [SD] error, 0.2% [0.0%]), Kay iSight Test Professional (mean [SD] error, 3.5% [0.7%]), and Smart Optometry (mean [SD] error, 15.9% [4.3%]). None of the apps tested were ideal for telemedicine, because some apps displayed accurate optotype size, while others displayed the same letters on separate devices; no apps exhibited both characteristics.

METHOD: This observational study comprises an open cohort of approximately 200,000 adults at high cardiovascular risk registered with general practitioners in five South East England Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). An intervention programme is planned in four of these CCGs with a further non-intervention CCG acting as a control group. The intervention will consist of: clinical guidelines and educational outreach; virtual patient-reviews software; peer-performance dashboards and, where available, financial incentives. The study will examine 3 primary outcomes: 1. Diagnosed hypertension with a blood pressure <140/90mmHg; 2. Diagnosed CVD on a high-intensity statin; 3. A cardiovascular indication for antithrombotic therapy with one or more factors for increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (e.g. age 65) on gastroprotection. A further 17 secondary outcomes related to these three aims will be assessed. ANALYSIS: We will use an interrupted time series analysis over 18 months, representing the pre-implementation, implementation and the post-implementation phases with comparison to the control CCG and applicable national Quality and Outcomes Framework and national prescribing statistics (e.g. OpenPrescribing). Secondary outcomes include an equity impact analysis with results stratified by age, gender, ethnic group and index of deprivation.

The nucleoside analog inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by competing with the usual counterpart adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The nucleoside analog is incorporated into the generating RNA strand and causes a delayed stop in the viral replication process.

Two authors independently screened the retrieved citations and extracted the data from the included studies. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussions between the authors. The findings were analyzed using thematic analysis and presented narratively. RESULTS: A total of 34 studies focusing on different digital courses were included in this review. Most of the studies (22/34, 65%) were published between 2010 and 2019 and originated in the United States (20/34, 59%). The reported digital health courses were mostly elective (20/34, 59%), were integrated into the existing curriculum (24/34, 71%), and focused mainly on medical informatics (17/34, 50%). Most of the courses targeted medical students from the first to third year (17/34, 50%), and the duration of the courses ranged from 1 hour to 3 academic years. Most of the studies (22/34, 65%) reported the use of blended education. A few of the studies (6/34, 18%) delivered courses entirely digitally by using online modules, offline learning, massive open online courses, and virtual patient simulations. The reported courses used various assessment approaches such as paper-based assessments, in-person observations, and online assessments. Most of the studies (30/34, 88%) evaluated courses mostly by using an uncontrolled before-and-after design and generally reported improvements in students learning outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health courses reported in literature are mostly elective, focus on a single area of digital health, and lack robust evaluation. They have diverse delivery, development, and assessment approaches. There is an urgent need for high-quality studies that evaluate digital health education.","output":"Digital Health Training Programs for Medical Students: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Gastrointestinal disorders are frequent in COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 has been hypothesized to impact on host microbial flora and gut inflammation, infecting intestinal epithelial cells. Since there are currently no coded therapies or guidelines for treatment of COVID-19, this study aimed to evaluate the possible role of a specific oral bacteriotherapy as complementary therapeutic strategy to avoid the progression of COVID-19. Methods: We provide a report of 70 patients positive for COVID-19, hospitalized between March 9th and April 4th, 2020. All the patients had fever, required non-invasive oxygen therapy and presented a CT lung involvement on imaging more than 50%. Forty-two patients received hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics, and tocilizumab, alone or in combination. A second group of 28 subjects received the same therapy added with oral bacteriotherapy, using a multistrain formulation. Results: The two cohorts of patients were comparable for age, sex, laboratory values, concomitant pathologies, and the modality of oxygen support. Within 72 h, nearly all patients treated with bacteriotherapy showed remission of diarrhea and other symptoms as compared to less than half of the not supplemented group. The estimated risk of developing respiratory failure was eight-fold lower in patients receiving oral bacteriotherapy. Both the prevalence of patients transferred to ICU and mortality were higher among the patients not treated with oral bacteriotherapy. Conclusions: A specific bacterial formulation showed a significant ameliorating impact on the clinical conditions of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results also stress the importance of the gut-lung axis in controlling the COVID-19 disease.","output":"Challenges in the Management of SARS-CoV2 Infection: The Role of Oral Bacteriotherapy as Complementary Therapeutic Strategy to Avoid the Progression of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of highly contagious diseases has put forward urgent requirements for high sensitivity and adaptive capacity of point-of-care testing (POCT). Herein, for the first time, we report an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) dye-energized light-initiated afterglow nanoprobes (named LiAGNPs), implemented onto a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test strip, for diagnosis of two highly contagious diseases, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as model validation. The primary working mechanism relies on the cyclically generated singlet oxygen ((1)O(2))-triggered time-resolved luminescent signals of LiAGNPs in which AIE dyes (TTMN) and chemiluminescent substrates (SO) are loaded. The designed LiAGNPs were found 2-fold and 32-fold sensitive than the currently used Eu(III)-based time-resolved fluorescent nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles in lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), respectively. In addition, the extra optical behaviors of nude color and fluorescence of LiAGNPs enable the LFIA platform with the capability of the naked eye and fluorescent detection to satisfy the applications under varying scenarios. In short, the versatile LiAGNPs have great potential as a novel time-resolved reporter in enhancing detection sensitivity and application flexibility with LFIA platform for rapid but sensitive infectious disease diagnostics.","output":"Engineering light-initiated afterglow lateral flow immunoassay for infectious disease diagnostics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has placed additional stressors on mothers during an already vulnerable lifecourse transition. Initial social distancing restrictions (Timepoint 1; T1) and initial changes to those social distancing restrictions (Timepoint 2; T2) have disrupted postpartum access to practical and emotional support. This qualitative study explores the postpartum psychological experiences of UK women during different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 women, approximately 30 days after initial social distancing guidelines were imposed in the UK (22 April 2020). A separate 12 women were interviewed approximately 30 days after the initial easing of social distancing restrictions (10 June 2020). Data were transcribed verbatim, uploaded into NVivo for management and analysis, which followed a recurrent cross-sectional approach to thematic analysis. RESULTS: Two main themes were identified for T1: Motherhood is Much Like Lockdown and A Self-Contained Family Unit. Each main T1 theme contained two sub-themes. Two main themes were also identified for T2: Incongruously Held Views of COVID-19 and Mothering Amidst the Pandemic. Each main T2 theme contained three sub-themes. Comparisons between data gathered at each timepoint identified increased emotional distress over time. Current findings call for the improvement of postpartum care by improving accessibility to social support, and prioritising the re-opening of schools, and face-to-face healthcare appointments and visitation. CONCLUSION: Social distancing restrictions associated with COVID-19 have had a cumulative, negative effect on postpartum mental health. Recommendations such as: Allowing mothers to bubble with a primary support provider even at their healthcare appointments; allowing one support partner to attend all necessary healthcare appointments; and providing tailored informational resources, may help to support postpartum emotional wellbeing during this, and similar health crises in the future.

Older adults are especially likely to develop depressive symptomatology. This study aims to investigate the association between physical activity intensities and sedentary behavior with depression levels among previously active older adults during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: A total of 1,123 physically active older Brazilian adults (67.68  5.91 years, 91.00% female) were interviewed by telephone in regard to sociodemographic, general health status, depression (GDS-15), and physical activity (IPAQ-SV) after being home-confined for 11.59  2.42 weeks. Participants were also asked to self-report changes in their physical activity levels and time spent sitting. Descriptive statistics (mean, frequencies), between-groups comparisons (t-tests and chi-square), and hierarchical regression analysis were used. RESULTS: About 83.80% of older adults self-reported a decrease in daily physical activity levels and 73.90% increased sitting time. Overall, depressive symptoms were observed in 30.40, and 20.80% met physical activity recommendations. Daily moderate ( = ?0.174; 95% CI = ?0.026; -0.012) and moderate-to-vigorous ( = ?0.183; 95% CI = ?0.023; 0.011) physical activity intensities were negatively associated with depression score explaining 2.6 and 2.9% of depression variability, respectively, after adjusting for age, gender, education level, body mass index, and polypharmacy. Daily walking and sitting time were not associated with the depression score (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results provide empiric suggestion supporting moderate to vigorous physical activity as a way to reduce depressive levels among older adults during COVID-19 confinement. Supervised home-based exercise programs, specifically designed for older adults, might be an important strategy to maintain and improve older adults mental health.","output":"Associations Between Depressive Symptoms and Physical Activity Intensity in an Older Adult Population During COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"News outlets are developing formats dedicated to social platforms that capture audience attention, such as Instagram stories, Facebook Instant articles, and YouTube videos. In some cases, these formats are created in collaboration with the tech companies themselves. At the same time, the use of data-driven storytelling is becoming increasingly integrated into the ever-complex business models of news outlets, generating more impact and visibility. Previous studies have focused on studying these two effects separately. To address this gap in the literature, this paper identifies and analyzes the use of data journalism on the Instagram content of AJ Labs, the team dedicated to producing data-driven and interactive stories for the Al Jazeera news network. Drawing upon a mixed-method approach, this study examines the use and characteristics of data stories on social media platforms. Results suggest that there is reliance on producing visual content that covers topics such as politics and violence. In general, AJ Labs relies on the use of infographics and produces its own unique data.

Accountability for Cancer Care through Undoing Racism and Equity (ACCURE) was an NIH-funded intervention that utilized an antiracism lens and community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches to address Black-White disparities in cancer treatment completion. ACCURE emphasized change at the institutional level of healthcare systems through two primary principles of antiracism organizing: transparency and accountability. ACCURE was successful in eliminating the treatment completion disparity and improved completion rates for breast and lung cancer for all participants in the study. The structural nature of the ACCURE intervention creates an opportunity for applications in other health outcomes, as well as within educational institutions that represent social determinants of health. We are focusing on the maternal healthcare and K-12 education systems in particular because of the dire racial inequities faced by pregnant people and school-aged children. In this article, we hypothesize cross-systems translation of a system-level intervention exploring how key characteristics of ACCURE can be implemented in different institutions. Using core elements of ACCURE (i.e., community partners, milestone tracker, navigator, champion, and racial equity training), we present a framework that extends ACCURE's approach to the maternal healthcare and K-12 school systems. This framework provides practical, evidence-based antiracism strategies that can be applied and evaluated in other systems to address widespread structural inequities.","output":"Expanding the Reach of an Evidence-Based, System-Level, Racial Equity Intervention: Translating ACCURE to the Maternal Healthcare and Education Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic requires a fast response from researchers to help address biological, medical, and public health issues to minimize its impact.

However, few studies have focused on humoral response after inactivated virus-based vaccines in KT. Here, we compare antibody response following vaccination with inactivated virus (Coronavac?) and BNT162b2 mRNA. METHODS: A national multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted. The study group was composed of patients from all KT centers in Uruguay, vaccinated between May 1(st)-May 31(st) (Coronavac? n = 245 and BNT162b2 n = 39). Control group was constituted by 82 healthy individuals. Participants had no prior confirmed COVID-19 test. Blood samples were collected between 30 and 40 days after second dose. Serum specific IgG antibodies against Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein were determined using COVID-19 IgG QUANT ELISA Kit. RESULTS: Only 29% of KT recipients showed seroconversion [36.5% BNT162b2, 27.8% inactivated virus, p = 0.248] in comparison to 100% in healthy control with either vaccine. Antibody levels against RBD were higher with BNT162b mRNA than with inactivated virus [173 (73C554) and 29 (11C70) BAU/mL, p < 0.034] in KT and 10 times lower than healthy control [inactivated virus: 308 (209C335) and BNT162b2: 2638 (2608C3808) BAU/mL, p < 0.034]. In multivariate analysis, variables associated with negative humoral response were age, triple immunosuppression, eGFR and time post-KT. CONCLUSION: Seroconversion was low in KT patients after vaccination with both platforms. Antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 were lower with inactivated virus than BNT162b mRNA.

Supramolecular nanostructures provide a flexible strategy for combinatorial regulation of glycemia. Here, we compare the effects of free insulin to insulin bound to positively charged nanofibers comprised of self-assembling amino acid compounds (AACs) with an antioxidant-modified side chain moiety (AAC2) in both in vitro and in vivo models of type 1 diabetes. Free AAC2, free human insulin (hINS) and AAC2-bound-human insulin (AAC2-hINS) were tested in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse model of type 1 diabetes. AAC2-hINS acted as a complex and exhibited different properties compared to free AAC2 or hINS. Mice treated with the AAC2-hINS complex were devoid of hypoglycemic episodes, had improved levels of insulin in circulation and in the brain, and increased expression of neurotransmitter taurine transporter, Slc6a6. Consequently, treatment with AAC2-hINS markedly advanced both physical and cognitive performance in mice with STZ-induced and genetic type 1 diabetes compared to treatments with free AAC2 or hINS. This study demonstrates that the flexible nanofiber AAC2 can serve as a therapeutic platform for the combinatorial treatment of diabetes and its complications.","output":"Amino Acid Nanofibers Improve Glycemia and Confer Cognitive Therapeutic Efficacy to Bound Insulin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article involved a broad search of applied sciences for milestone technologies we deem to be the most significant innovations applied by the North American pork industry, during the past 10 to 12 years. Several innovations shifted the trajectory of improvement or resolved significant production limitations. Each is being integrated into practice, with the exception being gene editing technology, which is undergoing the federal approval process. Advances in molecular genomics have been applied to gene editing for control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and to identify piglet genome contributions from each parent. Post-cervical artificial insemination technology is not novel, but this technology is now used extensively to accelerate the rate of genetic progress. A milestone was achieved with the discovery that dietary essential fatty acids, during lactation, were limiting reproduction. Their provision resulted in a dose-related response for pregnancy, pregnancy maintenance and litter size, especially in maturing sows and ultimately resolved seasonal infertility. The benefit of segregated early weaning (12 to 14 days of age) was realized for specific pathogen removal for genetic nucleus and multiplication. Application was premature for commercial practice, as piglet mortality and morbidity increased. Early weaning impairs intestinal barrier and mucosal innate immune development, which coincides with diminished resilience to pathogens and viability later in life. Two important milestones were achieved to improve precision nutrition for growing pigs. The first involved the updated publication of the National Research Council nutrient requirements for pigs, a collaboration between scientists from America and Canada. Precision nutrition advanced further when ingredient description, for metabolically available amino acids and net energy (by source plant), became a private sector nutrition product. The past decade also led to fortuitous discoveries of health-improving components in ingredients (xylanase, soybeans). Finally, two technologies converged to facilitate timely detection of multiple pathogens in a population: oral fluids sampling and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for pathogen analysis. Most critical diseases in North America are now routinely monitored by oral fluid sampling and prepared for analysis using PCR methods.","output":"Review: innovation through research in the North American pork industry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION This contribution gives an overview on estimating the economic impact of substance use (SU) and substance use disorders (SUDs) from a societal perspective.

In general, cost studies should not be limited to SUDs, but should also include costs related to the consequences of any type of SU to achieve a comprehensive picture of the societal burden. Further, estimating potentially avoidable costs will increase the value of cost studies. Importantly, methodologically sound cost studies shed light on the magnitude of societal problems related to SU and can be used as a reference point to evaluate regulatory policies and other preventive measures. The area of estimating potential economic benefits of SU is understudied and lacks a theoretical and methodological framework.

Preliminary in vitro screening of EVOO phenolic compounds library for ability to reverse PA toxicity on Schwann cells revealed PN and AC as potential hits. In a Swiss albino mouse model, AC significantly minimized the fatality after intra-peritoneal administration of PA fatal doses and normalized most biochemical factors by modulating the STAT1 expression.

Hence, even suspected HID cases should be managed in specialised facilities minimizing infection risks but allowing state-of-the-art critical care. Consensus statements on the operational management of isolation facilities have been published recently. The study presented was set up to compare the operational management, resources, and technical equipment among European isolation facilities. Due to differences in geography, population density, and national response plans it was hypothesized that adherence to recommendations will vary. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Until mid of 2010 the European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases conducted a cross-sectional analysis of isolation facilities in Europe, recruiting 48 isolation facilities in 16 countries. Three checklists were disseminated, assessing 44 items and 148 specific questions. The median feedback rate for specific questions was 97.9% (n = 47/48) (range: n = 7/48 (14.6%) to n = 48/48 (100%). Although all facilities enrolled were nominated specialised facilities' serving countries or regions, their design, equipment and personnel management varied. Eighteen facilities fulfilled the definition of a High Level Isolation Unit'. In contrast, 24 facilities could not operate independently from their co-located hospital, and five could not ensure access to equipment essential for infection control. Data presented are not representative for the EU in general, as only 16/27 (59.3%) of all Member States agreed to participate. Another limitation of this study is the time elapsed between data collection and publication; e.g. in Germany one additional facility opened in the meantime.

We aimed to evaluate the difference of clinical features in children with MP, according to their age and chest radiographic patterns. METHODS: The diagnosis of MP was made by examinations at both admission and discharge and by two serologic tests: the indirect microparticle agglutinin assay (1:40) and the cold agglutinins titer (1:32). A total of 191 children with MP were grouped by age: 2 years of age (29 patients), 3-5 years of age (81 patients), and 6 years of age (81 patients). They were also grouped by pneumonia pattern: bronchopneumonia group (96 patients) and segmental/lobar pneumonia group (95 patients). RESULTS: Eighty-six patients (45%) were seroconverters, and the others showed increased antibody titers during hospitalization. Among the three age groups, the oldest children showed the longest duration of fever, highest C-reactive protein (CRP) values, and the most severe pneumonia pattern. The patients with segmental/lobar pneumonia were older and had longer fever duration and lower white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte counts, compared with those with bronchopneumonia. The patient group with the most severe pulmonary lesions had the most prolonged fever, highest CRP, highest rate of seroconverters, and lowest lymphocyte counts. Thrombocytosis was observed in 8% of patients at admission, but in 33% of patients at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In MP, older children had more prolonged fever and more severe pulmonary lesions.

The survey measured stressors and 14 coping strategies grouped into two types, approach and avoidant. Substantial levels of stress were reported by teachers. Correlations show that positive psychological outcomes (wellbeing, health, happiness, resilience, and growth during trauma) correlated positively with approach coping and negatively with avoidant coping. Avoidant coping, however, consistently correlated (rs between .42 and .54) only with the negative outcomes (stress, anxiety, anger, sadness, and loneliness). In addition, ANOVA showed that although approach coping was consistently used across stress groups, avoidant coping increased as stress increased suggesting that there may be a cost to using avoidant coping strategies. Stepwise regression analyses using the 14 specific coping strategies showed a complex pattern of coping.

While reverse genetics systems have been established for various CoVs, none exist for ToVs. Herein, we developed a reverse genetics system using an infectious full-length cDNA clone of bovine ToV (BToV) in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Recombinant BToV harboring genetic markers had the same phenotype as wild-type (wt) BToV. To generate two types of recombinant virus, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene was edited, as cell-adapted wtBToV generally loses full-length HE (HEf), resulting in soluble HE (HEs). First, recombinant viruses with HEf and HA-tagged HEf or HEs genes were rescued. These exhibited no significant differences in their effect on virus growth in HRT18 cells, suggesting that HE is not essential for viral replication in these cells. Thereafter, we generated recombinant virus (rEGFP), wherein HE was replaced by the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene. The rEGFP expressed EGFP in infected cells, but showed significantly lower viral growth compared to wtBToV. Moreover, the rEGFP readily deleted the EGFP gene after one passage. Interestingly, rEGFP variants with two mutations (C1442F and I3562T) in non-structural proteins (NSPs) that emerged during passages exhibited improved EGFP expression, EGFP gene retention, and viral replication. An rEGFP into which both mutations were introduced displayed a similar phenotype to these variants, suggesting that the mutations contributed to EGFP gene acceptance. The current findings provide new insights into BToV, and reverse genetics will help advance the current understanding of this neglected pathogen. Importance ToVs are diarrhea-causing pathogens detected in various species, including humans. Through the development of a BAC-based BToV, we introduced the first reverse genetics system for Tobaniviridae. Utilizing this system, recombinant BToVs with a full-length HE gene were generated. Remarkably, although clinical BToVs generally lose the HE gene after a few passages, some recombinant viruses generated in the current study retained the HE gene for up to 20 passages while accumulating mutations in NSPs, which suggested that these mutations may be involved in HE gene retention. The EGFP gene of recombinant viruses was unstable, but rEGFP into which two NSP mutations were introduced exhibited improved EGFP expression, gene retention, and viral replication. These data suggested the existence of an NSP-based acceptance or retention mechanism for exogenous RNA or HE genes. Recombinant BToVs and reverse genetics are powerful tools for understanding fundamental viral processes, infection pathogenesis, and BToV vaccine development.","output":"Reverse Genetics with a Full-length Infectious cDNA Clone of Bovine Torovirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a new problem whose input data are two linear genomes together with two indexed gene subsequences of them, which asks to find a longest common exemplar subsequence of the two given genomes with a subsequence identical to the given indexed gene subsequences. We present an algorithm for this problem such that the algorithm is allowed to take diminishing time and space to solve the problem by setting the indexed genes with an incremental number. Although an incremental number of indexed genes were selected, the algorithm was verified definite to reach a solution whose length insistently comes very close to a real longest common exemplar subsequence of the two given genomes. Aiming at 23 human/gorilla chromosome pairs, the algorithm was examined for use in questing for longest common exemplar subsequences whose basic units are annotated genes as well as pseudo genes, namely consecutive DNA subsequences. By contrasting the pseudo gene common exemplar subsequences the algorithm had reached for the human chromosomes 7 and 16 and their gorilla homologues with those annotated genes in the human and gorilla chromosomes, we found more than 1 000 and 500 pseudo genes in the human chromosomes 7 and 16 that occur in the same order as they are in the gorilla chromosomes 7 and 16 and, do not overlap with any annotated gene. Author summary There is a benefit of the algorithm: It can reach a long enough common exemplar subsequence of two linear genomes in as fast a speed as one requires even if the given genomes would be equipped with too many duplicated genes, which can be done by setting incremental number of indexed genes. We developed a Java software based on the algorithm, that has been available for download on https://github.com/ShuZhang-sdu/LCES. Only in need to set the indexed gene sequences as null, was it verified successful for our algorithm to obtain the longest common exemplar subsequences of the annotated gene summary pairs extracted from 23 human/gorilla chromosome pairs. In convenience for researchers to find new motifs or conserved genes, we devoted for the algorithm to quest pseudo gene (i.e. consecutive DNA subsequences) summary pairs of the 23 human/gorilla chromosome pairs for solutions. There are 20 pseudo gene summary pairs whose longest common exemplar subsequences have been found by the algorithm with null indexed gene sequences. The other 3 pseudo gene summary pairs were verified solvable for the algorithm to reach their longest common exemplar subsequences that have to admit subsequences identical to given indexed gene subsequences. There were informed to exist 2 353 and 1 148 pseudo genes in the gorilla chromosome 7 and 16 that occur in the same order as they are in the human chromosome 7 and 16 and, do not overlap with any annotated gene.

French respondents (N = 430) filled in an online questionnaire during the first lockdown in Spring 2020. The results showed that the preference for solitude and personality variables of the Big Five predicted individuals mental health and creativity. Moreover, a cluster analysis revealed three profiles of individuals: Affiliation, Emotionally Stable Lonely and Emotionally Unstable Lonely. Results showed that individuals with Affiliation and Emotionally Unstable Lonely profiles expressed higher stress and anxiety, and the latter performed better on a divergent creative thinking task. By contrast, those with an Emotionally Stable Lonely profile expressed a lower level of loneliness, and performed better on a creative insight task. These findings reveal the importance of personality profiles in psychological reactions during lockdowns. With this knowledge, health professionals could develop appropriate interventions to accompany high-risk individuals in situations of social isolation.

It was first described more than a century ago, and scientists are acquiring new data and learning novel information about the disease every day. Although there are nuances and details continuously being unraveled, many key players were identified in the early 1900s by Dr. Oskar Fischer and Dr. Alois Alzheimer, including amyloid-beta (A), tau, vascular abnormalities, gliosis, and a possible role of infections. More recently, there has been growing interest in and appreciation for neurovascular unit dysfunction that occurs early in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) before and independent of A and tau brain accumulation. In the last decade, evidence that A and tau oligomers are antimicrobial peptides generated in response to infection has expanded our knowledge and challenged preconceived notions. The concept that pathogenic germs cause infections generating an innate immune response (e.g., A and tau produced by peripheral organs) that is associated with incident dementia is worthwhile considering in the context of sporadic AD with an unknown root cause. Therefore, the peripheral amyloid hypothesis to cognitive impairment and AD is proposed and remains to be vetted by future research. Meanwhile, humans remain complex variable organisms with individual risk factors that define their immune status, neurovascular function, and neuronal plasticity.

Responses of chemical fertilizer intensity first decrease and then increase subjected to the shocks from the urban population proportion and secondary and tertiary industry proportion. The intensity of agricultural plastic film use first increases and then decreases when receives the shocks from the urban population proportion which is the opposite to the response to the shock from the secondary and tertiary industry proportion. In addition, the responses of pesticide use intensity, chemical fertilizer use intensity and agricultural plastic film use intensity trend decrease following their own shocks after positive initial responses. The variance decomposition results demonstrate that the shocks due to pesticide use intensity, chemical fertilizer use intensity and agricultural plastic film use intensity generally explain the largest proportion of their own variation over the 10-year horizon. However, an increase in the urban population proportion plays a critical role in determining the variations of pesticide use intensity in late periods, it account for 56.88% the variations in the tenth period. And the contribution of the urban population proportion to the variations in agricultural plastic film use intensity increases consistently, it account for 33.74% of the variations in the tenth period.

Caring for patients during an epidemic/pandemic may impact negatively on the mental health of HCPs. There is a lack of evidence-based advice on what would be effective in mitigating this impact. Objectives: This rapid review synthesizes the evidence on the psychological impact of pandemics/epidemics on the mental health of HCPs, what factors predict this impact, and the evidence of prevention/intervention strategies to reduce this impact. Method: According to rapid review guidelines, systematic searches were carried out in Embase.com, PubMed, APA PsycINFO-Ovid SP, and Web of Science (core collection). Searches were restricted to the years 2003 or later to ensure inclusion of the most recent epidemic/pandemics, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Papers written in French or English, published in peer-reviewed journals, and of quantitative design using validated measures of mental health outcomes were included. Of 1308 papers found, 50 were included. The full protocol for this rapid review was registered with Prospero ( reg.no. CRD42020175985). Results: Results show that exposed HCPs working with patients during an epidemic/pandemic are at heightened risk of mental health problems in the short and longer term, particularly: psychological distress, insomnia, alcohol/drug misuse, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, burnout, anger, and higher perceived stress. These mental health problems are predicted by organizational, social, personal, and psychological factors and may interfere with the quality of patient care. Few evidence-based early interventions exist so far. Discussion: HCPs need to be provided with psychosocial support to protect their mental wellbeing if they are to continue to provide high quality patient care.

Transmission of the virus to humans, for example via undercooked meat, may cause acute or chronic hepatitis. To determine sources and routes of infection, comparing the viruses present in humans to the ones present in main hosts is a helpful tool. However, it requires knowledge of the genetic diversity of the circulating viruses. Therefore, we tested Swiss pigs and wild boars for HEV and determined the virus subtype and part of its genome. In addition, we determined the HEV subtype present in 11 positive meat products. One pig liver from the slaughterhouses (0.3%) and seven livers from a carcass collection (13%) as well as seven wild boar livers (5.8%) were found HEV positive. The same virus subtypes were found in Swiss pigs, wild boars, and meat products. Most of the viruses belonged to a Swiss-specific cluster within the subtype 3h. In addition, one pig liver and one wild boar liver were found positive for 3l and two meat products from Germany for 3c. Our data indicate that Switzerland has its own HEV viruses that circulate independent from the rest of Europe. ABSTRACT: Hepatitis E caused by hepatitis E viruses of the genotype 3 (HEV-3) is a major health concern in industrialized countries and due to its zoonotic character requires a One Health approach to unravel routes and sources of transmission. Knowing the viral diversity present in reservoir hosts, i.e., pigs but also wild boars, is an important prerequisite for molecular epidemiology. The aim of this study was to gain primary information on the diversity of HEV-3 subtypes present along the food chain in Switzerland, as well as the diversity within these subtypes. To this end, samples of domestic pigs from slaughterhouses and carcass collection points, as well as from hunted wild boars, were tested for HEV RNA and antibodies. HEV positive meat products were provided by food testing labs. The HEV subtypes were determined using Sanger and next generation sequencing. The genetic analyses confirmed the predominance of a Swiss-specific cluster within subtype HEV-3h in pigs, meat products, and wild boars. This cluster, which may result from local virus evolution due to the isolated Swiss pig industry, supports fast differentiation of domestic and imported infections with HEV.","output":"Genetic Diversity of Hepatitis E Virus Type 3 in SwitzerlandFrom Stable to Table"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The tourism sector in general and the hotelier in particular face the challenge of managing appropriate measures to deal with the covid-19 pandemic.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 910 trials retrieved on August 7, 2020. Results: A total of 910 registered clinical trials with at least one drug intervention were evaluated. The number of registrations (32.4%, 295) from the United States accounted for nearly one-third of the total and far exceeded that of other countries individually. Furthermore, the peak number of trials were registered in April (34.3%, 312). Over half of the trials (51.2%, 466) are in the recruitment phase, and only 4.2% (38) of the trials have been completed. The median (interquartile range) estimated enrollment is 127 (59, 365). In 39% (355) of trials, the estimated enrollment is less than 100 participants. A total of 94.5% (790) of the trials use randomization in the allocation, 82.7% (753) use a parallel intervention mode, and 52.2% (475) use masking. A total of 287 drug names have been standardized and mapped. \\"Hydroxychloroquine\\" is the leading drug among the registered trials (7.47%, 68). Among the main countries contributing to investigations on \\"hydroxychloroquine\\", the United States ranks first with 36.76% (25) of the trials. Conclusion: The designs of COVID-19 clinical drug trials have greatly improved in terms of the implementation of randomization and, particularly, blinding methods. In terms of drug reuse, the number of drug types has greatly increased, and hundreds of drugs have been used for efficacy screening. The emergence of large-sample registration trials is expected to address the uncertainty regarding the current clinical efficacy of some drugs.","output":"COVID-19 Clinical Trials Registered Worldwide for Drug Intervention: An Overview and Characteristic Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Shock and organ damage occur in critically ill patients in the emergency department because of biological responses to invasion, and cytokines play an important role in their development. It is important to predict early multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) because it is useful in predicting patient outcomes and selecting treatment strategies. This study examined the accuracy of biomarkers, including interleukin (IL)-6, in predicting early MOD in critically ill patients compared with that of quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA). METHODS: This was a multicenter observational sub-study. Five universities from 2016 to 2018. Data of adult patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome who presented to the emergency department or were admitted to the intensive care unit were prospectively evaluated. qSOFA score and each biomarker (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin [PCT]) level were assessed on Days 0, 1, and 2. The primary outcome was set as MOD on Day 2, and the area under the curve (AUC) was analyzed to evaluate qSOFA scores and biomarker levels. RESULTS: Of 199 patients, 38 were excluded and 161 were included. Patients with MOD on Day 2 had significantly higher qSOFA, SOFA, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores and a trend toward worse prognosis, including mortality. The AUC for qSOFA score (Day 0) that predicted MOD (Day 2) was 0.728 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.651C0.794). IL-6 (Day 1) showed the highest AUC among all biomarkers (0.790 [95% CI: 0.711C852]). The combination of qSOFA (Day 0) and IL-6 (Day 1) showed improved prediction accuracy (0.842 [95% CI: 0.771C0.893]). The combination model using qSOFA (Day 1) and IL-6 (Day 1) also showed a higher AUC (0.868 [95% CI: 0.799C0.915]). The combination model of IL-8 and PCT also showed a significant improvement in AUC. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of IL-6, IL-8 and PCT to qSOFA scores improved the accuracy of early MOD prediction.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in a global pandemic, which led to deferral of elective surgeries including breast surgeries for early stage breast cancer patients during March-June 2020. Institutional guidelines were developed based on societal recommendations, including NCCN, to use NET as a bridge to surgery. Objective: Primary objective was to establish a database of early stage HR+ Her2/neu-breast cancer patients diagnosed during COVID-19 who were treated with NET as a bridge to surgery. Secondary endpoints include correlation between duration of NET and changes in pathological variables. Method: This was a single institution, retrospective observational study from Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone Hospital and NYU Langone Hospital-Long Island of DCIS and early stage breast cancer patients diagnosed from March 15, 2020-June 1, 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic. Inclusion criteria were males and females older than 18 years of age and initial diagnosis of DCIS or early stage HR+ Her2/neu-breast cancer who did not require neoadjuvant chemotherapy by established guidelines. Descriptive statistics were calculated separately by DCIS and invasive breast cancer using SAS version 9.4. Results: From March 15-S June 1, 2020, 13 patients who were diagnosed with DCIS and 41 patients with early stage HR+ Her2/neu-invasive breast cancer received NET (Table 1). Of the 41 patients with invasive breast cancer, 19 (46%) had Oncotype DX assay on biopsy specimens;12/19 (63%) had scores 10-14 and 7/19 (37%) had scores 15-25. 38/41 (92.7%) had post-surgery Ki-67% and 16/38 (42.1%) demonstrated maturation arrest (Ki-67 <2.7%). 26/41 (63%) invasive breast cancer patients had pre and post Ki-67% checked while on aromatase inhibitors (AI);21/26 (81%) had a decrease in Ki-67%, 2/26 (7.7%) patients had no change, and 3/26 (11.5%) had an increase. Of those 21 patients, the percent change of Ki-67% from baseline was mean 69.15%  22.58 and median 71.83%. No significant associations with changes (pre to post) in Ki-67%, T stage, ER% and PR% in NET for 4 weeks and >4 weeks (Table 2). Median duration of NET in invasive breast cancer was 6.85 weeks. 1 patient had a complete pathological response after NET and 2 patients were upstaged from DCIS to invasive carcinoma at the time of surgery. Conclusion: While the sample sizes are small, this is a unique cohort of early stage surgically resectable breast cancer patients who were treated with NET during the COVID-19 pandemic. This real-world data confirms pathological changes, especially decrease in Ki-67% even with short duration use of NET that has been reported in trials of neoadjuvant AI.

There is an abundance of literature relating to the preventative nature of breastmilk and breastfeeding against many infectious diseases and chronic conditions. However, despite medically complex infants and children being a group that could benefit most from continued breastfeeding, breastfeeding duration and exclusivity are lower among more complex paediatric populations. The reasons for this are not well known, and there is a paucity of data relating to supporting infants who have acute or chronic illness, disability or congenital anomaly to breastfeed. This systematic review aimed to understand the challenges of breast/chestfeeding the medically complex child and to establish the gaps in healthcare provision that act as barriers to optimal infant and young child feeding. The search was limited to studies published in English, focused on breastfed sick infants in hospital, with no date limits as there is no previous systematic review. Of 786 papers retrieved, 11 studies were included for review, and seven themes identified. Themes included practical and psychological challenges of continuing to breastfeed in a hospital setting, complications of the condition making breastfeeding difficult, lack of specialist breastfeeding support from hospital staff and a lack of availability of specialist equipment to support complex breastfeeding. The findings affirm the lack of consistent high-quality care for lactation support in paediatric settings and reinforce the need for further focused research in this area.","output":"The challenges of medically complex breastfed children and their families: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is straining health systems globally.

DATA SOURCES: The following PubMed literature search terms were used from July 2020 to January 2, 2021: diabetes, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), glucose-lowering agents, and pharmacology. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: English-language studies reporting on the association between diabetes, COVID-19 adverse outcomes, and the potential roles of glucose-lowering agents were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Selected glucose-lowering agents have benefits beyond glycemic control, with the potential to reduce the risks of severe complications during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Key benefits include anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, immune modulating, and enzyme/receptor effects. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review summarizes the current knowledge of glucose-lowering agents and their potential roles in COVID-19 outcomes. Considering beneficial mechanisms on COVID-19 outcomes that extend beyond glycemic control as well as safety profiles, current data suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors and metformin may have the most promise and warrant further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Certain glucose-lowering agents may offer additional benefits beyond glucose control-namely, by modulating the mechanisms contributing to adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. DPP-IV inhibitors and metformin appear to have the most promise. However, current published literature on diabetes medications and COVID-19 should be interpreted with caution. Most published studies are retrospective and consist of convenience samples, and some lack adequate analytical approaches with confounding biases.

Tracheostomies improve outcomes and decrease length of stay for COVID-19 patients. Our objectives are to determine if (1) COVID-19 tracheostomies have similar complication and mortality rates as non-COVID-19 tracheostomies and (2) to determine the effectiveness of our tracheostomy protocol at a safety net hospital. METHODS Patients who underwent tracheostomy at Los Angeles County Hospital between August 2009 and August 2020 were included. Demographics, SARS-CoV-2 status, body mass index (BMI), Charlson Co-morbidity Index (CCI), length of intubation, complication rates, decannulation rates, and 30-day all-cause mortality versus tracheostomy related mortality rates were all collected. RESULTS Thirty-eight patients with COVID-19 and 130 non-COVID-19 patients underwent tracheostomies. Both groups were predominately male with similar BMI and CCI, though the COVID-19 patients were more likely to be Hispanic and intubated for a longer time (P = .034 and P < .0001, respectively). Both groups also had similar, low intraoperative complications at 2% to 3% and comparable long-term post-operative complications. However, COVID-19 patients had more perioperative complications within 7 days of surgery (P < .01). Specifically, they were more likely to have perioperative bleeding at their tracheostomy sites (P = .03) and long-term post-operative mucus plugging (P < .01). However, both groups had similar 30-day mortality rates. There were no incidences of COVID-19 transmission to healthcare workers. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 tracheostomies are safe for patients and healthcare workers. Careful attention should be paid to suctioning to prevent mucus plugging.

So far, the COVID-19 has caused more than 2 million deaths worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 contains the Spike (S) glycoprotein on its surface, which is the main target for current vaccine development because antibodies directed against this protein can neutralize the infection. Companies and academic institutions have developed vaccines based on the S glycoprotein, as well as its antigenic domains and epitopes, which have been proven effective in generating neutralizing antibodies. However, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants could affect the effectiveness of vaccines. Here, we review the different types of vaccines designed and developed against SARS-CoV-2, placing emphasis on whether they are based on the complete S glycoprotein, its antigenic domains such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or short epitopes within the S glycoprotein.

With the experiences of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 and commitments to ensure guests' health and safety, many hotels in Asia have actively engaged in updating and implementing new service standards and measures. This study aims to investigate hotels' service standard changes, processes of management decisions and preparations for the future. Design/methodology/approach: Using grounded theory methodology, this research interviews 24 hotel managers from mainland China and Hong Kong. It examines the differences among hotels with different operation types, classifications and locations, and analyzes the service standards in physical and social services cape. Findings: Building on the service marketing and crisis management literature, this research provides a synthesis that reflects how hotels have coped with the COVID-19 crisis. It depicts the service standard update process during the COVID-19. Research limitations/implications: In line with the literature in disaster management, hotels experienced the outbreak, response and recovery phases of the crisis management procedure. However, given the severity and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, undertaking particular processes is necessary at every procedure such as following local guidelines and updating local standard operating procedures (LSOPs). This research also expands the literature on the process of adopting new technology in hotels during crisis management. Practical implications: The paper suggests that hotel managers should update and use well-thoughtout standards on the bases of available scientific evidence. For example, hotels should use LSOPs according to the local situations. Hotels are also suggested to exert additional efforts and attention in service innovation, guest experience and enhancing hospitableness. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is one of the first efforts to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on hotel operations. It offers empirical evidence from hotel operators who worked against the crisis during the pandemic and provides valuable theoretical contribution to the hospitality service literature as well as managerial implications for hotel operators globally.","output":"Updates in service standards in hotels: how COVID-19 changed operations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Bariatric surgery is known as the most effective treatment resulting in long-term weight loss for obesity. However, behavioral changes, including food preference, food allergies, and consumption, between groups of patients who underwent bariatric surgery in comparison with people who did not have bariatric surgery have not been fully discussed in the literature. Objective: The aim of this article is to describe patient-reported changes of perception related to food preferences, consumption, and food allergies in participants who underwent bariatric surgery and to compare their food consumption with participants who did not have bariatric surgery in Saudi Arabia. Methodology: This study is a secondary analysis of the Sharik Diet and Health National Survey (SDHNS) conducted in July 2021. Quota sampling was utilized to generate balanced distributions of participants by age and gender across all administrative regions of Saudi Arabia. Data collection included sociodemographic information (age, gender, and educational level), as well as food habits and the consumption of various food categories. Results: Of the 6267 potential participants contacted in 2021 from the 13 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia, 5228 successfully completed the interview, with a response rate of 83.4%. Gender was distributed equally among the total participants in the sample. The prevalence of bariatric surgeries in Saudi Arabia was estimated at around 4.1% of the total sample. More than 36% of people who had bariatric surgery experienced food taste changes, and around 15% reported a decrease in allergic reactions to food. Moreover, 68.1% had food preference changes, either starting to favor a new food or no longer favoring one. There was a significant association between consuming more red meat, chicken, and energy drinks and a decreased consumption of grains and rice among those who had the bariatric surgery compared with those who did not. Conclusions: This study found that more than two-thirds of people who had bariatric surgery self-reported food taste and food preference changes.

In this regard, the relevance of the topic is due to the need to study the use of digital technologies (DT) to create anti-turbulent conditions in the mode of effective business activity and economy in general, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. DT is the subject of countless discussions and publications about its effects. The aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework that reveals the value of DT, which is not in the DT models themselves, but in the ability of organizations to use them.

This study examines health inequality by SES amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its underlying mechanisms in Wuhan, China's epicenter. Using survey data collected in the city during the lockdown period from February 20 to March 6, 2020, we identify two ways in which SES shapes health inequalities-vulnerability and resilience to COVID-19. First, higher SES is associated with a lower risk of infection for both survey respondents and their family members. Second, higher SES reduces mental distress during the pandemic, and this protective effect is particularly strong for individuals who contract the virus or who have family members infected with the disease. Mediation analysis further illustrates that SES shapes the risk of infection and mental distress primarily through three channels: access to daily essential and protective supplies, employment status, and the community environment. These findings lend support to the fundamental cause theory that links socioeconomic differentials to health inequality in a unique context. The outbreak of COVID-19 magnifies pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities.","output":"Two Tales of One City: Unequal Vulnerability and Resilience to COVID-19 by Socioeconomic Status in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although Russia and the Baltics have historically been economic partners, the economic relations between them are tense today. Nearly stagnating bilateral trade contributes little to the development of either side. The Baltics-Russian bilateral trade conducted within global value chains (GVCs) and operations of multinational companies is much more resistant to geopolitical and economic shocks than traditional international trade. For instance, the accession of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to the EU and NATO in 2004 and the introduction of reciprocal EU-Russia sanctions in 2014 did not curb GVC activities between Russia and the Baltics.

Studies have shown a circadian regulation of many aspects of immunity. Immune cells have intrinsic clock mechanisms, and innate and adaptive immune responses - such as leukocyte migration, magnitude of inflammation, cytokine production and cell differentiation - are under circadian control. This circadian regulation has consequences for infections including parasitic infections. In the context of Leishmania infection, the circadian clock within host immune cells modulates the magnitude of the infection and the inflammatory response triggered by the parasite. As for malaria, rhythms within the immune system were shown to impact the developmental cycles of Plasmodium parasites within red blood cells. Further, host circadian rhythms impact infections by multicellular parasites; for example, infection with helminth Trichuris muris shows different kinetics of worm expulsion depending on time of day of infection, a variation that depends on the dendritic cell clock. Although the research on the circadian control of immunity in the context of parasitic infections is in its infancy, the research reviewed here suggests a crucial involvement of host circadian rhythms in immunity on the development and progression of parasitic infections.","output":"The involvement of host circadian clocks in the regulation of the immune response to parasitic infections in mammals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Until very recently, vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had not been authorized for emergency use in persons younger than 16 years of age. Safe, effective vaccines are needed to protect this population, facilitate in-person learning and socialization, and contribute to herd immunity. METHODS: In this ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded trial, we randomly assigned participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive two injections, 21 days apart, of 30 g of BNT162b2 or placebo. Noninferiority of the immune response to BNT162b2 in 12-to-15-year-old participants as compared with that in 16-to-25-year-old participants was an immunogenicity objective. Safety (reactogenicity and adverse events) and efficacy against confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19; onset, &#8805;7 days after dose 2) in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 2260 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age received injections; 1131 received BNT162b2, and 1129 received placebo. As has been found in other age groups, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety and side-effect profile, with mainly transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity (predominantly injection-site pain [in 79 to 86% of participants], fatigue [in 60 to 66%], and headache [in 55 to 65%]); there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events and few overall severe adverse events. The geometric mean ratio of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers after dose 2 in 12-to-15-year-old participants relative to 16-to-25-year-old participants was 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47 to 2.10), which met the noninferiority criterion of a lower boundary of the two-sided 95% confidence interval greater than 0.67 and indicated a greater response in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort. Among participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, no Covid-19 cases with an onset of 7 or more days after dose 2 were noted among BNT162b2 recipients, and 16 cases occurred among placebo recipients. The observed vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI, 75.3 to 100).

This disease poses an extraordinary challenge for public health systems because screening and surveillance capacity is often severely limited, especially during the beginning of the outbreak; this can fuel the outbreak, as many patients can unknowingly infect other people. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect and analyze posts related to COVID-19 on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like social media site in China. To our knowledge, this infoveillance study employs the largest, most comprehensive, and most fine-grained social media data to date to predict COVID-19 case counts in mainland China. METHODS: We built a Weibo user pool of 250 million people, approximately half the entire monthly active Weibo user population. Using a comprehensive list of 167 keywords, we retrieved and analyzed around 15 million COVID-19-related posts from our user pool from November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. We developed a machine learning classifier to identify \\"sick posts,\\" in which users report their own or other people's symptoms and diagnoses related to COVID-19. Using officially reported case counts as the outcome, we then estimated the Granger causality of sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts. For a subset of geotagged posts (3.10% of all retrieved posts), we also ran separate predictive models for Hubei province, the epicenter of the initial outbreak, and the rest of mainland China. RESULTS: We found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts up to 14 days ahead of official statistics, whereas other COVID-19 posts did not have similar predictive power. For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China regardless of the unequal distribution of health care resources and the outbreak timeline. CONCLUSIONS: Public social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and inform timely responses. Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19. In addition to monitoring overall search and posting activities, leveraging machine learning approaches and theoretical understanding of information sharing behaviors is a promising approach to identify true disease signals and improve the effectiveness of infoveillance.","output":"Using Reports of Symptoms and Diagnoses on Social Media to Predict COVID-19 Case Counts in Mainland China: Observational Infoveillance Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of COVID-19 initially appeared to cause only a mild illness in children. However, it is now apparent that a small percentage of children can develop a hyperinflammatory syndrome labeled as Pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrometemporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) with a phenotype resembling Kawasaki disease (KD) ('Kawa-COVID-19). Features of this newly recognized condition may include fever, hypotension, severe abdominal pain and cardiac dysfunction, evidence of inflammation, and single or multi organ dysfunction in the absence of other known infections. Children emerge to have mild symptoms compared to adults, perhaps due to reduced expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptor (the target of SARS-CoV-2) gene, trained innate immunity, and a young and fit immune system. Some of these children may share features of Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome or cytokine storm syndrome. They can deteriorate rapidly and may need intensive care support as well. The PCR test is more often negative although most of the children have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Although the pathogenesis is not clearly known, immune-mediated injury has been implicated.","output":"Clinical Characteristics of Paediatric Hyperinflammatory Syndrome in the Era of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and canine coronavirus were studied with respect to their serological cross-reactivity in homologous and heterologous virus neutralization, immune precipitation of radiolabeled TGEV, electroblotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using individual virion polypeptides prepared by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. TGEV was neutralized by feline anti-FIPV serum, and the reaction was potentiated by complement; heterologous neutralization involved antibody reacting with the peplomer protein (P), the envelope protein (E), and cellular (glycolipid) components incorporated into the TGEV membrane. Electrophoretic analysis of immune precipitates containing [35S]methionine-labeled disrupted TGEV and feline anti-FIPV antibody confirmed the reaction with the P and E polypeptides and showed the nucleocapsid protein (N) in addition. Electroblotting, followed by incubation with antibody, 125I-labeled protein A, and fluorography, disclosed cross-reactions between the three viruses at the N and E levels and revealed differences in the apparent molecular weights of the latter. Enzyme immunoassays performed with standard amounts of immobilized P, N, and E polypeptides of the three viruses showed recognition of the antigens by homologous and heterologous antibody to comparable degrees. These results indicate a close antigenic relationship between TGEV, FIPV, and canine coronavirus due to common determinants on the three major virion proteins.

AKI induces microbiota alteration in the gastrointestinal (GI) system, while gut dysbiosis also aggravates AKI. The interplay between AKI and gut dysbiosis is not yet well clarified but worthy of further investigation. The current review focuses on the pathophysiology of this bidirectional interplay and AKI treatment in this base. Both macrophages and neutrophils of the innate immunity and the T helper type 17 cell from the adaptive immunity are the critical players of AKI-induced gut dysbiosis. Conversely, dysbiosis-induced overproduction of gut-derived uremic toxins and insufficient generation of short-chain fatty acids are the main factors deteriorating AKI. Many novel treatments are proposed to deter AKI progression by reforming the GI microbiome and breaking this vicious cycle. Data support the benefits of probiotic treatment in AKI patients, while the results of postbiotics are mainly limited to animals. Prebiotics and synbiotics are primarily discussed in chronic kidney disease patients rather than AKI patients. The effect of adsorbent treatment seems promising, but more studies are required before the treatment can be applied to patients.

WPA2/WPA3 solutions take user interaction and a strong passphrase for granted. However, the often weak passphrases are subject to guessing attacks. Notably, there has been a significant rise of cyberattacks on Wi-Fi home or small office networks during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper addresses the device provisioning problem in Wi-Fi (personal mode) and proposes ComPass protocol to supplement WPA2/WPA3. ComPass replaces the pre-installed or user-selected passphrases with automatically generated ones. For this, ComPass employs Physical Layer Security and extracts credentials from common random physical layer parameters between devices. Two major features make ComPass unique and superior compared to previous proposals: First, it employs phase information (rather than amplitude or signal strength) to generate the passphrase so that it is robust, scaleable, and impossible to guess. Our analysis showed that ComPass generated passphrases have 3 times more entropy than human generated passphrases (113-bits vs. 34-bits). Second, ComPass selects parameters such that two devices bind only within a certain proximity (less than 3m), hence providing practically useful in-build PLS-based authentiation.

Media reports have suggested that the wave of the alpha variant in the Spring of 2021 in the US caused more cases among younger patients and racial and ethnic subgroups. ApproachWe analyzed electronic health record data from a multihospital health system to test whether younger patients accounted for more cases and more severe disease, and whether racial disparities are widening. We compared demographics, patient characteristics, and hospitalization variables for patients admitted from November 2020 through January 2021 to those admitted in March and April 2021. ResultsWe analyzed data for 37, 502 unique inpatients and outpatients at 21 hospitals from November 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021. Compared to patients from November through January, those with positive tests in March and April were younger and less likely to die. Among patients under age 50, those with positive tests in March and April were three times as likely to be hospitalized and twice as likely to require ICU admission or mechanical ventilation. Individuals identified as Black represented a greater proportion of cases and hospitalizations in March and April as compared to November through January. ConclusionsWe found that relative COVID-19 hospitalization rates for younger individuals and individuals identified as Black were rising over time.

Confessing to being a victim of FSA is infrequent and often met with incredulity. Identifying as such a victim is thus often a response to an incitement to speak in the mode of confession. Interviews producing the possibility for such confessions were conducted with ten self-identified South African FSA victims and then analysed using a Foucauldian approach. In identifying as victims of FSA the participants drew on psychologised, gendered accounts of damage reflected in trauma, revictimisation, memory loss, the cycle of abuse and deviance. An analysis of these accounts demonstrates how confessional sites, such as the (psychological) interview, anchor victim worthiness in damage so that non-normative victims of violence are able to see themselves in sexual violence discourse as forever compromised subjects whose healing requires rethinking the relationship between gender, sexuality, and violence in contemporary South Africa.","output":"Confession, psychology and the shaping of subjectivity through interviews with victims of female-perpetrated sexual violence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic as declared by World Health Organization (WHO).

However, the efficacy and safety of HCQ and/or AZM have been questioned by recent clinical reports. Direct effects of these drugs on the human heart remain very poorly defined. To better understand the mechanisms of action of HCQ +/?

Our hvCTS experiments showed that AZM induced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect which could be aggravated by HCQ; electrophysiologically, as revealed by the hvCAS platform, AZM prolonged action potentials and induced spiral wave formations. Collectively, our data were consistent with reported clinical risks of HCQ and AZM on QTc prolongation/ventricular arrhythmias and development of heart failure. In conclusion, our study exposed the risks of HCQ/AZM administration while providing mechanistic insights for their toxicity.

Despite its widespread use, it damages healthy tissues such as skin. The goal of this study was to prove that the real impact of paclitaxel-induced skin toxicity could be underestimated because the adverse events might appear asymptomatic. METHODS: Gynecological cancer patients were recruited. Skin parameters measurements were taken after three and six paclitaxel cycles. Measurements were conducted using specific probes which measure hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), sebum, elasticity and firmness, erythema, roughness, smoothness, skin thickness, and desquamation levels. Further, a 3D epidermis model was incubated with paclitaxel to analyze gene and protein expression of aquaporin 3, collagen type 1, elastin, and fibronectin. RESULTS: Paclitaxel induced alterations in the skin parameters with no visible clinical manifestations. Gynecological cancer patients under paclitaxel treatment had a decrease in hydration, TEWL, sebum, elasticity, and thickness of the skin, while erythema, roughness, and desquamation were increased. The molecular markers, related to hydration and the support of the skin layers, and analyzed in the 3D epidermis model, were decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that paclitaxel modifies gene and protein expression of skin-related molecular markers, and impairs different physical, physiological, and biomechanical properties of the skin of cancer patients at a subclinical level.","output":"Paclitaxel Induces Epidermal Molecular Changes and Produces Subclinical Alterations in the Skin of Gynecological Cancer Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter discusses the ways in which viral replication damages tissues and organs and the ways in which the body's own responses may cause damage. It presents examples illustrating the pathogenesis of four basic kinds of acute viral infection: respiratory, intestinal, generalized, and neurological. As the immune system plays a key role in protection against infections, viral damage to its components can exacerbate the severity of disease or predispose to superinfection with other viral or nonviral agents. Both specific acquired immunodeficiency and generalized immunosuppression can occur in viral infections. The immune response to viral infection may itself frequently contribute to the pathology of the disease. Inflammation with accompanying cellular infiltration is a regular feature of viral infection. Such common signs as erythema, edema, and enlargement of lymph nodes have an immunological basis. There are viral diseases in which the cardinal manifestations are caused by the body's immune response. Immunopathological (hypersensitivity) reactions are traditionally classified into types 1, 2, 3, and 4. For most viral infections, it is not known whether immunopathological effects make a significant contribution to disease and if so then as to which of the four classical hypersensitivity reactions is implicated. It is instructive to speculate about the possible involvement of different kinds of hypersensitivity reactions in viral diseases.","output":"Mechanisms of Disease Production: Acute Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 5 million deaths and 250 million infections worldwide. Despite successful vaccination efforts and emergency approval of small molecule therapies, a diverse range of antivirals is still needed to combat the inevitable resistance that will arise from new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (M(pro)) is an attractive drug target due to the clinical success of protease inhibitors against other viruses, such as HIV and HCV. However, in order to combat resistance, various chemical scaffolds need to be identified that have the potential to be developed into potent inhibitors. To this end, we screened a high-content protease inhibitor library against M(pro)in vitro, in order to identify structurally diverse compounds that could be further developed into antiviral leads. Our high-content screening efforts retrieved 27 hits each with >50% inhibition in our M(pro) FRET assay. Of these, four of the top inhibitor compounds were chosen for follow-up due to their potency and drugability (Lipinskis rules of five criteria): anacardic acid, aloesin, aloeresin D, and TCID. Further analysis via dose response curves revealed IC(50) values of 6.8 M, 38.9 M, 125.3 M, and 138.0 M for each compound, respectively. Molecular docking studies demonstrated that the four inhibitors bound at the catalytic active site of M(pro) with varying binding energies (-7.5 to -5.6 kcal/mol). Furthermore, M(pro) FRET assay kinetic studies demonstrated that M(pro) catalysis is better represented by a sigmoidal Hill model than the standard Michaelis-Menten hyperbola, indicating substantial cooperativity of the active enzyme dimer. This result suggests that the dimerization interface could be an attractive target for allosteric inhibitors. In conclusion, we identified two closely-related natural product compounds from the Aloe plant (aloesin and aloeresin D) that may serve as novel scaffolds for M(pro) inhibitor design and additionally confirmed the strongly cooperative kinetics of M(pro) proteolysis. These results further advance our knowledge of structure-function relationships in M(pro) and offer new molecular scaffolds for inhibitor design.","output":"Identification of Aloe-derived natural products as prospective lead scaffolds for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many services attempted to quickly transition to a remote format. A need to validate remote delivery of neuropsychological measures arose. TestMyBrain (TMB) from the Many Brains Project has been utilizing teleneuropsychology in research since 2017. Method Volunteer research participants (N = 147, Mage = 29, Medu = 15 years, 64.7% white, 54.2% female, 83.2% right-handed, 52.1% utilized Mac Operating System) were administered TMB Verbal Paired Associates(TMBVPA) and WMS-IV Verbal Paired Associates I(VPAI) as part of a larger battery of test via zoom. The WMS-IV assessments adhered to standardization as much as possible such as limiting potential distractions. Results A correlation revealed a positive association between TMBVPA and VPAI r(150) = 0.312, p = < 0.001. A linear regression revealed that performance on the TMBVPA positively predicted performance on the VPAI F(3, 144) = 9.344, p < 0.001 accounting for 16.6% of the variability over and above known demographic variables. The rate of agreeance showed that 23.7% of TMBVPA scores were within a one score difference of the VPAI and 37.4% were within two scores. Conclusions The results suggest that the two remote administration formats may not be as congruent as originally thought. With 62.6% of scores outside of a two-point range and the low rate of agreement this suggests little real-world application of the TMBVPA. Although telepsychology has come a long way, remote neuropsychological measures may still not be a reality any time soon.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate microvascular function in patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: A prospective observational study was conducted in which patients with critical and severe COVID-19 were investigated during acute disease phase and at least 3 months after disease onset. SETTING: Single-center study at Danderyd University Hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 treated with noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, seven patients with severe COVID-19 with dyspnea or need of oxygen supply up to 8 L/min, and 15 noncoronavirus disease controls. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: Skin perfusion was investigated through laser speckle contrast imaging before and after iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside for determination of the endothelial-dependent and the endothelial-independent vasodilation, respectively. MAIN RESULTS: Patients with critical COVID-19 had higher basal skin perfusion during both the acute (34  9 perfusion unit; p = 0.0003) and the postinfectious phase (29  8 perfusion unit; p = 0.04), compared with noncoronavirus disease controls (23  7 perfusion unit). In addition, endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent vasodilation were reduced in patients with critical COVID-19 during the acute disease phase (p < 0.001 for both), whereas no significant differences between patients and controls were found during the postinfectious phase. In patients with severe COVID-19, basal skin perfusion and endothelial-dependent vasodilatation were not significantly changed, whereas endothelial-independent vasodilatation was reduced (p = 0.02) compared with controls.

However, there is a need to develop behavioral strategies that can effectively increase adherence to these guidelines, especially for young adults, who report particularly poor adherence. Across several domains of prevention science, norms-based interventions have successfully motivated constructive health behavior by correcting normative misperceptions, but these strategies are only relevant when these misperceptions are widespread. We examined the accuracy of young adults' perceptions of peers' adherence to CDC-recommended behavioral guidelines (i.e., perceived social norms) to assess the rationale for employing norm-correcting strategies. Young adult college students (N = 539; Mage = 19.5 years) self-reported their level of adherence to a list of preventive behavioral guidelines and estimated the norms regarding the extent to which other young adults adhered to these guidelines. We measured adherence and perceived norms for each guideline in terms of adherence frequency, ranging from 0 to 100% of the time. We found that young adults, on average, underestimated the extent to which other young adults adhere to each of the recommended preventive behaviors. That is, young adults tended to think that other young adults are failing to adhere to CDC guidelines, whereas our self-reported data showed adherence frequency may be quite high. Moreover, we found positive associations between self-reported adherence and perceptions of others' adherence-that is, those who underestimated others' adherence also self-reported lower adherence to guidelines.

Given the peak age of onset for most mental health problems is in adolescence, it is vital that adolescents have access to mental health counselling. There are several initiatives to increase access to mental health counselling in South Africa, primarily through the integration of counselling for common mental disorders (CMD) into primary health care services, but adolescents (15C18 years of age) generally do not utilize these services. To address this gap, we will undertake a study to explore the feasibility of conducting a trial of the effectiveness of a community-based mental health counselling intervention for adolescents at-risk for a CMD. METHODS: The study is a feasibility trial of the ASPIRE intervention, a four-session blended multi-component counselling intervention adapted for South African adolescents at risk for depression and alcohol use disorders. We will enrol 100 adolescents from community settings and randomly assign them to the ASPIRE intervention or a comparison condition. Feasibility measures, such as rates of recruitment, consent to participate in the trial and retention, will be calculated. Qualitative interviews with participants and counsellors will explore the acceptability of the intervention. The primary outcomes for a subsequent trial would be reductions in symptoms of depression and days of heavy drinking which will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months post-randomization. DISCUSSION: This feasibility trial using a mixed-methods design will allow us to determine whether we can move forward to a larger effectiveness trial of the ASPIRE intervention.

SUMMARY INTRODUCTION The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused global public health and economic crises. OBJECTIVE The aim of this observation study was to estimate the effectiveness, safety and elicited immune response of the BNT162b2 mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in healthcare workers of the Buda Hospital of the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God. METHOD After vaccination, the infection rate, adverse events and the kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein antibodies were evaluated. RESULTS Before vaccination, from the 295 healthcare workers 36 recovered from prior COVID-19 infection (COVID-19-positive group). After the second vaccination, there was no COVID-19 infection during the three-month follow-up period. The adverse events were mild. In the COVID-19-positive group, the median cut-off index of anti-N antibodies measured at 4 weeks after the first vaccination were significantly (p<0.0001) higher (28.37) than in the COVID-19-negative group (0.085). After the first vaccine, the median titer of anti-S antibodies was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the COVID-19-positive group (8015 U/ml) compared to the COVID-19-negative group (23.18 U/ml). In the COVID-19-negative group, the median titer of anti-S antibodies increased significantly (p<0.0001) after the second vaccine (from 23.18 U/ml to 1173 U/ml), showing an increase of 500. CONCLUSIONS After the second vaccination, there was no COVID-19 infection during the follow-up. In the COVID-19-negative group, the anti-S antibody titer is moderate after the first vaccination and increases significantly after the second vaccine. In the COVID-19-positive group, the first vaccine induces significant anti-S antibody production.

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Emergency telephone triage provided by Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) National Health Service (NHS) Trust. PARTICIPANTS: 12 653 adults who contacted EMS telephone triage services provided by YAS between 2 April 2020 and 29 June 2020 assessed by COVID-19 telephone triage pathways were included. OUTCOME: Accuracy of call handler decision to dispatch an ambulance was assessed in terms of death or need for organ support at 30 days from first contact with the telephone triage service. RESULTS: Callers contacting EMS dispatch services had an 11.1% (1405/12 653) risk of death or needing organ support. In total, 2000/12 653 (16%) of callers did not receive an emergency response and they had a 70/2000 (3.5%) risk of death or organ support. Ambulances were dispatched to 4230 callers (33.4%) who were not conveyed to hospital and did not deteriorate. Multivariable modelling found variables of older age (1 year increase, OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.05) and presence of pre-existing respiratory disease (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.60) to be predictors of false positive triage. CONCLUSION: Telephone triage can reduce ambulance responses but, with low specificity. A small but significant proportion of patients who do not receive an initial emergency response deteriorated. Research to improve accuracy of EMS telephone triage is needed and, due to limitations of routinely collected data, this is likely to require prospective data collection.","output":"Accuracy of emergency medical service telephone triage of need for an ambulance response in suspected COVID-19: an observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In spite of substantial declines in both incidence and mortality rates in the past 50 years, cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer associated mortality among women globally. We performed this meta-analysis to explore the role of XRCC3 rs861539, MTHFR rs1801133, IL-6 rs1800795, IL-12B rs3212227, TNF- rs1800629 and TLR9 rs352140 polymorphism with susceptibility to cervical carcinoma.

However, there are unsolved ambiguities underlying mechanisms for this growth signaling thereby creating therapeutic complications. This study shows that a vital component of the pathway CRAF is directly impacted by an end product of the cascade, glutathione transferases (GST) P1 (GSTP1), driving a previously unrecognized autocrine cycle that sustains proliferation of mKRAS and mBRAF cancer cells, independent of oncogenic stimuli. The CRAF interaction with GSTP1 occurs at its N-terminal regulatory domain, CR1 motif, resulting in its stabilization, enhanced dimerization, and augmented catalytic activity. Consistent with the autocrine cycle scheme, silencing GSTP1 brought about significant suppression of proliferation of mKRAS and mBRAF cells in vitro and suppressed tumorigenesis of the xenografted mKRAS tumor in vivo. GSTP1 knockout mice showed significantly impaired carcinogenesis of mKRAS colon cancer. Consequently, hindering the autocrine loop by targeting CRAF/GSTP1 interactions should provide innovative therapeutic modalities for these cancers.","output":"A CRAF/glutathione-S-transferase P1 complex sustains autocrine growth of cancers with KRAS and BRAF mutations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bovine coronavirus isolates from eight different states of the USA were compared for their antigenic properties and susceptibility to hygromycin B.

One difficulty of undertaking evolutionary analyses over short timescales is the dependency of the inferred evolutionary parameters on the timespan of observation. Here, we characterise the molecular evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza during the first 12 months of their respective pandemics. We use Bayesian phylogenetic methods to estimate the dates of emergence, evolutionary rates, and growth rates of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 over time and investigate how varying sampling window and dataset sizes affects the accuracy of parameter estimation. We further use a generalised McDonald-Kreitman test to estimate the number of segregating non-neutral sites over time. We find that the inferred evolutionary parameters for both pandemics are time-dependent, and that the inferred rates of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 decline by ~50% and ~100%, respectively, over the course of one year. After at least 4 months since the start of sequence sampling, inferred growth rates and emergence dates remain relatively stable and can be inferred reliably using a logistic growth coalescent model. We show that the time-dependency of the mean substitution rate is due to elevated substitution rates at terminal branches which are 2-4 times higher than those of internal branches for both viruses. The elevated rate at terminal branches is strongly correlated with an increasing number of segregating non-neutral sites, demonstrating the role of purifying selection in generating the time-dependency of evolutionary parameters during pandemics.","output":"Purifying selection determines the short-term time dependency of evolutionary rates in SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Progressive immune deficiency of aging is characterized by severe thymic atrophy, contracted T cell repertoire, and poor immune function. p63 is critical for the proliferative potential of embryonic and adult stem cells, as well as thymic epithelial cells (TECs).

Since post-natal thymic stromal development and function differs from that of the embryo, we assessed the impact of lineage-restricted p63 loss on pre- and post-natal murine TEC function by generating mice with a loss of p63 function targeted to TEC, termed p63TECko mice. In adult p63TECko mice, severe thymic hypoplasia was observed with a lack in a discernable segregation into medullary and cortical compartments and peripheral T cell lymphopenia. This profound thymic defect was seen in both neonatal as well as embryonic p63TECko mice. In addition to TECs, p63 also plays in important role in the development of stratified epithelium of the skin; lack of p63 results in defects in skin epidermal stratification and differentiation. Interestingly, all adult p63TECko mice lacked hair follicles despite having normal p63 expression in the skin. Together our results show a critical role of TEC p63 in thymic development and maintenance and show that p63 expression is critical for hair follicle formation.","output":"P63 targeted deletion under the FOXN1 promoter disrupts pre-and post-natal thymus development, function and maintenance as well as induces severe hair loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We begin this chapter by looking at the role of sensors during tissue and organ fabrication.

A protocol was developed for performing this procedure in an Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) with extended recovery. METHODS From January 2000 to December 2011, data about all laparoscopic incisional hernia repairs were gathered prospectively. The patients' clinical features, hernia type, intraoperative and postoperative complications and reasons for hospital admission are studied. RESULTS A total of 259 patients have been operated for incisional hernia (185) or recurrent hernioplasty (74) in our ASC. Laparoscopic repair was successful in 254 patients (98.07 %). Conversion to open surgery was necessary in five patients (1.93 %). A total of 50 patients (19.69 %) in whom surgery was completed laparoscopically were discharged the same day of surgery, 179 (70.47 %) at 24 h and 25 (9.84 %) required a stay of over 24 h. Postoperative pain was severe in 10 % of patients, moderate in 40 %, and mild in 50 %. Complications, mostly minor and self-limiting, were observed in 25 patients (9.84 %) during hospital stay. Five major complications that occured were: bile peritonitis, an acute peritonitis, due to an inadvertent intestinal perforation, and one intestinal obstruction by partial detachment of the mesh, an intra-abdominal hematoma and a colo-cutaneous fistula.

Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of 2019-nCoV. We used data on air travel volumes departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of introduction per country.

Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing the most to their risk. Findings: Countries at the highest importation risk (Egypt, Algeria, Republic of South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. Three clusters of countries are identified that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing, respectively.

We highlight best practices and challenges and offer perspectives for the future. DESIGN: A thematic analysis across 10 preparedness and response domains, namely, governance, leadership, and coordination; planning and monitoring; risk communication and community engagement; surveillance, rapid response, and case investigation; infection prevention and control; case management; screening and monitoring at points of entry; national laboratory system; logistics and supply chain management; and maintaining essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING: All countries in the WHO African Region were eligible for inclusion in the study. National IAR reports submitted by March 2021 were analysed. RESULTS: We retrieved IAR reports from 18 African countries. The COVID-19 pandemic response in African countries has relied on many existing response systems such as laboratory systems, surveillance systems for previous outbreaks of highly infectious diseases and a logistics management information system. These best practices were backed by strong political will. The key challenges included low public confidence in governments, inadequate adherence to infection prevention and control measures, shortages of personal protective equipment, inadequate laboratory capacity, inadequate contact tracing, poor supply chain and logistics management systems, and lack of training of key personnel at national and subnational levels. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that African countries response to the COVID-19 pandemic was prompt and may have contributed to the lower cases and deaths in the region compared with countries in other regions. The IARs demonstrate that many technical areas still require immediate improvement to guide decisions in subsequent waves or future outbreaks.","output":"Assessment of COVID-19 pandemic responses in African countries: thematic synthesis of WHO intra-action review reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to circulate, testing strategies are of the utmost importance.

The largest known outbreak outside the Middle East occurred in South Korea in 2015. As of 29 June 2016, 1769 laboratory-confirmed cases (630 deaths; 35.6 % case fatality rate [CFR]) had been reported from 26 countries, particularly in the Middle East. However, the CFR for hospital outbreaks was higher than that of family clusters in the Middle East and Korea. Here, we compared the mortality rates for 51 nosocomial outbreaks in the Middle East and one outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea. Our findings showed the CFR in the Middle East was much higher than that in South Korea (25.9 % [56/216] vs. 13.8 % [24/174], p = 0.003). Infected individuals who died were, on average, older than those who survived in both the Middle East (64 years [25C98] vs. 46 years [2C85], p = 0.000) and South Korea (68 years [49C82] vs. 53.5 years [16C87], p = 0.000). Similarly, the co-morbidity rates for the fatal cases were statistically higher than for the nonfatal cases in both the Middle East (64.3 % [36/56] vs. 28.1 % [45/160], p = 0.000) and South Korea (45.8 % [11/24] vs. 12.0 % [18/150], p = 0.000). The median number of days from onset to confirmation of infection in the fatal cases was longer than that for survivors from the Middle East (8 days [1C47] vs. 4 days [0C14], p = 0.009). Thus, older age, pre-existing concurrent diseases, and delayed confirmation increase the odds of a fatal outcome in nosocomial MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East and South Korea.

This study presents the results from a psychiatric helpline for older adults in Mannheim, Germany, during the lockdown, set up to provide information and psychosocial support. We aim to elucidate the needs of older adults, their reported changes, and the psychological impact during the initial stages of the health crisis. METHODS: A total of 55 older adults called the psychiatric helpline between April and June 2020. Information on demographics, medical and psychiatric history. as well as changes in daily life due to the pandemic was collected anonymously. Mental health status was assessed using the 7-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-7) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). RESULTS: Most callers were women, older adults (M = 74.69 years), single, and retired. In total, 69% of callers reported new or an increase in psychiatric symptoms, with anxiety and depressive symptoms being the most common ones. Age was significantly negatively correlated to higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. Individuals with a previous diagnosis of a psychiatric disease reported significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than those without a diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In older adults, the perceived psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis appears to ameliorate with age. Individuals with a history of psychiatric disease are most vulnerable to negative mental health outcomes. Rapid response in the form of a geriatric helpline is a useful initiative to support the psychosocial needs of older adults during a health crisis.","output":"Rapid Support for Older Adults during the Initial Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from a Geriatric Psychiatry Helpline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) and a target for disease prevention.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays identified the cause of ACE2 overexpression in human primary lung epithelial cells. We demonstrated that ACE2 was predominantly overexpressed on the apical surface of bronchial epithelium, while reduced in alveolar epithelium, owing to the dramatically decreased abundance of alveolar type II pneumocytes in CS\\\\exposed mouse lungs. Consistent with this, ACE2 was primarily significantly overexpressed in human bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells in smokers regardless of age or gender. Decreased ACE2 expression was observed in bronchial epithelial cells from ex\\\\smokers compared with current\\\\smokers, especially in those who had ceased smoking for more than 10 years. Moreover, ACE2 expression was positively correlated with the levels of HIF\\\\1, iNOS, and 4\\\\HNE in both mouse and human bronchioles.

However, it showed positive returns after MCO 3 and MCO 4. The results implied that the market perceived that the pandemic was under control. The study also revealed a significant relationship between CAAR and the number of cases announced, supporting the notion that in a less to a moderately free country such as Malaysia, investors showed a certain lack of trust in the number of cases reported by the authorities, and thus overreacted to the number of reported cases.

Previous studies have found that many patients had a procoagulant state and/or severe hypoxemia with relatively well-preserved lung mechanics. Mechanisms underlying the damage to vascular tissues are not well-elucidated yet. Histological data in COVID-19 patients are still limited and are mainly focused on post-mortem analysis. Given that the skin is affected by COVID-19 and the relative ease of its histological examination, we aimed to examine the histology of skin lesions in COVID-19 patients to better understand the disease's pathology. METHODS Five skin lesions from COVID-19 adult patients were selected for a deep histological tissue examination. RESULTS A strong vasculopathic reaction pattern based on prominent vascular endothelial and myointimal cell growth was identified. Endothelial cell distortion generated vascular lumen obliteration and striking erythrocyte and serum extravasation. Significant deposition of C4d and C3 throughout the vascular cell wall was also identified. A regenerative epidermal hyperplasia with tissue structure preservation was also observed. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 could comprise an obliterative microangiopathy consisting on endothelial and myointimal growth with complement activation. This mechanism, together with the increased vascular permeability identified, could contribute to obliteration of the vascular lumen and hemorrhage in COVID-19. Thus, anticoagulation by itself could not completely reverse vascular lumen obliteration, with consequent increased risk of hemorrhage. Findings of this study could contribute to a better understanding of physiopathological mechanisms underlying COVID-19 on living patients and could help further studies find potential targets for specific therapeutic interventions in severe cases.","output":"Vascular obliteration because of endothelial and myointimal growth in COVID-19 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: A recent update of the definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) proposed an empirical classification based on ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) at ARDS onset. Since the proposal did not mandate PaO(2)/FiO(2) calculation under standardised ventilator settings (SVS), we hypothesised that a stratification based on baseline PaO(2)/FiO(2) would not provide accurate assessment of lung injury severity. DESIGN: A prospective, multicentre, observational study. SETTING: A network of teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 478 patients with eligible criteria for moderate (100<PaO(2)/FiO(2)200) and severe (PaO(2)/FiO(2)100) ARDS and followed until hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS: We examined physiological and ventilator parameters in association with the PaO(2)/FiO(2) at ARDS onset, after 24 h of usual care and at 24 h under a SVS. At 24 h, patients were reclassified as severe, moderate, mild (200<PaO(2)/FiO(2)300) ARDS and non-ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2)>300). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Group severity and hospital mortality. RESULTS: At ARDS onset, 173 patients had a PaO(2)/FiO(2)100 but only 38.7% met criteria for severe ARDS at 24 h under SVS. When assessed under SVS, 61.3% of patients with severe ARDS were reclassified as moderate, mild and non-ARDS, while lung severity and hospital mortality changed markedly with every PaO(2)/FiO(2) category (p<0.000001). Our model of risk stratification outperformed the stratification using baseline PaO(2)/FiO(2) and non-standardised PaO(2)/FiO(2) at 24 h, when analysed by the predictive receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve: area under the ROC curve for stratification at baseline was 0.583 (95% CI 0.525 to 0.636), 0.605 (95% CI 0.552 to 0.658) at 24 h without SVS and 0.693 (95% CI 0.645 to 0.742) at 24 h under SVS (p<0.000001).

METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional study of healthcare workers during May 2020 to assess the socio-ecological predictors of mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed factors at four socio-ecological levels: individual (e.g., gender), interpersonal (e.g., social support), institutional (e.g., personal protective equipment availability), and community (e.g., healthcare worker stigma). The Personal Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Primary Care Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise scales assessed probable major depression (MD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess unadjusted and adjusted associations between socio-ecological factors and mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1,092 participants, 72.0% were female, 51.9% were frontline workers, and the mean age was 40.4 years (standard deviation = 11.5). Based on cut-off scores, 13.9%, 15.6%, 22.8%, and 42.8% had probable MD, GAD, PTSD, and AUD, respectively. In the multivariable adjusted models, needing more social support was associated with significantly higher odds of probable MD, GAD, PTSD, and AUD. The significance of other factors varied across the outcomes. For example, at the individual level, female gender was associated with probable PTSD. At the institutional level, lower team cohesion was associated with probable PTSD, and difficulty following hospital policies with probable MD. At the community level, higher healthcare worker stigma was associated with probable PTSD and AUD, decreased satisfaction with the national government response with probable GAD, and higher media exposure with probable GAD and PTSD.

There is a need to understand the impact on different health care professionals in different countries. The aim of the present study was to explore the psychological impact of the pandemic among dental staff in Norway in relation to background characteristics, work situation and preparedness of the service. METHODS: A structured questionnaire sent electronically to dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants inquired information about the lockdown period in Norway (13 March-17 April 2020). Distributions of background characteristics, perceptions of preparedness and psychological impact were calculated. Exploratory factor analysis was performed, and Structural Equation Models (SEMs) were used to compare psychological impact between dental professionals treating patients versus not during lockdown. RESULTS: Among the 1237 respondents, 58.8% worked clinically with patients. The majority were concerned of becoming infected (71.9%), of infecting others (85.4%) and/or of their family becoming infected (76.9%). Respondents who treated patients felt significantly more insecure about whether having become infected or not. The minority felt discriminated (6.7%), worried about death (11.7%), felt that life was threatening (9.8%) or felt loss of control of their lives (8.9%). More than 80% agreed that their workplace handled the situation well. Four factors were retrieved from the factor analysis. SEMs showed that gender and work experience had a significant effect on the factors Instability, Infection and Concerns. Respondents with work experience 10 years were less likely to express fear about Instability and Infection.

Objectives: To assess the fear of COVID-19 and its impact on the quality of life during the Lockdown situation among the teaching faculty of a Health University and also study the gender differences if any. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among the teaching faculty of a Health University during April 28 through to May 8, 2020. Randomly selected 270 faculty were sent Google link of the assessment tool using the University e-mail network. They had to fill the questionnaire based on their experience of the past 1 month. Assessment tools used were fear scale of COVID-19 and adapted with permission World Health Organization quality of life (QOL)-BREF QoL. Results: Out of the 270 participants, only 198 teaching faculty participated in the survey (response rate = 73.33%). The overall mean fear score was 18.69  5.57 and the overall QoL mean score was 46.29  4.02. There was a gender-wise statistically significant difference observed in the fear score (t = 2.34, P = 0.02), reporting more fear in the females (19.45  5.81) as compared to the males (17.57  5.01). There was a negative correlation between QoL scores and Fear score r = -0.24 (P = 0.000). Conclusions: There is certainly a fear about COVID-19, but it has not impacted the quality of life. ? 2021 Medical Journal of Dr. D.Y.

Although the infection is frequently asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms, in a small proportion of patients it can produce an intense inflammatory and prothrombotic state that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, and death. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), highly expressed in the respiratory system, has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, ACE2 is also expressed in the cardiovascular system and there are multiple cardiovascular implications of COVID-19. Cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease have been associated with severe manifestations and poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Importantly, patients with COVID-19 may have thrombotic and coagulation abnormalities promoting a hypercoagulable state, resulting in an increased rate of thrombotic and thromboembolic events.

It is able to reinforce public health messages, help patients manage at home, and identify those in need of hospital care. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, primary care scrambled to rapidly transform itself and protect clinicians, staff, and patients while remaining connected to patients. Using the established public health framework for addressing a pandemic, we describe the actions primary care needs to take in a pandemic. Recommended actions are based on observed experiences of the authors' primary care practices and networks. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, tasks focused on promoting physical distancing and encouraging patients with suspected illness or exposure to self-quarantine. Testing was not available and contract tracing was not possible. As the pandemic spread, in-person care was converted to virtual care using telehealth. Practices remained connected to patients using registries to reach out to those at risk for infection, with uncontrolled chronic conditions, or were socially vulnerable. Practices managed most patients with suspected COVID-19 at home. As the pandemic decelerates, practices are now preparing to address the direct and indirect consequences-complications from COVID-19 infections, missed treatment for acute problems, inadequate prevention, uncontrolled chronic disease, mental illness, and greater social needs. Throughout, practices bore tremendous financial burden, laying off staff or even closing at a time when most needed. Primary care must learn from this experience and be ready for the next pandemic.

The change agent practices of our 103 participants involve many types of actions but show underinvestment in mass communication. Mass communication actions are more frequent when participants have greater experience, additional academic degrees, and training in change agency. Also, occupational therapists with additional academic degrees and change agency training tend to use a wider variety of actions. Finally, our participants actions principally target actors in the clinical context, rarely political actors. IMPLICATIONS.

This included developing features in the cellphone app such as step feedback, success rate, muscle activity calibration, and cloud integration. Next, we tested the validity and reliability of the mTrigger device in healthy adults by comparing it to a laboratory-grade EMG system. While wearing both devices, 32 adults walked overground and on a treadmill at four speeds (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 m/s). Statistical analysis revealed good to excellent test-retest reliability (r > 0.89) and good to excellent agreement in the detection of steps (ICC > 0.85) at all speeds between two systems for treadmill walking.

This could be a major issue in developing countries where access to basic sanitation is poor leading to the sharing of toilet facilities. In this study, we present the first report of SARS-CoV-2 contamination on key contact surfaces in shared toilets, in the city of Durban, using droplet digital PCR and assessed the probabilistic risks of COVID-19 infections.Approximately, 53-69% of the contact surfaces were contaminated, with SARS-CoV-2 viral loads per cm 2 ranging from 25.9 to 132.69 gc/cm 2 . Toilet seats had the highest contamination per cm 2 . The results suggested that the leading cause of contamination in shared toilets could be the shedding of the viral particles in feces and contaminated hands. We observed a significant reduction in viral loads on the contaminated surfaces after cleaning, showing the potential of effective cleaning on the reduction of contamination of these surfaces. The probabilistic assessment showed a high potential for COVID-19 infections. Touching the internal latch of the toilet cubicle had the highest risk of infections (4.3x10 -2 (6.0x10 -4 )) when a person uses the toilet once in a day, increasing to 1.0x10 -1 (1.4x10 -3 ) for three uses in a day. The risks estimated in this study were higher than any of the tolerable/acceptable risk figures proposed for COVID-19 from environmental exposure.

This study characterized LUS lesions in patients with PTB and compared them with chest X-ray (CXR) findings. Adult patients in Lima, Peru, with PTB were recruited within 1 week of starting antituberculosis treatment. Comprehensive LUS was performed in all patients at enrollment and assessed for consolidation, small subpleural consolidation (SPC, hypothesized to be a marker of CXR consolidation), cavity, pleural effusion, pathologic B-lines, and miliary pattern. Patient CXRs were digitized and interpreted by a board-certified radiologist. Fifty-one patients were included in the final analysis. Lung ultrasound detected either consolidation or SPC in 96.1% of participants. No significant difference was found between the LUS detection of a composite of consolidation or SPC, and CXR detection of consolidation (96.1% versus 98%, P > 0.99). The proportion of patients with cavity detected by LUS was significantly lower than that detected by CXR (5.9% versus 51%, P < 0.001). Overall, LUS detection of consolidation or SPC may be a sensitive marker for diagnosis of PTB. Lung ultrasound demonstrated poor ability to detect radiographically identified cavity, although previous studies suggest SPC could add specificity for the diagnosis of PTB. Based on its portability and evidence base for diagnosing other pulmonary diseases, LUS may have a role in screening and diagnosis of PTB in areas without ready access to CXR.

We tested the efficacy of a spike encoding mRNA vaccine (CVnCoV) against the ancestral strain BavPat1 and the novel VOC B.1.351 in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Naive mice and mice immunized with formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 preparation were used as controls. mRNA-immunized mice developed elevated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody as well as neutralization titers against the ancestral strain BavPat1. Neutralization titers against VOC B.1.351 were readily detectable but significantly reduced compared to BavPat1. VOC B.1.351-infected control animals experienced a delayed course of disease, yet nearly all SARS-CoV-2 challenged na?ve mice succumbed with virus dissemination and high viral loads. CVnCoV vaccine completely protected the animals from disease and mortality caused by either viral strain. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in oral swabs, lung, or brain in these groups.

To provide a better understanding of the overstocking situation after the outbreak of the pandemic, this study depicts the distribution characteristics of overstocked agricultural products in China. After analyzing a nationwide data set collected from 3482 individuals/organizations by the Chinese Agri-products Marketing Association after the outbreak of the pandemic, we found that some of the initial prevention and control measures disrupted sales channels, and in turn, caused the farmers to suffer losses.

Many of these patients receive therapeutic anticoagulation because of a very high risk of thromboembolism. However, data about the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in these patients on therapeutic anticoagulation is scarce. Additionally, endoscopy utilization among these GIB patients need further studies. This study aims to evaluate the rates of GIB bleeding in COVID-19 patients and the endoscopy utilization for the same from a national research network database. Methods: We used a federated cloud-based network database named TriNetX, comprising of 50 healthcare organizations (HCOs) across the US to identify all adults patients who were on therapeutic anticoagulation (warfarin, therapeutic dose-heparin [enoxaparin, unfractionated heparin], direct thrombin inhibitors, direct-acting factor Xa inhibitors 3-months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with the use of anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis were excluded. Patients with the above characteristics were studied from January 1, 2020, to June 15, 2021, were divided into the anticoagulation (COVID with AC) and without anticoagulation (COVID w/o AC) groups. The primary outcomes were rates of GIB (melena/hematemesis), inpatient hospitalizations, endoscopy (EGD/colonoscopy) utilization, number of packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions, and 30-day all-cause mortality. The outcomes were measured after 1:1 propensity matching of the groups based on the baseline demographics and comorbidities. Results: A total of 104,946 patients in COVID with AC and 591,273 patients in COVID w/o AC groups were compared. The patient comorbidities at presentation, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes are noted in Table 1. After matching, COVID with AC patients had a higher risk of GIB (risk ratio [RR]-1.62 (CI-1.45 -1.82)), inpatient hospitalization rates (RR-4.53 (CI-4.42 -4.65)), PRBC transfusions (RR 3.67 (CI-3.35 -4.02)), overall mortality (RR 3.93 (3.75 -4.12)). Despite the increased presence of GIB, endoscopy utilization was lower (RR-0.85 (0.78 -0.93)). Conclusion: Rates of GIB, inpatient hospitalization, and overall mortality increased in COVID-19 patients on therapeutic anticoagulation. However, endoscopy utilization remained low, probably due to fear of infection transmission. If the increased mortality is related to the underlying severity of COVID-19 or unidentified comorbidities need to be further evaluated.","output":"Gastrointestinal bleeding risk and endoscopy utilization in covid-19 patients on therapeutic anticoagulation: A multicentric study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explored the impact of physical distancing measures on COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada using a previously described age- and health-status stratified transmission model.

We projected that mortality would have been 4.6-fold what was observed had physical distancing measures not been implemented in the province. Relaxation of physical distancing measures without compensatory increases in case detection, isolation, and/or contact tracing was projected to result in resurgence of disease activity. Return to normal or near-normal levels of contact would rapidly result in cases exceeding ICU capacity. Maintaining physical distancing for a longer period of time, allowing for the initial wave of infections to subside, delayed this resurgence, but the level of contacts post-restrictive distancing was the major factor determining how quickly ICU capacity was expected to be overwhelmed. Using a model, we demonstrate the marked impact strong public health measures had in reducing ICU admissions and mortality in Ontario. We also show that this hard-earned success is tenuous: relaxation of physical distancing measures in the near-term is projected to result in a rapid resurgence of disease activity.","output":"Reduced COVID-19-Related Critical Illness and Death, and High Risk of Epidemic Resurgence, After Physical Distancing in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new, store-and-forward, fully digitised Teledermatology (TD) pathway was designed and implemented in an urban setting for non-two-week wait routine patients.

METHODS: We monitored the dynamic progression of ICF in patients with moderate COVID-19. Out of 694 COVID-19 inpatients from 10 hospitals in Wenzhou, China, we selected 293 adult patients without comorbidities. These patients were divided into different daily cohorts according to the COVID-19 onset-time. Retrospective data were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: The virus-induced damages to pre-hospitalization patients triggered two ICF fluctuations during the 14-day course of the disease. C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels increased and peaked at day 5 (D5) and D9 during the 1st and 2nd fluctuations, respectively. The ICF activities were higher during the 2nd fluctuation.

Hispanic children face many challenges in access to healthcare services. Our objective was to describe the communication challenges faced by Spanish-speaking parents with limited English proficiency (SSP-LEP). METHODS: This was a qualitative study of 70 children of Spanish-speaking caregivers, enrolled in a complex care program of a tertiary care childrens hospital in North Carolina. Secondary source data were abstracted logs of care coordination tasks maintained by the programs two bilingual care coordinators for a median observation period of 45 months, and complemented by data from care coordinator interviews. Data were entered and coded in ATLAS.ti. Using thematic content analysis and an iterative process, we identified recurrent themes related to communication challenges of Spanish-speaking caregivers. RESULTS: Median age of children was 5 years; 51% were girls; 97% had Medicaid; and 3% were uninsured. Seven children died during the observation period. Three major themes were identified as follows: (1) caregivers faced many communication challenges primarily because of language barrier. (2) Multiple factors at caregiver, provider, and system levels, in addition to language barrier, contributed to communication challenges. (3) Communication challenges had serious consequences for CMC. These consequences were lessened by bilingual coordinators. CONCLUSION: SSP-LEP face unique communication challenges resulting in negative impact on the healthcare of their CMC. Bilingual coordinators can help improve communication between SSP-LEP and their healthcare providers. Interventions to address communication challenges of Spanish-speaking caregivers are warranted.

DATA SOURCES Statutory notification data, local tuberculosis programme data, and census data were reviewed. Literature search of PubMed was performed up to December 2005. STUDY SELECTION Original and major review articles related to tuberculosis among health care workers and guidelines for prevention were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION Relevant data were extracted from our literature review and local sources. DATA SYNTHESIS Earlier experimental data demonstrated an airborne spread of tuberculosis and a steady state mathematical model for quantification of the transmission risk. In the post-chemotherapy era in developed countries, few studies demonstrated an occupational risk of tuberculin conversion outside of outbreak settings, and few studies were able to conclusively demonstrate an increased risk of active tuberculosis among health care workers. In countries with limited resource, the situation may be different, with a higher tuberculosis incidence among health care workers. Local tuberculosis programme and notification data from the Labour Department did not show an increased risk of active tuberculosis among health care workers. Although administrative control, engineering control, and personal protection are widely accepted control measures, it is difficult to quantify their cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS Although an increased liability to tuberculosis among health care workers is expected due to the concentration of infectious patients in their environment, prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment may minimise the risk. A high background rate of disease and possible healthy worker effect may make it difficult to pick up a small risk differential. With the ongoing threat of a nosocomial outbreak, continuing vigilance is called for.","output":"Occupational tuberculosis: a review of the literature and the local situation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BNT162b2, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (S) stabilized in the prefusion conformation, has demonstrated 95% efficacy in preventing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)1.

Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic has led many countries around the world, including Chile, to take various measures, including physical and, social isolation. The effects of these measures, necessary to prevent the virus from spreading, must be studied. In particular, quarantines are known to have an impact on quality of life and well-being (for example, associated symptoms such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and other psychosocial consequences). Furthermore, these effects are expected to be more pronounced in previously disadvantaged populations, such as LGBT people. This paper describes the main measures taken by LGBT population during quarantine to avoid COVID-19 and its psychosocial consequences on an individual and social basis. Method: Non-probability sampling was used. An online self-administered survey including 1181 participants was used. These were lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender residents over 18 years old from Chile. Results: Almost eight out of ten participants were in a total quarantine situation. From them, 18,2% were in partial isolation and only 4.6% were not in quarantine. COVID-19 has affected almost all the LGBT participants to a certain extent. COVID-19 has emotionally affected the vast majority of the LGBT participants to a certain extent. In other words, the pandemic has affected their lives. This psychosocial impact of COVID has been greater for people who define themselves as *sexual (include queer, asexual, pansexual, demisexual). Discussion: The measures taken to prevent the virus transmission significantly affect LGBT peoples life. In particular, these measures affect *sexual people. *sexual people must manage discrimination and misunderstanding of their identity in many contexts including their family.","output":"LImpact psychosocial de la pandmie de COVID-19 sur les personnes LGBT au Chili"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While multiple information sources exist concerning surface\\\\level air pollution, no individual source simultaneously provides large\\\\scale spatial coverage, fine spatial and temporal resolution, and high accuracy.

This study was aimed to discover key Chinese materia medica, main active compounds, hub therapeutic target proteins and core signal pathways in the potential therapeutic mechanism of HSBD on severe COVID-19 through integrating network pharmacological methods. Experimental procedure TCMSP, TCMID and STITCH databases were used to screen out active compounds and target proteins of HSBD. GeneCards database was used to screen out disease genes of severe COVID-19. The potential therapeutic targets of HSBD on severe COVID-19 were used to construct protein-protein interaction network through STRING database and the hub target proteins were discovered. Next, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were carried out to discover core signal pathways. Finally, the network diagram of Chinese materia medica-active compounds-therapeutic target proteins was built, then key Chinese materia medica and main active compounds were selected. Results and Conclusion HSBD might treat severe COVID-19 through 45 potential target genes, among them, there were 13 hub target genes: RELA, TNF, IL6, IL1B, MAPK14, TP53, CXCL8, MAPK3, MAPK1, IL4, MAPK8, CASP8, STAT1. Meanswhile, GO_BiologicalProcess and KEGG signaling pathways analysis results showed that the core signal pathways were inflammation and immune regulation pathways. Finally, 4 key Chinese materia medica and 11 main active compounds were discovered in the HSBD.

Outcomes based on primary tumor location after salvage hepatic radioembolization with Yttrium-90 resin microspheres (Y90) are not well studied. OBJECTIVE: To assess survival outcomes in patients with advanced chemorefractory mCRC treated with Y90 radioembolization, stratified by primary tumor location, and to explore potential factors predictive of survival. METHODS: A total of 99 patients with mCRC liver metastases progressive on systemic therapy treated with Y90 at a single center were retrospectively analyzed. In 89 patients, tumor response on first imaging follow-up (CT or MRI at 1.9  0.9 months after Y90) was evaluated using RECIST. Overall survival (OS), post-Y90 OS, and hepatic progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Outcomes, and associations of outcomes with tumor response, were compared between patients with left- and right-sided tumors. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients had left-sided colon cancer, and 25 patients had right-sided colon cancer. Median OS from the time of mCRC diagnosis was 37.2 months, median post-Y90 OS was 5.8 months, and median hepatic PFS was 3.3 months. Based on RECIST, progressive disease on first imaging follow-up was observed in 38 patients (43%) post-Y90 and was associated with shorter post-Y90 OS compared to disease control on first imaging follow-up (4.0 vs 10.5 months, p < .001). Patients with right-sided primaries showed decreased post-Y90 OS compared to patients with left-sided primaries (5.4 vs 6.2 months, p = .02). Right- and left-sided primaries showed no significant difference in RECIST tumor response, hepatic PFS, or extrahepatic disease progression (p > .05). Post-Y90 survival was significantly lower in patients with progressive disease than with disease control among left-sided primaries (4.2 vs 13.9 months, p < .001), though not for right-sided primaries (7.2 vs 3.3 months, p = .05). CONCLUSION: Right-sided primary tumor was independently associated with decreased survival in patients with chemorefractory mCRC after Y90 radioembolization, despite similar RECIST tumor response, hepatic PFS, and extrahepatic disease progression compared to those with left-sided primary tumors. CLINICAL IMPACT: Primary colon cancer location impacts outcomes after salvage Y90 radioembolization and may help guide patient selection.","output":"Yttrium-90 Hepatic Radioembolization for Advanced Chemorefractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: Survival Outcomes Based on Right-Versus Left-Sided Primary Tumor Location."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The newly identified Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Voronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has steered concerns across the world due to the possession of large number of mutations leading to high infectivity and vaccine escape potential. The Omicron variant houses 32 mutations in S protein alone. The viral infectivity is determined mainly by the ability of spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to bind to the human Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. In this paper, the interaction of the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 variants with hACE2 was analyzed by using protein-protein docking and compared with the novel Omicron variant. Our findings reveal that the Omicron RBD interacts strongly with hACE2 receptor via unique amino acid residues as compared to the Wuhan and many other variants. However, the interacting residues of RBD are found to be the same in Lamda (C.37) variant. These unique binding of Omicron RBD with hACE2 suggests an increased potential of infectivity and vaccine evasion potential of the new variant. The evolutionary drive of the SARS-CoV-2 may not be exclusively driven by RBD variants but surely provides for the platform for emergence of new variants.","output":"Analyzing the interaction of human ACE2 and RBD of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in perspective of Omicron variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the critical stages of COVID-19, leading to lung injury and hemolysis.

The reduced size of microplastic makes it easier for intake by aquatic organisms resulting in amassing of noxious wastes, thereby disturbing their physiological functions. Microplastics are abundantly available and exhibit high propensity for interrelating with the ecosystem thereby disrupting the biogenic flora and fauna. About 71% of the earth surface is occupied by oceans, which holds 97% of the earths water. The remaining 3% is present as water in ponds, streams, glaciers, ice caps, and as water vapor in the atmosphere. Microplastics can accumulate harmful pollutants from the surroundings thereby acting as transport vectors; and simultaneously can leach out chemicals (additives). Plastics in marine undergo splintering and shriveling to form micro/nanoparticles owing to the mechanical and photochemical processes accelerated by waves and sunlight, respectively. Microplastics differ in color and density, considering the type of polymers, and are generally classified according to their origins, i.e., primary and secondary. About 54.5% of microplastics floating in the ocean are polyethylene, and 16.5% are polypropylene, and the rest includes polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polyester, and polyamides. Polyethylene and polypropylene due to its lower density in comparison with marine water floats and affect the oceanic surfaces while materials having higher density sink affecting seafloor.

METHODS: Young to middle-aged adults with HNN (aged 18-40 years) and treated with unilateral neck irradiation  5 years before inclusion underwent cardiovascular risk and neuropsychological assessments and answered validated questionnaires regarding subjective cognitive complaints, fatigue, depression, quality of life, and cancer-specific distress. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed to assess white matter hyperintensities (WMH), infarctions, and atrophy. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (aged 24C61, 13 men) median 9.2 [7.3C12.9] years post-treatment were included. HNN patients performed worse in episodic memory (Z-score = -1.16 [-1.58C0.34], p < 0.001) and reported more fatigue symptoms (Z-score = 1.75 [1.21C2.00], p < 0.001) compared to normative data.

Such repairs are prone to failure, particularly with low pressure venous flow (bidirectional cavopulmonary connection or Fontan). We describe our experience of disconnection of central pulmonary arteries and selective systemic-PA shunt to the hypoplastic vessel. Single ventricle patients (n=12) with diffuse left pulmonary artery (LPA) hypoplasia (LPA:RPA diameter <0.7) underwent PA disconnection (ligation clip) and selective arterial shunt to the LPA. Patients with &#8804; mild atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR), and no more than mild systolic dysfunction on echocardiogram were considered. Following systemic-LPA shunt, patients were re-assessed by cardiac catheterisation prior to further surgery, with follow-up catheterisation later performed and description of changes observed. Increased volume loading was well tolerated with no greater than mild AVVR and preserved systolic function (normal or mildly reduced). Selective arterial shunting increased the caliber of the LPA from 4.1 mm (1.2-5.6) to 6.5 mm (1.7-11.9) and this increase was preserved post-Fontan (6.7 mm (1.3-8.0)) (median (range)). Ventricular end diastolic pressure (EDP) increased with arterial shunting but resolved after shunt takedown and Fontan completion (median +3 and -4 mmHg respectively). Post-Fontan hospital length of stay was not prolonged (median 11 days, range 7-14). No deaths occurred. In univentricular hearts and PA hypoplasia, selective systemic-PA shunting physiologically increases the caliber of the distal vessels.

We analyzed data from 871 students with regular menstrual cycles who completed the Premenstrual Symptoms Questionnaire (PSQ), Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised version (IES-R). The total PSQ score was significantly higher in women with COVID-19-induced posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) than in non-PTSS groups. Compared with pre-pandemic data (2019), the total PSQ score did not change in non-PTSS, but increased in PTSS groups. All symptoms were more severe in PTSS groups than in non-PTSS groups. Compared with 2019, PTSS groups had more severe symptoms for all symptoms except 'physical symptoms' and 'decreased social activity', and non-PTSS groups only exhibited improvements in the 'decreased social activity'. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the IES-R score was a significant exacerbation factor of the total PSQ score, along with age and menstrual pain.

The first senolytic drugs Dasatinib, Quercetin, Fisetin and Navitoclax were discovered using a hypothesis-driven approach. SC accumulate with ageing and at causal sites of multiple chronic disorders, including diseases accounting for the bulk of morbidity, mortality and health expenditures. The most deleterious SC are resistant to apoptosis and have up-regulation of anti-apoptotic pathways which defend SC against their own inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), allowing them to survive, despite killing neighbouring cells. Senolytics transiently disable these SCAPs, causing apoptosis of those SC with a tissue-destructive SASP. Because SC take weeks to reaccumulate, senolytics can be administered intermittently - a 'hit-and-run' approach. In preclinical models, senolytics delay, prevent or alleviate frailty, cancers and cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, liver, kidney, musculoskeletal, lung, eye, haematological, metabolic and skin disorders as well as complications of organ transplantation, radiation and cancer treatment. As anticipated for agents targeting the fundamental ageing mechanisms that are 'root cause' contributors to multiple disorders, potential uses of senolytics are protean, potentially alleviating over 40 conditions in preclinical studies, opening a new route for treating age-related dysfunction and diseases. Early pilot trials of senolytics suggest they decrease senescent cells, reduce inflammation and alleviate frailty in humans. Clinical trials for diabetes, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, COVID-19, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, eye diseases and bone marrow transplant and childhood cancer survivors are underway or beginning.

Furthermore, it is unclear whether an infection affects essential therapy treatment and if a therapy increases the risk for an infection. Method(s): We tested every patient (n=1286) in 7 different oncology outpatient clinics from 04/15/2020 and 04/26/2020 for COVID-19 infection regardless of whether symptoms were present or not. Virus RNA was extracted using the MGIEasy extraction kit in combination with SP-960 robots and a RT qPCR was performed. Result(s): From 1286 tested patients 40 (3.1%) patients were identified positive. Only two of those (5.0%) had mild symptoms whereas one positive patient (2,5%) was treated stationary with pneumonia. The majority (37/40) was asymptomatic virus-carriers (92,5 %). Noteworthy is the fact that 22 (55%) of the positively tested patients were undergoing systemic therapy of which 10 (45.5%) patients received chemotherapy and 4 (18.2%) patients received immunomodulating antibodies. Conclusion(s): A consequent testing for COVID-19 in cancer patients is obligate to identify asymptomatric positive carrier to separate this potential vector group from COVID negative patients since the majority (37/40) of positive patients was asymptomatic virus-carriers (92,5 %). The data we collected contrasts strongly the hypothesis that cancer patients are suspected to be highly vulnerable for SARS-CoV-2 infections.

We do not know if tracheostomy will improve their care. Given the paucity of data on this topic, the optimal surgical approach has yet to be elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal surgical strategy for performing tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Cohort study of 143 ventilator dependent COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy at an academic medical center from April 15 to May 15, 2020, with follow up until June 1, 2020. SETTING: A New York City (NYC) academic quaternary referral center during its peak of COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to a NYC medical center with COVID-19 who required invasive mechanical ventilation for greater than 2 weeks who were unable to be extubated and determined to have reasonable chance of recovery and fit defined tracheostomy candidate criteria. EXPOSURE: Patients had either a percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) or open surgical tracheostomy (ST) performed by one of three surgical services. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and results of tracheostomy for both patients with COVID-19 and the surgeons performing the tracheostomy. Specifically, tracheostomy complications, inpatient mortality, disposition of patients, and transmission of COVID-19 to surgeons were measured. RESULTS: 143 patients underwent tracheostomy, 58 (41%) via a ST, and 85 (59%) via a PT. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the two groups, except that more patients who had a history of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) underwent PT (11% vs 2%, p=0.049). There were no statistical differences observed between the PT and ST groups with regard to bleeding complications (3.5% vs 10.3%, p=0.099), tracheostomy related complications (5.9% vs 8.6%, p=0.528), inpatient death (12% vs 5%, p=0.178), discharge from hospital (39% vs 36%,p=0.751) or surgeon illness (0% v 0%, p=1). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The rapid formation of a multi-disciplinary team allows for the efficient evaluation and performance of a large volume of tracheostomies in a resource-limited setting. Bedside tracheostomy in COVID-19 does not cause additional harm to patients if performed after 2 weeks from intubation. It also appears to be safe for proceduralists to perform in this timeframe.

COVID-19 was confirmed through detectable SARS-CoV2 by RT-PCR (repeated twice if negative first) and/or specific CT-scan. The study aims to assess the 28-day mortality rate after the first COVID test. RESULTS: From March 1st to May 21st 2020, 23 French cancer centres and hospitals enrolled 1230 cancer patients with suspicion of COVID-19, including 1162 (94.5%) matching the inclusion criteria. We identified 425 (36.6%) COVID-19 positive patients including 155 (13.3%) diagnosed with CT-scan only, while 737 (63.4%) patients were COVID-19 negative. Death at day-28 occurred in 116/425 (27.8%) COVID-19 positive patients, and in 118/737 (16.3%) COVID-19 negative patients (p < 00001).

The variations in the meaning of the same Arabic words could directly affect the performance of any AI-based framework. This work aims to identify the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) algorithms through preprocessing and representation techniques. This effectiveness is measured via different AI-based classification techniques. Basically, the ATC process is influenced by several factors such as stemming in preprocessing, method of feature extraction and selection, nature of datasets, and classification algorithm. To improve the overall classification performance, preprocessing techniques are mainly used to convert each Arabic word into its root and decrease the representation dimension among the datasets. Feature extraction and selection always play crucial roles to represent the Arabic text in a meaningful way and improve the classification accuracy rate. The selected classifiers in this study are performed based on various feature selection algorithms. The overall classification evaluation results are compared using different classifiers such as multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Logistic Regression (LR), and Linear SVC. All of these AI classifiers are evaluated using five balanced and unbalanced benchmark datasets: BBC Arabic corpus, CNN Arabic corpus, Open-Source Arabic corpus (OSAc), ArCovidVac, and AlKhaleej. The evaluation results show that the classification performance strongly depends on the preprocessing technique, representation methods and classification technique, and the nature of datasets used.

Although this chalcogen forms a wide variety of compounds, there are surprisingly few small-molecule organic selenium compounds (OSeCs) in biology. Besides its more prominent relative selenocysteine (SeCys), the amino acid selenomethionine (SeMet) is one example. SeMet is synthesized in plants and some fungi and, via nutrition, finds its way into mammalian cells. In contrast to its sulfur analog methionine (Met), SeMet is extraordinarily redox active under physiological conditions and via its catalytic selenide (RSeR)/selenoxide (RSe(O)R) couple provides protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other possibly harmful oxidants. In contrast to SeCys, which is incorporated via an eloquent ribosomal mechanism, SeMet can enter such biomolecules by simply replacing proteinogenic Met. Interestingly, eukaryotes, such as yeast and mammals, also metabolize SeMet to a small family of reactive selenium species (RSeS). Together, SeMet, proteins containing SeMet and metabolites of SeMet form a powerful triad of redox-active metabolites with a plethora of biological implications. In any case, SeMet and its family of natural RSeS provide plenty of opportunities for studies in the fields of nutrition, aging, health and redox biology.","output":"Selenomethionine: A Pink Trojan Redox Horse with Implications in Aging and Various Age-Related Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background A single nucleotide change in the coding region can alter the amino acid sequence of a protein. In consequence, natural or artificial sequence changes in viral RNAs may have various effects not only on protein stability, function and structure but also on viral replication. In recent decades, several tools have been developed to predict the effect of mutations in structured RNAs such as viral genomes or non-coding RNAs. Some tools use multiple point mutations and also take coding regions into account. However, none of these tools was designed to specifically simulate the effect of mutations on viral long-range interactions. Results Here, we developed SilentMutations (SIM), an easy-to-use tool to analyze the effect of multiple point mutations on the secondary structures of two interacting viral RNAs. The tool can simulate disruptive and compensatory mutants of two interacting single-stranded RNAs. This allows a fast and accurate assessment of key regions potentially involved in functional long-range RNA-RNA interactions and will eventually help virologists and RNA-experts to design appropriate experiments. SIM only requires two interacting single-stranded RNA regions as input. The output is a plain text file containing the most promising mutants and a graphical representation of all interactions.

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavirCritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavirCritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavirCritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavirCritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavirCritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavirCritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.

Rapid and sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with multiple social gatherings. Informant interviews revealed that community members were concerned about having to follow critical mitigation strategies, including social distancing and mask wearing.? To help reduce the ongoing transmission risk in a community, state and county health department staff members and community leaders need to work together to develop, deliver, and promote culturally responsive health education messages to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and ensure that access to testing services is timely and convenient.

In this research, for the first time, a series of experiments, including modified compaction, unconfined compression strength and resilient modulus tests, were conducted on the blends of different percentages of the shredded face mask (SFM) added to the recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) for road base and subbase applications. The experimental results show that RCA mixed with three different percentages (i.e., 1%, 2% and 3%) of SFM satisfied the stiffness and strength requirements for pavements base/subbase. The introduction of the shredded face mask not only increased the strength and stiffness but also improved the ductility and flexibility of RCA/SFM blends. The inclusion of 1% SFM to RCA resulted in the highest values of unconfined compressive strength (216 kPa) and the highest resilient modulus (314.35 MP).

AIM: To identify strategies for the successful implementation and sustainable use of PSI-based interventions in routine primary care. DESIGN & SETTING: Qualitative study in primary care settings across England. METHOD: Anchoring on a complex pharmacist-led IT-based intervention (PINCER) and clinical decision support (CDS) for prescribing and medicines management, a qualitative study was conducted using sequential, multiple methods. The methods comprised documentary analysis, semi-structured interviews, and online workshops to identify challenges and possible solutions to the longer-term sustainability of PINCER and CDS. Thematic analysis was used for the documentary analysis and stakeholder workshops, while template analysis was used for the semi-structured interviews. Findings across the three methods were synthesised using the RE-AIM (reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. RESULTS: Forty-eight documents were analysed, and 27 interviews and two workshops involving 20 participants were undertaken. Five main issues were identified, which aligned with the adoption and maintenance dimensions of RE-AIM: fitting into current context (adoption); engaging hearts and minds (maintenance); building resilience (maintenance); achieving engagement with secondary care (maintenance); and emphasising complementarity (maintenance). CONCLUSION: Extending ownership of prescribing safety beyond primary care-based pharmacists, and achieving greater alignment between general practice and hospital prescribing safety initiatives, is fundamental to achieve sustained impact of PSI-based interventions in primary care.","output":"Strategies supporting sustainable prescribing safety improvement interventions in English primary care: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a newly discovered infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus The COVID-19 pandemic started at the end of December 2019 in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the world, especially in North and South America or Europe The number of infected cases in the developed countries in North America and Europe or South America is extremely high, whereas its number in the developing countries of Africa or Southeast Asia is not so high;therefore, the COVID-19 is different from the usual infectious disease outbreaks This article introduces the epidemiology of COVID-19, comparing with other historical infectious disease outbreaks","output":"Epidemiology of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and several remarkable pandemics.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of liver injury on the prognosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods In this retrospective, single-center study, data on 109 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were extracted and analyzed. The primary composite end-point event was the use of mechanical ventilation or death. Results At admission, of the 109 patients enrolled, 56 patients (51.4%) were diagnosed with severe disease, and 39 (35.8%) presented with liver injury, which mainly manifested as elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) accompanied simultaneously by an increase in the level of -glutamyl transferase. A primary composite end-point event occurred in 21 patients (19.3%). Liver injury was more prevalent in patients with severe disease than in those with non-severe disease (46.4% vs. 24.5%, P=0.017). However, there was no significant difference found between severe and non-severe patients in the use of mechanical ventilation, mortality, hospital stay, or use and dosage of glucocorticoids between individuals with and without liver injury (all P>0.05). The degree of disease severity (OR =7.833, 95% CI, 1.834-31.212, P=0.005) and presence of any coexisting illness (OR =4.736, 95% CI, 1.305-17.186, P=0.018) were predictable risk factors for primary composite end-point events, whereas liver injury had no significance in this aspect (OR =0.549, 95% CI, 0.477-5.156, P=0.459).

However, little is known about the incidence and impact of AKI occurring in the community or early in the hospital admission. The traditional KDIGO definition can fail to identify patients for whom hospitalization coincides with recovery of AKI as manifested by a decrease in serum creatinine (sCr). We hypothesized that an extended KDIGO definition, adapted from the International Society of Nephrology 0by25 studies, would identify more cases of AKI in patients with COVID-19 and that these may correspond to community-acquired AKI with similarly poor outcomes as previously reported in this population. Methods and Findings: All individuals in the ISARIC cohort admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 15th, 2020, to February 1st, 2021, were included in the study. Data was collected and analysed for the duration of a patients admission. Incidence, staging and timing of AKI were evaluated using a traditional and extended KDIGO (eKDIGO) definition which incorporated a commensurate decrease in serum creatinine. Patients within eKDIGO diagnosed with AKI by a decrease in sCr were labelled as deKDIGO. Clinical characteristic and outcomes - intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death - were compared for all three groups of patients. The relationship between eKDIGO AKI and in-hospital death was assessed using survival curves and logistic regression, adjusting for disease severity and AKI susceptibility. 75,670 patients from 54 countries were included in the final analysis cohort. Median length of admission was 12 days (IQR 7, 20). There were twice as many patients with AKI identified by eKDIGO than KDIGO (31.7 vs 16.8%). Those in the eKDIGO group had a greater proportion of stage 1 AKI (58% vs 36% in KDIGO patients). Peak AKI occurred early in the admission more frequently among eKDIGO than KDIGO patients. Compared to those without AKI, patients in the eKDIGO group had worse renal function on admission, more in-hospital complications, higher rates of ICU admission (54% vs 23%) invasive ventilation (45% vs 15%) and increased mortality (38% vs 19%). Patients in the eKDIGO group had a higher risk of in-hospital death than those without AKI (adjusted OR: 1.78, 95% confidence interval: 1.71-1.8, p-value < 0.001). Mortality and rate of ICU admission were lower among deKDIGO than KDIGO patients (25% vs 50% death and 35% vs 70% ICU admission) but significantly higher when compared to patients with no AKI (25% vs 19% death and 35% vs 23% ICU admission) (all p values < 5x10-5). Limitations include ad hoc sCr sampling, exclusion of patients with less than two sCr measurements, and limited availability of sCr measurements prior to initiation of acute dialysis. Conclusions: The use of an extended KDIGO definition to diagnose AKI in this population resulted in a significantly higher incidence rate compared to traditional KDIGO criteria. These additional cases of AKI appear to be occurring in the community or early in the hospital admission and are associated with worse outcomes than those without AKI.","output":"Use of an extended KDIGO definition to diagnose acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19: A multinational study of the ISARIC cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) bioanalysis has become increasingly important in various fields from bioanalysis to clinical diagnosis due to its outstanding merits, including low background signal, high sensitivity, and simple instrumentation.

Yet, in the Peruvian Amazon, the geographical region believed to be tobaccos historical birthplace, this plant is associated with a strikingly different usage and repute: Tobacco (especially Nicotiana rustica L.) in this area is described as a potent medicinal plant, used topically or via ingestion to treat a variety of health conditions. The goal of this transdisciplinary field study was to investigate clinical applications of the tobacco plant as per Amazonian medicine exemplified in the practice of a reputed Maestro Tabaquero, an Amazonian traditional healer whose medical specialization focuses on tobacco-based treatments. METHODS: Using a transdisciplinary clinical approach, we conducted in-depth interviews with the tabaquero applying the systematizing expert interview method, in order to map modes of preparation and administration, indications, contraindications, effects, risks, adverse effects, and systemic aspects of tobacco-based remedies. RESULTS: The informants descriptions revealed refined knowledge on this plants therapeutic properties and scope, safety profile, and application techniques. The main indications mentioned included problems of the mind, of the respiratory system, parasitic illnesses (intestinal/skin), gout, and Amazonian epistemic conditions described as spiritual-energetic in nature. A liquid remedy taken orally was his most commonly used preparation, with acute/sub-acute effects involving a pronounced psychoactive component (altered state of consciousness) and physiological response (emesis, nausea). A skilled tabaquero that knows how to dose, administer, and intervene in case of adverse effects was considered imperative for safe treatment delivery. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study employing a transdisciplinary clinical approach to examine therapeutic applications of tobacco by an Amazonian tabaquero. Our findings significantly contribute to the growing research literature on Amazonian medicine and emergent psychedelic-assisted therapies and could, in the long-term, open new treatment avenues in several domains.

The Delta variant has a transmission advantage over the Alpha variant, and thus replaced it in approximately two months. The outbreak led to an unexpectedly large proportion of breakthrough infections (BTI)-- a phenomenon that received worldwide attention. The BTI proportion amongst cases in the age group of 60+ years reached levels as high as [~]85% in August 2021. Most of the Israeli population, especially those 60+ age, received their second dose of the vaccination, four months before the invasion of the Delta variant. Hence, either the vaccine induced immunity dropped significantly or the Delta variant possesses immunity escaping abilities. In this work, we analyzed and model age-structured cases, vaccination coverage, and vaccine BTI data obtained from the Israeli Ministry of Health, to help understand the epidemiological factors involved in the outbreak. We propose a mathematical model which captures a multitude of factors, including age structure, the time varying vaccine efficacy, time varying transmission rate, BTIs, reduced susceptibility and infectivity of vaccinated individuals, protection duration of the vaccine induced immunity, and the vaccine distribution. We fitted our model to the cases among vaccinated and unvaccinated, for <60 and 60+ age groups, to address the aforementioned factors. We found that the transmission rate was driven by multiple factors including the invasion of Delta variant and the mitigation measures. Through a model reconstruction of the reproductive number R0(t), it was found that the peak transmission rate of the Delta variant was 1.96 times larger than the previous Alpha variant. The model estimated that the vaccine efficacy dropped significantly from >90% to [~]40% over 6 months, and that the immunity protection duration has a peaked Gamma distribution (rather than exponential). We further performed model simulations quantifying the important role of the third vaccination booster dose in reducing the levels of breakthrough infections. This allowed us to explore \\"what if\\" scenarios should the booster not have been rolled out. Application of this framework upon invasion of new pathogens, or variants of concern, can help elucidate important factors in the outbreak dynamics and highlight potential routes of action to mitigate their spread.","output":"Modelling COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Infections in Highly Vaccinated Israel - the effects of waning immunity and third vaccination dose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Being heavily dependent to oil products (mainly gasoline and diesel), the French transport sector is the main emitter of Particulate Matter (PMs) whose critical levels induce harmful health effects for urban inhabitants We selected three major French cities (Paris, Lyon, and Marseille) to investigate the relationship between the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak and air pollution Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) experiments, we have determined the concentration of PM2 5 and PM10 linked to COVID-19-related deaths Our focus is on the potential effects of Particulate Matter (PM) in spreading the epidemic The underlying hypothesis is that a pre-determined particulate concentration can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection The empirical strategy used an innovative Machine Learning (ML) methodology In particular, through the so-called cutting technique in ANNs, we found new threshold levels of PM2 5 and PM10 connected to COVID-19: 17 4 g/m3 (PM2 5) and 29 6 g/m3 (PM10) for Paris;15 6 g/m3 (PM2 5) and 20 6 g/m3 (PM10) for Lyon;14 3 g/m3 (PM2 5) and 22 04 g/m3 (PM10) for Marseille Interestingly, all the threshold values identified by the ANNs are higher than the limits imposed by the European Parliament Finally, a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm is applied to check the consistency of our findings","output":"The relationship between air pollution and COVID-19-related deaths: An application to three French cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coordinated efforts between the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Veterans Affairs have built the capacity for large-scale clinical research investigating the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic pain treatments.

We used this model to evaluate how patient-specific lung compliance (C) and resistance (R) would impact Vt under 5 ventilator settings of pre-set PIP, PEEP, and I:E ratio (suggested by Farkas, J.D. MD as an approach by hospitals to manage multiple patients on a single ventilator). Results: Our computational model predicts Vt within 10% of experimental measurements. Using this model to perform a parametric study, we provide proof-of-concept for an algorithm to better match patients in different hypothetical scenarios of a single ventilator shared by more than one patient. Conclusions: Assigning patients to pre-set ventilators based on their lung mechanics could be used to overcome some of the legitimate concerns of placing multiple patients on a single ventilator. We emphasize that our results are currently based on a computational model that has not been validated against any pre-clinical/clinical data. Therefore, clinicians considering this approach should not look to our study as an exact estimate of predicted patient tidal volumes.","output":"Use of a Single Ventilator to Support Multiple Patients: Modeling Tidal Volume Response to Heterogeneous Lung Mechanics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the experiences and learnings of 2 ambulatory care nurse leaders on the front lines of the Covid-19 pandemic using the theory \\"navigating through chaos\\" as a framework.","output":"Nurse Leaders' Experiences and Learnings Navigating Through the Chaos of a Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SAP ERP knowledge is becoming more and more important and the demand for corresponding education and training is constantly increasing. Nowadays, curricula around SAP ERP typically include face-to-face instruction by a lecturer as well as hands-on practice phases with the SAP system to apply and reinforce theoretical knowledge. In the era of COVID-19, this has created challenges, since courses needed to be redesigned to be fully digital within a very short amount of time. The purpose of this paper is to identify existing digital elements around SAP ERP education and training that could help lecturers to design engaging hybrid or fully digital learning offerings. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted, and the results show that the identified offerings are either infrastructural offerings or simulations. Furthermore, SAP S/4HANA is hardly addressed in prior research, even though it is supposed to become the industry standard by 2027. Consequently, future research should focus on developing digital elements for education and training around SAP S/4HANA. Existing simulations might be adapted, but research should also try to explore further digital elements beyond simulations.","output":"Digital Elements for SAP ERP Education and Training Results from a Systematic Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the main cellular target of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is thought to be alveolar cells, the absence of their tractable culture system precludes the development of a clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 infection model. Here, we establish an efficient human alveolosphere culture method and sphere-based drug testing platform for SARS-CoV-2. Alveolospheres exhibit indolent growth in a Wnt- and R-spondin-dependent manner. Gene expression, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy analyses reveal the presence of alveolar cells in alveolospheres. Alveolospheres express ACE2 and allow SARS-CoV-2 to propagate nearly 100,000-fold in 3 days of infection. Whereas lopinavir and nelfinavir, protease inhibitors used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, have a modest anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2, remdesivir, a nucleotide prodrug, shows an anti-viral effect at the concentration comparable with the circulating drug level.

High levels of antibodies were observed in 98% of our vaccinated cohort, and the presence of protective T cells was confirmed in the blood samples of all participants. The humoral immune response is diversified and is visible as early as 2C3 weeks after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine. The level of protection increased significantly after the second dose, with the increase being much greater in pre-vaccine healthy subjects and less in convalescents. In the second and third weeks after the second dose, the concentration of IgG antibodies was the highest, and in the following weeks, it decreased gradually. Regular serological measurements on eight subjects show that antibody titers are lower four months after vaccination than before the second dose.","output":"Differences in the concentration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies post-COVID-19 recovery or post-vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"LAY ABSTRACT Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social communication difficulties and restricted repetitive behaviors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder are often diagnosed with other psychiatric conditions, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression. However, research on post-traumatic stress disorder among individuals with autism spectrum disorder is scarce. Nonetheless, studies have shown that those with autism spectrum disorder may face an increased risk of exposure to traumatic events. Separate lines of research in autism spectrum disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder have shown that the two may share several vulnerability factors. One of those is ruminative thinking, that is, one's tendency to re-hash thoughts and ideas, in a repetitive manner. This article examined the role of two rumination types as potential factors connecting autism spectrum disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder: brooding (continuously comparing one's current condition to one's desired condition) and reflection (an introspective effort to cognitively solve one's problems). A total of 34 adults with autism spectrum disorder (with no intellectual impairment) and 66 typically developing adults completed questionnaires assessing post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and rumination. The results showed increased post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in adults with autism spectrum disorder, compared to typically developing adults. Brooding rumination was also higher among those with autism spectrum disorder. Finally, brooding, but not reflection, served as a mechanism connecting autism spectrum disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, that is, those with autism spectrum disorder showed increased brooding, which in turn predicted more post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. This study has potential clinical implications. Rumination and cognitive inflexibility, which are common in autism spectrum disorder, could exacerbate post-traumatic symptoms among individuals with autism spectrum disorder who experience traumatic events. Interventions targeting brooding rumination and cognitive flexibility may assist in alleviating post-traumatic symptoms in individuals with autism spectrum disorder.","output":"The comorbidity between autism spectrum disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder is mediated by brooding rumination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While RDF was designed to make data easily readable by machines, it does not make data easily usable by end-users. Question Answering (QA) over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is seen as the technology which is able to bridge this gap. It aims to build systems which are capable of extracting the answer to a users natural language question from an RDF dataset. In recent years, many approaches were proposed which tackle the problem of QA over KGs. Despite such efforts, it is hard and cumbersome to create a Question Answering system on top of a new RDF dataset. The main open challenge remains portability, i.e., the possibility to apply a QA algorithm easily on new and previously untested RDF datasets. In this publication, we address the problem of portability by presenting an architecture for a portable QA system. We present a novel approach called QAnswer KG, which allows the construction of on-demand QA systems over new RDF datasets. Hence, our approach addresses non-expert users in QA domain. In this paper, we provide the details of QA system generation process. We show that it is possible to build a QA system over any RDF dataset while requiring minimal investments in terms of training. We run experiments using 3 different datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to design a process for non-expert users.

Unlike the outdoors, indoor air quality (IAQ) in nursing homes is not regulated by legislation and is seldom monitored. To that end, residents of nursing homes commonly spend the vast majority of their time indoors where they are exposed to indoor air pollutants for long periods of time. Given that many nursing home residents, especially those of advanced age, are more susceptible to the effects of air pollutants, even at low concentrations, this prolonged exposure may adversely affect their health, well-being, quality of life and increase medical expenditures due to frequent, unscheduled acute care visits and hospitalizations. We propose an action plan for assessing IAQ in nursing homes, understanding the impacts of IAQ on adverse health outcomes of nursing home residents, and addressing vulnerabilities in these facilities to safeguard health, well-being, and quality of life of nursing home residents and minimizing unscheduled acute care visits and hospitalizations. We propose that IAQ should be regularly monitored in nursing homes to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities in these facilities and that resources should be provided for remedial interventions to improve IAQ in nursing homes, including but not limited to source control, improving ventilation and filtration, and deploying air cleaners where appropriate. This proactive approach may pave the way for establishing enforceable standards for indoor air quality in nursing homes that will promote health, well-being, and quality of life of nursing home residents and reduce medical expenditures.","output":"Adequate indoor air quality in nursing homes: An unmet medical need."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected more than 19 7 million persons worldwide with 7 28 013 deaths till August 10, 2020 It has put an unprecedented workload on healthcare systems with special reference to labor rooms and obstetrics as deliveries cannot be stopped or postponed Preparing their facilities using triage (COVID-positive patients, COVID-suspect patients, and COVID-negative patients) can help to better utilize the limited resources and help in prevention of spread of disease, and improve maternal and perinatal outcome There is a need for proper training of healthcare providers for judicious use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for optimum outcome Fortunately, the available literature suggests that there is no substantial increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 in pregnancy or its increased virulence in pregnancy and labor and there are no adverse effects on fetus and neonate with negligible fetal transmission rate Nevertheless, utmost care is needed to manage such pregnancies, their prenatal care, and labor This review aimed to highlight the main recommendations applied in Indian maternities for better management of pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Recommendations for prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care during COVID-19 pandemic in India.

To compare presentation of infectious keratitis during COVID-19 lockdown with previous years, assess relative severity, and compare outcomes between COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 era groups. Methods. Acute presentations of infectious keratitis during a strict government-mandated COVID-19 lockdown period were analysed retrospectively (MarchCMay 2020). Data were compared with the same periods in 2018-2019. The clinical notes of patients undergoing corneal scrapes were reviewed, and data were collected on treatment, culture growth, surgical interventions, visual outcomes, admission rates, and risk factors. Results. There were 37% fewer presentations of infectious keratitis to the ED in 2020 (N = 29, 47, and 45, respectively). Risk factor profiles and microbial data were similar across all periods. Admission rates and use of fortified antibiotics were lower in 2020. COVID-19 era cases recovered less vision (LogMAR 0.26, 0.67, and 0.45, respectively;p = 0.04) and were more likely to require surgical intervention (10%, 4%, and 2%, respectively;OR 3.4 (CI 0.7C17.9, p = 0.1)). Conclusion. A concerning fall in presentations of infectious keratitis to ED during the pandemic lockdown was observed. Though societal behaviour changed during the lockdown, our data suggest it is unlikely that the incidence of infectious keratitis fell significantly. It is unclear how and where these patients were treated. We postulate that lower levels of visual recovery and higher rates of surgical intervention may have been caused by delays in accessing care. To minimise avoidable ocular morbidity as COVID-19 resurges, we must communicate clearly with patients and health professionals on how to access available emergency eye care services.

In many countries, public debate has focused on the risks this technology poses to privacy, with advocates and experts sounding alarm bells about surveillance and mission creep reminiscent of the post 9/11 era. Yet, when Apple and Google launched their contact tracing API in April 2020, some of the world's leading privacy experts applauded this initiative for its privacy-preserving technical specifications. In an interesting twist, the tech giants came to be portrayed as greater champions of privacy than some democratic governments. This article proposes to view the Apple/Google API in terms of a broader phenomenon whereby tech corporations are encroaching into ever new spheres of social life. From this perspective, the (legitimate) advantage these actors have accrued in the sphere of the production of digital goods provides them with (illegitimate) access to the spheres of health and medicine, and more worrisome, to the sphere of politics. These sphere transgressions raise numerous risks that are not captured by the focus on privacy harms. Namely, a crowding out of essential spherical expertise, new dependencies on corporate actors for the delivery of essential, public goods, the shaping of (global) public policy by non-representative, private actors and ultimately, the accumulation of decision-making power across multiple spheres. While privacy is certainly an important value, its centrality in the debate on digital contact tracing may blind us to these broader societal harms and unwittingly pave the way for ever more sphere transgressions.","output":"Blind-sided by privacy?

The purpose of this method is to recognize emotions in spoken speech through the knowledge base of emotionally charged words, which are stored as a code book. The method analyzes human speech for the presence of emotions. To assess the quality of the method, an experiment was conducted for 420 audio recordings. The accuracy of the proposed method is 79.7% for the Kazakh language. The method can be used for different languages and consists of the following tasks: capturing a signal, detecting speech in it, recognizing speech words in a simplified transcription, determining word boundaries, comparing a simplified transcription with a code book, and constructing a hypothesis about the degree of speech emotionality. In case of the presence of emotions, there occurs complete recognition of words and definitions of emotions in speech. The advantage of this method is the possibility of its widespread use since it is not demanding on computational resources. The described method can be applied when there is a need to recognize positive and negative emotions in a crowd, in public transport, schools, universities, etc. The experiment carried out has shown the effectiveness of this method.

Non-coding RNAs, RNA transcripts that are unable to encode proteins, not only participate in the pathological mechanisms of autoimmune-related diseases but also regulate the function of immune cells in these diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of non-coding RNAs contributes to DC differentiation, functions, and so on, consequently producing effects in various autoimmune diseases.

We aimed to investigate the magnitude of the association between psoriasis and the risk of prevalent and incident NAFLD, and to assess whether psoriasis severity and/or psoriatic arthritis are associated with a greater risk of NAFLD. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies evaluating the association between psoriasis and NAFLD, as diagnosed by imaging or International Classification of Diseases codes was performed. Literature search on PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science on May 3, 2021 was undertaken. Studies using liver biopsy were not available. For the meta-analysis, the random-effects modelling was adopted. RESULTS We identified 15 observational (case-control and cross-sectional) studies for a total of 249,933 patients with psoriasis (49% with NAFLD) and 1,491,402 controls (36% with NAFLD). Psoriasis was associated with prevalent NAFLD (n = 11 studies; pooled random-effects odds ratio [OR] 1.96, 95% CI 1.70-2.26; I2 = 97%, p < 0.01). Psoriatic patients with NAFLD had a higher mean psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) than their counterparts without NAFLD (n = 8 studies, pooled weighted mean difference: 3.93, 95% CI 2.01-5.84; I2 = 88%, p < 0.01).

A good understanding of the current status and issues of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in naturally ventilated urban buildings and the association with urban microclimate is fundamental for improving their IEQ. This paper reviews past studies on (a) the microclimate in urban street canyons, (b) the potential influence of such microclimate on IEQ of nearby naturally ventilated buildings, and (c) the real-life IEQ status in these buildings. The review focuses mainly on studies conducted by on-site measurements. The microclimate in urban street canyons is characterized by low wind speed, high surface temperature difference, high pollutant concentration, and high noise level. Insufficient ventilation rates and excessive penetration of outdoor pollutants are two key risks involved in naturally ventilated urban buildings. Existing knowledge suggests that reasonable urban planning and careful building envelope design are the primary methods to ensure acceptable IEQ and maximize the utilization of natural ventilation. However, quantitative studies of both microclimate in street canyons and IEQ in buildings are still highly insufficient in many aspects, which make cross comparison and influencing factors analysis currently impossible.

Methods We reviewed 85 studies (21,530 patients), published from five regions of the world, to highlight issues involved in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic, following the standards outlined in the PRISMA statement. All relevant articles, published up to May 31, 2020, in PubMed, BioRiXv, MedRiXv, and Google Scholar, were included. We evaluated the qualitative (9749 patients) and quantitative (10,355 patients) performance of RT-PCR and serologic diagnostic tests for real-world samples, and assessed the concordance (5,538 patients) between methods in meta-analyses. Results The RT-PCR tests exhibited heterogeneity in the primers and reagents used. Of 1,957 positive RT-PCR COVID-19 participants, 1,585 had positive serum antibody (IgM +/- IgG) tests (sensitivity 0.81, 95%CI 0.66-.90).

In the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed whether those trained through these programmes were involved in the COVID-19 response and if so, in which area(s) of the emergency response they were applying their skills. Methods: From the records for each training programme, we identified the individuals who had completed training during the relevant timespan of each programme: 1999-2018 for the CRDF scheme, 2015-2020 for PGTS, and 2009-2019 for SORT-IT. Between March and April 2020, we sent trainees an online questionnaire by e-mail. Results: Out of 1254 trained, 1143 could be contacted and 699 responded to the survey. Of the latter, 411 were involved with the COVID-19 response, of whom 315 (77%) were applying their acquired skills in 85 countries. With some overlap between programmes, 84% of those trained through CRDF were applying their skills in 27 countries, 91% of those trained through PGTS were applying their skills in 19 countries, and through SORT IT, this was 73% in 62 countries. Skills were being applied in various areas of the emergency response, including: emergency preparedness, situation analysis/surveillance, infection control and clinical management, data generation, mitigating the effect of COVID on the health system, and research. Depending on the type of training programme, 26-74% were involved in implementation, operational or clinical research. Conclusion: Research training programmes build research capacity and equip health workers with transferable core competencies and skillsets prior to epidemics.

METHODS: a retrospective observational analytical descriptive study was carried out on the population attended in the Emergency Services of two general hospitals in a public Health Care Department in Spain. Data were studied from the two-months confinement period in 2020 and compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: A total of 56,332 emergency cases were included. There was a decrease in the total number of patients attended along the confinement period compared to the same period in the two previous years. Fracture cases decreased by 58,8% in the confinement period (330 in 2020; 715 in 2018 and 884 in 2019). Also there was a 37,6% reduction in fractures needing admission or surgery. The percentage distribution of the types of fractures that required admission resulted in a decrease in upper and lower limb fractures, whereas the number of vertebral and hip fractures remained unchanged.

This inflammatory response results from assembly/activation of a cell-intrinsic defense platform known as the inflammasome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 viroporin encoded by ORF3a activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, the most promiscuous of known inflammasomes. ORF3a triggers IL-1 expression via NFB, thus priming the inflammasome while also activating it via ASC-dependent and -independent modes. ORF3a-mediated inflammasome activation requires efflux of potassium ions and oligomerization between NEK7 and NLRP3. With the selective NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 able to block ORF3a-mediated inflammasome activation and key ORF3a residues needed for virus release and inflammasome activation conserved in SARS-CoV-2 isolates across continents, ORF3a and NLRP3 present prime targets for intervention. Summary Development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies is aimed predominantly at blocking infection or halting virus replication. Yet, the inflammatory response is a significant contributor towards disease, especially in those severely affected. In a pared-down system, we investigate the influence of ORF3a, an essential SARS-CoV-2 protein, on the inflammatory machinery and find that it activates NLRP3, the most prominent inflammasome by causing potassium loss across the cell membrane. We also define key amino acid residues on ORF3a needed to activate the inflammatory response, and likely to facilitate virus release, and find that they are conserved in virus isolates across continents.

The isolated viruses grew to equal or higher titers than parental JHM virus at 39 but were restricted in replication at 32 and hence were cold-sensitive mutants. Neither isolate synthesized RNA at the nonpermissive temperature (32), and temperature shift experiments indicated that the restrictive cold-sensitive step in replication occurred during an early viral function. The isolates were unable to complement each other at 32. Although coinfection between each mutant and parental JHM virus often resulted in decreased yields of both infecting viruses, interference could not be convincingly demonstrated. Both mutants were more thermostable than parental JHM virus and could be distinguished from each other and from parental JHM virus by their thermal inactivation kinetics. The isolates were obtained from single cell clones and therefore presumed to be homogeneous; however, thermal inactivation of one (S-3JHM) indicated the possible existence of a second population. Subclones of virus prepared from each isolate were also found to be thermally stable and to retain the cold sensitive defect.

Despite a high unmet need for modern family planning methods, the state has experienced a substantial decline in fertility. India has also seen a decline during this period which can be attributed to the increased prevalence of modern methods of family planning, particularly female sterilisation, but in UP, the corresponding increase was marginal. At the same time, Traditional Family Planning Methods (TMs) increased significantly in UP in contrast to India, where it was marginal. The trends in UP raise questions about the drivers in fertility decline and question the conventional wisdom that fertility declines are driven by modern methods, and the paper aims to understand this paradox. Fertility trends and family planning practices in UP were analysed using data from different rounds of National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) and the two UP Family Planning Surveys conducted by the UP Technical Support Unit to understand whether the use of TMs played a role in the fertility decline. As per NFHS-4, the prevalence of TM in India (6%) was less than half that of UP (13%). The UP Family Planning Survey in 25 High Priority Districts estimated that 22% of women used TMs. The analysis also suggested that availability and accessibiility of modern contraceptives might have played a role in the increased use of TMs in UP. If there are still couples who make a choice in favour of TMs, they should be well informed about the risks associated with the use of traditional methods as higher failure rate is observed among TMs users.","output":"Declining fertility and increasing use of traditional methods of family planning: a paradox in Uttar Pradesh, India?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of biodiversity protection for disease prevention is now obvious from evolutionary, ecological and economic angles.","output":"Three-pronged pandemic prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This paper aims to clarify the concept of reflective practice in nursing by using Rodgers' evolutionary method of concept analysis.

Peer-reviewed articles published in English language between 2011-2021 that included the terms 'reflection' and/or 'reflective practice' in the title were selected. Seminal pieces of work were also considered in this analysis. A total of 23 works were included. Most of the selected works addressed the concept of reflective practice in nursing education or nursing practice. DATA SYNTHESIS: The data analysis integrated the stages identified in Rodgers' method of concept analysis to analyze the concept of reflective practice. Analysis of selected works provided an understanding of common surrogates, antecedents, attributes, and consequences of the concept of reflective practice. CONCLUSIONS: Reflective practice is a cognitive skill that demands conscious effort to look at a situation with an awareness of own beliefs, values, and practice enabling nurses to learn from experiences, incorporate that learning in improving patient care outcomes. It also leads to knowledge development in nursing. Considering the current circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper identifies the need for nurses to go beyond reflection-on-action and also include reflection-in-action and reflection-for-action as part of their practice.

OBJECTIVE: To study the effectiveness of underwater horizontal traction in combination with mechanotherapy in patients with non-stenosing unstable degenerative spondylolisthesis of the lumbosacral spine of the 1st degree, accompanied by pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The clinical study included 14 patients (mean age 50.21 years). Patients underwent underwater horizontal traction of the spine according to the modified Pushkareva-Vozdvizhenskaya method in a variable mode, the procedures were performed every other day, for a course of 6 procedures. After completion of the traction procedure, patients were recommended to put on a fixing lumbosacral corset, in which they rested for 30 minutes in the supine position. At the end of the rest period, the patients performed training of the back muscles with biofeedback on the mechanotherapeutic complex of simulators for 30 minutes daily, except for weekends, for a course of 10 procedures. RESULTS: All patients completed the course of treatment, during the procedures no side effects or deterioration were noted. During the treatment, motor and daily activity significantly improved according to the Oswestry scale (p=0.002), the severity of the pain syndrome and its effect on the patient's activity decreased, according to the Roland-Morris questionnaire (p=0.003). According to an objective assessment of the muscle strength of the lumbosacral spine at the initial level, no deviations from the normative parameters were revealed, however, during the treatment, a significant increase in strength was noted in all muscle groups. CONCLUSION: Underwater horizontal traction of the spine in variable mode according to Pushkareva-Vozdvizhenskaya is an effective and safe method of conservative treatment of unstable non-stenosing degenerative spondylolisthesis of the 1st degree, accompanied by back pain, which helps to reduce the intensity of the pain syndrome and improve the daily motor and social activity of patients.

METHODS: A literature search was conducted by reviewing original research articles such as case reports, case series, observational studies, and questionnaire-based surveys published in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Google scholar. Data from individual patients in case series and case reports have been pooled to create a data set that was compared with larger such cohorts obtained from several other observational studies. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were identified from 14 original articles. No significant differences were found in the clinical manifestations of patients with sarcoidosis presenting with COVID-19 as compared to the general population. The rate of hospitalization in our study was found to be 48.1%. The overall mortality in our study was 7.4%, which is higher than the global average of 2.1%. CONCLUSION: Our observations have reinforced the hypothesis that the presence of additional medical comorbidities is associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission. Furthermore, the presence of moderate to a severe limitation in pulmonary functions is an additional risk factor associated with increased hospital admissions and mortality in sarcoidosis. However, neither the diagnosis of sarcoidosis nor ongoing treatment with steroids, methotrexate, or other immunosuppressants was associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with sarcoidosis. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: Patients with sarcoidosis must take added precautions to mitigate the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection in view of the COVID-19-related mortality rate in this group of patients. Specifically, immunocompromised patients (on immunomodulator drugs and high dose steroids) have been found to have an increased risk of contracting COVID-19.

The guideline recommends a change in monitoring from trough to AUC/MIC based to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine institutional uptake of vancomycin AUC monitoring 1-year post guideline publication in hospitals across the U.S. METHODS: An electronic survey was created to assess vancomycin AUC monitoring practices and distributed to the American College of Clinical Pharmacy Infections Diseases Practice and Research Network (ACCP IDprn) and American Society of Health System Pharmacists (ASHP). Initial survey distribution (phase 1) occurred May-June 2020 and aimed to serve as baseline data. The survey was re-distributed (phase 2) to the ACCP IDprn and ASHP one year later, May-June 2021. Prior to re-distribution the survey was updated to assess the impact of COVID-19 on uptake. Results were analyzed and reported using descriptive statistics. Chi-Square tests were used to compare categorical data. RESULTS: A total of 202 responses to phase 1 and 138 responses to phase 2 were recorded. Significantly more respondents implemented AUC monitoring 1-year post guideline than at baseline (42.8% vs 29.8%, p= 0.013). In both phases, 57% of those who had not implemented AUC monitoring had plans to do so over the next year.

Microglia, the resident inflammatory cells of the brain, are important for pathogen detection and initiation of innate immunity, however, a novel role for these cells as immune regulators has also emerged. PD-L1 on microglia has been shown to negatively regulate T-cell activation in models of multiple sclerosis and acute viral encephalitis. In this study, we investigated the role of glial cell PD-L1 in controlling encephalitogenic CD8(+) T-lymphocytes, which infiltrate the brain to manage viral infection, but remain to produce chronic neuroinflammation. Using a model of chronic neuroinflammation following murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-induced encephalitis, we found that CD8(+) T-cells persisting within the brain expressed PD-1. Conversely, activated microglia expressed PD-L1. In vitro, primary murine microglia, which express low basal levels of PD-L1, upregulated the co-inhibitory ligand upon IFN--treatment. Blockade of the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway in microglial: CD8(+) T-cell co-cultures increased T-cell IFN- and interleukin (IL)-2 production. We observed a similar phenomenon following blockade of this co-inhibitory pathway in astrocyte: CD8(+) T-cell co-cultures. Using ex vivo cultures of brain leukocytes, including microglia and CD8(+) T-cells, obtained from mice with MCMV-induced chronic neuroinflammation, we found that neutralization of either PD-1 or PD-L1 increased IFN- production from virus-specific CD8(+) T-cells stimulated with MCMV IE1(168-176) peptide. These data demonstrate that microglia and astrocytes control antiviral T-cell responses and suggest a therapeutic potential of PD1: PD-L1 modulation to manage the deleterious consequences of uncontrolled neuroinflammation.","output":"Glial cells suppress post-encephalitic CD8(+) T lymphocytes through PD-L1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a spectrum of adversities that have affected older adults disproportionately.

We investigate pre-pandemic levels of functional, social and psychological forms of resilience among this sub-population of at-risk individuals on two outcomes C self-reported comprehensive pandemic impact and personal worry. METHODS: This study was conducted using Follow-up 1 data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), and the Baseline and Exit COVID-19 study, conducted between April and December in 2020. A final sub-group of 9211 older adults with two or more chronic health conditions were selected for analyses. Logistic regression and Generalized Linear Mixed Models were employed to test hypotheses between a multimorbidity resilience index and its three sub-indices measured using pre-pandemic Follow-up 1 data and the outcomes, including covariates. RESULTS: The multimorbidity resilience index was inversely associated with pandemic comprehensive impact at both COVID-19 Baseline wave (OR = 0.83, p < 0.001, 95% CI: [0.80,0.86]), and Exit wave (OR = 0.84, p < 0.001, 95% CI: [0.81,0.87]); and for personal worry at Exit (OR = 0.89, p < 0.001, 95% CI: [0.86,0.93]), in the final models with all covariates. The full index was also associated with comprehensive impact between the COVID waves (estimate = ? 0.19, p < 0.001, 95% CI: [? 0.22, ? 0.16]). Only the psychological resilience sub-index was inversely associated with comprehensive impact at both Baseline (OR = 0.89, p < 0.001, 95% CI: [0.87,0.91]) and Exit waves (OR = 0.89, p < 0.001, 95% CI: [0.87,0.91]), in the final model; and between these COVID waves (estimate = ? 0.11, p < 0.001, 95% CI: [? 0.13, ? 0.10]). The social resilience sub-index exhibited a weak positive association (OR = 1.04, p < 0.05, 95% CI: [1.01,1.07]) with personal worry, and the functional resilience measure was not associated with either outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that psychological resilience is most pronounced in protecting against pandemic comprehensive impact and personal worry.

The present study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of travel restrictions in reducing the risk of importation from mid-August to September, 2014, using a simple hazard-based statistical model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The hazard rate was modeled as an inverse function of the effective distance, an excellent predictor of disease spread, which was calculated from the airline transportation network. By analyzing datasets of the date of EVD case importation from the 15(th) of July to the 15(th) of September 2014, and assuming that the network structure changed from the 8(th) of August 2014 because of travel restrictions, parameters that characterized the hazard rate were estimated. The absolute risk reduction and relative risk reductions due to travel restrictions were estimated to be less than 1% and about 20%, respectively, for all models tested. Effectiveness estimates among African countries were greater than those for other countries outside Africa. CONCLUSIONS: The travel restrictions were not effective enough to expect the prevention of global spread of Ebola virus disease. It is more efficient to control the spread of disease locally during an early phase of an epidemic than to attempt to control the epidemic at international borders. Capacity building for local containment and coordinated and expedited international cooperation are essential to reduce the risk of global transmission.","output":"Reduced Risk of Importing Ebola Virus Disease because of Travel Restrictions in 2014: A Retrospective Epidemiological Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted public health services worldwide, determining a significant decrease of elective cardiovascular (CV) procedures, especially in patients with associated chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus (DM).

Youth, grades 2-6, and their families who experienced disruption in usual learning and social activities due to COVID-19 restrictions. Experiential activities are the hallmark of farm to school education. In March 2020 all hands-on, school based activities planned by Extension faculty were cancelled due to the pandemic. Faculty responded by offering garden-cooking clubs using a web-based hybrid approach independent of schools. Faculty facilitated bi-weekly virtual meetings of 30 minutes for 6-8 weeks for youth and their families. Asynchronous activities were also offered via a website, kits, video demonstrations, farmers market vouchers and when possible, farm tours. Adult caregivers received a survey at the end of the 6-8 week club sessions to evaluate their child's and family's level of engagement including queries on how much time they spent using web-based tools and how likely they were to start a garden. One hundred and ninety youth, grades 2-6, and their families participated in 4 virtual and/or hybrid clubs delivered by Extension faculty from March 2020 to October 2020. Caregiver responses from the survey (n = 46) indicated 83% of families expanded or started a garden. On average youth and/or families spent 47 minutes per week engaged in program activities including online learning.

METHODS: We analyzed data from patients confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2-positive from February through May 2020. The data were obtained from clinical laboratories, primary health care providers, and hospitals. Previously recorded comorbidities, including diabetes, cancer, circulatory diseases, chronic pulmonary, and kidney disease, were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 2249 patients, 46.0% were men (median age 51 years; median disease duration 27 days). Hospitalization was required for 41.8% patients, mechanical ventilation for 2.5%, while 4.7% of all patients died. Patients who died were significantly older (median 82 vs 50 years, P < 0.001) with a higher prevalence of all investigated comorbidities (all ps <0.001), more frequently required mechanical ventilation (34% vs 1%, P < 0.001), and had shorter length of hospital stay (median 13 vs 27 days, P < 0.001) with no sex preponderance. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation were significantly older (median age 70 vs 51 years, P < 0.001), more frequently men (59.6% vs 45.7%, P = 0.037), showed a higher prevalence of all comorbidities except ischemic heart and chronic kidney disease (all ps <0.001), and demonstrated a higher case-fatality rate (63.2% vs 3.2%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients who died in the first pandemic wave in Croatia were more likely to suffer previous somatic comorbidities. This corroborates the findings of similar studies and calls for further research into the underlying disease mechanisms, hence providing ground for more efficient preventive measures.","output":"Prevalence of somatic comorbidities among coronavirus disease 2019 patients in Croatia in the first pandemic wave: data from national public health databases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted organised sport in the community as authorities cancelled, greatly modified or postponed sporting participation as part of a strategy to reduce transmission of the virus.

In this article we examine the reuse of disposable gowns with respect to still providing personnel protection. XR7, a fluorescent powder, was used to track contamination of gowns after manipulation of rodent cages. Mouse cages were treated with XR7 prior to manipulations. Disposable gowns were labeled for single person use and hung in common procedure spaces within the vivarium between usages. A simulated rack change of 140 cages was completed using XR7-treated cages. One individual changed all cages with a break occurring after the first 70 cages, requiring the gown to be removed and reused once. To simulate research activities, 5 individuals accessed 3 XR7-treated cages daily for 5 d. Each mouse in the XR7-treated cages was manipulated at least once before returning cages to the housing room. Disposable gowns were reused 5 times per individual. Gowns, gloves, clothing, bare arms, and hands were scanned for fluorescence before and after removing PPE. Fluorescence was localized to gloves and gown sleeves in closest contact with animals and caging. No fluorescence was detected on underlying clothing, or bare arms and hands after removing PPE. Fluorescence was not detected in procedure spaces where gowns were hung. The lack of fluorescence on personnel or surfaces indicate that gowns can be reused 1 time for routine husbandry tasks and up to 5 times for research personnel.

The practice of empiric antimicrobial prescription, due to limited diagnostic capabilities of many hospitals, has the potential to escalate an already worrisome antimicrobial resistance (AMR) situation in India. This study reports the prevalence and profiles of secondary infections (SIs) and clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in India. Patients and Methods: A retrospective study of secondary infections in patients admitted in intensive care units (ICUs) and wards of ten hospitals of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) AMR surveillance network, between June and August 2020, was undertaken. The demographic data, time of infection after admission, microbiological and antimicrobial resistance data of secondary infections, and clinical outcome data of the admitted COVID-19 patients were collated. Results: Out of 17,534 admitted patients, 3.6% of patients developed secondary bacterial or fungal infections. The mortality among patients who developed secondary infections was 56.7% against an overall mortality of 10.6% in total admitted COVID-19 patients. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 78% of patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae (29%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (21%). Thirty-five percent of patients reported polymicrobial infections, including fungal infections. High levels of carbapenem resistance was seen in A. baumannii (92.6%) followed by K. pneumoniae (72.8%). Conclusion: Predominance of Gram-negative pathogens in COVID-19 patients coupled with high rates of resistance to higher generation antimicrobials is an alarming finding. A high rate of mortality in patients with secondary infections warrants extra caution to improve the infection control practices and practice of antimicrobial stewardship interventions not only to save patient lives but also prevent selection of drug-resistant infections, to which the current situation is very conducive.","output":"Secondary Infections in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: Indian Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Shortage of general neurosurgery and specialized neurotrauma care in low resource settings is a critical setback in the national surgical plans of low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Neurotrauma fellowship programs typically exist in high-income countries (HIC), where surgeons who fulfill the requirements for positions regularly stay to practice. Due to this issue, neurosurgery residents and medical students from LMICs do not have regular access to this kind of specialized training and knowledge-hubs. The objective of this paper is to present the results of a recently established neurotrauma fellowship program for neurosurgeons of LMICs in the framework of global neurosurgery collaborations, including the involvement of specialized parallel education for neurosurgery residents and medical students. Methods: The Global Neurotrauma Fellowship (GNTF) program was inaugurated in 2015 by a multi-institutional collaboration between a HIC and an LMIC. The course organizers designed it to be a 12-month program based on adapted neurotrauma international competencies with the academic support of the Barrow Neurological Institute at Phoenix Children's Hospital and Meditech Foundation in Colombia. Since 2018, additional support from the UK, National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Global Health Research in Neurotrauma Project from the University of Cambridge enhanced the infrastructure of the program, adding a research component in global neurosurgery and system science. Results: Eight fellows from Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba, Pakistan, and Colombia have been trained and certified via the fellowship program. The integration of international competencies and exposure to different systems of care in high-income and low-income environments creates a unique environment for training within a global neurosurgery framework. Additionally, 18 residents (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Cuba, Germany, Spain, and the USA), and ten medical students (the United Kingdom, USA, Australia, and Colombia) have also participated in elective rotations of neurotrauma and critical care during the time of the fellowship program, as well as in research projects as part of an established global surgery initiative. Conclusion: We have shown that it is possible to establish a neurotrauma fellowship program in an LMIC based on the structure of HIC formal training programs. Adaptation of the international competencies focusing on neurotrauma care in low resource settings and maintaining international mentoring and academic support will allow the participants to return to practice in their home-based countries.","output":"International Neurotrauma Training Based on North-South Collaborations: Results of an Inter-institutional Program in the Era of Global Neurosurgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current case report presents acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy (AHNE) as an example of a fatal complication, the etiology of which could be coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with multiple organ damage along with the existing respiratory tuberculosis.

At present, revealing the molecular mechanisms of osteoporosis and developing effective prevention and treatment methods are of great significance to health worldwide. LncRNA is a non-coding RNA peptide chain with more than 200 nucleotides. Researchers have identified many lncRNAs implicated in the development of diseases and lncRNA H19 is an example. RESULTS A large amount of evidence supports the fact that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes, such as H19, have multiple, far-reaching effects on various biological functions. It has been found that lncRNA H19 has a role in the regulation of different types of cells in the body including the osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts found in bones. Therefore, it can be postulated that lncRNA H19 affects the incidence and development of osteoporosis. CONCLUSION The prospect of targeting lncRNA H19 in the treatment of osteoporosis is promising because of the effects that lncRNA H19 has on the process of osteogenic differentiation. In this review, we summarize the molecular pathways and mechanisms of lncRNA H19 in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and summarize the research progress of targeting H19 as a treatment option.

However, statistical models use different assumptions and methods and thus yield different results. One issue in monitoring disease progression over time is how to handle excess zeros counts. In this research, we assess the statistical empirical performance of these models in terms of their fit and forecast accuracy of COVID-19 deaths.Two types of models are suggested in the literature to study count time series data. The first type of models is based on Poisson and negative binomial conditional probability distributions to account for data over dispersion and using auto regression to account for dependence of the responses. The second type of models is based on zero-inflated mixed auto regression and also uses exponential family conditional distributions. We study the goodness of fit and forecast accuracy of these count time series models based on autoregressive conditional count distributions with and without zero inflation.We illustrate these methods using a recently published online COVID-19 data for Tunisia, which reports daily death counts from March 2020 to February 2021. We perform an empirical analysis and we compare the fit and the forecast performance of these models for death counts in presence of an intervention policy. Our statistical findings show that models that account for zero inflation produce better fit and have more accurate forecast of the pandemic deaths.This paper shows that infectious disease data with excess zero counts are better modelled with zero-inflated models. These models yield more accurate predictions of deaths related to the pandemic than the generalized count data models. In addition, our statistical results find that the lift of travel restrictions has a significant impact on the surge of COVID-19 deaths.

The total number of femicides in 2020 was similar to that recorded during each of the three previous years, and femicides did not peak during the months of the strictest lockdowns. In fact, their monthly distribution in 2020 did not differ from the seasonal distribution of femicides in any former year. The discussion criticizes the current state of research on femicide and its inability to inspire effective criminal polices. It also proposes three lines of intervention. The latter are based on a holistic approach that places femicide in the context of crimes against persons, incorporates biology and neuroscience approaches, and expands the current cultural explanations of femicide.","output":"Against All Odds, Femicide Did Not Increase During the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence From Six Spanish-Speaking Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current guidelines for patient isolation in COVID-19 cases recommend a symptom-based approach, averting the use of control real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) testing. However, we hypothesized that patients with persistently positive results by RT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could be potentially infectious for a prolonged time, even if immunocompetent and asymptomatic, which would demand a longer social isolation period than presently recommended. To test this hypothesis, 72 samples from 51 mildly symptomatic immunocompetent patients with long-lasting positive rRT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 were tested for their infectiousness in cell culture. The serological response of samples from those patients and virus genomic integrity were also analyzed. Infectious viruses were successfully isolated from 34.38% (22/64) of nasopharynx samples obtained 14 days or longer after symptom onset. Indeed, we observed successful virus isolation up to 128 days. Complete SARS-COV-2 genome integrity was demonstrated, suggesting the presence of replication-competent viruses. No correlation was found between the isolation of infectious viruses and rRT-PCR cycle threshold values or the humoral immune response. These findings call attention to the need to review current isolation guidelines, particularly in scenarios involving high-risk individuals. IMPORTANCE In this study, we evaluated mildly symptomatic immunocompetent patients with long-lasting positive rRT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2. Infectious viruses were successfully isolated in cell cultures from nasopharynx samples obtained 14 days or longer after symptom onset. Indeed, we observed successful virus isolation for up to 128 days. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 genome integrity was demonstrated by sequencing, suggesting the presence of replication-competent viruses. These data point out the risk of continuous SARS-CoV-2 transmission from patients with prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract, which has important implications for current precaution guidelines, particularly in settings where vulnerable individuals may be exposed (e.g., nursing homes and hospitals).","output":"Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 Positivity in Immunocompetent Patients: Virus Isolation, Genomic Integrity, and Transmission Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Opioid misuse screening in hospitals is resource-intensive and rarely done. Many hospitalized patients are never offered opioid treatment. An automated approach leveraging routinely captured electronic health record (EHR) data may be easier for hospitals to institute. We previously derived and internally validated an opioid classifier in a separate hospital setting. The aim is to externally validate our previously published and open-source machine-learning classifier at a different hospital for identifying cases of opioid misuse. METHODS: An observational cohort of 56,227 adult hospitalizations was examined between October 2017 and December 2019 during a hospital-wide substance use screening program with manual screening. Manually completed Drug Abuse Screening Test served as the reference standard to validate a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier with coded word embedding features from the clinical notes of the EHR. The opioid classifier utilized all notes in the EHR and sensitivity analysis was also performed on the first 24 h of notes. Calibration was performed to account for the lower prevalence than in the original cohort. RESULTS: Manual screening for substance misuse was completed in 67.8% (n = 56,227) with 1.1% (n = 628) identified with opioid misuse. The data for external validation included 2,482,900 notes with 67,969 unique clinical concept features. The opioid classifier had an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI 0.99C0.99) across the encounter and 0.98 (95% CI 0.98C0.99) using only the first 24 h of notes. In the calibrated classifier, the sensitivity and positive predictive value were 0.81 (95% CI 0.77C0.84) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.68C0.75). For the first 24 h, they were 0.75 (95% CI 0.71C0.78) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.57C0.64). CONCLUSIONS: Our opioid misuse classifier had good discrimination during external validation. Our model may provide a comprehensive and automated approach to opioid misuse identification that augments current workflows and overcomes manual screening barriers.

This practice of smoking can lead to weakened defences of a smoker's respiratory epithelium, making the smoker vulnerable to respiratory diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019, tuberculosis and others. METHODS: This study evaluated the water quality and hygiene factors among 43 smokers of five villages in rural Luang Namtha Province. Water samples were collected from participant's TWPs and assessed for the presence of Escherichia coli, coliforms and aerobic plate count (APC) bacteria using the 3M Petrifilm. RESULTS: The microbial indicator testing results were 95% positive for the APC, 38% positive for coliforms and 17% positive for the E. coli indicator. The concentrations were highest for the APC, with an average of 10(6) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, followed by coliforms with <100 cfu/ml and lowest for E. coli with <10 cfu/ml. Most TWPs were infrequently cleaned, heavily used and contained a warm, brown-coloured water. CONCLUSIONS: The warm, dark and moist internal water container may facilitate microbial survival and growth.

Groupthink, a term coined by Irving Janis to depict premature consensus seeking in highly cohesive groups, is a theory that has been widely discussed in disciplines outside health care. However, it remains unclear how it has been conceptualized, studied, and mitigated in the context of health professionals conducting patient care. This scoping review aimed to examine the conceptualization of groupthink in health care, empirical research conducted in healthcare teams, and recommendations to avoid groupthink. Eight databases were systematically searched for articles focusing on groupthink among health professional teams using a scoping review methodology. A total of 22 articles were included-most were commentaries or narrative reviews with only four empirical research studies. This review found that focus on groupthink and group decision making in medicine is relatively new and growing in interest. Few empirical studies on groupthink in health professional teams have been performed and there is conceptual disagreement on how to interpret groupthink in the context of clinical practice. Future research should develop a theoretical framework that applies groupthink theory to clinical decision making and medical education, validate the groupthink framework in clinical settings, develop measures of groupthink, evaluate interventions that mitigate groupthink in clinical practice, and examine how groupthink may be situated amidst other emerging social cognitive theories of collaborative clinical decision making.","output":"Groupthink among health professional teams in patient care: A scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Profanity, derived from the Latin for \\"not sacred,\\" has long been seen as antithetical to spirituality Social norms around organized religion, respectability, race, gender, etc compound this perception In this article, I examine how the use of profanity in Clinical Pastoral Education can help students experience personal, social, and physical freedom Association of Clinical Pastoral Education outcomes, demographic data, and a student experience provide support for this assertion","output":"Blessings and Cursings: The Liberating Gift of Profanity in Clinical Pastoral Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To explore the emotional impact and experiences of geriatric nurses working in nursing homes and caring for patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19).

As part of the project a case record database was established to document prospective cases of snakebite presenting to Mandalay General Hospital, in Upper Myanmar. The study period was 12 months (1-2-2016 to 31-1-2017). Snake identity was based on a mixture of identified dead snakes brought with patients, doctor's clinical opinion and patient identification. 965 patients were enrolled during the 12 month period, of whom 948 were included for analysis. The male: female ratio was 1.58:1. Most cases involved bites to the lower limbs (82.5%) and adults involved in farm work, confirming snakebite as an occupational disease in this community. Motorised transport was by far the most common form of transport to health care and most patients sought care from the health system (87.7%), not traditional healers (11.5%) as their first point of contact. The officially promoted application of a pressure pad, bandage and immobilisation as first aid for snakebite was almost never used, while most patients used some form of tourniquet (92.0%). 85.4% of cases where a snake ID was listed were bitten by Russell's vipers. Russell's viper bites were responsible for all fatalities (9.8% of cases) and all cases of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). For all cases, clinical features included local swelling (76.5%), local pain (62.6%), AKI (59.8%), incoagulable blood (57.9%), regional lymphadenopathy (39.8%), nausea/vomiting (40.4%), thrombocytopenia (53.6%), abdominal pain (28.8%), shock (11.8%), secondary infection (8.6%), panhypopituitarism (2.1%). AKI required renal replacement therapy (RRT) in 23.9% of cases, all ascribed to Russell's viper bite. Green pit viper bites were the next most common cause of bites (7.6%) and were associated with incoagulable blood (29%) and occasionally shock (5%) and local necrosis (3%), and in one case AKI not requiring RRT. In contrast to Russell's viper bites, green pit viper bite was most likely to occur in the home (49%). Some green pit viper patients were treated with Russell's viper antivenom (15%), presumably because they had incoagulable blood, although this antivenom is not effective against green pit viper envenoming. For the entire patient group, antivenom was given in 80.5% of cases. The most common indications were presence of coagulopathy/non-clotting blood (59.8%), local swelling (47.4%), oliguria/anuria (19.8%), heavy proteinuria (19.4%).

Much progress has been made in vaccine development, and vaccination will become an inevitable trend in the fight against this pandemic. However, the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination still remains uncertain. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was used in Wen Juan Xing survey platform. All the respondents were divided into healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the key sociodemographic, cognitive, and attitude associations among the samples of healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers. Results: A total of 2,580 respondents completed the questionnaire, including 1,329 healthcare workers and 1,251 non-healthcare workers. This study showed that 76.98% of healthcare workers accepted the COVID-19 vaccine, 18.28% workers were hesitant, and 4.74% workers were resistant. Among the non-healthcare workers, 56.19% workers received the COVID-19 vaccine, 37.57% workers were hesitant, and 6.24% workers were resistant. Among the healthcare workers, compared with vaccine recipients, vaccine-hesitant individuals were more likely to be female (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.12C2.07); vaccine-resistant individuals were more likely to live in the suburbs (AOR = 2.81, 95% CI: 1.44C3.99) with an income of 10,000 RMB or greater (AOR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.03C3.90). Among the non-healthcare workers, vaccine-hesitant individuals were more likely to be female (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.31C2.11); vaccine-resistant individuals were also more likely to be female (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.16C3.02) and older than 65 years (AOR = 4.96, 95% CI: 1.40C7.62). There are great differences between healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers in their cognition and attitude toward vaccines. Conclusions: Our study shows that healthcare workers are more willing to be vaccinated than non-healthcare workers.

However, whether abused women from non-Western cultures experience similar post-traumatic responses to intimate partner violence is less documented. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this paper were (1) to review the literature for information about post-traumatic stress disorder among Chinese women survivors of intimate partner violence; (2) to provide a synthesis of the literature on post-traumatic stress disorder among abused Chinese women; and (3) to identify implications for practice and to suggest directions for research relating to post-traumatic stress disorder among abused Chinese women. DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature. DATA SOURCES: Following a systematic search for relevant literature in computerized databases and manual searches of English and Chinese language publications, five papers reporting on four studies conducted in China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and the United States were included in the review. REVIEW METHODS: Abstracts meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed independently by two of the authors and any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Full papers for selected abstracts were then retrieved and assessed independently by the same reviewers. RESULTS: The present literature review revealed a paucity of information relating to post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms or diagnoses in abused Chinese women. Nevertheless, a link between post-traumatic stress disorder and intimate partner violence was demonstrated by the reviewed papers. CONCLUSIONS: Caution should be exercised when making comparison of the findings across the four studies because of the inherent methodological differences.

We aimed to quantify potential infectiousness among asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) in relation to prior or later symptomatic disease. We previously (at the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic) performed a cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 infections among 27,000 healthcare workers (HCWs) at work in the capital region of Sweden. We performed both SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and serology. Furthermore, the cohort was comprehensively followed for sick leave, both before and after sampling. In the present report, we used the cohort database to quantify potential infectiousness among HCWs at work. Those who had sick leave either before or after sampling were classified as post-symptomatic or pre-symptomatic, whereas the virus-positive subjects with no sick leave were considered asymptomatic. About 0.2% (19/9449) of HCW at work were potentially infectious and pre-symptomatic (later had disease) and 0.17% (16/9449) were potentially infectious and asymptomatic (never had sick leave either before nor after sampling). Thus, 33% and 28% of all the 57 potentially infectious subjects were pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, respectively.

We compared the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 76 breakthrough cases after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), or JNJ-78436735 (Janssen) to unvaccinated controls (February-April 2021) in metropolitan New York, including their phylogenetic relationship, distribution of variants, and full spike mutation profiles. The median age of patients in the study was 48 years; 7 required hospitalization and 1 died. Most breakthrough infections (57/76) occurred with B.1.1.7 (Alpha) or B.1.526 (Iota). Among the 7 hospitalized cases, 4 were infected with B.1.1.7, including 1 death. Both unmatched and matched statistical analyses considering age, sex, vaccine type, and study month as covariates supported the null hypothesis of equal variant distributions between vaccinated and unvaccinated in 2 and McNemar tests (P > 0.1), highlighting a high vaccine efficacy against B.1.1.7 and B.1.526. There was no clear association among breakthroughs between type of vaccine received and variant. In the vaccinated group, spike mutations in the N-terminal domain and receptor-binding domain that have been associated with immune evasion were overrepresented. The evolving dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 variants requires broad genomic analyses of breakthrough infections to provide real-life information on immune escape mediated by circulating variants and their spike mutations.","output":"Dominance of Alpha and Iota variants in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough infections in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all aspects of people's lives, with many tasks and services now being delivered online in the aim of reducing contact and preventing further transmission of the disease. This has resulted in the increase in the use of portable electronic devices (i.e., mobile phones, smartphones, laptops), which emit different frequencies of electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation. However, the evidence on the harmful impacts of EMF radiation exposure on the human body, particularly on the abdomen of the female body during pregnancy, is scarce. Further, the related studies in the literature have yet to be systematically reviewed. If unmanaged, the absorption of EMF radiation by the maternal abdomen during pregnancy is associated with serious birth and infant outcomes. PURPOSE: This study aimed to systematically review the published studies on the direct effects of EMF radiation emitted from mobile phones on pregnancy, birth, and infant outcomes. METHODS: After a systematic search using the PRISMA guidelines, a total of 18 articles were retrieved from 5 databases. Studies which addressed the negative outcomes of EMF radiation exposure on mothers, adults, and children's health were included. The research articles were then sorted based on whether their findings were related to the impacts of EMF on physiological or pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: The findings of this review showed that EMF radiation exposure is associated with hormonal, thermal, and cardiovascular changes among adults. However, the reviewed studies did not consider the impacts of EMF radiation exposure on pregnancy outcomes specifically, which makes it difficult to draw conclusions from this review. Only four of the reviewed studies were conducted among pregnant women. These studies reported that EMF radiation exposure during pregnancy is associated with miscarriages and fluctuations in the fetal temperature and heart rate variability, as well as infant anthropometric measures. CONCLUSIONS: More research should be conducted to identify the specific impacts of EMF radiation exposure on pregnancy, birth, and infant outcomes. Healthcare providers and researchers are recommended to collaborate to improve public health through public education and updated organizational policies to limit these environmental risks by encouraging the use of safe technologies.","output":"Impacts of smartphone radiation on pregnancy: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This case report demonstrates pericardial effusion, acute pericarditis, and cardiac tamponade in an otherwise healthy woman who had a positive test result for coronavirus disease 2019.

These tools vary in different aspects. Either children are examined by a trained experimenter, or caregivers fill out questionnaires. The tools are applied in the controlled setting of a laboratory or in the childrens natural environment. While these tools provide a detailed picture of the current state of childrens development, they are at the same time subject to several constraints. Furthermore, the measurement of an individual childs change of different skills over time requires not only one measurement but high-density longitudinal assessments. These assessments are time-consuming, and the breadth of developmental domains assessed remains limited. In this paper, we present a novel tool to assess the development of skills in different domains, a smartphone-based developmental diary app (the kleineWeltentdecker App, henceforth referred to as the APP (The German expression kleine Weltentdecker can be translated as young world explorers.)). By using the APP, caregivers can track changes in their childrens skills during development. Here, we report the construction and validation of the questionnaires embedded in the APP as well as the technical details. Empirical validations with children of different age groups confirmed the robustness of the different measures implemented in the APP. In addition, we report preliminary findings, for example, on childrens communicative development by using existing APP data. This substantiates the validity of the assessment. With the APP, we put a portable tool for the longitudinal documentation of individual childrens development in every caregivers pocket, worldwide.","output":"The kleineWeltentdecker App - A smartphone-based developmental diary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neonatal seizures have an incidence of 3.5 per 1000 newborns; while hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) accounts for 50-60% of cases, half are resistant to 1st-line anti-seizure drugs such as phenobarbital (PB). Tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) activation following ischemic injury is known to increase neuronal excitability by downregulation of K-Cl co-transporter 2 (KCC2); a neuronal chloride (Cl-) co-transporter. In this study, three graded doses of ANA12, a small-molecule selective TrkB antagonist, were tested in CD1 mice at P7 and P10 following induction of neonatal ischemia by a unilateral carotid ligation. The PB loading dose remained the same in all treatment groups at both ages. Evaluation criteria for the anti-seizure efficacy of ANA12 were: (1) quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure burden and power, (2) rescue of post-ischemic KCC2 and pKCC2-S940 downregulation and (3) reversal of TrkB pathway activation following ischemia. ANA12 significantly rescued PB resistant seizures in a dose-dependent manner at P7 and improved PB efficacy at P10. Additionally, female pups responded better to lower doses of ANA12 compared to males. ANA12 significantly reversed post-ischemic KCC2 downregulation and TrkB pathway activation at P7 when PB alone was inefficacious.

The medical community is still getting to know behavior of this virus and the consequences from a population point of view. All this knowledge is extremely dynamic, so some behaviors are still not well established. Otorhinolaryngologists have a central role in the management of this situation, in which they must assess the patient, avoid contamination to and by health professionals and other patients. Thus, the recommendations of the Brazilian Association of Otorhinolaryngology and Cervical-Facial Surgery (ABORL-CCF) have the main objective of reducing the spread of the new coronavirus during otorhinolaryngological care and assisting in the management of these patients. METHODS: Review of the main recommendations of national and international scientific societies, decisions by government agencies and class councils. The topics will be related to the general aspects of COVID-19, personal protective equipment, care in patient assistance, endoscopic exam routines and the management of sinonasal, otological and pediatric evaluations related to COVID-19. RESULTS: The use of personal protective equipment is considered crucial in routine ENT care. We recommend postponing appointments, exams and elective surgeries to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, we recommend changing routines in several areas of otolaryngology. Additionally, guidance is provided on the use of telemedicine resources during the pandemic period.

However, after the discovery of penicillin by Fleming in 1928, and the subsequent introduction of the much cheaper and safer antibiotics in the 1930s, serum therapy was largely abandoned. However, the broad and general use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has resulted in the development of multi-resistant strains of bacteria with limited to no response to existing treatments and the need for alternative treatment options. The combined specificity and flexibility of antibody-based treatments makes them very valuable tools for designing specific antibody treatments to infectious agents. These attributes have already caused a revolution in new antibody-based treatments in oncology and inflammatory diseases, with many approved products. However, only one monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, for the prevention and treatment of respiratory syncytial virus, is approved for infectious diseases. The high cost of monoclonal antibody therapies, the need for parallel development of diagnostics, and the relatively small markets are major barriers for their development in the presence of cheap antibiotics.

Here, we present the results of the pilot trial evaluating low-dose whole-lung irradiation (LD-WLI) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Ten patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia were treated with LD-WLI in a single fraction of 0.5 or 1.0 Gy along with the national protocol. The primary endpoint was the improvement in SpO2. The secondary endpoints were the number of hospital/ICU stay days, the number of intubations after RT, 28-day mortality, and changes in biomarkers. The response rate (RR) was defined as a rise in SpO2 upon RT with a rising or constant trend in the next 2 days, clinical recovery (CR) included patients who were discharged or acquired SpO2&#8805;93% on room air, and 28-day mortality rate was defined based on RT day. RESULTS: The median age was 75 years (80% male). Five, 1, and 4 patients received single 0.5Gy, two 0.5Gy, and single 1.0Gy LD-WLI, respectively. The mean improvement in SpO2 at days 1 and 2 after RT was 2.4% (4.8%) and 3.6% (6.1%), respectively, with improvement in 9 patients after 1 day. Five, 1, and 4 patients were discharged, opted out the trial, and died in hospital, respectively. Two of 5 discharged patients died within 3 days at home. Among discharged patients, the SpO2 at discharge was 81-88% in 3 and 93% in the other 2 patients. Overall, the RR and CR were 63.6% and 55.5%, respectively.

They combine discrete dynamics represented by state machines or finite automata with continuous behaviors represented by differential equations. The measurement of continuous behaviors is performed by sensors. When these sensors have a continuous access to these measurements, we call such model an Event-Triggered model. The properties of this model are easier to prove, while its implementation is difficult in practice. Therefore, it is preferable to introduce a more realistic model, called Time-Triggered model, where the sensors take periodic measurements. Contrary to Event-Triggered models, Time-Triggered models are much easier to implement, but much more difficult to verify. Based on the differential refinement logic (dR[Formula: see text]), a dynamic logic for refinement relations on hybrid systems, it is possible to prove that a Time-Triggered model refines an Event-Triggered model.

Among them, genistein (Gen) stands out for showing cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cells. However, its low water solubility, limited bioavailability, and fast metabolism hinder its administration in chemopreventive therapies. To overcome these obstacles, bovine serum albumin nanovehicles (BSAnp) were obtained by a heat-induced self-assembly process at 70a?C and two aqueous medium pH (9.0 and 11.0) and assayed for the Gen loading. Thus, in this work, Gen loading in BSAnp was studied by spectroscopic techniques and compared with the one obtained for its stereoisomer, chrysin (Chrys). Results revealed that Gen binds to BSAnp via fluorescence quenching mechanism forming inclusion complexes. Compared to Chrys, Gen binding to BSAnp involved more molecules, whereas the association constant was similar for both flavonoids. In general, flavonoid loading in protein systems was strongly affected by the combined effects of BSA conformational state (native vs. aggregated), nanovehicle size, and flavonoid chemical structure. To evaluate the antitumor properties freeze-dried powders were obtained, and they were assayed in vitro after reconstitution by XTT technique and Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry against mouse mammary adenocarcinoma F3II cells. Gen-loaded BSAnp produced a significant decrease in cell viability compared with unloaded BSAnp systems, being the highest cytotoxic effects found for the lowest sized Gen-loaded BSAnp.

METHODS: This was a qualitative study based on face-to-face semistructured interviews with healthcare professionals involved in ASPs and activities across three Ministry of Health (MoH) hospitals in Saudi Arabia (n = 18). Interviews were also conducted with two representatives of a General Directorate of Health Affairs in a Saudi region and two representatives of the Saudi MoH (n = 4) between JanuaryCFebruary 2017. RESULTS: Despite the existence of a national strategy to implement ASPs in Saudi MoH hospitals, their adoption and implementation remains low. Hospitals have their own antimicrobial stewardship policies, but adherence to these is poor. ASP team members highlight that lack of enforcement of policies and guidelines from the MoH and hospital administration is a significant barrier to ASP adoption and implementation. Other barriers include disintegration of teams, poor communication, lack of recruitment/shortage of ASP team members, lack of education and training, and lack of health information technology (IT). Physicians fears and concerns in relation to liability are also a barrier to their adoption of ASPs. CONCLUSION: This is the first qualitative study exploring barriers to ASP adoption and implementation in Saudi hospitals from the perspective of ASP team members. Formal endorsement of ASPs from the MoH as well as hospital enforcement of policies and provision of human and health IT resources would improve the adoption and implementation of ASPs in Saudi hospitals.","output":"Barriers to implementing antimicrobial stewardship programmes in three Saudi hospitals: Evidence from a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose. To analyze the impact of botulinum toxin chemodenervation on postoperative opiate consumption through a novel intraoperative injection protocol. Methods. A retrospective review of the implementation of a novel intraoperative botulinum toxin injection into both rectus and oblique musculature. Patients undergoing open retrorectus release, with and without intraoperative chemodenervation with Botox, were retrospectively collected between 2015 and 2019. Demographics, comorbidities, and opioid use in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) were retrospectively captured. Basic descriptive statistics and linear regression analysis were performed. Results. 19 patients in the Botox and 22 in the no Botox group were analyzed. Basic demographics were similar with female preponderance in the Botox group, 58% vs 27%, P = .05. Median hernia length was 15 cm for both groups (P = .57), median hernia width was 8 vs 9 cm (P = .39), epidural catheter used in 0 vs 4 (P = .11), transverse abdominal plane blocks in 3 vs 4 (P = 1), median MME usage was 191 vs 230 (P = .37) in the inpatient setting, 225 vs 300 (P = .17) in the outpatient setting, and 405 vs 568 (P = .07) in total for Botox vs no Botox groups. Stepwise linear regression analysis identified Botox as the only predictor for MME usage, P = .048. Conclusions. Chemodenervation was the only factor associated with reduced opioid usage compared to a standard group using multimodality analgesia. The role of muscular pain in laparotomy is likely underappreciated and understudied.

Confronted with thousands of deaths daily worldwide, we have to build quickly the rationale behind the treatment, taking advantage from past analogues. When a new virus strikes, T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma/delta cells are in the first line of defence, activated by stress molecules and recognising some epitopes in a process that is major histocompatibility complex (MHC) independent but still specific, e.g. cytomegalovirus (CMV), as well as participating in the regulatory mechanism - both characteristics are useful in fighting SARS-CoV-2. The fatalities are mostly due to pneumonitis, in the course of which an overwhelming inflammatory process impairs blood oxygenation, calling for artificial ventilation. In fatal COVID-19 cases the balance between the immune response and the inflammatory outcome fails, due to which the patients at risk, mostly aged, have higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and an enhanced inflammatory process in the lung. Apparently there is no feedback control over the antibody production. The investigational use of convalescent plasma, providing antibodies taken from patients who have recovered, was shown to be effective, likely through exerting idiotype associated negative control of antibody production. Similarly, the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) may assist the body regulatory mechanisms, knowing the anti-inflammatory potential of these cells. The use of these two immunotherapeutic tools is understandable on the grounds of basic immunology, whose knowledge may direct the medical community in efforts to fight the virus.","output":"Ability of the immune system to fight viruses highlighted by cytometry and TCR clonotype assessments: lessons taken prior to COVID-19 virus pandemic outbreak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infertility is a significant global health issue affecting around 8-12% of couples worldwide with male factor infertility accounting for a substantial proportion of these cases.

Up to 25% with a history of limb related VTE will develop post-thrombotic syndrome, while up to 20% can develop a pulmonary embolus with a mortality rate of between 2-9%. Provision of VTE prophylaxis for critically ill children is highly variable. In preparation for a quality improvement initiative to improve the rate of appropriate VTE prophylaxis in critically ill children, we sought to identify the baseline rate of VTE prophylaxis in our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). METHODS: A VTE prevention guideline was created by a multidisciplinary working group, adapted from published VTE risk assessment tools. Patients are risk stratified for the development of VTE and bleeding risk. To determine baseline provision of appropriate VTE prophylaxis this guideline was retrospectively applied to randomly selected patients aged 1-18 years admitted to the PICU from December 2020-April 2021. Children with COVID/MIS-C, trauma, ECMO or those receiving therapeutic anticoagulation were excluded. Appropriate VTE prophylaxis was defined as pharmacologic prophylaxis (PP)  mechanical prophylaxis (MP) for patients with high risk for VTE and with no or low bleeding risk factors;MP for patients with high risk for VTE and bleeding risk factors or for patients with moderate VTE risk. RESULTS: A total of 78 PICU admissions, with a mean age of 10.6 years were reviewed. Of these, 52% did not have VTE prophylaxis, 42% received MP alone, 5% received combined MP and PP, and 1% received PP alone. Based on our VTE prevention guideline only 64% of patients received appropriate prophylaxis based on their risk stratification. Children older than 12 years of age were more likely to receive any kind of prophylaxis compared to children younger than 12 years of age (94% vs 9%). CONCLUSIONS: VTE prophylaxis was provided less often than indicated to our critically ill pediatric patients. Barriers include low utilization of PP when clinically appropriate, difficulties in providing MP to younger children and no defined process to identify VTE risk stratification.

In the U.S., residential recovery homes for persons with alcohol and drug disorders are good examples of high-risk environments where virus mitigation procedures are essential. The National Alliance for Recovery Residences (NARR) has taken recommendations developed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and applied them to recovery home settings. This paper describes how COVID-19 mitigation efforts in recovery homes may be influenced by two factors. First, while some houses are licensed by states with rigorous health and safety standards, others are not licensed and are subject to less oversight. These homes may be more inconsistent in adhering to mitigation standards. Second, to varying degrees, recovery homes use a social model approach to recovery that contrasts with mitigation procedures such as social distancing and stay-at-home orders. This paper provides examples of ways recovery homes have been forced to adjust to the competing demands of mitigation efforts and social model recovery. The paper also identifies multiple questions that could be addressed by provider-researcher coalitions to inform how social model recovery can navigate forward during the era of COVID-19. As we move forward during the era of COVID-19, providers are encouraged to remember that recovery homes have a history of resilience facing adversity and in fact have their origins in grassroots responses to the challenges of their times.","output":"Understanding Challenges for Recovery Homes During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS (1) To explore the relationship between loneliness and mental health in older people accessing interventions delivered through the voluntary sector.

RESULTS One-to-one therapeutic interventions are beneficial when loneliness is associated with low psychological and emotional wellbeing stemming from trauma and other complex pre-existing issues that have left individuals unable to build social relationships and networks. One-to-one peer-to-peer interventions are beneficial for individuals whose loneliness is linked to low psychological and emotional wellbeing but for whom their issues are less complex. Group-based interventions are beneficial when loneliness is linked to social wellbeing and individuals want to build social networks and relationships and contribute to their community.

The injection of cells as therapeutic treatment often results in apoptosis due to stresses within the needle and the immune response of the host. Degradable microspheres may improve treatment effectiveness by increasing cell residence time, shielding cells during injection, and offering early protection against the immune system response. The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential of human VF fibroblasts encapsulated in polymeric microspheres as an injectable therapeutic treatment in vitro. METHODS Alginate, alginate-poly-L-lysine, and alginate-chitosan microspheres were fabricated using electrospraying and characterized in terms of biocompatibility, swelling, and mechanical properties as well as cytokine production. RESULTS Alginate microspheres were found to have the most desirable properties for VF regeneration. They were resistant to mechanical challenges. They were found to have a stiffness similar to that reported for native VF-lamina propria. They were found to be biocompatible and increased the proliferation of fibroblasts. Human VF fibroblasts encapsulated in alginate microspheres induced the production of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-4 at 24 hours. CONCLUSION The alginate microspheres fabricated in this study were found to offer potential advantages, as cell delivery tool.

Foxd1 is essential for kidney development and mitochondrial metabolism, but its significance in renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has not been reported. METHODS: Transcriptome data from the TCGA database was used to correlate FOXD1 expression with patient survival. FOXD1 was knocked out in the 786-O cell line and known targets were analyzed. Reduced cell growth was observed and investigated in vitro using growth rate and Seahorse XF metabolic assays and in vivo using a xenograft model. Cell cycle characteristics were determined by flow cytometry and immunoblotting. Immunostaining for TUNEL and H2AX was used to measure DNA damage. Association of the FOXD1 pathway with cell cycle progression was investigated through correlation analysis using the TCGA database. RESULTS: FOXD1 expression level in ccRCC correlated inversely with patient survival. Knockout of FOXD1 in 786-O cells altered expression of FOXD1 targets, particularly genes involved in metabolism (MICU1) and cell cycle progression. Investigation of metabolic state revealed significant alterations in mitochondrial metabolism and glycolysis, but no net change in energy production. In vitro growth rate assays showed a significant reduction in growth of 786-O(FOXD1null). In vivo, xenografted 786-O(FOXD1null) showed reduced capacity for tumor formation and reduced tumor size. Cell cycle analysis showed that 786-O(FOXD1null) had an extended G2/M phase. Investigation of mitosis revealed a deficiency in phosphorylation of histone H3 in 786-O(FOXD1null), and increased DNA damage. Genes correlate with FOXD1 in the TCGA dataset associate with several aspects of mitosis, including histone H3 phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: We show that FOXD1 regulates the cell cycle in ccRCC cells by control of histone H3 phosphorylation, and that FOXD1 expression governs tumor formation and tumor growth. Transcriptome analysis supports this role for FOXD1 in ccRCC patient tumors and provides an explanation for the inverse correlation between tumor expression of FOXD1 and patient survival. Our findings reveal an important role for FOXD1 in maintaining chromatin stability and promoting cell cycle progression and provide a new tool with which to study the biology of FOXD1 in ccRCC.

To reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, healthcare institutions implemented policies to protect staff, patients and families. Family presence at the bedside was reduced to one caregiver, except in special circumstances requiring pre-approval by hospital leadership. OBJECTIVES: We explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric healthcare delivery, focusing on family presence. We describe the clinician's experience of restricted family presence during the COVID-19 pandemic in a paediatric hospital. DESIGN/METHODS: Physicians, trainees, and nurses at The Hospital for Sick Children completed surveys between March-August 2020 to identify patients they perceived to have experienced a suboptimal quality of care or health-outcome related to changes that had occurred as a result of the pandemic and describe the impact. Data were analyzed via case report and thematic analysis. As part of a larger study, here we report on cases related to family presence in the hospital. RESULTS: A total of 212 clinicians reported 116 cases; eighteen cases specified an impact on child and family-centered care. Nine cases related to patient experiences and nine to family experiences of the restricted family presence policy. Clinicians reported a perceived distress in patients due to family members not being present. 6267 family restriction exemption requests were received. Cases described families who opted for a different location for end-of-life care so that extended family could be present. Further cases highlighted how important conversations such as disclosure of diagnosis involved one parent present and the other joining remotely. Siblings were also reported to be impacted by visitor restrictions and closure of the sibling play area. Exclusions were also reported to be challenging for children with complex medical needs and technology dependency whereby two-caregivers were often required. Clinicians reported experiencing stress and moral distress as part of being required to support family restriction policies, impairing their ability to provide care. CONCLUSION: Family presence policies are a critical component of child and family-centered care and have been impacted by the pandemic as described both by family and clinician stress. Recommendations based on these findings would include: facilitating two-caregiver presence to support shared decision making, regular remote meetings to communicate information with families in cases where they cannot be physically present; using remote technology or implementing allotted visitation time for siblings, reviewing exceptions to caregiver restrictions, and mental health supports for clinicians such as peer-support groups, or wellness workshops.","output":"88 Family Absence at the Bedside during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiologists suggest that even as we deal with the current COVID-19 crisis, we also prepare for future pandemics.

METHODS Forty-five COPD patients were included in this study where they allocated in three-groups (nasal-delivery, oral-delivery, and oronasal-delivery groups) All patients were received their inhaled-salbutamol dose using Aerogon Solo nebulizer by one of three interfaces e.g. nasal-cannula, mouthpiece, and facemask in two conditions; with oxygen-flow and without any oxygen-flow. Pulmonary and systemic salbutamol deposition was estimated through collecting two urine-samples from the patient; 30min post-inhalation and cumulatively 24h post-inhalation. The quantity of salbutamol in these collected samples was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Lung function measurement was performed pre-bronchodilator inhalation and 30 min post-bronchodilator to estimate the change in pulmonary functions post-inhalation regarding all tested interfaces. RESULTS COPD patients showed the highest salbutamol percentage excreted 30 min post-inhalation of 5.7% (1.4) with mouthpiece interface when combined with oxygen at p<0.002. While with the same condition using oxygen, valved-facemask showed the highest salbutamol percentage excreted in 24 h post inhalation samples but the difference is only significantly compared to nasal cannula (p<0.006).On the other hand without oxygen delivery, mouthpiece and valved facemask showed approximately the same salbutamol percentage excreted in 30 min post-inhalation samples, higher than that delivered by nasal cannula (p<0.001). Of note, salbutamol delivery is significantly increased with oxygen flow for all interfaces (p<0.05) except with nasal cannula.

(2) Methods: All patients hospitalized in France for COVID-19 in March-April 2020 were included from the French national administrative database, which contains discharge summaries for all hospital admissions in France. Cancer patients were identified within this population. The effect of cancer was estimated with logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities.

These patients were older and were more likely to be men and to have complications (acute respiratory and kidney failure, venous thrombosis, atrial fibrillation) than those without cancer. In patients with hematological cancer, admission to ICU was significantly more frequent (24.8%) than patients without cancer (16.4%) (p < 0.01). Solid cancer patients without metastasis had a significantly higher mortality risk than patients without cancer (aOR = 1.4 [1.3-1.5]), and the difference was even more marked for metastatic solid cancer patients (aOR = 3.6 [3.2-4.0]).

BCG activates monocytes and innate memory NK cells which are crucial for the antiviral immune response. Therefore, strategies to prevent COVID-19 in health workers (HW) should be carried out to prevent them becoming unwell so that they can continue to work during the pandemic. The hypothesis is that BCG will improve the innate immune response and prevent symptomatic infection or COVID-19 severity. The primary objective is to verify the effectiveness and safety of the BCG vaccine to prevent or reduce incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the city of Goiania (Brazil) among HW previously vaccinated with BCG and also its severity and mortality during the pandemic of the disease. Secondary objectives are to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among these professionals and the innate immune response elicited to BCG. TRIAL DESIGN: This a phase II trial for repositioning BCG as a preventive strategy against COVID-19. The trial is an open-label, parallel-group randomised clinical trial, comparing HW vaccinated with BCG and HW not vaccinated. PARTICIPANTS: The trial will recruit 800 HW of Goiania - Gois, Brazil to reach a total of 400 HW included after comorbidities questioning and laboratorial evaluation. Eligibility criteria: Any HW presenting BCG vaccination scar with direct contact with suspected COVID-19 patients for at least 8 hours per week, whether in hospital beds, ICU, or in transportation or admission (nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists, receptionists, etc.) who have negative IgM and IgG COVID-19 test. Participants with any of the following characteristics will be excluded: - Have had in the last fifteen days any signs or symptoms of virus infection, including COVID-19; - Have had fever in the last fifteen days; - Have been vaccinated fifteen days before the inclusion; - Have a history or confirmation of any immunosuppressive disease such as HIV, presented solid tumour in the last two years or autoimmune diseases; - Are under preventive medication with antibiotics, steroid anti-inflammatories, or chemotherapy; - Have less than 500 neutrophils per mL of blood; - Have previously been diagnosed with tuberculosis; - Are breastfeeding or pregnant; - Are younger than 18 years old; - Are participating as an investigator in this clinical trial. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: HW will be randomized into the BCG vaccinated group or the BCG unvaccinated control group. The BCG vaccinated group will receive in the right arm, intradermally, a one off dose of 0.1 mL corresponding to approximately 2 x10(5) to 8 x10(5) CFU of live, freeze-dried, attenuated BCG Moscow 361-I, Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine (Serum Institute of India PVT. LTD.). The unvaccinated control group will not be vaccinated. The HW allocated in both groups will be followed up at specific times points until 180 days post inclusion. The vaccinated and control groups will be compared according to COVID-19 related outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes are the incidence coefficient of infection by SARS-CoV-2 determined by RT-PCR of naso-oropharyngeal swab specimen or rapid lateral flow IgG and IgM test, and presence of general COVID-19 symptoms, disease severity and admission to hospital during the 180 days of follow up. The secondary outcome is the innate immune response elicited 15-20 days after vaccination. RANDOMISATION: The vaccine vial contains approximately 10 doses. In order to optimize the vaccine use, the randomisation was performed in blocks of 20 participants using the platform randomization.com [http://www.jerrydallal.com/random/permute.htm]. The randomization was prepared before any HW inclusion. The results were printed and inserted in sealed envelopes that were numbered with BCG-001 to BCG-400. The printed results as well the envelopes had the same numbers. At the time of the randomisation, each participant that meets the inclusion criteria will receive a consecutive participant number [BCG-001-BCG-400]. The sealed envelope with the assigned number, blinded to the researchers, will be opened in front of the participant and the arm allocation will be known. BLINDING (MASKING): There is no masking for the participants or for the healthcare providers. The study will be blinded to the laboratory researchers and to those who will be evaluating the outcomes and performing the statistical analyses.

This questionnaire-based survey investigated the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on household disinfectant product consumption levels and behaviour of 3667 Chinese residents. In particular, in the context that no strategy is currently available to minimize the disinfectant pollution, based on the similarities between disinfectants and pharmaceuticals, we proposed a perspective of ecopharmacovigilance (EPV), which is an effective measure to minimize the environmental risks posed by pharmaceuticals using drug administration protocols, for disinfectant environmental risk management. The publics environmental perceptions, attitudes and the related practices regarding household disinfectant consumption from an EPV perspective were also included in the study. The results showed that the COVID-19 outbreak caused a tremendous rise in the publics household disinfectant consumption and usage levels in China. After the COVID-19 outbreak, the chlorine-based and alcohol-based disinfectants were considered as the most preferred products for household disinfection and hand sanitization, respectively. Importantly, the Chinese publics environmental perceptions and practice on disinfectants were poor. Less than half respondents had positive attitudes toward the source control of disinfectant pollution. The population groups including females, the middle aged adults, those having healthcare professional background, as well as the higher-educated could be focused on to develop targeted efforts for the future control of disinfectant pollution in environment.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household disinfectant consumption behaviours and related environmental concerns: A questionnaire-based survey in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We successfully produced second-generation cloned cats by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) using skin cells from a cloned cat. Skin cells from an odd-eyed, all-white male cat (G0 donor cat) were used to generate a cloned cat (G1 cloned cat). At 6 months of age, skin cells from the G1 cloned cat were used for SCNT to produce second-generation cloned cats. We compared the in vitro and in vivo development of SCNT embryos that were derived from the G0 donor and G1 cloned donor cat's skin fibroblasts. The nuclei from the G0 donor and G1 cloned donor cat's skin fibroblasts fused with enucleated oocytes with equal rates of fusion (60.7% vs. 58.8%, respectively) and cleavage (66.3% vs. 63.4%). The 2C4-cell SCNT embryos were then transferred into recipients. One of the five recipients of G0 donor derived NT embryos (20%) delivered one live male cloned kitten, whereas 4 of 15 recipients of the G1 cloned donor cat derived NT embryos (26%) delivered a total of seven male second-generation cloned kittens (four live kittens from one surrogate, plus two stillborn kittens, and one live kitten that died 2 d after birth from three other surrogate mothers).

To answer the question, we propose concepts of individual utility and societal utility and build a simple model. By applying the model, we predict that countries with an individualist culture would adopt more passive strategies while countries with a collectivist culture would adopt more active strategies. The comparison between strategies adopted in China and in the United Kingdom supports the prediction. Furthermore, as the spread of COVID-19 virus continues, governments response may change and individualist countries may switch to more active strategies. So we extend our model to incorporate the dynamics of strategy selection, and explain the switch between passive and active strategies. We then predict in particular that facing the unexpected infections and deaths, the countries with an individualist culture would temporally adopt a relatively more active strategy responding to COVID-19.

These patients are restricted in performing daily activities due to angina pectoris. Spinal cord stimulation is a last resort treatment option. A number of this patient population also has an indication for a cardiac implanted electronic device (CIED) (pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator). Manufacturers of spinal cord stimulators have stated a warning that interference can occur between the spinal cord stimulator and the CIED. Consequently, only a limited number of patients with RAP and a CIED have received a spinal cord stimulator. The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to determine whether spinal cord stimulation can be safely used in patients with RAP and a CIED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with RAP referred to our center were screened and included if 1) the patient received a spinal cord stimulator as treatment for RAP and if 2) the patient received a CIED either prior to or after spinal cord stimulator implantation. A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treadmill test was used as screening tool to determine whether the patient was eligible for implantation of a spinal cord stimulator. Interference between the spinal cord stimulator and CIED was checked 1) after TENS treadmill test, 2) during implantation of spinal cord stimulator or CIED, 3) during mode switches of the SCS, and 4) during regular out-patient follow-up. RESULTS: In total, 22 patients had both a spinal cord stimulator and a CIED with an average follow-up duration of 44.5 months. No interference between the spinal cord stimulator and CIED was found. CONCLUSION: Spinal cord stimulation can be safely applied in patients with a CIED provided that the CIED is checked for interference during implantation, if mode switches of the SCS occurred and once yearly after implantation according to routine follow-up.","output":"Feasibility of Spinal Cord Stimulation in Patients With Refractory Angina Pectoris and a Cardiac Implanted Electronic Device"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The largest banks in the US, the systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), are under immense pressure as the economy strains","output":"Opinion: Covid-19 has shown that Dodd-Frank is working, don't ruin it"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last decade, a rapid rise in deaths due to liver disease has been observed especially amongst young people. Nowadays liver disease accounts for approximately 2 million deaths per year worldwide: 1 million due to complications of cirrhosis and 1 million due to viral hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Besides primary liver malignancies, almost all solid tumours are capable to spread metastases to the liver, in particular, gastrointestinal cancers, breast and genitourinary cancers, lung cancer, melanomas and sarcomas. A big portion of liver malignancies undergo palliative care. To this end, the paradigm of the palliative care in the liver cancer management is evolving from just end of the life care to careful evaluation of all aspects relevant for the survivorship. In the presented study, an evidence-based approach has been taken to target molecular pathways and subcellular components for modelling most optimal conditions with the longest survival rates for patients diagnosed with advanced liver malignancies who underwent palliative treatments. We developed an unsupervised machine learning (UML) approach to robustly identify patient subgroups based on estimated survival curves for each individual patient and each individual potential biomarker. UML using consensus hierarchical clustering of biomarker derived risk profiles resulted into 3 stable patient subgroups. There were no significant differences in age, gender, therapy, diagnosis or comorbidities across clusters. Survival times across clusters differed significantly. Furthermore, several of the biomarkers demonstrated highly significant pairwise differences between clusters after correction for multiple testing, namely, comet assay patterns of classes I, III, IV and expression rates of calgranulin A (S100), SOD2 and profilinall measured ex vivo in circulating leucocytes. Considering worst, intermediate and best survival curves with regard to identified clusters and corresponding patterns of parameters measured, clear differences were found for comet assay and S100 expression patterns. In conclusion, multi-faceted cancer control within the palliative care of liver malignancies is crucial for improved disease outcomes including individualised patient profiling, predictive models and implementation of corresponding cost-effective risks mitigating measures detailed in the paper. The proof-of-principle model is presented.","output":"Optimal multiparametric set-up modelled for best survival outcomes in palliative treatment of liver malignancies: unsupervised machine learning and 3 PM recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As an alternative to protein alignments for the comparison of sequences, the reiterations of mono- di- and trinucleotide frequencies were used for the comparison of coronavirus sequences.

In a context of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance requiring correct and fast assessment of epidemiological clusters from substantial amount of samples, the present study proposes an analytical workflow for identifying accurately the PANGO lineages of SARS-CoV-2 samples and building of discriminant minimum spanning trees (MST) bypassing the usual time consuming phylogenomic inferences based on multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and substitution model. RESULTS: GENPAT constituted two collections of SARS-CoV-2 samples. The first collection consisted of SARS-CoV-2 positive swabs collected by IZSAM from the Abruzzo region (Italy), then sequenced by next generation sequencing (NGS) and analyzed in GENPAT (n = 1592), while the second collection included samples from several Italian provinces and retrieved from the reference Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (n = 17,201). The main results of the present work showed that (i) GENPAT and GISAID detected the same PANGO lineages, (ii) the PANGO lineages B.1.177 (i.e. historical in Italy) and B.1.1.7 (i.e. UK variant) are major concerns today in several Italian provinces, and the new MST-based method (iii) clusters most of the PANGO lineages together, (iv) with a higher dicriminatory power than PANGO lineages, (v) and faster that the usual phylogenomic methods based on MSA and substitution model.

With the ongoing media coverage and spread of misinformation, public health authorities need to identify effective strategies and create culturally appropriate and evidence-based messaging that best encourage preventive health behaviors to control the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between COVID-19 sources of information and knowledge, and how US adults' knowledge may be associated with preventive health behaviors to help mitigate COVID-19 cases and deaths. DESIGN AND SETTING: For this cross-sectional study, survey data pertaining to COVID-19 were collected via online platform, Qualtrics, in February and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Data responses included 718 US adults from the February survey and 672 US adults from the May survey-both representative of the US adult population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 knowledge score, COVID-19 reliable sources of information, and adherence to COVID-19 preventive health behaviors. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The main findings showed that disseminating COVID-19 information across various sources, particularly television, health care providers, and health officials, to increase people's COVID-19 knowledge contributes to greater adherence to infection prevention behaviors. Across February and May 2020 survey data, participants 55 years and older and those with higher educational background reported a higher average COVID-19 knowledge score. In addition, among the racial and ethnic categories, Black/African American and Native American/Alaska Native participants reported a lower average COVID-19 knowledge score than white participants-signaling the need to establish COVID-19 communication that is culturally-tailored and community-based. Overall, health care authorities must deliver clear and concise messaging about the importance of adhering to preventive health behaviors, even as COVID-19 vaccines become widely available to the general public.

During peak season, picornaviruses cause 82% of all episodes of acute nasopharyngitis (the common cold), the most frequent manifestation of acute respiratory infection, and produce more restriction of activity and physician consultations annually than any other viral or bacterial source of respiratory illness. Objective: This article reviews the clinical impact and outcomes of picornavirus-induced respiratory infections in specific populations at risk for complications. It also discusses the potential economic impact of the morbidity associated with picornavirus-induced respiratory infection.

To optimize practice and sustain the workforce stretched thin by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to understand what it means for retired registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) to work after retirement. This study explored what nursing practice means for RNs and LPNs who have formally retired but continue to practice in rural and remote communities. METHODS: A pan-Canadian cross-sectional survey conducted in 2014C2015 of nurses in rural and remote Canada provided data for analysis. Textual responses from 82 RNs and 19 LPNs who indicated they had retired but were occasionally employed in nursing were interpreted hermeneutically. RESULTS: Retired nurses who continued to practice took on new challenges as well as sought opportunities to continue to learn, grow, and give back. Worklife flexibility was important, including having control over working hours. Nurses everyday practice was inextricably tied up with their lives in rural and remote communities, with RNs emphasizing serving their communities and LPNs appreciating community recognition and the family-like character of their work settings. CONCLUSIONS: Retired nurses who continue to work in nursing see retirement as the next phase in their profession and a vital way of engaging with their rural and remote communities. This study counters the conventional view of retaining retired nurses only to combat nursing shortages and alleviate a knowledge drain from the workplace. Rural and remote nurses who retire and continue working contribute to their workplaces and communities in important and innovative ways. They can be characterized as dedicated, independent, and resilient. Transitioning to retirement in rural and remote practice can be re-imagined in ways that involve both the community and the workplace.

The audio data is generated in real time from a variety of RNA motifs that are known to be important in the functioning of RNA. Additionally, metadata relating to RNA translation and transcription has been used to shape the auditory and visual displays. Together these tools provide a unique approach to further understand the metabolism of the viral RNA genome. This audio provides a further means to represent the function of the RNA in addition to traditional written and visual approaches. RESULTS: Sonification of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA sequence results in a complex auditory stream composed of up to 12 individual audio tracks. Each auditory motive is derived from the actual RNA sequence or from metadata. This approach has been used to represent transcription or translation of the viral RNA genome. The display highlights the real-time interaction of functional RNA elements. The sonification of codons derived from all three reading frames of the viral RNA sequence in combination with sonified metadata provide the framework for this display. Functional RNA motifs such as transcription regulatory sequences and stem loop regions have also been sonified. Using the tool, audio can be generated in real-time from either genomic or sub-genomic representations of the RNA. Given the large size of the viral genome, a collection of interactive buttons has been provided to navigate to regions of interest, such as cleavage regions in the polyprotein, untranslated regions or each gene. These tools are available through an internet browser and the user can interact with the data display in real time. CONCLUSION: The auditory display in combination with real-time animation of the process of translation and transcription provide a unique insight into the large body of evidence describing the metabolism of the RNA genome.

Using an experimental design where we randomly assign participants to either a disease concerns or control condition, we find that salient COVID-19 concerns decrease intentions to download contact tracing apps. Mediation results reveal that greater valuations of privacy explain the lower willingness. We therefore explain why COVID-19 contact tracing apps that are promoted when the pandemic is at its peak see low levels of uptake.

Three constitutive moments of the organizations transformation to NWW are analytically distinguished: (i) how implicit becomes explicit, (ii) how collective becomes self, and (iii) how personal becomes impersonal. Our findings emphasize that the transition to NWW must take into account prevailing institutional logics and must reconnect to a fundamental and often neglected question: What does doing work mean within the particular organization? Negotiating this fundamental question might help to overcome supervisors uncertainties about managerial control and provide clarity to subordinates about what is expected from them while working remotely. Finally, we discuss how the transition to NWW may serve as both an opportunity and a potential threat to established organizational practices while highlighting the challenge supervisors face when the institutional logics conflict with remote working.","output":"Remote Working in a Public Bureaucracy: Redeveloping Practices of Managerial Control When Out of Sight"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Sternal dehiscence is a grave complication after open heart surgery. Sternal debridement and flap coverage are the mainstays of therapy, but no consensus exists regarding the appropriate level of debridement. More recently, the use of vacuum-assisted closure devices has been advocated as a bridge to definitive closure, but indications for use remain incompletely defined. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of all chest wall reconstructions performed from January 2000 to December 2010 was conducted. The type of operative management was evaluated to assess morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS Fifty-four patients underwent chest wall reconstruction for poststernotomy mediastinitis. Of these patients, 24 underwent conservative sternal debridement with flap closure, 24 underwent radical sternectomy including resection of the costal cartilages followed by flap closure, and 6 underwent radical sternectomy with vacuum-assisted closure therapy followed by flap closure in a delayed fashion. There were 15 patients in the conservative group and 8 patients in the radical sternectomy group who developed postoperative complications (62.5% vs 33.3%, P < 0.05). The conservative sternectomy group had more serious complications requiring reoperation compared to the radical sternectomy group (86.7% vs 25.0%, P < 0.05). The most common complication in the former group was flap dehiscence (8/15, 53.3%), whereas that in the latter group was a superficial wound infection (6/8, 75.0%).

The data for the research study is extracted from electronic records of HMIS (health management information system) of MoHFW (ministry of health and family welfare), Govt. of India and analysed with stata and Microsoft office. The mean number of home deliveries attended by SBA [(Skill Birth Attendant) (Doctor/Nurse/ANM/ Midwife)] during the pandemic year 2021 with total number of observation of 5 months of 2021(January to May) forecasted up to December 2021 across India was 13370.27938, for years 2020, 2019, 2018 it was 16429.25, 19006.58, 21317.83 respectively with total number of observation of 12 months across India for these three years. This research study revealed that pandemic years have negative impact on number of home deliveries attended by SBA [(Skill Birth Attendant) (Doctor/Nurse/ANM/ Midwife)]. This research study revealed that pandemic years have negative impact on number of home deliveries attended by SBA [(Skill Birth Attendant) (Doctor/Nurse/ANM/ Midwife)]. There is a (projected) decrease of 37.28% in mean number of home deliveries attended by SBA in 2021 as compared to 2018. This novel research study revealed that during pandemic years 2020 and 2021 all the variables reduced quantitatively except Number of PW given Tablet Misoprostol during HD which increased in 2020 (first pandemic year).The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had negative effects on Deliveries and Home Based New Born Care (HBNC) in India. More research is required to investigate the direct and indirect consequence of the pandemic on birth and provision of HBNC as well as the health facility type which are not performing well in providing respectful maternity care and newborn services during pandemic period. The facility based research analysis is under process by the author which will be available in next version of this article.","output":"What is the impact of COVID-19 pandemic years on Deliveries and Home Based New Born Care in India?

METHODS: Between May 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021, we identified clusters of 3 or more COVID-19 cases in which nosocomial transmission was suspected in a Veterans Affairs healthcare system. Asymptomatic employees and patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 if they were identified as being at risk through contact tracing investigations; for 7 clusters all personnel and/or patients in a shared work area were tested regardless of exposure history. Whole genome sequencing was performed to determine the relatedness of SARS-CoV-2 samples from the clusters and from control employees and patients. RESULTS: Of 14 clusters investigated, 7 occurred in community-based outpatient clinics, 1 in the emergency department, 3 in ancillary care areas, and 3 on hospital medical/surgical wards that did not provide care for patients with known COVID-19 infection. Eighty-one of 82 (99%) symptomatic COVID-19 cases and 31 of 35 (89%) asymptomatic cases occurred in healthcare personnel. Sequencing analysis provided support for several transmission events between co-workers and in 2 cases supported transmission from healthcare personnel to patients. There were no documented transmissions from patients to personnel. CONCLUSIONS: Clusters of COVID-19 with nosocomial transmission predominantly involved healthcare personnel and often occurred in outpatient clinics and ancillary care areas.

METHODS We constructed novel unimolecular dual agonists of GLP-1R and glucagon receptor prepared by linking sEx-4 and native glucagon (GCG) via lysine or triazole (sEx4-GCG(K) and sEx4-GCG(T), respectively) and evaluated their anti-obesity and anti-diabetic efficacy in diabetic and obese mouse model. RESULTS Both sEx4-GCG(K) and sEx4-GCG(T) demonstrated the beneficial metabolic effects of GLP-1 and glucagon: they promoted weight loss and ameliorated insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. They also increased thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, and lipolysis and -oxidation in white adipose tissue, with concomitant suppression of lipogenesis. Furthermore, both dual agonists activated the 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and prevented palmitate-induced oxidative stress in skeletal muscle cells. CONCLUSION Through their complementary dual agonism, sEx4-GCG(T) and sEx4-GCG(K) induce more marked weight loss and metabolic improvements than conventional agonists, and could be developed as novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic disorders in humans.

Here we report the first case series of 7 children diagnosed with MIS-C in Qatar. Methods: : Clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients admitted to Sidra Medicine, Qatar from June to October 2020, who met the WHO case definition for MIS-C were reviewed. Results: : The mean age in our case series was 5.6 years, of which 71.4% were males. All patients were previously healthy but had a history of COVID-19 infection. Fever, rash, vomiting and abdominal pain were the most common symptoms (70%-100%). The average hospitalization was 12.9 days with no case fatalities. Laboratory findings included lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia in most patients, as well as evidence of coagulopathy and elevated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, ferritin and procalcitonin. Many patients (71.4%) required inotropic support in intensive care, while only one required respiratory support. Although all patients had elevated cardiac biomarkers, cardiovascular involvement was observed in 42.9% of patients with one patient developing a giant coronary aneurysm. All patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and 86% of patients received corticosteroids, with two patients requiring treatment with IL-1 inhibitors.

Although clinical features and outcomes are not significantly different from those reported elsewhere, lack of case fatalities in our cohort may indicate that early recognition and prompt medical attention is necessary for a favorable outcome in MIS-C.","output":"COVID-19 related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C): a case series from a tertiary care pediatric hospital in Qatar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now officially a pandemic. Current studies observed extensive abnormal indexes in COVID-19 patients and significant differences between mild and severe patients. However, which index would perform better as the indicator of disease progression merits further investigation. Methods: We enrolled COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical center. We closely monitored the following candidate indictors: white blood cell, lymphocyte, platelet, CD4 T cell, CD8 T cell, alanine aminotransferase, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), fibrin degradation products (FDP), D-dimer, creatine kinase, myoglobin, troponin T (TnT), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), lactase dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin. The correlation with illness severity were assessed by Spearman analysis and the ability of differentiating the clinical statuses was quantified as the AUC value of the ROC curve. Results: A total of 326 patients were enrolled, including 299 mild-ordinary and 27 severe-critical patients. At admission, D-dimer and CRP were elevated above normal range both in mild-ordinary and severe-critical patients. LDH, NT-proBNP, myoglobin, CD4 T cell, eGFR, FDP and PCT were beyond normal range in the mild-ordinary stages of severe-critical patients, but remained normal in the persistently mild-ordinary patients. Top 5 parameters with highest spearmen coefficient were LDH, procalcitonin, NT-proBNP, myoglobin and D-dimer (Spearman coefficient: 0.488, 0.453, 0.414, 0.412, 0.407). Comparing between mild-ordinary stage and severe/critical stage, LDH showed the highest receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.951. PCT ranked second, with the ROC AUC of 0.905. Comparing between mild-ordinary and severe stages, only LDH had the ROC AUC of over 0.90 (0.927).

Because two novel protein-based vaccines against serogroup B are available, the main purpose of this study was to provide data on the diversity and distribution of meningococcal vaccine antigen types circulating in Brazil. METHODOLOGY: Genetic lineages, vaccine antigen types, and allele types of antimicrobial-associated resistance genes based on whole-genome sequencing of a collection of 145 Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B invasive strains recovered in Brazil from 2016 to 2018 were collected. RESULTS: A total of 11 clonal complexes (ccs) were identified among the 145 isolates, four of which were predominant, namely, cc461, cc35, cc32, and cc213, accounting for 72.0% of isolates. The most prevalent fHbp peptides were 24 (subfamily A/variant 2), 47 (subfamily A/variant 3), 1 (subfamily B/variant 1) and 45 (subfamily A/variant 3), which were predominantly associated with cc35, cc461, cc32, and cc213, respectively. The NadA peptide was detected in only 26.2% of the isolates. The most frequent NadA peptide 1 was found almost exclusively in cc32. We found seven NHBA peptides that accounted for 74.5% of isolates, and the newly described peptide 1390 was the most prevalent peptide exclusively associated with cc461. Mutated penA alleles were detected in 56.5% of the isolates, whereas no rpoB and gyrA mutant alleles were found. CONCLUSION: During the study period, changes in the clonal structure of circulating strains were observed, without a predominance of a single hyperinvasive lineage, indicating that an epidemiologic shift has occurred that led to a diversity of vaccine antigen types in recent years in Brazil.","output":"Genomic surveillance of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B invasive strains: Diversity of vaccine antigen types, Brazil, 2016-2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The People's Republic of China increasingly has turned to political warfare and sharp power to influence U.S. policy toward China and on international issues that it considers important.

Although recent research has supported the effectiveness of telehealth delivery of a variety of interventions for children, the literature has focused very little on childhood posttraumatic stress disorder. This pilot study examined the feasibility and potential effectiveness of trauma-focused cognitive- behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) delivered via telepsychotherapy in community-based locations of either schools or patient homes. Telepsychotherapy treatment was delivered to 70 traumaexposed youth in 7 underserved communities. Of these, 88.6% completed a full course of TF-CBT and 96.8% of these treatment completers no longer met diagnostic criteria for a trauma-related disorder at posttreatment. Results demonstrated clinically meaningful symptom change posttreatment, with large effect sizes evident for both youthand caregiver-reported reduction in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. The results observed in this pilot evaluation are promising and provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of this novel treatment format. The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented need to rethink how mental health services are delivered, which is particularly applicable to high base rate conditions related to posttraumatic stress.

We aimed to study changes in the environment, diet, behavior, personal hygiene, contacts, lifestyle choices and the degree of compliance to NPI measures by primary school children in Cyprus at school and at home for two periods, i.e., before lockdown and during the school re-opening using the methodological context of the human exposome. MethodsDuring June 2020, an online survey questionnaire was forwarded to parents of primary school children through schools administrations, with questions about the childrens lifestyle/behaviours for two periods; school re-opening, following the population-wide lockdown (May 21-June 26, 2020), and the school period before lockdown (before March 2020). Descriptive statistics and exposome wide association analysis were implemented to agnostically assess associations of demographic, lifestyle and behavioral parameters with the degree of compliance to NPI measures. FindingsA total of 1509 children from more than 180 primary schools (out of 330 schools) in Cyprus were included. Median number of contacts per day at home, school and other places during weekdays was lower (p<0.001) in the post-lockdown period compared to the pre-lockdown period (5 vs 12, 10 vs 29 and 6 vs 14, respectively). Vulnerable contacts with children also decreased from 2[1, 3] in the pre-lockdown to 1[0, 2] in the post-lockdown period (p<0.001). Differences in sugary and ready-made food consumption, physical activity, screen time, digital communication and hand hygiene were noted between the two periods. More than 72% of children complied with the NPI measures, with the exception of the decrease in number of vulnerable contact(s) indicator (48%). Eating meat more frequently post-lockdown and doing less physical activity during school break post-lockdown were positively associated with increased time spent at home post-lockdown. Furthermore, the odds of compliance, as indicated by the time spent at home post-lockdown were lower with days elapsing from school re-opening, living in smaller town and using antiseptic more frequently pre-lockdown. InterpretationIn this national survey, children showed a high degree of compliance to most NPI measures for the community and primary school settings in Cyprus. The initial NPI measures may have affected the childrens exposome profile in the following months, by altering their diet, physical activity, sedentary lifestyle and hand hygiene habits. FundingThe study was partially funded by the EXPOSOGAS project, H2020 under grant agreement #810995 Panel: Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for studies published until September 30, 2020 using the search terms: COVID-19, children and lifestyle. Only six peer-reviewed, English-language studies were retrieved on the effect of COVID-19 measures on childrens lifestyle. The impact of non-pharmacological intervention (NPI) measures on childrens health during the pandemic period has been sporadically studied by focusing on a few risk factors at a time without using the exposomes methodological framework, which is defined as the comprehensive characterization of all environmental exposures during ones lifetime. Added value of this studyA survey targeted all primary schools of Cyprus to comprehensively study the impact of the initial population-wide NPI measures (lockdown) (March 13-May 4) on the childrens exposome during the school re-opening period (May 21 - June 26). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study looking at the post-confinement (lockdown) exposome profile changes of children during schools re-opening, after the initial population-wide NPI measures of COVID-19 response. The comprehensive and agnostic description of the childrens exposome profile may help to comprehensively account for both known and possibly unknown effects of NPI measures on childrens health and for delineating the childrens degree of compliance to infection prevention and control protocols at school and at home. Implications of all the available evidenceThis dataset could inform COVID-19 risk-based public health response strategies targeted for school settings. Future response strategies to epidemic waves shall consider elements of promoting a healthy lifestyle for children at school and at home. Public health policy could ultimately benefit from the inclusion of the human exposome methodological framework and its tools towards the improved identification of susceptible sub-population groups and to facilitate the deployment of site-tailored public health measures; this may be particularly relevant for children and their potential to spread the disease to vulnerable groups.","output":"Exposome changes in primary school children following the wide population non-pharmacological interventions implemented due to COVID-19 in Cyprus: a national survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During outbreaks of infectious diseases, transmission of the pathogen can form networks of infected individuals connected either directly or indirectly. METHODS: Network centrality metrics were used to characterize hospital-acquired Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (HA-MERS) outbreaks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between 2012 and 2016. Covariate-adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were applied to assess the effect of individual level risk factors and network level metrics associated with increase in length of hospital stay and risk of deaths from MERS. RESULTS: About 27% of MERS cases were hospital acquired during the study period. The median age of healthcare workers and hospitalized patients were 35 years and 63 years, respectively, Although HA-MERS were more connected, we found no significant difference in degree centrality metrics between HA-MERS and non-HA-MERS cases. Pre-existing medical conditions (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR) = 2.43, 95% confidence interval: (CI) [1.11C5.33]) and hospitalized patients (aOR = 29.99, 95% CI [1.80C48.65]) were the strongest risk predictors of death from MERS. The risk of death associated with 1-day increased length of stay was significantly higher for patients with comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Our investigation also revealed that patients with an HA-MERS infection experienced a significantly longer hospital stay and were more likely to die from the disease. Healthcare worker should be reminded of their potential role as hubs for pathogens because of their proximity to and regular interaction with infected patients.

However, validated instruments that assess physical resilience in older adults are rare. Therefore, we aimed to validate the Physical Resilience Instrument for Older Adults (PRIFOR) to fill the literature gap. METHODS: Content analysis with content validity was first carried out to generate relevant items assessing physical resilience for older adults, and 19 items were developed. Psychometric evaluation of the 19 items was then tested on 200 older adults (mean [SD] age = 76.4 [6.6] years; 51.0% women) for item properties, factor structure, item fit, internal consistency, criterion-related validity, and known-group validity. RESULTS: All 19 items had satisfactory item properties, as they were normally distributed (skewness = -1.03 to 0.38; kurtosis = -1.05 to 0.32). However, two items were removed due to substantial ceiling effects. The retained 17 items were embedded in three factors as suggested by the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) results. All items except one had satisfactory item fit statistics in Rasch model; thus, the unidimensionality was supported for the three factors on 16 items.

We report on the relevant cardiopulmonary findings in, to our knowledge, the first autopsy series of ten African American decedents, with the cause of death attributed to COVID-19. METHODS: Autopsies were performed on ten African American decedents aged 44C78 years with cause of death attributed to COVID-19, reflective of the dominant demographic of deaths following COVID-19 diagnosis in New Orleans. Autopsies were done with consent of the decedents' next of kin. Pulmonary and cardiac features were examined, with relevant immunostains to characterise the inflammatory response, and RNA labelling and electron microscopy on representative sections. FINDINGS: Important findings include the presence of thrombosis and microangiopathy in the small vessels and capillaries of the lungs, with associated haemorrhage, that significantly contributed to death. Features of diffuse alveolar damage, including hyaline membranes, were present, even in patients who had not been ventilated. Cardiac findings included individual cell necrosis without lymphocytic myocarditis. There was no evidence of secondary pulmonary infection by microorganisms.

Neither of these have occurred in Asia or Africa but rather in Europe - namely Spain, Denmark, Netherlands and in the US, at a mink farm in Utah. Current evidence indicates that the virus was transmitted to the animals through infected human workers on the farm.At the time of writing, SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been documented in any other intensively farmed species, suggesting that mustelids may exhibit a higher susceptibility to the virus.

Mustelids comprise approximately 60 different species (Kollas et al. 2015) and are widely distributed across a number of habitats, both aquatic (marine and freshwater), and terrestrial (prairies, steppes, tundra, forests). Several wild mustelids have become acclimated to urban areas - such as raccoons, otters and badgers, and some are raised in households as pets - such as ferrets. The latter are perhaps at greater risk of infection than their cousins inhabiting the wild, but it is the former that we should be most worried about. If infection by SARS-CoV-2 spills into wild mustelids, these have the potential to become a permanent reservoir of infection for other animal species. Such a scenario has been seen before with rabies in raccoons and skunks (Rupprecht et al. 1995) and with bovine tuberculosis in badgers (Gallagher and Clifton-Hadley 2000).We believe that it is important to prioritize studies in mustelids on their putative role as reservoirs and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals and subsequently humans. The development of appropriate surveillance and intervention strategies will determine if mustelids are one of the key links in the chain to the initiation of an unprecedented epochal event: a panzootic.","output":"Could Mustelids spur COVID-19 into a panzootic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies indicate that chemoattractant cytokines (chemokines), together with tissue-specific adhesion molecules, coordinate the migration of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) from their sites of antigen-driven differentiation in lymphoid tissues to target effector tissues.

Demographics, comorbidities, medication use, geographic region, and other factors may increase the risk for complications from COVID-patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We developed a prognostic risk prediction tool for estimating the probability of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death due to COVID-19 in patients with IBD. Methods: Based on reports to Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) from March to October 2020, we modeled the probability of Hospitalization+ (a composite outcome of hospitalization, ICU and/or death), ICU+ (a composite outcome of ICU admission, intubation, and/or death) and Death separately using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection set consisting of a random sample of cases reported between March 2020 and a pre-set cutoff date. Model validation was conducted using a test data set consisting of the remaining cases not in the training data plus all additional cases from one month past the cutoff date. We assessed the resulting models' discrimination using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Results: Overall, 2709 cases from 59 countries were included (mean age 41.3 years (s.d. 633 (24%) were hospitalized, 137 (5%) were admitted to ICU or intubated, and 69 (3%) died. The models have excellent discrimination, with an AUC and associated 95% confidence interval estimated on the test data set of 0.79 (0.75, 0.83) for Hospitalization+, 0.88 (0.82, 0.95) for ICU+, and 0.95 (0.91, 0.99) for Death. Age, comorbidities, corticosteroid use, and male sex were associated with higher risk of death while use of biologic therapies was associated with a lower risk of death (Figure 1).

Based on known analogy between chronic pain and dyspnea, we investigated the effects of visual respiratory feedback in iVR, on refractory breathlessness in patients recovering from severe COVID-19 pneumonia. MethodsWe performed a controlled, randomized, single-blind, cross-over clinical study to evaluate an iVR-based intervention to alleviate refractory breathlessness in patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia. The single-site study was conducted at the university hospital of Geneva, Switzerland. Patients reported refractory breathlessness ([]5 on a 10-point dyspnea scale) and had a MoCA score of []24. Cross-over groups were randomly assigned, concealed from the referring clinician. Participants received synchronous (intervention) or asynchronous (control) feedback of their breathing, embodied via a gender-matched avatar in iVR. Prior to the first exposure and following both experimental conditions, patients completed questionnaires. Breathing patterns were captured continuously. The COVVR clinical study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04844567) and is now closed. FindingsStudy enrollment was open between November 2020 and April 2021. A total of 26 patients (27% women; age: mean=57, SD{+/-}12) were enrolled; 14 patients were randomly assigned to the \\"synchronous/asynchronous\\" sequence, 12 to the \\"asynchronous/synchronous\\" sequence. Data was available for all except two (7.7%) of 26 patients. The mean rating of breathing comfort was 0.1 at baseline, 0.8{+/-}1.8 for asynchronous, and 1.3{+/-}1.4 synchronous feedback (estimated difference of 0.5 (95%CI 0.05 to 1.04; p<0.05) between iVR conditions). Of all patients, 91.2% were satisfied with the intervention (1.8{+/-}1.6, t=5.201, p<0.0001, 95%CI 1.173 to inf) and 66.7% perceived it as beneficial for their breathing (0.7{+/-}1.9, t=1.806, p<0.05, 95%CI 0.036 to inf). No adverse events were reported. InterpretationBased on these findings, we propose that our iVR-based DTx is a feasible and safe neuro-rehabilitation tool that improves breathing comfort in patients recovering from severe COVID-19 infection.

These new techniques are considered to be painless procedures, but no published studies investigate the possibility of different pain scores in these new techniques versus classic laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In this randomized control study, we investigated pain scores in SILS cholecystectomy versus classic laparoscopic cholecystectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty patients (34 women and 6 men) were randomly assigned to two groups. In group A (n = 20) four-port classic laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Patients in group B (n = 20) underwent SILS cholecystectomy. In all patients, preincisional local infiltration of ropivacaine around the trocar wounds was performed. Infusion of ropivacaine solution in the right subdiaphragmatic area at the beginning of the procedure plus normal saline infusion in the same area at the end of the procedure was performed in all patients as well. Shoulder tip and abdominal pain were registered at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h postoperatively using visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS Significantly lower pain scores were observed in the SILS group versus the classic laparoscopic cholecystectomy group after the first 12 h for abdominal pain, and after the first 6 h for shoulder pain. Total pain after the first 24 h was nonexistent in the SILS group. Also, requests for analgesics were significantly less in the SILS group, while no difference was observed in incidence of nausea and vomiting between the two groups.

The existing data on the incidence of neurological impairments among COVID-19 patients is highly variable, probably because they (most often) come from small, single-center retrospective studies. These data are practically published in real-time, and the question remains when larger studies will be available, given that the pandemic is continuing.

Similarly, successfully implementing individual- and population-based behaviors that reduce the infectious inoculum intensity and force of infection, respectively, while testing and deploying COVID-19 vaccines is predicted to increase the certainty of success of demonstrating vaccine efficacy and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease, death, and the pandemic itself.","output":"Certainty of success: three critical parameters in coronavirus vaccine development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Most patients with COVID-19 experience mild illness, which can be managed in a home environment. This study was done to assess the perception, awareness, and practices regarding home-based management of COVID-19 among the general population in India. Methods: This cross-sectional study was done in May and June 2021. Data were collected using a Google Form. Results: Mean age of the 294 participants was 36.6  12.1 years. Of these participants, 45 (15.3%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 anytime in the past. Among them, 37 (82.2%) underwent home-based management for COVID-19. Monitoring body temperature and oxygen saturation were performed just once a day by 15.2% and 5.9% of COVID-19 patients respectively. Self-medication was practiced by 11 (29.7%) patients. Disposable face masks were worn by 23 (62.2%) patients beyond eight hours of continuous usage. The disposable type of face mask was not discarded despite becoming wet, and cloth masks were worn by eight (21.6%) patients. Disposable gloves were only worn by 14 (37.8%) caregivers of COVID-19 patients. As many as 10 (27%) patients were tested for COVID-19 after completion of home isolation.

Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 illness range broadly from asymptotic and mild to a life-threatening situation. This casts uncertainties for defining host determinants underlying the disease severity. Recent genetic analyses based on extensive clinical sample cohorts using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and high throughput sequencing curation revealed genetic errors and gene loci associated with about 20% of life-threatening COVID-19 cases. Significantly, most of these critical genetic loci are enriched in two immune signaling pathways, i.e., interferon-mediated antiviral signaling and chemokine-mediated/inflammatory signaling. In line with these genetic profiling studies, the broad spectrum of COVID-19 illness could be explained by immuno-pathological regulation of these critical immunogenetic pathways through various epigenetic mechanisms, which further interconnect to other vital components such as those in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) because of its direct interaction with the virus causing COVID-19. Together, key genes unraveled by genetic profiling may provide targets for precisely early risk diagnosis and prophylactic design to relieve severe COVID-19.

Methods Data from a cohort of delivery hospitalizations occurring during April-December of 2019 and 2020 in the Premier Healthcare Database were analyzed. Prevalence of select adverse outcomes were examined. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Poisson regression with robust standard errors. Results We identified 663,620 deliveries occurring April-December of 2019 and 614,093 deliveries occurring April-December of 2020. We observed an increase in in-hospital death from 2019 to 2020 (n=33;5 per 100,000 vs. n=53;9 per 100,000, aPR: 1.68, CI: 1.09, 2.59), which was no longer statistically significant after excluding deliveries with a COVID-19 diagnosis (aPR: 1.25, CI: 0.78, 2.00).

To investigate whether there is an association between H. pylori infection and small intestinal mucosal injury. METHODS Patients were selected from a general pool of subjects who underwent capsule endoscopy for current or past obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Characteristics including age, gender, history, treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or acid suppressant, diagnosis, and H. pylori infection were investigated. Patients infected with H. pylori had positive test result, ranging 30 days before to 30 days after capsule endoscopy. Patients diagnosed with inflammatory diseases, malignant tumors, etc. were excluded. All video images were re-evaluated to count small intestinal mucosal breaks. Eligible patient variables were compared. RESULTS A total of 92 patients (30 infected with H. pylori/62 uninfected) were eligible. By univariate analysis of the number of mucosal breaks, patients treated with NSAIDs were found to have more mucosal breaks than patients untreated (38%: 8/21 vs. 18%: 13/71; p = 0.004), and the possible association was detected between patients infected with H. pylori and those who were not (67%: 14/21 vs. 37%: 26/71; p = 0.081). When comparing the H. pylori infected and uninfected patients, the rate of patients with mucosal breaks was greater in infected patients (47%: 14/30 vs. 11%: 7/62; p = 0.001). After excluding patients treated with NSAIDs, the number of mucosal breaks was also greater in patients infected with H. pylori (1.2  1.5 vs. 0.38  0.62; p = 0.001).

However, the specific cellular mediators and inflammatory components driving diverse clinical disease outcomes remain poorly understood. We undertook longitudinal immune profiling on both whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of hospitalized patients during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Here, we report key immune signatures present shortly after hospital admission that were associated with the severity of COVID-19. Immune signatures were related to shifts in neutrophil to T cell ratio, elevated serum IL-6, MCP-1 and IP-10, and most strikingly, modulation of CD14+ monocyte phenotype and function. Modified features of CD14+ monocytes included poor induction of the prostaglandin-producing enzyme, COX-2, as well as enhanced expression of the cell cycle marker Ki-67. Longitudinal analysis revealed reversion of some immune features back to the healthy median level in patients with a good eventual outcome. These findings identify previously unappreciated alterations in the innate immune compartment of COVID-19 patients and lend support to the idea that therapeutic strategies targeting release of myeloid cells from bone marrow should be considered in this disease. Moreover, they demonstrate that features of an exaggerated immune response are present early after hospital admission suggesting immune-modulating therapies would be most beneficial at early timepoints.","output":"Longitudinal immune profiling reveals key myeloid signatures associated with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has reshaped human behaviors and switched communication systems from face-to-face to digital communication technologies.

We use the traditional theory of planned behavior (TPB) to determine new behavioral roles in the digital era, namely digitally planned and transformed behavior. The quantitative survey method was designed to collect cross-sectional data from 550 Thai citizens to provide the conceptual evidence of key proximal measures of digital attitude, digital social norms, digital behavioral control perception, and the digital behavioral decision to predict digitally planned and transformed behavior. The results show that people are more likely to digitalize than before, which predicts the decision to behave digitally at 93.9% of the variability, more than 75% of the predictive power of the total variance suggested by Hair, Ringle, and Sarstedt [1]. However, the higher the COVID-19 severity, the more likely digital transformation is impactful ( = 0.481).

The framework is extended further to also allow for detection of heterogeneity among the means of random parameters. We show that various sociodemographic factors (relating mainly to household social grade, employment status and disability) significantly influenced the frequency at which outdoor exercise trips were made during lockdown. Specifically, those who are self-employed, those from a social DE household (the households main income earner is employed in a manual occupation or is unemployed) and those with a health problem or disability, were shown to be significantly more likely to complete no outdoor exercise during lockdown, and therefore, these groups are at greater risk of the associated mental and physical illnesses.

METHODS: 174 diagnostic imaging departments were invited to participate in a cross-sectional electronic survey focused upon advanced level practice and their educational and accreditation expectations (OctoberCDecember 2019). Breast imaging, computed tomography, fluoroscopy, interventional radiology, lithotripsy, magnetic resonance imaging and projectional radiography were included. RESULTS: A total of 97 responses were received, of which 79 were eligible for inclusion (45%). Respondents reported advanced-level practice roles across all imaging modalities, which included clinical reporting, procedural-based and combined roles. Radiograph and mammogram reporting were most prevalent (95 and 67% of Trusts), with fluoroscopy the most frequent procedure-only role (25%). Only 39% of trusts required adherence to the four pillars of ACP within job descriptions, and only 12% requiring a full Masters qualification. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic radiographer reporting and procedure-based roles in the NHS are varied and widespread. However, inconsistencies in fulfilment against the expected standards for advanced practice exist. Realignment of advanced-level roles to delineate enhanced and advanced clinical practice may ensure consistency between roles and professions. A requirement for accreditation as an advanced (clinical) practitioner with adherence to advanced practice requirements could therefore provide value to accreditation for both individual practitioners and Trusts.

The R-number is derived from time-series of case data, using bespoke data processing to remove systematic and errors and stochastic fluctuations. In principle, growth rate can be obtained by differentiating the reported case numbers, but in fact daily stochastic fluctuations disqualify this method. We therefore assume that the case data comprises a smooth, underlying trend which is differentiable and a noise term. The approach produces, up-to-date estimates of the R-number throughout the period of data availability. Our method is validated against published consensus R-numbers from the UK government, and shown to produce comparable results. A significant advantage of our method is that it is stable up to the most recent data, this enables us to make R-number estimates available over two weeks ahead of the published consensus. The short-lived peaks observed in the R-number and case data cannot be explained by a well-mixed model and are suggestive of spread on a localised network. Such a localised spread model tends to give an Rt number close to 1, regardless of how large R0 is. The case-driven approach is combined with Weight-Shift-Scale (WSS) methods to monitor trends in the epidemic and for medium term predictions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A thorough literature review was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar to identify articles pertaining to surgical delay and genitourinary oncology. We reviewed all relevant articles pertaining to kidney, upper tract urothelial cell (UTUC), bladder, prostate, penile, and testicular cancer in regard to diagnostic, surgical, or treatment delay. RESULTS: The majority of urologic cancers rely on surgery as primary treatment. Treatment of unfavorable intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer, can likely be delayed for 3-6 months without affecting oncologic outcomes. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and testicular cancer can be treated initially with chemotherapy. Surgical management of T3 renal masses, high-grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma, and penile cancer should not be delayed. CONCLUSION: The majority of urologic oncologic surgeries can be safely deferred without impacting long-term cancer specific or overall survival. Notable exceptions are MIBC, high-grade UTUC, large renal masses, testicular and penile cancer. Joint decision making among providers and patients should be encouraged. Clinicians must manage emotional anxiety and stress when decisions around treatment delays are necessary as a result of a pandemic.","output":"Urologic Oncology Practice During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review on What can be Deferrable vs. Nondeferrable"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study examined the association between candidate psychosocial and lifestyle variables and the trajectories of clinically significant anxiety and depressive symptoms from entry to completion of first-year university. DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study PARTICIPANTS: First-year undergraduate students METHODS: We analysed the responses of 1686 first-year undergraduate students attending Queens University who completed electronic surveys at both the beginning and completion of their academic year. Predictors of change in positive anxiety and depressive symptom screens (based on exceeding validated symptom threshold scores) were identified using logistic regression. RESULTS: Increased university connectedness reduced the odds of emergent significant depressive and anxiety symptoms in healthy students and increased the odds of recovery in students who screened positive at the start of university. Students who screened positive for depression or anxiety at university entry were less likely to recover if they had a lifetime history of internalising disorders. Healthy students who increased their drug use over their first year had higher odds of developing significant levels of both anxiety and depressive symptoms by completion of the academic year. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms are common among students at entry to university and persist over the first year. University connectedness may mitigate the risk of persistent or emergent symptoms, whereas drug use appears to increase these risks.

The objectives of this study were to measure (1) audited compliance of primary health-care facilities in South Africa with national standards for OHS and IPC, (2) change in compliance at reaudit three years after baseline, and (3) the inter-rater reliability of the audit. METHODS: The study analyzed audits of 60 primary health-care facilities in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Baseline external audits in the time period 2011C2012 were compared with follow-up internal audits in 2014C2015. Audits at 25 facilities that had both internal and external audits conducted in 2014/2015 were used to measure reliability. RESULTS: At baseline, 25% of 60 facilities were noncompliant (audit score<50%), 48% conditionally compliant (score >50 < 80%), and only 27% compliant (score >80%). Overall, there was no significant improvement in compliance three years after baseline. Percentage agreement on specific items between internal and external audits ranged from 28% to 92% and kappa from -0.8 to 0.41 (poor to moderate). CONCLUSION: Low baseline compliance with OHSCIPC measures and lack of improvement over three years reflect the difficulties of quality improvement in these domains. Low inter-rater reliability of the audit instrument undermines the audit process. Evidence-based investment of effort is required if repeat auditing is to contribute to occupational risk reduction for health workers.","output":"Repeat Auditing of Primary Health-care Facilities Against Standards for Occupational Health and Infection Control: A Study of Compliance and Reliability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Background Enteroviruses are the most frequent cause of acute meningitis and are seen increasingly in sepsis-like disease and fever without source in the paediatric population. Detection of enterovirus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens by PCR is the gold standard diagnostic test. Our aim was to assess a method of detecting enterovirus in blood specimens by PCR. Methods We did a prospective, multicentre, observational study at 35 French paediatric and emergency departments in 16 hospitals. We recruited newborn babies (aged 28 days) and infants (aged >28 days to 2 years) with fever without source, sepsis-like disease, or suspected meningitis, and children (aged >2 years to 16 years) with suspected meningitis, who were admitted to a participating hospital. We used a standardised form to obtain demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, which were anonymised. Enterovirus PCR testing was done in blood and CSF specimens. Findings Between June 1, 2015, and Oct 31, 2015, and between June 1, 2016, and Oct 31, 2016, we enrolled 822 patients, of whom 672 had enterovirus PCR testing done in blood and CSF specimens. Enterovirus was detected in 317 (47%) patients in either blood or CSF, or both (71 newborn babies, 83 infants, and 163 children). Detection of enterovirus was more frequent in blood samples than in CSF specimens of newborn babies (70 [99%] of 71 vs 62 [87%] of 71; p=0011) and infants (76 [92%] of 83 vs 62 [75%] of 83; p=0008), and was less frequent in blood samples than in CSF specimens of children (90 [55%] of 163 vs 148 [91%] of 163; p<00001). Detection of enterovirus was more frequent in blood samples than in CSF specimens of infants aged 2 years or younger with fever without source (55 [100%] of 55 vs 41 [75%] of 55; p=00002) or with sepsis-like disease (16 [100%] of 16 vs nine [56%] of 16; p=0008). Detection of enterovirus was less frequent in blood than in CSF of patients with suspected meningitis (165 [67%] of 246 vs 222 [90%] of 246; p<00001). Interpretation Testing for enterovirus in blood by PCR should be an integral part of clinical practice guidelines for infants aged 2 years or younger. This testing could decrease the length of hospital stay and reduce exposure to antibiotics for low-risk patients admitted to the emergency department with febrile illness.

Extracting high-quality keywords from text and categorizing them widely uses information mining, which is the basis of named entity recognition, relation extraction, knowledge questions and answers and other disassembly domain information recognition and extraction. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning dictionary construction algorithm based on multi-dimensional features that combines different features of extraction candidate keywords from the text of each scientific study. Keywords recognition is regarded as a binary classification problem using the LightGBM model to filter each keyword, and then expand the domain dictionary based on the pointwise mutual information value between keywords and its category. Here, we make use of Chinese disassembly manuals, patents and papers in order to establish a general corpus about the disassembly information and then use our model to mine the disassembly parts, disassembly tools, disassembly methods, disassembly process, and other categories of disassembly keywords. The experiment evidenced that our algorithms can significantly improve extraction and category performance better than traditional algorithms in the disassembly domain.

However, the natural peroxidase has low stability and its catalytic efficiency is easily affected by external conditions. In this work, a copper-based metal-organic framework (Cu-MOF) was prepared by hydrothermal method, and characterized by means of XRD, SEM, FT-IR and EDS. The synthesized Cu-MOF material showed high peroxidase-like activity and could be utilized to catalyze the oxidation of o-phenylenediamine (OPDA) and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of H2O2. The steady-state kinetics experiments of the oxidation of OPDA and TMB catalyzed by Cu-MOF were performed, and the kinetic parameters were obtained by linear least-squares fitting to Lineweaver-Burk plot. The results indicated that the affinity of Cu-MOF towards TMB and OPDA was close to that of the natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The as-prepared Cu-MOF can be applied for colorimetric detection of H2O2 and glucose with wide linear ranges of 5 to 300 M and 50 to 500 M for H2O2 and glucose, respectively. Furthermore, the specificity of detection of glucose was compared with other sugar species interference such as sucrose, lactose and maltose. In addition, the detection of ascorbic acid and sodium thiosulfate was also performed upon the inhibition of TMB oxidation.

Methods : DMEK grafts (n=27) were prepared at Amnitrans EyeBank Rotterdam from 27 corneas (15 donors) that were eligible for transplantation but could not be allocated due to the Covid-19-related cancellation of elective surgeries. Cell viability (by Calcein-AM staining) and ECD of 5 grafts originally scheduled for transplantation, were evaluated on the originally planned surgery day, whereas 22 grafts from paired donor corneas were evaluated either directly post-preparation or after 3-7 days of storage. Results : Light microscopy (LM) evaluation of all grafts showed an unremarkable endothelial cell monolayer directly after preparation. However, median viable ECD for the 5 grafts initially allocated for transplantation was 18% (range 9-73%) lower than median LM ECD. For the paired DMEK grafts, viable ECD determined by Calcein-AM staining on the day of graft preparation and after 3-7 days of graft storage showed a median decrease of 1% (mean, 5(11)%) and 2% (mean, 16(33)%), respectively.

METHODS This scoping review included observational studies that 1) involved adults living with a neurological condition, and 2) quantified the amount of rehabilitation being received in the community or outpatient hospital setting. Only literature published in English was considered. MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and PEDro databases were searched from inception. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, followed by full texts, and data extraction. Mean annual hours of rehabilitation was estimated based on the amount of rehabilitation reported in the included studies. RESULTS Overall, 18 studies were included after screen 14,698 articles. The estimated mean annual hours of rehabilitation varied greatly (4.9 to 155.1 h), with individuals with spinal cord injury and stroke receiving the greatest number of hours.

Presently, approaches to induce antigen-specific tolerance as a therapeutic approach; for example, by peptide-based tolerogenic inverse vaccines have regained great interest. We have previously shown that coupling of peptides to carriers can enhance their capacity to induce regulatory T cells in vivo. METHOD: In this present study, we investigated whether the tolerogenic potential of immunodominant myelin T-cell epitopes can be improved by conjugation to the synthetic carrier polyethylene glycol (PEG) in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model for chronic MS (MOG C57BL/6). RESULTS: Preventive administration of the PEGylated antigenic peptide could strongly suppress the development of EAE, accompanied by reduced immune cell infiltration in the central nervous system (CNS). Depletion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) abrogated the protective effect indicating that Tregs play a crucial role in induction of antigen-specific tolerance in EAE. Treatment during the acute phase of disease was safe and did not induce immune activation. However, treatment at the peak of disease did not affect the disease course, suggesting that either induction of Tregs does not occur in the highly inflamed situation, or that the immune system is refractory to regulation in this condition. CONCLUSION: PEGylation of antigenic peptides is an effective and feasible strategy to improve tolerogenic (Treg-inducing) peptide-based vaccines, but application for immunotherapy of overt disease might require modifications or combination therapies that simultaneously suppress effector mechanisms.","output":"Prevention of EAE by tolerogenic vaccination with PEGylated antigenic peptides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose three different data driven approaches for pricing European style call options using supervised machine-learning algorithms.

The objective of this study was to develop a protocol for direct use of saliva in tests for genetic markers, without purifi cation of nucleic acids. Methods. PCR, real-time RT-PCR and isothermal amplifi cation tests were used for direct detection of genetic markers, without purifi cation of nucleic acids. Results. We report a protocol for the direct detection of genetic markers in saliva. The protocol is based on a collection of saliva in a solution containing a detergent and ethanol and is compatible with isothermal amplifi cation (LAMP), real-time RT-PCR and RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 and GAPDH markers were used as reference markers. We observed that mild detergents allow effi cient detection of external reference and intracellular endogenous markers, while strong detergent, e.g. sodium dodecyl sulfate, inhibited the PCR reaction. Under these conditions, saliva samples can be stored for 24 h at +4C or -18C with the preservation of markers. Storage at room temperature led to the deterioration of marker detection. Snap heating of saliva samples at the time of collection, followed by storage at room temperature, provided partial protection. Conclusion. The protocol presented in this report describes the collection and storage of saliva for direct detection of genetic markers and is compatible with PCR and LAMP tests. ? 2021 Croatian Veterinary Institute.

CCR5 and CCL5 were also significantly correlated with the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Finally, the mechanisms of insulin resistance in PCOS may be caused by an increase in serine phosphorylation and a decrease in Akt phosphorylation.","output":"CysteineCCysteine Motif Chemokine Receptor 5 Expression in Letrozole-Induced Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we evaluated 3444 Latin American natural products using cheminformatic tools.

The overall analysis was performed using drug-likeness properties, molecular fingerprints of different designs, two parameters similarity, molecular scaffolds, and molecular complexity metrics. It was found that, in general, Salvadoran natural products have a large diversity based on fingerprints. Simultaneously, those belonging to Mexico and Panama present the greatest diversity of scaffolds compared to the other databases. This study provided evidence of the high structural complexity that Latin America's natural products have as a benchmark. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on a global level. Thus, in the search for substances that may influence the coronavirus life cycle, the secondary metabolites from El Salvador and Panama were evaluated by docking against the endoribonuclease NSP-15, an enzyme involved in the SARS CoV-2 viral replication.

The need for a tailored, peer-led group programme was raised by parent carers, who co-developed the Healthy Parent Carers programme with researchers. This study aimed to test the feasibility of programme delivery in community settings, and the feasibility and acceptability of a randomised controlled trial design. METHODS Participants were individually randomised with concealed allocation to a structured group programme and access to online resources (intervention), or access to the online resources only (control). Measures of wellbeing and secondary and economic outcomes were collected before randomisation, immediately post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention. Descriptive statistics on recruitment and attrition, demographics, attendance, and fidelity of intervention delivery were analysed with feedback on the acceptability of the trial design. RESULTS One hundred and ninety-three parent carers expressed an interest in taking part. Ninety-two participants recruited from across six sites were randomised (47 intervention, 45 control). Lead and assistant facilitators were trained and delivered the group sessions. Sixteen (34%) participants in the intervention arm did not attend any sessions, and attendance varied across sites and sessions. One participant withdrew post-randomisation, and 83 (90%) participants completed outcome measures at the six-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrated that it was feasible to deliver the programme in community settings. The number of parent carers who expressed interest signifies the need for such a programme and the feasibility of recruiting to a definitive trial. Loss to follow-up was low. Further research is needed to explore ways to reduce barriers to participation in person and assess the feasibility and acceptability of programme content and delivery for more ethnically diverse groups, and potentially using interpreters. Given the Covid-19 pandemic and delivery format feedback, there is also a need to investigate remote or blended delivery strategies. Although the results indicate that a definitive trial is feasible, programme impact would be strengthened through exploration of these uncertainties.

The aim of this study was to describe the coverage of school health monitoring systems for infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and school physical environments in China, and to explore differences by geography, regional wealth, and school type. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using data from 2428 schools from 17 provinces in China in 2018. Data were collected using a questionnaire administered by the Ministry of Education through its monitoring system, and included infectious diseases (e.g., reporting system for student infectious diseases), non-communicable diseases (e.g., regular student health examinations), and school physical environments (e.g., monitoring of classroom light, microclimate and drinking water). FINDINGS: Overall, the coverage rate of full school health monitoring systems was 166%. The coverage rates of school health monitoring systems for infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and school physical environments were 712%, 685%, and 249%, respectively. Coverage was higher in schools from urban rather than rural areas, in schools from areas with greater wealth, and in senior secondary schools rather than junior secondary and primary schools. INTERPRETATION: Systems for monitoring infectious diseases in school students have been widely implemented in China. Systems for monitoring non-communicable diseases and physical environments need to be strengthened. Beyond greater attention in poorer and rural areas, increased investment in more comprehensive approaches to school health is indicated.

Though the vaccinations are done on a massive scale, the frequent mutations in the viral gene and resilience of the future strains could be more problematic. Therefore, there is always a need for new compounds to be available for therapeutic studies. We carried out the present research to discover potential drug compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. A total of 16,000 drug-like small molecules from the ChemBridge database were virtually screened to obtain the top hits. As a result, 1032 hits were selected based on their docking scores. Next, these structures were prepared for molecular docking, and each small molecule was docked into the active site of the Mpro. Only those compounds with strong interactions with the active site residues and had the highest docking score were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The post-simulation analyses were carried out using the in-built GROMACS commands to gauge the stability, flexibility, and compactness. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hydrogen bonding were also calculated to observe trends and affinity of the drugs towards the target. Among the five top compounds, C1, C3, and C4 revealed strong interaction with the targets active site and remained highly stable throughout the simulation. We believe the predicted compounds in this study could be potential inhibitors in the natural system and must be considered for further practice.","output":"Discovering potent inhibitors against the Mpro of the SARS-CoV-2.

An overview of PubMed literature depicting the state of the art of urology residency in the COVID-19 era was performed as well, to contextualize the issue. METHODS An online learning event for residents was set up at the beginning of the pandemic; the faculty consisted of experts in urology who provided on-line lectures and videos on surgical anatomy, procedures, updates in guidelines, technology, training. The audience was composed of 30-500 attendees from Italy, USA, India and Belgium. A questionnaire to analyze relevance, satisfaction and popularity of the lessons was mailed to 30 local residents. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Almost all residents defined the web environment suitable to achieve the learning outcomes; the method, the number and the competence of the faculty were appropriate/excellent. Most of the younger residents (81.8%) stated their surgical knowledge would improve after the course; 72.7% declared they would take advantage into routine inpatients clinical activity. Nineteen more expert residents agreed that the course would improve their surgical knowledge and enhance their practical skills; almost all stated that the initiative would change their outpatients and inpatients practice. Overall, 44 articles available in PubMed have addressed the concern of urological learning and training during the pandemic from different standpoints; four of them considered residents' general perception towards web-based learning programs. CONCLUSIONS The paper confirms residents' satisfaction with e-learning methods and, to our knowledge, is the first one focusing on a specific event promptly settled up at the beginning of the outbreak. Web-based educational experience developed during the pandemic may represent the very basis for the implementation of prospective on-site training and overall scientific update of future urologists.","output":"COVID-19 and slowdown of residents' activity: Feedback from a novel e-learning event and overview of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kinesiophobia is related with adverse outcomes in various diseases, but it hasn't been studied in chronic heart failure (CHF).

Development of animal models that recapitulate important aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for the evaluation of vaccines and antivirals, and understanding disease pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV-1, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)(1C3). Due to amino acid differences between murine and hACE2, inbred mouse strains fail to support high titer viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, a number of transgenic and knock-in mouse models, as well as viral vector-mediated hACE2 delivery systems have been developed. Here we compared the K18-hACE2 transgenic model to adenovirus-mediated delivery of hACE2 to the mouse lung. We show that K18-hACE2 mice replicate virus to high titers in both the lung and brain leading to lethality. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated delivery results in viral replication to lower titers limited to the lung, and no clinical signs of infection with a challenge dose of 10(4) plaque forming units. The K18-hACE2 model provides a stringent model for testing the ability of vaccines and antivirals to protect against disease, whereas the adenovirus delivery system has the flexibility to be used across multiple genetic backgrounds and modified mouse strains.","output":"Comparison of Transgenic and Adenovirus hACE2 Mouse Models for SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to most academics, different generations share common characteristics.

However, due to the complex nature of mental disorders (e.g., high comorbidity), symptoms that are specifically associated with deficits in decision-making remain unidentified. Furthermore, the influence of psychiatric symptoms on computations underpinning reward-seeking and loss-avoidance decision-making remains elusive. Here, we aim to address these issues by leveraging a large-scale online experiment and computational modelling. METHODS In the online experiment, we recruited 1,900 non-diagnostic participants from the general population. They performed either a reward-seeking or loss-avoidance decision-making task, and subsequently completed questionnaires about psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS We found that one trans-diagnostic dimension of psychiatric symptoms related to compulsive behaviour and intrusive thought (CIT) was negatively correlated with overall decision-making performance in both the reward-seeking and loss-avoidance tasks. A deeper analysis further revealed that, in both tasks, the CIT psychiatric dimension was associated with lower preference for the options that recently led to better outcomes (i.e., reward or no-loss). On the other hand, in the reward-seeking task only, the CIT dimension was associated with lower preference for recently unchosen options. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that psychiatric symptoms influence the two types of decision-making, reward-seeking and loss-avoidance, through both common and distinct computational processes.

However, the effects of high levels of potentially toxic substances such as sulfatides--which accumulate in metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD)--on this regenerative ability are still largely unclear. To start addressing this question, in vitro and in vivo experiments were used to examine the behavior of multipotential neural precursors exposed to abnormally high levels of sulfatides. Following transplantation of dissociated neurospheres into the brain of presymptomatic MLD pups, the majority of donor-derived cells were distributed in a caudal to rostral direction, with higher numbers in the cortex. Most if not all of the donor cells acquired an astroglial phenotype. We found no evidence of oligodendrocyte or neuronal commitment of transplanted cells in long-term-treated MLD mice (e.g. up to 1.5 years of age). This was in line with our in vitro findings of sulfatides blocking oligodendrocyte formation after induction of differentiation in sulfatide-treated epidermal growth factor/fibroblast growth factor responsive neurospheres. Transplanted MLD mice showed an improved arylsulfatase A (ARSA) activity and a significant amelioration of sulfatide metabolism, neurodegeneration and motor-learning/memory deficits. Furthermore, transplanted cells were shown to act as a source of ARSA enzyme that accumulated in endogenous brain cells, indicating the occurrence of enzyme cross-correction between transplanted and host cells. These results provide a first insight into the effect of sulfatides on the stemness properties of neural stem cells and on the effects of the MLD environment on the in vivo expectations of using neural stem cells in cell therapy.","output":"Multipotential neural precursors transplanted into the metachromatic leukodystrophy brain fail to generate oligodendrocytes but contribute to limit brain dysfunction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past few months, numerous studies harnessed in silico methods such as molecular docking to evaluate food compounds for inhibitory activity against coronavirus infection and replication.

Hence, we designed a randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and advantages of TCMR for treating patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a parallel-design, two-arm, analyst assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial. A total of 128 patients with COVID-19 aged from 20 to 80 years will be recruited and assigned randomly into a guideline therapy group and a guideline therapy plus TCMR group at a 1:1 ratio. Patients in both groups will receive guideline therapy. The patients in the intervention group will perform acupressure therapy and Liu Zi Jue Qigong exercises in addition to conventional treatments twice a day and will be persistent from admission to discharge. The primary outcome will be measured with the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, and the secondary outcomes will include the Activities of Daily Living Barthel Index Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Scale, and the Respiratory Symptoms Scale. The assessments of the clinical scales will be performed at three points (before treatment, the 7th day during hospitalization, and the discharge day).

A few reports suggest the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from mothers to their neonates. Most neonates have mild symptoms, but some develop multisystem involvement and shock. Case Presentation: We report two cases of possible SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission from mothers to their neonates. The first case shows maternal infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the second trimester followed by recurrent infection in the third trimester right before the delivery. The infant demonstrated respiratory distress soon after delivery along with myocardial dysfunction and multi-organ system involvement. The second case shows maternal infection with SARS-COV-2 at the time of delivery with preterm labor secondary to placental abruption, with that delivery resulting in the preterm neonate requiring non-invasive ventilation with multisystem involvement in the context of persistently positive SARS-COV-2 PCR in the neonate. Both neonates were treated with IVIG along with steroids. Both neonates recovered fully and were discharged and allowed to go home. Conclusion: In neonates, COVID-19 usually presents as an asymptomatic or mild illness;some may develop a more severe course. Our two cases, however, demonstrate that multisystem involvement, although rare, is possible. This report also supports the current evidence of possible vertical transmission from mothers to their neonates.

Considering that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) played an important role during outbreak of SARS and H1N1, finding potential alternative approaches for COVID-19 treatment is necessary before vaccines are developed. According to previous studies, Maxing Shigan decoction (MXSGD) present a prominent antivirus effect and is often used to treat pulmonary diseases. Furthermore, we collected 115 open prescriptions for COVID-19 therapy from the National Health Commission, State Administration of TCM and other organizations, MXSGD was identified as the key formula. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of MXSGD against COVID-19 is still unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic mechanism of MXSGD against COVID-19 by network pharmacology and in vitro experiment verification, and screen the potential components which could bind to key targets of COVID-19 via molecular docking method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple open-source databases related to TCM or compounds were employed to screen active ingredients and potential targets of MXSGD. Network pharmacology analysis methods were used to initially predict the antivirus and anti-inflammatory effects of MXSGD against COVID-19. IL-6 induced rat lung epithelial type  cells (RLE-6TN) damage was established to explore the anti-inflammatory damage activity of MXSGD. After MXSGD intervention, the expression level of related proteins and their phosphorylation in the IL-6 mediated JAK-STAT signaling pathway were detected by western blot. Molecular docking technique was used to further identify the potential substances which could bind to three key targets (ACE2, Mpro and RdRp) of COVID-19. RESULTS: In this study, 105 active ingredients and 1025 candidate targets were selected for MXSGD, 83 overlapping targets related to MXSGD and COVID-19 were identified, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of MXSGD against COVID-19 was constructed. According to the results of biological enrichment analysis, 63 significant KEGG pathways were enriched, and most of them were related to signal transduction, immune system and virus infection. Furthermore, according the relationship between signal pathways, we confirmed MXSGD could effectively inhibit IL-6 mediated JAK-STAT signal pathway related protein expression level, decreased the protein expression levels of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, Bax and Caspase 3, and increased the protein expression level of Bcl-2, thereby inhibiting RLE-6TN cells damage. In addition, according to the LibDock scores screening results, the components with strong potential affinity (Top 10) with ACE2, Mpro and RdRp are mainly from glycyrrhiza uralensis (Chinese name: Gancao) and semen armeniacae amarum (Chinese name: Kuxingren). Among them, amygdalin was selected as the optimal candidate component bind to all three key targets, and euchrenone, glycyrrhizin, and glycyrol also exhibited superior affinity interactions with ACE2, Mpro and RdRp, respectively. CONCLUSION: This work explained the positive characteristics of multi-component, multi-target, and multi-approach intervention with MXSGD in combating COVID-19, and preliminary revealed the antiviral and anti-inflammatory pharmacodynamic substances and mechanism of MXSGD, which might provide insights into the vital role of TCM in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Potential effect of Maxing Shigan decoction against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) revealed by network pharmacology and experimental verification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between chronotype, learning style, and academic achievement. The study sample consisted of 1884 volunteer undergraduate students from 58 different universities across Turkey. The data were collected online during distance education because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Turkish version of Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and Big16 Learning Modality Inventory were used for data collection. The correlation between chronotype and cumulative grade point average (CGPA) scores was analyzed using Spearman's rho, and differences among the chronotypes were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis test. Chi-square tests with pairwise z-test were used to analyze the relationships between the participants' learning style preferences and chronotypes. Also, ANCOVA analyses were performed to evaluate the interactions of gender  chronotype and gender  learning style on CGPA scores. The results revealed that participants' preference for visual and auditory styles differed by chronotype. Visual learning style was more dominant among morning (M) types, while auditory style was more dominant among evening (E) types. However, the most preferred learning style was visual, followed by auditory and kinesthetic styles for all chronotypes. No relationship was found between chronotype and academic achievement. The CGPA scores of the participants with kinesthetic learning style were lower than the participants with auditory and visual learning styles. The female participants had higher CGPA score than males. However, the CGPA scores did not differ for both male and female participants with different chronotype and learning style preferences. From the results, we suggest that academic achievement can be enhanced by consideration of students' learning style preferences for all chronotypes.","output":"Investigation of the relationship between chronotype, learning style and academic achievement of university students during distance education in the pandemic period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"METHODS Forty-two COVID-19 patients who underwent emergency PCI due to the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome were included in the study.

We analyzed all data using descriptive statistics and correlations. Overall, most pharmacists held positive attitudes about the HPV vaccine. However, the majority rarely administered the HPV vaccine. Intentions to vaccinate and subjective norms positively correlated with vaccine administration behavior. Pharmacists' positive attitudes about the vaccine, subjective norm to vaccinate, and behavioral control or self-efficacy to recommend the vaccine impacted their intentions to vaccinate against HPV. Most surveyed pharmacists believed that the most substantial HPV vaccine administration barriers include parental consent and parental stigma against the vaccine. The most common pharmacy-related barrier was the lack of a tracking and reminder system to encourage patients to return for additional HPV vaccine doses. This work highlights the need to increase public awareness that pharmacists can administer vaccines to adolescents.

A combination of toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists can be a promising vaccine adjuvant candidate by stimulating innate immune cells and inducing antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI). In this study, a monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and Poly I:C combination, in low doses with ovalbumin (OVA) protein, elicited strong OVA-specific antibody production and more effective memory T cell responses compared with OVA only, OVA+MPL, OVA+Poly I:C groups at the site of immunization, as well as innate immune cell recruitment and activation. This study suggests MPL+Poly I:C as a potential CMI-inducing vaccine adjuvant candidate. ABSTRACT: Induction of antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI), as well as humoral immunity, is critical for successful vaccination against various type of pathogens. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists have been developed as adjuvants to promote vaccine efficacy and induce appropriate immune responses. Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL); a TLR4 agonist, and Poly I:C; a TLR3 agonist, are known as a strong immuno-stimulator which induce Th1 response. Many studies proved and compared the efficacy of each adjuvant, but no study has investigated the combination of them. Using ovalbumin protein antigen, MPL+Poly I:C combination induced more effective antigen-specific CMI response than single adjuvants. Production of inflammatory cytokines, recruitment of innate immune cells and antigen-specific CD4/CD8 memory T cell at the immunized site had been significantly enhanced by MPL+Poly I:C combination. Moreover, MPL+Poly I:C combination enhanced ovalbumin-specific serum IgG, IgG1, and IgG2c production and proliferative function of CD4 and CD8 T cells after in vitro ovalbumin peptide stimulation. Taken together, these data suggest that the combination of MPL and Poly I:C has a potency as a CMI-inducing vaccine adjuvant with synergistically increased effects.","output":"Monophosphoryl Lipid A and Poly I:C Combination Adjuvant Promoted Ovalbumin-Specific Cell Mediated Immunity in Mice Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Since the first novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient in Korea was diagnosed on January 20, 2020, 30 patients were diagnosed until February 17, 2020. However, 5,298 additional patients were confirmed until March 4, 2020. Therefore, our objective was to estimate the reproduction number (R) and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures. METHODS: A COVID-19 transmission model (SEIHR) was established to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of daily confirmed cases in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province (NGP), the main area of outbreak, was used. The first patient' symptom onset date in the Daegu/NGP outbreak was assumed as January 22, 2020. The R according to the start date of the effect of preventive measures was estimated. RESULTS: The estimated R in Hubei Province, China, was 4.0281, whereas the estimated initial R in Korea was 0.555, but later in Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.472 and 3.543. When the transmission period decreases from 4-day to 2-day, the outbreak ends early, but the peak of the epidemic increases, and the total number of patients does not change greatly. It was found that, if transmission rate decreases, the outbreak ends early, and the size of the peak and the total number of patients also decreases. CONCLUSIONS: To end the COVID-19 epidemic, efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, such as social distancing and wearing masks, are absolutely crucial with the participation of the public, along with the policy of reducing the transmission period by finding and isolating patients as quickly as possible through the efforts of the quarantine authorities.","output":"Estimating the reproductive number and the outbreak size of COVID-19 in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The M protein of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 is a triple-spanning membrane protein which assembles with an uncleaved internal signal sequence, adopting an NexoCcyt orientation. To study the insertion mechanism of this protein, domains potentially involved in topogenesis were deleted and the effects analyzed in topogenesis were deleted and the effects analyzed in several ways. Mutant proteins were synthesized in a cell-free translation system in the presence of microsomal membranes, and their integration and topology were determined by alkaline extraction and by protease-protection experiments. By expression in COS-1 and Madin-Darby canine kidney-II cells, the topology of the mutant proteins was also analyzed in vivo. Glycosylation was used as a biochemical marker to assess the disposition of the NH2 terminus. An indirect immunofluorescence assay on semi-intact Madin-Darby canine kidney-II cells using domain-specific antibodies served to identify the cytoplasmically exposed domains. The results show that each membrane-spanning domain acts independently as an insertion and anchor signal and adopts an intrinsic preferred orientation in the lipid bilayer which corresponds to the disposition of the transmembrane domain in the wild-type assembled protein.

Objective: In search of better prognostic markers in COVID-19, we hypothesized that circulating soluble ST2 (sST2) could be associated to a worse outcome, prompted by our previous knowledge of sST2 involvement in heart failure-associated lung deterioration, and by mounting evidence favoring a role of IL-33/ST2 axis in the disease. Design, Setting and participants: One hundred and fifty-two patients admitted for confirmed COVID-19 infection were included in a prospective non-interventional, observational study carried out in a tertiary teaching center. Blood samples were drawn at admission, 48-72 hours later and at discharge. sST2 concentrations, and routine blood laboratory were analyzed. Main outcomes: Primary end-points were admission at intensive care unit (ICU) and, mortality. Other outcomes were a need for high oxygen flow therapy (HOF) or increasing treatment at 48/72 hours. Results: Median age was 57.5 years (SD: 12.8), 60.4% males. Ten per cent of patients (n=15) were derived to ICU and/or died during admission. The rest stayed hospitalized 8(IQR:6) days on average. About 34% (n=47), 38% (n=53) and 48.5% (n=66) needed HOF, up-titrate therapy or both, respectively. Median (IQR) sST2 serum concentration (ng/mL) rose to 53.1(30.9) at admission, peaked at 48-72h (79.5[64]) and returned to admission levels at discharge (44.9[36.7]), remaining significantly elevated above healthy donor values (18.6[15.1]). A concentration of sST2 above 58.9 ng/mL identified patients progressing to ICU admission or death. These results remained significant after multivariable analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of sST2 for the occurrence of end-points was 0.776 (p=0.001). Admission sST2 was higher in patients who needed up-tritate therapy.

In this paper, we provide a model for dynamically optimizing the level of disease containment measures over the course of a pandemic. We determine the timing and level of containment measures to minimize the impact of a pandemic on economic activity and lives lost, subject to healthcare capacity and stochastic disease evolution dynamics. Based on practical evidence, we examine two common classes of containment policies C dynamic and static C and we find that the value of dynamic policies over static policies increases with lower healthcare capacity, higher disease infection rate, and longer disease recovery period. Our work reveals a fundamental relationship between the structure of Pareto-efficient containment measures (in terms of lives lost and economic activity) and key disease and economic parameters such as disease infection rate, recovery rate, and healthcare capacity. We also examine the impact possibilities of virus mutation and vaccination on the containment policies.","output":"Optimizing Disease Containment Measures during a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic/epidemic of COVID-19 has affected people worldwide. A huge number of lives succumbed to death due to the sudden outbreak of this corona virus infection. The specified symptoms of COVID-19 detection are very common like normal flu; asymptomatic version of COVID-19 has become a critical issue. Therefore, as a precautionary measurement, the oxygen level needs to be monitored by every individual if no other critical condition is found. It is not the only parameter for COVID-19 detection but, as per the suggestions by different medical organizations such as the World Health Organization, it is better to use oximeter to monitor the oxygen level in probable patients as a precaution. People are using the oximeters personally; however, not having any clue or guidance regarding the measurements obtained. Therefore, in this article, we have shown a framework of oxygen level monitoring and severity calculation and probabilistic decision of being a COVID-19 patient. This framework is also able to maintain the privacy of patient information and uses probabilistic classification to measure the severity. Results are measured based on latency of blockchain creation and overall response, throughput, detection, and severity accuracy.

Several measures have been put in place to prevent its spread among the population. However, for these preventive measures to be effective, the population requires appropriate and sufficient knowledge, attitude, and practices. Thus, a survey to assess knowledge, attitude, and self-reported practice toward measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19 was conducted among Ugandans. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among during the lockdown in Uganda. An online structured questionnaire was used, applying a snowballing sampling approach for recruitment of participants 18 years and above and residing in Uganda. Data collection was done from 6th to 15th April 2020, during which 1,763 people participated. We analyzed all data using STATA 14.2, applying appropriate statistical tests. Results: Out of 1,763 participants, 80% were highly knowledgeable. For attitude, 72.4% reported following recommendations given by the Ministry of health to prevent the spread of COVID-19; 89.0% were worried about contracting COVID-19 and 73.3% agreed that COVID-19 can be cured and 99.3% reported good practice toward measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. According to ordered logistic regression, health workers were 6 times more knowledgeable [aOR:6 (3.51-10.09), p < 0.001] followed by teachers [aOR:5.2 (2.6-10.32), p < 0.001]; students [aOR:3.2 (1.96-5.33), p < 0.001]. On the contrary, the drivers, business entrepreneurs, and security personnel had less knowledge. Conclusion: The results show that the participating Ugandans were knowledgeable and had a positive attitude and good practices. However, there is still a gap in knowledge among drivers, business entrepreneurs, and security personnel. Therefore, there is a need to mobilize the country's population to have the same degree of knowledge, which will have an impact on the attitude and practices toward prevention of the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Knowledge, Attitude, and Self-Reported Practice Toward Measures for Prevention of the Spread of COVID-19 Among Ugandans: A Nationwide Online Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Exploring the use of forecasting models and simulation tools to estimate demand and reduce the waiting time of patients in Emergency Departments (EDs). METHODS The analysis was based on data collected in May 2013 in the ED of Recanto das Emas, Federal District, Brasil, which uses a Manchester Triage System. A total of 100 consecutive patients were included: 70 yellow (70%) and 30 green (30%). Flow patterns, observed waiting time, and inter-arrival times of patients were collected. Process maps, demand, and capacity data were used to build a simulation, which was calibrated against the observed flow times. What-if analysis was conducted to reduce waiting times. RESULTS Green and yellow patient arrival-time patterns were similar, but inter-arrival times were 5 and 38 minutes, respectively. Wait-time was 14 minutes for yellow patients, and 4 hours for green patients. The physician staff comprised four doctors per shift. A simulation predicted that allocating one more doctor per shift would reduce wait-time to 2.5 hours for green patients, with a small impact in yellow patients' wait-time. Maintaining four doctors and allocating one doctor exclusively for green patients would reduce the waiting time to 1.5 hours for green patients and increase it in 15 minutes for yellow patients. The best simulation scenario employed five doctors per shift, with two doctors exclusively for green patients. CONCLUSION Waiting times can be reduced by balancing the allocation of doctors to green and yellow patients and matching the availability of doctors to forecasted demand patterns.

BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) and aortic aneurysm (AA) share commons risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking. Cardiac assessment before aortic abdominal aneurysm (AAA) surgery is indicated for patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). The usefulness of assessment of moderate/high-risk patients is still debated. PURPOSE: the purpose of our study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of dipyridamole stress echocardiography (DSE) for the detection of CAD in patients undergoing AAA surgery with high cardiovascular risk. METHODS: From 2017th to 2019th 120 patients underwent surgery for aortic aneurysm (71 endovascular technique and 49 with open laparotomy). Of these, 74 asymptomatic patients with high cardiovascular risk underwent a pre-surgical contrast-enhanced dipyridamole stress echo (0,84 mg/kg over 6 minutes C protocol with LVO with sulfur hexafluoride), to exclude the presence of inducible myocardial ischemia, Mean follow-up was 6-24 months. RESULTS: Mean age was 77 years +/- 6.6, with male gender prevalent (83%). No complication during DSE occurred; mean SCORE risk was 9.8% +/- 2.3%, with 63% patients with very high risk. Only 1 patient showed inducible ischemia during stress echocardiography, with evidence of significant LAD stenosis; no myocardial infarction was reported at follow-up, while 1 ischemic stroke and 1 unplanned revascularization occurred. 11% of patients died, of which 50% for Sars-Cov-2 disease and 12% due to post-surgery dissection while no cardiac deaths were found. CONCLUSIONS: dipyridamole stress echo is safe in patients with surgical-class abdominal aortic aneurism; in patients with high cardiovascular risk but no symptoms reversible ischemia is rare.

METHODS: Data on sociodemographics, occupational situation, contact to COVID-19 patients, mental burden, stressors, resilience, risk and protective factors were assessed among a convenience sample of healthcare personnel in spring 2020 (5 April 2020C7 May 2020). A comparison with the general population in Germany before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. RESULTS: After the evaluation of 650 completed questionnaires, an increased mental burden was found compared to the German general population before the pandemic, while the mental burden was reduced compared to the general population during the pandemic. The self-reported resilience was slightly higher compared to the general population before and during the pandemic. The COVID-19-related stressors and worries were the most important risk factors, self-efficacy and optimism the most important protective factors. The mental burden was moderately correlated with the intention to change the profession and the tendency towards absenteeism. CONCLUSION: Mental burden in healthcare personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a higher tendency towards taking sick leave.

Recent advances in the targeting of cytokines and leukocyte migration have greatly advanced treatment options, but most patients still relapse and inevitably progress. Although single-cell approaches are transforming our ability to understand the barrier tissue biology of inflammatory disease, comprehensive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlases of IBD to date have largely sampled pre-treated patients with established disease. This has limited our understanding of which cell types, subsets, and states at diagnosis are predictive of disease severity and response to treatment. Here, through a combined clinical, flow cytometric, and scRNA-seq study, we profile diagnostic human biopsies from the terminal ileum of treatment-naive pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (pediCD; n=14) and from non-inflamed pediatric controls with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID; n=13). To fully resolve and annotate epithelial, stromal, and immune cell states among the 201,883 single-cell transcriptomes, we develop and deploy a principled and unbiased tiered clustering approach, ARBOL, yielding 138 FGID and 305 pediCD end cell clusters. Notably, through both flow cytometry and scRNA-seq, we observe that at the level of broad cell types, treatment-naive pediCD is not readily distinguishable from FGID in cellular composition. However, by integrating high-resolution scRNA-seq analysis, we identify significant differences in cell states that arise during pediCD relative to FGID. Furthermore, by closely linking our scRNA-seq analysis with clinical meta-data, we resolve a vector of lymphoid, myeloid, and epithelial cell states in treatment-naive samples which can distinguish patients with less severe disease (those not on anti-TNF therapies (NOA)), from those with more severe disease at presentation who require anti-TNF therapies. Moreover, this vector was also able to distinguish those patients that achieve a full response (FR) to anti-TNF blockade from those more treatment-resistant patients who only achieve a partial response (PR). Our study jointly leverages a treatment-naive cohort, high-resolution principled scRNA-seq data analysis, and clinical outcomes to understand which baseline cell states may predict inflammatory disease trajectory.","output":"A Treatment-Naive Cellular Atlas of Pediatric Crohn's Disease Predicts Disease Severity and Therapeutic Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM: A novel human coronavirus, named SARS-COV-2, has recently caused thousands of deaths all around the world.

We used a generalized linear mixed model to evaluate the association between county level LAI and COVID-19 mortality rate in analyses adjusted for 2015-2019 county level average total county population, older population, race, overcrowding in home, Medicaid, education, and physical inactivity. RESULTS: A dose-response association was found between greenness and reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality.

Aside from LAI decile 5, no associations were found between the remaining LAI deciles and COVID-19 mortality. Increasing prevalence of counties with older age residents, low education attainment, Native Americans, Black Americans, and housing overcrowding were significantly associated with increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, whereas Medicaid prevalence was associated with a reduced risk.

Total pancreatectomy retains the challenges of uncinate process dissection and digestive reconstruction, but avoids the risk of pancreatic fistula, and could be a suitable operation to highlight the advantages of robotic assistance in pancreatic resections. METHODS Eleven laparoscopic robot-assisted total pancreatectomies (LRATP) were compared to 11 case-matched open total pancreatectomies. All operations were performed by one surgeon during the same period of time. Robotic assistance was employed in half of the patients, based on robot availability at the time of surgery. Variables examined included age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, body mass index, estimated blood loss, need for blood transfusions, operative time, tumor type, tumor size, number of examined lymph nodes, margin status, post-operative complications, 90-day or in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and readmission rate. RESULTS No LRATP was converted to conventional laparoscopy, hand-assisted laparoscopy or open surgery despite two patients (18.1 %) required vein resection and reconstruction. LRATP was associated with longer mean operative time (600 vs. 469 min; p = 0.014) but decreased mean blood loss (220 vs. 705; p = 0.004) than open surgery. Post-operative complications occurred in similar percentages after LRATP and open surgery. Complications occurring in most patients (5/7) after LRATP were of mild severity (Clavien-Dindo grade I and II). One patient required repeat laparoscopic surgery after LRATP, to drain a fluid collection not amenable to percutaneous catheter drainage. One further patient from the open group required repeat surgery because of bleeding. No patient had margin positive resection, and the mean number of examined lymph nodes was 45 after LRATP and 36 after open surgery.

Here, we analyzed the differentiation and cytotoxic profile of T cells in 30 cases of mild COVID-19 during acute infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a cytotoxic response of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, characterized by the simultaneous production of granzyme A and B as well as perforin within different effector CD8+ T cell subsets. PD-1-expressing CD8+ T cells also produced cytotoxic molecules during acute infection, indicating that they were not functionally exhausted. However, in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years, the cytotoxic T cell potential was diminished, especially in effector memory and terminally differentiated effector CD8+ cells, showing that elderly patients have impaired cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

With the numerous advancements made in molecular biology in recent years, researchers have discovered that exosomes and their cargos, such as miRNAs, lncRNAs, and proteins, can promote or inhibit the EMT, modulate the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, contribute to the proliferation of fibroblasts and promote immunoregulatory and mitochondrial damage during pulmonary fibrosis. Exosomes are key factors regulating the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into myofibroblasts. Interestingly, exosomes derived from BMSCs under pathological and physiological conditions may promote or inhibit the EMT of type II alveolar epithelial cells and the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts to regulate pulmonary fibrosis.

This mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression occurs during infection with gammaherpesviruses including Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which encode an mRNA endonuclease that initiates widespread RNA decay. Here, we show that MHV68-induced mRNA decay leads to a genome-wide reduction of Pol II occupancy at mammalian promoters. This reduced Pol II occupancy is accompanied by down-regulation of multiple Pol II subunits and TFIIB in the nucleus of infected cells, as revealed by mass spectrometry-based global measurements of protein abundance. Viral genes, despite the fact that they require Pol II for transcription, escape transcriptional repression. Protection is not governed by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay. We propose a model in which the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the localization of viral DNA within replication compartments, providing a means for these viruses to counteract decay-induced transcript loss.","output":"RNA decay during gammaherpesvirus infection reduces RNA polymerase II occupancy of host promoters but spares viral promoters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Acute lung injury is common following cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest for congenital heart surgery with the most severe injury in the dorsocaudal lung. Metabolomics offers promise in deducing mechanisms of disease states, providing risk stratification, and understanding therapeutic responses in regards to CPB/DHCA related organ injury. OBJECTIVES: Using an infant porcine model, we sought to determine the individual and additive effects of CPB/DHCA and lung region on the metabolic fingerprint, metabolic pathways, and individual metabolites in lung tissue. METHODS: Twenty-seven infant piglets were divided into two groups: mechanical ventilation + CPB/DHCA (n = 20) and mechanical ventilation only (n = 7). Lung tissue was obtained from dorsocaudal and ventral regions. Targeted analysis of 235 metabolites was performed using HPLC/MSCMS. Data was analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), ANOVA, and pathway analysis. RESULTS: Profound metabolic differences were found in dorsocaudal compared to ventral lung zones by PCA and PLS-DA (R2 = 0.7; Q2 = 0.59; p < 0.0005). While overshadowed by the regional differences, some differences by exposure to CPB/DHCA were seen as well. Seventy-four metabolites differed among groups and pathway analysis revealed 20 differential metabolic pathways. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate significant metabolic disturbances between dorsocaudal and ventral lung regions during supine mechanical ventilation with or without CPB/DHCA. CPB/DHCA also leads to metabolic differences and may have additive effects to the regional disturbances.

S protein is heavily glycosylated and the glycosylation sites are relatively conserved, thus glycans on S protein surface could be a target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies against variants. Here, we collected 12 plant-derived lectins with different carbohydrate specificity and evaluated their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity against mutant strains and epidemic variants using a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. The Lens culinaris-derived lentil lectin which specifically bind to oligomannose-type glycans and GlcNAc at the non-reducing end terminus showed most potent and broad antiviral activity against a panel of mutant strains and variants, including the artificial mutants at N-/O-linked glycosylation site, natural existed amino acid mutants, as well as the epidemic variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. Lentil lectin also showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found lentil lectin could block the binding of ACE2 to S trimer and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at the early steps of infection. Using structural information and determined N-glycan profile of S trimer, taking together with the carbohydrate specificity of lentil lectin, we provide a basis for the observed broad spectrum anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Lentil lectin showed weak haemagglutination activity at 1 mg/mL and no cytotoxicity activity, and no weight loss was found in single injection mouse experiment. This report provides the first evidence that lentil lectin strongly inhibit infection of SARS-COV-2 variants, which should provide valuable insights for developing future anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies.","output":"Lentil lectin derived from Lens culinaris exhibit broad antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 21st century has been a period of rising inequality in both income and health. In this paper, we find that geographic inequality in mortality for midlife Americans increased by about 70 percent between 1992 and 2016. This was not simply because states like New York or California benefited from having a high fraction of college-educated residents who enjoyed the largest health gains during the last several decades. Nor was higher dispersion in mortality caused entirely by the increasing importance of \\"deaths of despair,\\" or by rising spatial income inequality during the same period. Instead, over time, state-level mortality has become increasingly correlated with state-level income; in 1992 income explained only 3 percent of mortality inequality, but by 2016 state-level income explained 58 percent. These mortality patterns are consistent with the view that high-income states in 1992 were better able to enact public health strategies and adopt behaviors that, over the next quarter-century, resulted in pronounced relative declines in mortality. The substantial longevity gains in high-income states led to greater cross-state inequality in mortality.","output":"Rising Geographic Disparities in US Mortality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospital healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 infection. We aimed to determine the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in HCWs in Ireland. Two tertiary referral hospitals in Irish cities with diverging community incidence and seroprevalence were identified; COVID-19 had been diagnosed in 10.2% and 1.8% of staff respectively by the time of the study (October 2020). All staff of both hospitals (N = 9038) were invited to participate in an online questionnaire and blood sampling for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Frequencies and percentages for positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody were calculated and adjusted relative risks (aRR) for participant characteristics were calculated using multivariable regression analysis. In total, 5788 HCWs participated (64% response rate). Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 15% and 4.1% in hospitals 1 and 2, respectively. Thirty-nine percent of infections were previously undiagnosed. Risk for seropositivity was higher for healthcare assistants (aRR 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-3.0), nurses (aRR: 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.2), daily exposure to patients with COVID-19 (aRR: 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1), age 18-29 years (aRR: 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9), living with other HCWs (aRR: 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5), Asian background (aRR: 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) and male sex (aRR: 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4). The HCW seroprevalence was six times higher than community seroprevalence. Risk was higher for those with close patient contact.

Neonates born at term and preterm via cesarean delivery were included if cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy measurements were performed during the immediate transition after birth and blood glucose concentrations were measured at 15-20 minutes after birth. Arterial oxygen saturation and heart rate were measured with pulse oximetry. cFTOE was calculated from arterial oxygen saturation and crSO2 values. crSO2 and cFTOE 15 minutes after birth were correlated with blood glucose concentrations.

It is unclear why some SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals remain asymptomatic, while others develop severe symptoms. Baseline pulmonary levels of antiviral leukocytes, already residing in the lung prior to infection, may orchestrate an effective early immune response and prevent severe symptoms. Here, in silico flow cytometry was used to deconvolute the levels of all seven types of antiviral leukocytes in 1,927 human lung tissues. Baseline levels of CD8(+) T cells, resting NK cells, and activated NK cells, as well as cytokines that recruit these cells, are significantly lower in lung tissues with high expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This is observed in univariate analyses, in multivariate analyses, and in two independent data sets. Importantly, ACE2 mRNA and protein levels very strongly correlate in human cells and tissues. The above findings also largely apply to the SARS-CoV-2 entry protease TMPRSS2. Both SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells and COVID-19 lung tissues show upregulation of CD8(+) T cell- and NK cell-recruiting cytokines. Moreover, tissue-resident CD8(+) T cells and inflammatory NK cells are significantly more abundant in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from mildly affected COVID-19 patients compared to severe cases. This suggests that these lymphocytes are important for preventing severe symptoms. Elevated ACE2 expression increases sensitivity to coronavirus infection. Thus, the results suggest that some individuals may be exceedingly susceptible to develop severe COVID-19 due to concomitant high preexisting ACE2 and TMPRSS expression and low baseline cytotoxic lymphocyte levels in the lung. IMPORTANCE COVID-19 is caused by the highly contagious coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and currently has detrimental human health, community, and economic impacts around the world. It is unclear why some SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals develop severe COVID-19 symptoms, which can be fatal, while others only develop mild symptoms. In the absence of an effective and widely available vaccine, it is of paramount importance that we identify risk factors for development of severe symptoms to be able to improve treatment approaches. The ACE2 gene encodes the receptor on human cells that the virus uses to infect these cells. This study finds that if the lungs of healthy individuals have high levels of ACE2, they typically have low levels of the immune cells that eliminate viruses. Therefore, some individuals may develop severe COVID-19 due to simultaneous high levels of the virus receptor and low levels of immune cells that eradicate the virus in their lungs.","output":"Low Baseline Pulmonary Levels of Cytotoxic Lymphocytes as a Predisposing Risk Factor for Severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Latin American scientific production related to the COVID-19 epidemic means that only 6% represent publications by Latin American authors, led by countries such as Brazil and Mexico; however, this production is still scarce, so efforts must be doubled to make a substantial contribution to the search for alternatives to address the global health crisis that is now in place.","output":"Latin American authorship in scientific production on COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detecting the existence of SARS-CoV-2 in the indoor atmosphere is a practical solution to track the prevalence and prevent the spread of the virus In this work, a thermophoretic approach is presented to collect the novel coronavirus-laden aerosols from the air and accumulate to high concentrations adequate for the sensitivity of viral RNA detection Among the factors, the density and particle size have negligible effects on particle trajectory, while the vertical coordinates of particles increase with the rise in heating source temperature When the heating temperature is higher than 355 K, all of the particles exit the channel from one outlet;thus, the collecting and accumulating of virus-laden aerosols can be realized This study provides a potential approach to accelerate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and avoid a false negative in the following RNA test ? 2021 Author(s)","output":"Thermophoretic collection of virus-laden (SARS-CoV-2) aerosols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The use of single-port laparoscopy for left-lateral liver sectionectomy (LLLS) has been reported in the literature, but the effectiveness and safety of LLLS has not been validated in randomized, controlled trials.

METHODS Altogether, 38 patients aged 17-65 years (16 men, 22 women) with benign liver diseases were hospitalized for elective laparoscopic LLLS between January 2010 and December 2012. Patients were randomly assigned to either single-port (n = 19) or multi-port (n = 19) laparoscopic LLLS. Main outcome measures were operative time, volume of intraoperative blood loss, complication rates, and postoperative hospitalization. RESULTS Baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable. Single-port and multi-port laparoscopies were successfully completed in all but one patient (1/19, 5.3 %) who required conversion from a single-port to a multi-port procedure. The two groups had similar mean operative times and volumes of intraoperative blood loss. There were no clinically significant postoperative complications or deaths.

Here, we investigated for the first time whether, consistent with psychological models of loneliness, biased interpretations of social situations could prospectively predict loneliness in youth. 104 young people completed measures of loneliness and interpretations of ambiguous social and non-social (bodily or health-related) situations at three time-points with intervals of three months between each. As government-imposed social distancing measures (to control the COVID-19 outbreak) occurred between Times 2 and 3 (but not between Times 1 and 2), this enabled us to assess whether restricted social activity could provoke greater predictive power of biased interpretational styles on loneliness. Using cross-lagged panel models, we showed that after estimating paths representing within-time across-variable (\\"concurrent\\") paths and across-time within-variable (\\"stability\\") paths, there were no significant cross-lag 'causal' paths between earlier interpretational style and later loneliness. Between Time 2 and 3, we demonstrated a significant cross-lag 'consequential' path between earlier loneliness and later threatening interpretations of social situations, but this became non-significant after controlling for concurrent anxiety and depression.

METHODS: An online questionnaire was developed according to the Italian validated COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) and addressed to the general population (GP). A similar questionnaire, augmented with CF specific questions, targeted pwCFs. The two web-based surveys were accessible for some weeks during the lockdown mandated by the Italian government. RESULTS: The CF questionnaire was completed by 712 adult pwCFs (422 females), matched for sex and age with a 1/5 ratio to GP questionnaire respondents. Mild or medium distress affected 40.2% of pwCFs and 43.9% of GP controls, severe distress 5.3% of pwCFs and 6.2% of GP controls. The level of psychological distress was not correlated with the degree of pulmonary function impairment. When symptoms of anxiety and depression, and physical manifestations were independently analyzed, the control group featured a 55% higher level of mild-moderate anxiety symptoms. Signs of psychological distress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and physical manifestations were significantly more frequent in female pwCFs compared to males, similarly to GP. CONCLUSION: Adult pwCFs seem to have equal, and in some domains, lower levels of psychological distress than GP controls. This might be sustained by lifelong experiences in coping with the demands of their chronic disease. These results may orient future psychological interventions.","output":"Psychological distress in adults with and without cystic fibrosis during the COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rapid development of Internet technology and the continuous advancement of medical informatization, big data in healthcare has gradually become an important resource to innovate health management and meet the growing health needs of people and the application of big data in healthcare has been one of the indispensable parts of national big data strategy in China.

This study aimed to establish the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 three months after the first case was reported. Methods Between June 10th and July 1st, a cross-sectional design was carried out on people over 14 years old, selected from a probabilistic sample of households. A finger prick sample was tested by ELISA to detect IgG-class antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Multilevel model was applied to understand sector, household and individual conditions associated with seroconvert. Results Prevalence based on IgG was 53.4% (95%IC 52.8% to 54.1%). Among the IgG positive cases, 15% reported having compatible symptoms at some point in the past two months. There is evidence of within-household clustering effect (rho=0.52; 95% IC 0.36-0.67); living with a PCR-confirmed case doubled the chance of being SARS-CoV2 IgG positive (OR 2.13; 95% IC 1.17-3.85). The highest risk of infection was found in one of the most deprived areas of the slum, the Bajo autopista sector. Discussion High seroprevalence is shown, for each symptomatic RT-qPCR-confirmed diagnosis, 9 people were IgG positive, indicating a high rate of undetected (probable asymptomatic) infections. Given that transmission among family members is a leading driver of the disease\`s spread, it is unsurprising that crowded housing situations in slums are directly associated with higher risk of infection and consequently high seroprevalence levels.

However, ongoing physical side-effects and psychosocial concerns can compromise quality of life (QoL). Patients and physicians increasingly look to the internet and other technologies to address diverse supportive needs encountered across this evolving cancer trajectory. OBJECTIVES 1. To examine the features and delivery of web and technological interventions supporting patients with advanced cancer. 2. To explore their efficacy relating to QoL and psychosocial well-being. METHODS Relevant studies were identified through electronic database searches (MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Web of Science and ProQuest) and handsearching. Findings were collated and explored through narrative synthesis. RESULTS Of 5274 identified records, 37 articles were included. Interventions were evaluated within studies targeting advanced cancer (13) or encompassing all stages (24). Five subtypes emerged: Interactive Health Communication Applications (n=12), virtual programmes of support (n=11), symptom monitoring tools (n=8), communication conduits (n=3) and information websites (n=3). Modes of delivery ranged from self-management to clinically integrated. Support largely targeted psychosocial well-being, alongside symptom management and healthy living. Most studies (78%) evidenced varying degrees of efficacy through QoL and psychosocial measures. Intervention complexity made it challenging to distinguish the most effective components. Incomplete reporting limited risk of bias assessment. CONCLUSION While complex and varied in their content, features and delivery, most interventions led to improvements in QoL or psychosocial well-being across the cancer trajectory. Ongoing development and evaluation of such innovations should specifically target patients requiring longer-term support for later-stage cancer.

There have been 80 published cases of OHT recipients with COVID-19 infection to date, and they show a higher incidence of infection and greater mortality (26-41%) than that observed in the general population. Remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, decreases median recovery time from infection in the general population, but was not used in any OHT patients. We sought to determine the effectiveness of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 in OHT recipients. Methods Out of 400 OHT patients followed at UCSD, 1.8% (n=7) have tested positive for COVID-19. Four of these patients were treated with remdesivir. Three patients with milder symptoms did not require treatment. Results OHT recipients with COVID-19 infection were a median 55 years of age (range 28-62 years), 71% (5/7) were male, and they were a median of 3 years post-transplant (range 2-5 years). All patients were taking tacrolimus, 85% (6/7) were also taking mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or 14% (1/7) were taking mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. All patients had positive nasopharyngeal COVID-19 PCR and were admitted for observation. MMF and mTOR inhibitors were held on admission while tacrolimus was continued. Four patients (57%) developed hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen or had pulmonary infiltrates on chest x ray and were treated with remdesivir. Patients received an intravenous (IV) infusion of 200 mg loading dose followed by 100 mg IV daily over 4 days (total 5 doses). Two patients were also treated with IV antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia (n=1) or urinary tract infection (n=1). Three of the four patients treated with remdesivir had complete resolution of fevers, hypoxia and symptoms after a 5-day course. The fourth patient had continued hypoxia requiring supplemental O2 therapy and received an additional 5 days of remdesivir 100 mg IV daily (10-day total course) with subsequent resolution of symptoms. No patients were intubated or admitted to intensive care and all 7 patients survived to hospital discharge and had negative COVID-19 PCR at outpatient follow up.

The host serine protease TMPRSS2 and cysteine proteases Cathepsin B/L can activate S, making two independent entry pathways accessible to SARS-CoV-2. Blocking the proteases prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro. This blockade may be achieved in vivo through 'repurposing' drugs, a potential treatment option for COVID-19 that is now in clinical trials. Here, we found, surprisingly, that drugs targeting the two pathways, although independent, could display strong synergy in blocking virus entry. We predicted this synergy first using a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 entry and dynamics in vitro. The model considered the two pathways explicitly, let the entry efficiency through a pathway depend on the corresponding protease expression level, which varied across cells, and let inhibitors compromise the efficiency in a dose-dependent manner. The synergy predicted was novel and arose from effects of the drugs at both the single cell and the cell population levels. Validating our predictions, available in vitro data on SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV entry displayed this synergy. Further, analysing the data using our model, we estimated the relative usage of the two pathways and found it to vary widely across cell lines, suggesting that targeting both pathways in vivo may be important and synergistic given the broad tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2.

Many viruses integrate their sequences into the genome of their host for replication. These processes may lead to the virus acquisition of host sequences. Such sequences are prone to accumulation of mutations and deletions. However, in rare instances, sequences acquired from a host become beneficial for the virus. We searched for unexpected sequence similarity among the 900,000 viral proteins and all proteins from cellular organisms. Here, we focus on viruses that infect metazoa. The high-conservation analysis yielded 187 instances of highly similar viral-host sequences. Only a small number of them represent viruses that hijacked host sequences. The low-conservation sequence analysis utilizes the Pfam family collection. About 5% of the 12,000 statistical models archived in Pfam are composed of viral-metazoan proteins. In about half of Pfam families, we provide indirect support for the directionality from the host to the virus. The other families are either wrongly annotated or reflect an extensive sequence exchange between the viruses and their hosts. In about 75% of cross-taxa Pfam families, the viral proteins are significantly shorter than their metazoan counterparts. The tendency for shorter viral proteins relative to their related host proteins accounts for the acquisition of only a fragment of the host gene, the elimination of an internal domain and shortening of the linkers between domains. We conclude that, along viral evolution, the host-originated sequences accommodate simplified domain compositions. We postulate that the trimmed proteins act by interfering with the fundamental function of the host including intracellular signaling, post-translational modification, protein-protein interaction networks and cellular trafficking. We compiled a collection of hijacked protein sequences.

Meanwhile the possible efficient targets COVID-19 acts on were identified via Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, DisGeNET database and GeneCards database. In addition, functions, components and pathways were identified by Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. Protein interaction, ingredients-targets network was established. Results: Our findings showed that numerous ingredients of Jingyin granule could act on COVID-19 with 88 target genes. GO enrichment analysis, KEGG pathway analysis, and protein-protein interaction network revealed that these targets were interrelated with regulation of immune function, directly targeting disease genes. Conclusions: Jingyin granule could be utilized to exert systematic pharmacological effects. Jingyin granule could directly target the major genes, and also regulate the immune system, acting as oblique disease treatment.","output":"Systematic elucidation of the mechanism of Jingyin granule in the treatment of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia via Network Pharmacology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms among people living with HIV (PLWH) are not well described. SETTING Longitudinal survey within the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) of PLWH compared with similar HIV-seronegative (SN) individuals. METHODS Telephone-administered survey of MWCCS participants at 13 clinical research sites across the United States addressing COVID-19 symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 testing, and pandemic impact on social distancing and antiretroviral therapy (ART) use. Primary data collection occurred during May (wave 1), June-July (wave 2), and August-September, 2020 (wave 3). RESULTS One-third of MWCCS participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection; 10% was tested 2 times. Similar proportions of PLWH and SN participants were tested, but SARS-CoV-2 positivity was higher among PLWH than among SN individuals (9.4% vs 4.8%, P = 0.003). Odds of SARS-CoV-2 positivity remained higher among PLWH after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and study site (adjusted odds ratio = 2.0, 95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 3.2). SARS-CoV-2 positivity was not associated with CD4 cell counts among PLWH. Among SARS-CoV-2 positive participants, 9% had no symptoms, 7% had 1-2 mild symptoms, and 84% had 3 symptoms. Most of the (98%) participants reported physical distancing during all survey waves; self-reported ART adherence among PLWH was not adversely affected during the pandemic compared with the previous year (similar adherence in 89% of participants, improved in 9% of participants, and decreased in 2% of participants). CONCLUSIONS Despite similar SARS-CoV-2 testing and physical distancing profiles by HIV serostatus among MWCCS participants, PLWH who reported SARS-CoV-2 testing were more likely to have a positive test result. Additional studies are needed to determine whether and why PLWH are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among People Living With HIV Compared With People Without HIV: Survey Results From the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food scarcity, population growth, and global climate change have propelled crop yield growth driven by high-throughput phenotyping into the era of big data. However, access to large-scale phenotypic data has now become a critical barrier that phenomics urgently must overcome. Fortunately, the high-throughput plant phenotyping platform (HT3P), employing advanced sensors and data collection systems, can take full advantage of non-destructive and high-throughput methods to monitor, quantify, and evaluate specific phenotypes for large-scale agricultural experiments, and it can effectively perform phenotypic tasks that traditional phenotyping could not do. In this way, HT3Ps are novel and powerful tools, for which various commercial, customized, and even self-developed ones have been recently introduced in rising numbers. Here, we review these HT3Ps in nearly 7 years from greenhouses and growth chambers to the field, and from ground-based proximal phenotyping to aerial large-scale remote sensing. Platform configurations, novelties, operating modes, current developments, as well the strengths and weaknesses of diverse types of HT3Ps are thoroughly and clearly described. Then, miscellaneous combinations of HT3Ps for comparative validation and comprehensive analysis are systematically present, for the first time. Finally, we consider current phenotypic challenges and provide fresh perspectives on future development trends of HT3Ps. This review aims to provide ideas, thoughts, and insights for the optimal selection, exploitation, and utilization of HT3Ps, and thereby pave the way to break through current phenotyping bottlenecks in botany.","output":"High-Throughput Plant Phenotyping Platform (HT3P) as a Novel Tool for Estimating Agronomic Traits From the Lab to the Field"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Energy resources are vital for the economic development of any nation, and they are currently recognised as an essential commodity for human beings Many countries are facing various levels up to severe energy crisis due to limited natural resources, coupled with the Covid-19 pandemic This crisis can lead to the shutdown or restriction of many industrial units, limited energy access, exacerbating unemployment, simultaneous impacts on people's lives The main reason for these problems is the increasing gap between energy supply and demand, logistics, financial issues, as well as ineffective strategic planning issues Different countries have different visions, missions, and strategies for energy management Integrated strategic management is requisite for managing global energy This study aims to develop a strategic management framework that can be used as a methodology for policymakers to analyse, plan, implement, and evaluate the energy strategy globally A conceptual research method that relies on examining the related literature is applied to develop the framework The present study yielded two main observations: 1) The identification of key concepts to consider in designing the strategic management framework for global energy, and 2) A strategic management framework that integrates the scope, process, important components, and steps to manage global energy strategies This framework would contribute to providing a standard procedure to manage energy strategies for policymakers at the global, regional, national, state, city, district, and sector levels","output":"Covid-19 shock: Development of strategic management framework for global energy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have great difficulties in social interaction and in the management of personal and other peoples emotions.

DESIGN: Matched pairs analysis of nursing homes that had their initial vaccine clinics between December 18, 2020, and January 2, 2021, versus between January 3, 2021, and January 18, 2021. Matched facilities had their initial vaccine clinics between 12 and 16 days apart. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and eighty nursing homes in 21 states owned and operated by the largest long-term care provider in the United States. MEASUREMENTS: Incident SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100 at-risk residents per week; hospital transfers and/or deaths per 100 residents with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection per day, averaged over a week. RESULTS: The early vaccinated group included 136 facilities with 12,157 residents; the late vaccinated group included 144 facilities with 13,221 residents. After 1 week, early vaccinated facilities had a predicted 2.5 fewer incident SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100 at-risk residents per week (95% CI: 1.2-4.0) compared with what would have been expected based on the experience of the late vaccinated facilities. The rates remained significantly lower for several weeks. Cumulatively over 5 weeks, the predicted reduction in new infections was 5.2 cases per 100 at-risk residents (95% CI: 3.2-7.3).

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between prehospitalization immunosuppressants use (exposure) and COVID-19 patient outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using a nationwide healthcare claims database of South Korea as of May 15, 2020. Confirmed COVID-19 infection in hospitalized individuals aged 40 years or older were included for analysis. We defined exposure variable by using inpatient and outpatient prescription records of immunosuppressants from the database. Our primary endpoint was a composite endpoint of all-cause death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation use. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted logistic regression analyses were used, to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), comparing immunosuppressants users and non-users. RESULTS: We identified 4,349 patients, for which 1,356 were immunosuppressants users and 2,993 were non-users. Patients who used immunosuppressants were at increased odds of the primary endpoint of all-cause death, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation use (IPTW OR =1.32; 95% CI: 1.06-1.63), driven by higher odds of all-cause mortality (IPTW OR =1.63; 95% CI: 1.21-2.26).

METHODS: We enrolled 80 patients with pertussis who were hospitalized in Shenzhen Childrens Hospital from January 2017 to December 2019. Respiratory tract samples were tested for B. pertussis with real-time polymerase chain reaction and respiratory viruses with immunofluorescence assay. Clinical data were obtained from hospital records and collected using a structured questionnaire.

No significant differences were found with regard to sex, body weight, preterm birth history, pertussis vaccination, symptoms, presence of pneumonia, or lymphocyte count between the 2 groups. Univariate analysis showed patients with RSV coinfection were older (median, 4.57 months vs 4.03 months, p = 0.048); more commonly treated with -lactam antibiotics (21% vs 5%, p = 0.044); had higher rates of wheezes (40% vs 14%, p = 0.009) and rales (35% vs 14%, p = 0.028) on chest auscultation, a higher rate of readmission (40% vs 11%, p = 0.004), and a longer hospital stay (median, 10 days vs 7 days, p = 0.002).

These individuals and organisations previously set health priorities for WHO, either through its regular budget or extra-budgetary funds. We asked what insights can be gained as to their priorities from previous decisions within the context of WHO. Methods We compared the WHO biennial budgetary allocations with the burden of disease from 1994C95 to 2008C09. We obtained data from publicly available WHO sources and examined whether WHO allocations varied with the burden of disease (defined by death and disability-adjusted life years) by comparing two WHO regionsWestern Pacific and Africathat are at differing stages of epidemiological transition. We further assessed whether the allocations differed on the basis of the source of funds (assessed and voluntary contributions) and the mechanism for deciding how funds were spent. Findings We noted that WHO budget allocations were heavily skewed toward infectious diseases. In 2006C07, WHO allocated 87% of its total budget to infectious diseases, 12% to non-communicable diseases, and less than 1% to injuries and violence. We recorded a similar distribution of funding in Africa, where nearly three-quarters of mortality is from infectious disease, and in Western Pacific, where three-quarters of mortality is from non-communicable disease. In both regions, injuries received only 1% of total resources. The skew towards infectious diseases was substantially greater for the WHO extra-budget, which is allocated by donors and has risen greatly in recent years, than for the WHO regular budget, which is decided on by member states through democratic mechanisms and has been held at zero nominal growth. Interpretation Decision makers at Bamako should consider the implications of the present misalignment of global health priorities and disease burden for health research worldwide. Funds allocated by external donors substantially differ from those allocated by WHO member states. The meeting at Bamako provides an opportunity to consider how this disparity might be addressed.

At the INT, in Naples, only the BNT162b2 / Pfizer vaccine has been administered to cancer patients and healthcare professionals aged 16 and over.In the present study, the antibody response levels and their decline were monitored in an interval of 6-9 months after vaccine administration in the two different cohorts of workers of the INT - IRCCS \\"Fondazione Pascale\\" Cancer Center (Naples, Italy): the group of individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccinated with a single dose;and that of individuals negative for previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated with two doses 21 days apart. Methods: : Specific anti-RBD (receptor-binding domain) titers against trimeric spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 by Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S ECLIA immunoassay were determined in serum samples of 27 healthcare workers with a previously documented history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 123 healthcare workers without, during antibody titers monitoring. Moreover, geometric mean titers (GMT) and relative fold changes (FC) were calculated. Results: : Bimodal titer decline was observed in both previously infected and uninfected SARS-CoV-2 subjects. A first rapid decline was followed by a progressive slow decline in the 6/9 month-period before the further vaccine boost. The trend was explained by 2 different mathematical models, exponential and power function, the latter revealing as predictive of antibody titer decline either in infected or in not previously infected ones. The value of the prolonged lower vaccine titer was about 1 log below in the 6/9-month interval after the single dose for previously infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2 and the two doses for those not previously infected. The titer change, after the boost dose administration, on the other hand, was  1.5 FC higher than the titers at the 6/9-month time-points in both cohorts. A similar quantitative immune titer was observed in both cohorts 8 days after the last boost dose. The subsequent immunoresponse trend remains to be verified. Discussion: The results show that a very rapid first decline, from the highest antibody peak, was followed by a very slow decline which ensured immune protection lasting more than six months. The apparent absence of adverse effects of the rapid decline on the vaccine's immune protective role has been related to a large majority of low avidity antibodies induced by current vaccines. High avidity antibodies with prolonged anti-transmission efficacy show a longer half-life and are lost over a longer interval period. The cellular immunity, capable of preventing severe clinical diseases, lasts much longer. The unbalanced dual activity (cellular vs humoral) while effective in limiting ICU pressure and overall mortality, does not protect against transmission of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in high circulation of the virus among unvaccinated subjects, including the younger population, and the continuous production of variants characterized by changes in transmissibility and pathogenicity. The high mutation rate, peculiar to the RNA virus, can however lead to a dual opposite results: selection of defective and less efficient viruses up to extinction;risk of more efficiently transmitted variants as the current omicron pandemic. Conclusions: : In conclusion the current bimodal antibody-titer decline, following BNT162b2 mRNA anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, needs a further extended analysis to verify the protective borderline levels of immunity and the optimal administration schedule of vaccine boosters. Our current results can contribute to such goal, besides a direct comparison of other FDA-approved and candidate vacci es.","output":"Bimodal Antibody-Titer Decline Following BNT162b2 Mrna Anti-SARS-Cov-2 Vaccination In Healthcare Workers of The INT C IRCCS Fondazione Pascale Cancer Center (Naples, Italy) (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to symbolic self completion theory, individuals strive for their aspired-to identity goals by accumulating symbols that indicate the possession of that very identity. If individuals lack such symbols, lose them, or fail to acquire them, a state of identity goal incompleteness is triggered that motivates identity goal-directed behavior (i.e., acquiring new identity symbols). We add to this framework an empirical investigation of the interplay between two identity goals, addressing the question: Will individuals who are incomplete regarding one identity goal be more or less likely to engage in symbolization behavior toward a second identity goal if no opportunity to strive for the first (incomplete) identity goal is at hand? We identify in two experiments the overlap between the two identity goals as a moderator variable determining to what degree individuals who are incomplete in one identity goal engage in behavior related to the other identity goal.

This food constitutes the food traditions of local populations in many countries of the world. SF characterizes a large number of cities around the world, from New York to Paris, from Palermo to cities of North Africa, China, India and Japan. SF is inexpensive and prepared following traditional methods that meet local consumer preferences, culinary culture and lifestyles. Moreover, SF allows a unique experience for tourists who also want to experience a destination through traditional food consumed on the street together with the locals. Nevertheless, SF is linked to several health hazards. Hence, several studies discussed on the compliance with hygiene and food quality requirements that SF vendors should guarantee, to ensure human health. So far, there is no bibliometric review attempting to provide an objective and comprehensive analysis of the existing scientific documents that simultaneously study the scientific topic of SF linked to that of Food Safety (FS). Therefore, the objective of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework of the interactions between studies on SF and FS topics, in order to discover if the combined topic of Street Food Safety (SFS) was investigated as a topic in its own right. A bibliometric analysis was carried out analyzing 276 scientific contributions from the last 21 years, indexed in the Elsevier Scopus database and in the Clarivate Web of Science database. The results showed a very strong interaction between the two topics and many others in several scientific sectors; In particular, the topic of SFS involves many disciplines of social sciences. The results highlight that the scientific topic of SFS exists but not consciously, and it is believed that the research interest in this topic can grow considerably in the coming years, also because of the current COVID-19 pandemic situation that we are experiencing.","output":"Interactions between Street Food and Food Safety Topics in the Scientific LiteratureA Bibliometric Analysis with Science Mapping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present an approach to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 virus types based on their RNA sequence descriptions avoiding a sequence alignment. For that purpose, sequences are preprocessed by feature extraction and the resulting feature vectors are analyzed by prototype-based classification to remain interpretable. In particular, we propose to use variants of learning vector quantization (LVQ) based on dissimilarity measures for RNA sequence data. The respective matrix LVQ provides additional knowledge about the classification decisions like discriminant feature correlations and, additionally, can be equipped with easy to realize reject options for uncertain data. Those options provide self-controlled evidence, i.e., the model refuses to make a classification decision if the model evidence for the presented data is not sufficient. This model is first trained using a GISAID dataset with given virus types detected according to the molecular differences in coronavirus populations by phylogenetic tree clustering. In a second step, we apply the trained model to another but unlabeled SARS-CoV-2 virus dataset. For these data, we can either assign a virus type to the sequences or reject atypical samples. Those rejected sequences allow to speculate about new virus types with respect to nucleotide base mutations in the viral sequences. Moreover, this rejection analysis improves model robustness. Last but not least, the presented approach has lower computational complexity compared to methods based on (multiple) sequence alignment.

They are required to achieve competencies and undergo refresher courses. 1This training course was designed to provide teaching to fulfil the requirements of continuous professional development and improve midwife confidence in epidural management. Methods: A training course, delivered by anaesthetists, consisting of short PowerPoint presentations and panel-based discussion was devised with reference to the Royal College of Midwives curriculum.2 Because of restrictions imposed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the programme was delivered on a virtual platform to midwives who were invited from all London NHS Trusts. A pre-course questionnaire was distributed focusing particularly on levels of confidence in the following aspects of epidural management: consent, administration of drugs and epidural maintenance, assessment of sensory and motor block and troubleshooting a suboptimal block. Two half-day sessions were delivered and delegates completed a post-course questionnaire to evaluate the effectiveness of this teaching programme. Results: A total of 304 midwives signed up from over 30 London NHS trusts, with 175 delegates able to attend. Delegates comprised of students (14%), band 5 (14%), band 6 (52%) and band 7C8 (20%) midwives. The breadth of experience with epidural anaesthesia ranged from less than 1 year to more than 10 years, with only half of the delegates previously receiving formal training. Improvements in confidence in all four aspects of epidural management are demonstrated in the figure. 97% thought this course was beneficial and 90% agreed that it was well delivered through a virtual platform. [Formula presented] Figure. Percentage of midwives who agreed or strongly agreed they were comfortable with these aspects of epidural management, pre-course (n=264) and post-course (n=149).

Second, how families impact health during the COVID-19 pandemic is conditional on public policies, organizational decisions, and concurrent events. Third, many health inequalities driven by racism, sexism, classism, and other oppressive societal force are amplified during COVID-19, but the extent to which this is occurring is shaped by families and by the public policies, organizational decisions, and concurrent events that also impact families and health.

On day 26, the blood was taken from the immunized mice to analyze IgG titer, whereas the splenocytes were used to analyze the lymphocyte proliferation and the level of cytokines. In order to assess the memory immune response, mice were given a booster dose after 150 days of the last immunization. Results The higher levels of MERS-CoV-PLpro-specific antibody titer, IgG2a and lymphocyte proliferation were noticed in mice immunized with -GalCer-MERS-PLpro-liposomes. Besides, the splenocytes from mice immunized with -GalCer-MERS-PLpro-liposomes produced larger amounts of IFN- as compared to the splenocytes from MERS-PLpro-liposomes or MERS- PLpro-Alum immunized mice. Importantly, an efficient antigen-specific memory immune response was observed in -GalCer-MERS-PLpro-liposomes immunized mice.

This study aims at analyzing the temporal evolution of different Emotion categories: Hesitation, Rage, Sorrow, Anticipation, Faith, and Contentment with Influencing Factors: Vaccine Rollout, Misinformation, Health Effects, and Inequities as lexical categories created from Tweets belonging to five countries with vital vaccine roll-out programs, namely, India, United States of America, Brazil, United Kingdom, and Australia. We extracted a corpus of nearly 1.8 million Twitter posts related to COVID-19 vaccination. Using cosine distance from selected seed words, we expanded the vocabulary of each category and tracked the longitudinal change in their strength from June 2020 to April 2021. We used community detection algorithms to find modules in positive correlation networks. Our findings suggest that tweets expressing hesitancy towards vaccines contain the highest mentions of health-related effects in all countries. Our results indicated that the patterns of hesitancy were variable across geographies and can help us learn targeted interventions. We also observed a significant change in the linear trends of categories like hesitation and contentment before and after approval of vaccines. Negative emotions like rage and sorrow gained the highest importance in the alluvial diagram.

The purpose of this study was to survey surgeons internationally to investigate attitudes regarding peer coaching and to identify any international differences to inform the design of future coaching programs. METHODS: Practicing surgeons in general surgery or related subspecialties were eligible to participate. Invitations to complete the survey were distributed through 13 surgical associations, social media, and personal e-mail invitations. Responses were obtained between June 1st and August 31st, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 521 surveys were collected. The majority of participants practiced in North America (263; 50%) with remaining respondents from Asia (81; 16%), Europe (34;7%), South America (21; 4%), Africa (17; 3%), and Oceania (6; 1%). Duration of practice was equally distributed across 4 intervals (0C5 years; 6C15 years; 16C25 years; > 25 years). Respondents most frequently identified as general surgeons (290; 67%) and 325 (75%) were male. Awareness of peer coaching was reported by 275 (53%) respondents, with 197 (44%) never seeking formal feedback from peers. The majority of respondents (372; 84%) would be willing to participate in a peer coaching program, with monthly interactions the most desirable frequency reported (193; 51%). Coaching in the operating room was preferred by most participants (360; 86%). Few respondents (67; 14%) would accept coaching from someone unknown to them. Participants identified key coaching program elements as: feedback kept private and confidential (267; 63%); opportunity to provide feedback to the coach (247; 59%); personalized goal setting (244; 58%); and the option to choose ones own coach (205; 49%). The most commonly cited potential barrier to participation was logistical constraints (334; 79%). CONCLUSION: This international survey of practicing surgeons demonstrated that peer feedback is rarely used in practice, but there is high interest and acceptance of the peer coaching model for continuous professional development.

The extent to which face masks mitigate the transmission is highly dependent on how well the mask fits each individual. The fit of simple cloth masks on the face, as well as the resulting perimeter leakage and face mask efficacy, are expected to be highly dependent on the type of mask and facial topology. However, this effect has, to date, not been adequately examined and quantified. Here, we propose a framework to study the efficacy of different mask designs based on a quasi-static mechanical model of the deployment of face masks onto a wide range of faces. To illustrate the capabilities of the proposed framework, we explore a simple rectangular cloth mask on a large virtual population of subjects generated from a 3D morphable face model. The effect of weight, age, gender, and height on the mask fit is studied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended homemade cloth mask design was used as a basis for comparison and was found not to be the most effective design for all subjects. We highlight the importance of designing masks accounting for the widely varying population of faces. Metrics based on aerodynamic principles were used to determine that thin, feminine, and young faces were shown to benefit from mask sizes smaller than that recommended by the CDC. Besides mask size, side-edge tuck-in, or pleating, of the masks as a design parameter was also studied and found to have the potential to cause a larger localized gap opening.","output":"One size fits all?: A simulation framework for face-mask fit on population-based faces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meter reading and billing are time-consuming activities for power, water and gas providing boards.

There is a concern that the pandemic will exacerbate the existing disparities in overall healthcare utilization and telehealth utilization. Few national studies have examined the changes in telehealth use during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data on 6.8 and 6.4 million employer-based health plan beneficiaries in 2020 and 2019, respectively, were collected in 2020. Unadjusted rates were compared both before and after the week of the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic as a national emergency. Trends in weekly utilization were also examined using a difference-in-differences regression framework to quantify the changes in telemedicine and office-based care utilization while controlling for the patient's demographic and county-level sociodemographic measures. All analyses were conducted in 2020. RESULTS: More than a 20-fold increase in the incidence of telemedicine utilization after March 13, 2020 was observed. Conversely, the incidence of office-based encounters declined by almost 50% and was not fully offset by the increase in telemedicine. The increase in telemedicine was greatest among patients in counties with low poverty levels (?=31.70, 95% CI=15.17, 48.23), among patients in metropolitan areas (?=40.60, 95% CI=30.86, 50.34), and among adults than among children aged 0-12 years (?=57.91, 95% CI=50.32, 65.49).

We hypothesized that a patients cholinesterase level on admission could predict COVID-19 pneumonia severity and mortality. Methods We retrospectively collected data of 26 COVID-19 pneumonia patients from FebruaryCMay 2020. Outcomes were aggravation of symptoms and in-hospital mortality. We compared receiver operating curves of cholinesterase, C-reactive protein, lymphocytes, albumin, D-dimer, and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and examined prediction accuracy. Regarding the interaction between cholinesterase and other variables, each independent variable was divided into two groups using cutoff values, and interaction terms were created. Results Cholinesterase levels on admission were significantly lower in the severe group than in the mild-to-moderate group (326 vs. 218 IU/L, p = 0.006;area under the curve: 0.81;95% confidence interval 0.61C0.94). When comparing the area under the curve, cholinesterase was comparable to C-reactive protein, albumin, lymphocytes, and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio other than D-dimer in the prediction accuracy of severe cases and mortality. Cholinesterase levels on admission were significantly lower in the death group than in the survival group (274 vs. 187.5 IU/L, p = 0.028;area under the curve: 0.79;95% interval 0.58C0.93). Regarding the interaction between cholinesterase and established predictors, the prediction accuracy of both severity and death was higher when cholinesterase was combined with each predictor than when cholinesterase was used alone.

This study aims to investigate the correlation between the extent of lung infection and relevant clinical laboratory testing indicators in COVID-19 and to analyse its underlying mechanism. METHODS: Chest high-resolution computer tomography (CT) images and laboratory examination data of 31 patients with COVID-19 were extracted, and the lesion areas in CT images were quantitatively segmented and calculated using a deep learning (DL) system. A cross-sectional study method was carried out to explore the differences among the proportions of lung lobe infection and to correlate the percentage of infection (POI) of the whole lung in all patients with clinical laboratory examination values. RESULTS: No significant difference in the proportion of infection was noted among various lung lobes (P > 0.05). The POI of total lung was negatively correlated with the peripheral blood lymphocyte percentage (L%) (r = - 0.633, P < 0.001) and lymphocyte (LY) count (r = - 0.555, P = 0.001) but positively correlated with the neutrophil percentage (N%) (r = 0.565, P = 0.001). Otherwise, the POI was not significantly correlated with the peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) count, monocyte percentage (M%) or haemoglobin (HGB) content.

Understanding the incidence of secondary pulmonary infections and the associated bacterial and fungal microorganisms identified can improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review aims to determine the incidence of secondary bacterial and fungal pulmonary infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and describe the bacterial and fungal microorganisms identified. METHOD: We perform a literature search and select articles with confirmed diagnoses of secondary bacterial and fungal pulmonary infections that occur 48 h after admission, using respiratory tract cultures in hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. We exclude articles involving co-infections defined as infections diagnosed at the time of admission by non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses, bacteria, and fungal microorganisms. RESULTS: The incidence of secondary pulmonary infections is low at 16% (4.8-42.8%) for bacterial infections and lower for fungal infections at 6.3% (0.9-33.3%) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Secondary pulmonary infections are predominantly seen in critically ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The most common bacterial microorganisms identified in the respiratory tract cultures are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common microorganism identified to cause secondary fungal pulmonary infections. Other rare opportunistic infection reported such as PJP is mostly confined to small case series and case reports.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the significance of occupational injuries in healthcare professionals was revealed once again. To assess the occupational injuries, we compared rates, distribution and type of exposure to blood and body fluids and NSSIs of health care workers for 2019 (pre-pandemic era) and 2020 (pandemic era) years, respectively. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study included data collected by the Hospital Infection Control Committee for the years 2019C2020. Data collected using the active surveillance method were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: During 2019 (pre-pandemic period) and 2020 (pandemic period), 112 (27.65%(0)) and 82 (21.4%(0)) NSSIs reported, respectively. Of the exposed HCWs in 2019 (pre-pandemic period), 16.8%(0) (14) were doctor, 53.6%(0) (60) were nurse and 47.4%(0) (14) were intern doctors. In the 2020 (pandemic period), NSSIs were observed most frequently in nurses and cleaning staff, 50.24%(0) and 33.64%(0), respectively. Concerning the total percentage of exposure to blood and other body fluids, a slight increase was revealed from 1.48%(0) to 2.62%(0) in 2019 and 2020, respectively. A significant decrease in exposure rate was reported among the doctors between the pre-pandemic and pandemic era; 3.6%(0) and 1.19%(0) at 2019 and 2020, respectively. A significant increase in exposure rate was reported among the nurses between pre-pandemic and pandemic era; 0.8%(0) and 6.89%(0), respectively. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the exposure to NSSIs during the pandemic period decreased; however, there was no severe difference at pre-pandemic and pandemic periods concerning exposure to blood and body fluids. Well-designed training and awareness programs can be effective in preventing exposure to NSSIs and blood and other body fluids and exposure to respiratory acquired viruses.","output":"What were the changes during the COVID-19 pandemic era concerning occupational risks among health care workers?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current prophylactic and therapeutic strategies targeting human influenza viruses include vaccines and antivirals.

At 24 hours post-infection, 623 host genes were significantly upregulated, including the cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1. H5N1 virus infection stimulated significantly higher CEACAM1 protein expression when compared to influenza A PR8 (H1N1) virus, suggesting a key role for CEACAM1 in influenza virus pathogenicity. Furthermore, silencing of endogenous CEACAM1 resulted in reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production, as well as reduced levels of virus replication following H5N1 infection. Our study provides evidence for the involvement of CEACAM1 in a clinically relevant model of H5N1 infection and may assist in the development of host-oriented antiviral strategies.","output":"Deep sequencing of primary human lung epithelial cells challenged with H5N1 influenza virus reveals a proviral role for CEACAM1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the value of inflammatory factors procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the early diagnosis and evaluation of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).

The levels of PCT, IL-6, and CRP were measured and statistically analyzed to determine the differences between the two groups. The differences in the COVID-19 group were analyzed after subgrouping into the ordinary type, severe type, and critical type. RESULTS: The PCT and CRP levels in the COVID-19 group were statistically lower than those in the CAP group (p < 0.05), but IL-6 was not statistically different between the two groups (p > 0.05). Statistically significant differences existed in IL-6 and CRP when comparing the COVID-19 subgroups of the critical type, severe type, and ordinary type (p < 0.05). However, there was no clinical meaning in the evaluation of the difference in PCT levels among the three subgroups with COVID-19.

We assessed brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in 27 COVID-19 patients needing conventional or intensive care unit hospitalization, three months after SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis and in nine age- and sex- matched control subjects. Interestingly, the FMD was lower in COVID-19 patients as compared to controls (8.2 (7.2C8.9) vs. 10.3 (9.1C11.7)); p = 0.002, and half of the hospitalized COVID-19 survivors presented with a reduced FMD < 8% at three months of COVID-19 onset. Impaired FMD was not associated with severe or critical SARS-CoV-2 infection, reflected by ICU hospitalization, total hospitalization duration, or severity of lung damage. In conclusion, reduced FMD is often observed even three months after hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but such alteration predominantly appears to not be related to COVID-19 severity. Longer and larger follow-up studies will help to clarify the potential prognosis value of FMD among COVID-19 patients, as well as to further determine the mechanisms involved.","output":"Reduced Flow-Mediated Dilatation Is Not Related to COVID-19 Severity Three Months after Hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Though considerable efforts have been made to improve the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the prognosis of patients has remained poor. Identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in EOC progression and exploiting them as novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets is of great value. METHODS: Overlapping DEGs were screened out from three independent gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets and were subjected to Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. The protein-protein interactions (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed based on the STRING database. The expression of hub genes was validated in GEPIA and GEO. The relationship of hub genes expression with tumor stage and overall survival and progression-free survival of EOC patients was investigated using the cancer genome atlas data. RESULTS: A total of 306 DEGs were identified, including 265 up-regulated and 41 down-regulated. Through PPI network analysis, the top 20 genes were screened out, among which 4 hub genes, which were not researched in depth so far, were selected after literature retrieval, including CDC45, CDCA5, KIF4A, ESPL1. The four genes were up-regulated in EOC tissues compared with normal tissues, but their expression decreased gradually with the continuous progression of EOC. Survival curves illustrated that patients with a lower level of CDCA5 and ESPL1 had better overall survival and progression-free survival statistically.

A significant challenge inthe repair these injuries is to resolve the restriction of prolapsed orbital soft tissue without inducing iatrogenic impingementat the time of implant placement. Forced duction testing, consisting of grasping the conjunctiva with forceps and manuallymanipulating the globe, is the current gold standard for assessing mechanical restriction of eye movement. However, forcedductions result in binary designations of positive or negative, as determined by an individual surgeon's subjectiveperception, which is highly variable and experience-dependent. Here, we present a device to determine quantitative and reproducible measurements of orbital compliance and orbital soft tissue restriction. Method: The device consists of stacked rotational and horizontal translational piezoelectric motor stages, attached to avertical translational motor stage via a load cell that senses vertical resistance ([ Fig. 1 ]). The horizontal translational stageis coupled to a load cell that senses horizontal resistance, with a custom 3D-printed rail and shuttle interface system thatcreates a curvilinear motion for appropriate globe manipulation. The ocular surface is engaged via vacuum-assisted suction([ Fig. 2 ]). The apparatus is mounted on a locking gooseneck arm that can be fastened to the operating table, allowing quickintraoperative positioning, neutralizing recoil force from motor motion, and eliminating user movement interference. Inaddition, we have devised a component for sensing resistance to cyclotorsion ([ Fig. 3 ]), to be affixed between the rotational and horizontal translational motor stages. We designed the device to automate scanning of resistance to translation alongeach orbit clock hour, of force applied normal to the ocular surface, and of globe torque;this enables rapid mapping of softtissue resistance and range of motion with respect to translation, cyclotorsion, and retropulsion. [ Fig. 4 ] depicts a proposedcolor-coded system for visualizing data on translational range of motion and resistance. Results: We had performed cadaveric testing of a previous handheld iteration of the device, consisting of stackedtranslational and rotational motor stages. We demonstrated the feasibility of manipulating the globe through the suctionmechanism and the ability of the load cell to measure resistance to translational force, distinguishing the entrapped state ina cadaveric fracture model. The need to gauge soft-tissue resistance across greater ranges of motion, and to remove usererror stemming from the handheld operation of the previous iteration, led to the creation of the present version. Though wehave constructed a fully functioning prototype, cadaveric and animal testing have not been performed due to COVID-19restrictions. Conclusion: Our device allows for the quantitative characterization of all extraocular muscles and resistance to retropulsion,which can assist in the evaluation not only of soft tissue entrapment secondary to orbital fractures, but also otherpathologies involving mechanical restriction of ocular motion including thyroid eye disease, orbital tumors, and iatrogenicinjury.

COVID-19 marks the emergence of the third large-scale epidemic related to the coronavirus, after SARS-CoV in 2002 and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV) in 2012. The pandemic has had a harmful effect on the public mental health, especially on depression. Increasing systematic reviews (SRs) of coronavirus were focusing on depression. However, the methodological quality of these SRs is unclear. Therefore, to evaluate and compare the normativity of report of SR, we conducted a comprehensive overview of depression during the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 pandemics. METHODS: Two independent reviewers will conduct comprehensively searches in PubMed, EMBASE.com, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Chinese biomedical literature database (CBM), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan fang Database, Chongqing VIP (CQVIP). Reference lists of articles, gray literature, and conference proceedings will also be searched.

Respiratory virus (RV) has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis. OBJECTIVE: We studied the relation between RV DNA/RNA detection in the upper/lower airways before HCT and the occurrence of allo-LSs. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all HCT recipients between 2004 and 2014, in whom real-time PCR for RV was performed in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid before HCT. The main outcome of interest was the presence of an allo-LS, which was defined as idiopathic pneumonia syndrome or bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Other outcomes were overall survival and treatment-related mortality. We used Cox proportional hazard models, logistic regression models, and Fine-Gray competing risk regression for analyses. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-nine children (median age, 6.8 years) were included. RVs were found in 61% (41% in BAL fluid/NPAs and 20% in NPAs only). Rhinovirus was the most frequently detected RV (42%). Allo-LSs occurred in 13%. RV positivity in BAL fluid was a predictor for allo-LSs (hazard ratio, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.4-10.7; P = .01), whereas RV positivity in NPAs only was not. No other predictors were found. Grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease related to steroid treatment shows a trend toward a protective effect (odds ratio, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.0-1.3; P = .08). Allo-LSs significantly increased treatment-related mortality (52%  10% in allo-LSs and 20%  4% in nonCallo-LSs, P = .007).

Fully immersive virtual reality (VR) is a hardware device on which an active video game can run. Active (video games in) VR (AVR), might increase immersion, game engagement, and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), thereby yielding greater exercise-related benefits, e.g., cognitive performance. METHODS: We examined the induction of MVPA via an AVR and a sedentary VR (SVR) as well as the effects of VR play on cognitive performance, which was monitored using 2 different methods. Each of 29 sedentary college students attended three 20-min laboratory sessions (AVR, SVR, or control) in a randomized order; during the control session, they sat quietly doing nothing. A fully immersive headset was used for the 2 video game sessions. We monitored and computed participants PA using hip-worn accelerometers (wGT3x-bt; ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) and a heart rate band (Polar H7; Polar, Kempele, Finland). After each session, the participants completed a mnemonic similarity test (MST) to measure recognition memory. They also filled out a motion sickness questionnaire and an abbreviated game experience questionnaire. RESULTS: The AVR session induced a significantly greater heart rate and more time spent in MVPA than did either of the other 2 sessions regardless of the PA monitoring method.

Although the exact mechanism of SARS-CoV pathogenesis remains unknown, an intense, ill-regulated local inflammatory response has been suggested as partially responsible for the devastating lung pathology. We investigated the interaction of SARS-CoV with human macrophages (Mphi) and dendritic cells (DC), two key innate immune cells of the host immune system, by focusing on their susceptibility to viral infection and subsequent responses (e.g., phenotypic maturation, T cell-priming activity, phagocytosis, and cytokine production). We found neither cell to be permissive for SARS-CoV replication. However, incubation of Mphi and DC with live, but not gamma irradiation-inactivated, viruses appeared to better sustain their viability. Also, exposure to infectious SARS-CoV led to the phenotypic and functional maturation of DC, with regard to MHC class II and costimulatory molecule expression, T cell-stimulatory capacity, and cytokine production, respectively. Cytokine production was also observed for Mphi, which were refractory to cell surface phenotypic changes. Strikingly, live SARS-CoV could further prime cell types to respond to a suboptimal dose of bacterial LPS (100 ng/ml), resulting in massive release of IL-6 and IL-12. However, the endocytic capacity (e.g., Ag capture) of Mphi was significantly compromised upon exposure to infectious SARS-CoV. This study is the first demonstration that although SARS-CoV does not productively infect human Mphi or DC, it appears to exert differential effects on Mphi and DC maturation and functions, which might contribute to SARS pathogenesis.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome and the innate immune responses: modulation of effector cell function without productive infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHO/UNICEF estimates for HPV vaccination coverage from 2010 to 2019 are analyzed against the backdrop of the 90% coverage target for HPV vaccination by 2030 set in the recently approved global strategy for cervical cancer elimination as a public health problem.

However, in an era in which the survival rates for children with malignancies have increased significantly and several recent reports have demonstrated effective ECMO use in children with cancer, we aimed to estimate the outcome and complications of ECMO treatment in these children. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases for studies on the use ECMO in pediatric patients with an underlying malignancy from inception to September 2020. This review was conducted in adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement. Study eligibility was independently assessed by two authors and disagreements resolved by a third author. Included studies were evaluated for quality using the NewcastleCOttawa Scale (NOS). Random effects meta-analyses (DerSimonian and Laird) were performed. The primary outcomes were mortality during ECMO or hospital mortality. RESULTS: Thirteen retrospective, observational cohort studies were included, most of moderate quality (625 patients). The commonest indication for ECMO was severe respiratory failure (92%). Pooled mortality during ECMO was 55% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47C63%) and pooled hospital mortality was 60% (95% CI 54C67%). Although heterogeneity among the included studies was low, confidence intervals were large. In addition, the majority of the data were derived from registries with overlapping patients which were excluded for the meta-analyses to prevent resampling of the same participants across the included studies. Finally, there was a lack of consistent complications reporting among the studies. CONCLUSION: Significantly higher mortalities than in general PICU patients was reported with the use of ECMO in children with malignancies. Although these results need to be interpreted with caution due to the lack of granular data, they suggest that ECMO appears to represents a viable rescue option for selected patients with underlying malignancies. There is an urgent need for additional data to define patients for whom ECMO may provide benefit or harm.

The goal of this study was to quantify changes in medical care during the first wave of the pandemic using radiological examinations as a comprehensive surrogate marker and to determine potential future workload. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all radiological examinations during the first wave of the pandemic was performed. The number of examinations was compared to time-matched control periods. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of radiological examinations attributed to various medical specialties was conducted and postponed examinations were extrapolated to calculate additional workload in the near future. RESULTS: A total of 596,760 examinations were analyzed. Overall case volumes decreased by an average of 41a??% during the shutdown compared to the control period. The most affected radiological modalities were sonography (-54a??%), X-ray (-47a??%) followed by MRI (-42a??%). The most affected medical specialty was trauma and orthopedics (-60a??% case volume) followed by general surgery (-49a??%). Examination numbers increased during the post-shutdown period leading to a predicted additional workload of up to 22a??%. CONCLUSION: This study shows a marked decrease in radiological examinations in total and among several core medical specialties, indicating a significant reduction in medical care during the first COVID-19 shutdown.

The entire procedure is completed within 50 min and the size of the instrument is small (15 x 34 x 30 cm). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the Smart Gene(?) system for detection of M. pneumoniae and detection of a point mutation at domain V of the 23S rRNA gene of M. pneumoniae. MATERIALS: Pharyngeal swab samples were collected from 154 patients who were suspected of having respiratory tract infections associated with M. pneumoniae. RESULTS: Compared with the results of qPCR, the sensitivity and specificity of the Smart Gene(?) system were 98.7% (78/79) and 100.0% (75/75), respectively. A point mutation at domain V of the 23S rRNA gene was detected from 7 (9.0%) of 78 M. pneumoniae-positive samples by the Smart Gene(?) system and these results were confirmed by direct sequencing. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of clarithromycin among the 5 isolates of M. pneumoniae with a point mutation at domain V of the 23S rRNA gene were >64 g/ml and those among the 33 isolates without a mutation in the 23S rRNA gene were <0.0625 g/ml. CONCLUSION: The Smart Gene(?) system is a rapid and accurate assay for detection of the existence of M. pneumoniae and a point mutation at domain V of the 23S rRNA gene of M. pneumoniae at the same time.

In this review, we analyze selected aspects of the impact of synchrotron radiation on structural biology. Synchrotron beamlines have been used to determine over 70% of all macromolecular structures deposited into the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

Similarly, the median times from the data collection to the deposition and release have not changed significantly. We describe challenges to reproducibility related to recording all relevant data and metadata during the synchrotron experiments, including diffraction images. Finally, we discuss some of the recent opinions suggesting a diminishing importance of X-ray crystallography due to impressive advances in Cryo-EM and theoretical modeling.

It is necessary to understand public knowledge and behaviors if we are to effectively address the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that knowledge about COVID-19 influences participation in different behaviors including self-reports of purchasing more goods than usual, attending large gatherings, and using medical masks. METHODS: This study was funded and approved by the Institutional Review Board on March 17, 2020. The cross-sectional online survey of 1034 US residents aged 18 years or older was conducted on March 17, 2020. RESULTS: For every point increase in knowledge, the odds of participation in purchasing more goods (odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.95), attending large gatherings (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.93), and using medical masks (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.50-0.62) decreased by 12%, 13%, and 44%, respectively.

PATIENT CONCERN A 52-year-old woman, whose airway was unable to visualize with FOB due to massive pulmonary secretion, was presented for bilateral sequential lung transplantation. Extracorporeal membranous oxygenation, tracheostomy, and mechanical ventilation were applied to the patient for 39 days preoperatively as a bridge for lung transplantation. DIAGNOSIS Patient was diagnosed with an idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obesity. INTERVENTION Initially, height-based blind positioning with a conventional double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) failed to ventilate the patient properly, and the confirmation of DLT positioning with FOB was impossible due to massive pulmonary secretion. Therefore, a novel DLT (ANKOR DLT) that has one more cuff, located at a point between the distal opening of the tracheal lumen and the starting point of bronchial cuff, than conventional DLT was used for the lung isolation in the patient.

Our objectives were to estimate the proportions of hypertensive adults who had been diagnosed, took antihypertensive medication, and achieved control in the middle-aged and older Indian population and to investigate the association between access to healthcare and hypertension management. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We designed a nationally representative cohort study of the middle-aged and older Indian population, the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI), and analyzed data from the 2017C2019 baseline wave (N = 72,262) and the 2010 pilot wave (N = 1,683). Hypertension was defined as self-reported physician diagnosis or elevated blood pressure (BP) on measurement, defined as systolic BP  140 mm Hg or diastolic BP  90 mm Hg. Among hypertensive individuals, awareness, treatment, and control were defined based on self-reports of having been diagnosed, taking antihypertensive medication, and not having elevated BP, respectively. The estimated prevalence of hypertension for the Indian population aged 45 years and older was 45.9% (95% CI 45.4%C46.5%). Among hypertensive individuals, 55.7% (95% CI 54.9%C56.5%) had been diagnosed, 38.9% (95% CI 38.1%C39.6%) took antihypertensive medication, and 31.7% (95% CI 31.0%C32.4%) achieved BP control. In multivariable logistic regression models, access to public healthcare was a key predictor of hypertension treatment (odds ratio [OR] = 1.35, 95% CI 1.14C1.60, p = 0.001), especially in the most economically disadvantaged group (OR of the interaction for middle economic status = 0.76, 95% CI 0.61C0.94, p = 0.013; OR of the interaction for high economic status = 0.84, 95% CI 0.68C1.05, p = 0.124). Having health insurance was not associated with improved hypertension awareness among those with low economic status (OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.86C1.07, p = 0.437) and those with middle economic status (OR of the interaction = 1.15, 95% CI 1.00C1.33, p = 0.051), but it was among those with high economic status (OR of the interaction = 1.28, 95% CI 1.10C1.48, p = 0.001). Comparing hypertension awareness, treatment, and control rates in the 4 pilot states, we found statistically significant (p < 0.001) improvement in hypertension management from 2010 to 2017C2019. The limitations of this study include the pilot sample being relatively small and that it recruited from only 4 states. CONCLUSIONS: Although considerable variations in hypertension diagnosis, treatment, and control exist across different sociodemographic groups and geographic areas, reducing uncontrolled hypertension remains a public health priority in India. Access to healthcare is closely tied to both hypertension diagnosis and treatment.","output":"Hypertension awareness, treatment, and control and their association with healthcare access in the middle-aged and older Indian population: A nationwide cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic significantly impacted most countries globally, including Zimbabwe The government of Zimbabwe instituted several strategies to contain the spread of COVID-19 This study explored the challenges and opportunities that emanated from the strategies that were adopted It focused on how the generality of Zimbabwean citizens responded to the government's COVID-19 response and the opportunities arising from the various interventions We adopted a qualitative approach to analyse thirty-four (n=34) tweets responding to government strategies to contain the spread of COVID-19 The study found a lack of confidence in the mechanisms devised by the government, considering the socio-economic context of hyper-inflation and a severely incapacitated public health system The dominant sentiment pointed to a lax in the response by the government, jeorpardising chances of containing the pandemic Most people argued that more resources should have been allocated towards fighting COVID-19 The radical decision to declare a 21-day lockdown was received with mixed feelings Most people criticised the lockdown for failing to consider the status-quo where majority of Zimbabweans survive from hand to mouth due to the informal nature of the economy However, some people acknowledged the merit of putting the country in lockdown mode The tweets re-iterated the need to forge strong and well-coordinated public-private partnerships to generate the much-needed resources to fight COVID-19, given that substantial financial and material support was availed to the government through individuals and the private sector Future studies should explore socio-economic implications of the lockdown on Zimbabweans ? 2020 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd All rights reserved","output":"Lockdown strategies adopted by the zimbabwean government to avert the spread of covid-19: Media responses, challenges and opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2), which causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019), has resulted in a pandemic.

SETTING: An 800-bed tertiary-level teaching hospital in the south of Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Serum was collected for anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG using the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG CMIA qualitative assay, as per the manufacturers specifications. The groups were as follows: (1) HCWs who had real-time PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 infection (>1-month postpositive RT-PCR); (2) HCWs identified as close contacts of persons with COVID-19 infection and who subsequently developed symptoms (virus not detected by RT-PCR on oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab); (3) HCWs identified as close contacts of COVID-19 cases and who remained asymptomatic (not screened by RT-PCR); (4) HCWs not included in the aforementioned groups working in areas determined as high-risk clinical areas; and (5) HCWs not included in the aforementioned groups working in areas determined as low-risk clinical areas.

In the absence of a SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine, the options for control include social distancing, improved hygiene, and face mask use. There is evidence that mask use may decrease the rates of viral transmission. The rate of effective face mask use has not yet been established in Hawai'i. The authors performed an observational study at 2 locations in Honolulu and evaluated outdoor face mask use compliance in 200 people. Simultaneous observations were performed in a downtown Honolulu business area and in Waikiki, an area focusing on tourism.

Glochidia have a unique morphological structure that adapts to parasitic lifestyles and survival. The morphology of the glochidial shells of most Unionoidea, a group of freshwater bivalve mollusks, has been studied in detail using light and scanning electron microscopy. This study summarizes our data on the glochidia shell morphology of the Asian mussel Nodularia douglasiae from two localities in the Primorsky Territory, the Russian Far East. In contrast to the shell morphology of glochidia, little is known about the neurodevelopment of the Unionoidea. Herein, we first demonstrate that the structures of the sensory, muscle, and nervous systems of the glochidia larvae of N. douglasiae differ dramatically from those of the comparable larval systems of marine bivalve species, as revealed through alpha-acetylated tubulin, serotonin (5-HT), and FMRFamide antibodies as well as phalloidin for detection of F-actin and whole-mount confocal microscopy. We found that the glochidia sensory system included four pairs of tubulin-lir multicilia hair cells. Non-ciliar tubulin-lir cells synthesize the neuropeptide FMRFamide and are identified as afferent neurons collecting information from peripheral tubulin-lir hair sensory cells to nervous regulators. The glochidia's muscular system was represented by a smooth adductor, retractors, and minor muscle bundles associated with the shell and visceral organs. The 5-HT-lir larval system is arranged most simply and consists of two immunopositive neurons innervating the adductor. The FMRFamide-lir system is more complicated and consists of several neuronal centers comprising neuronal bodies and their neurites in different areas of the larva. The FMRFamide-lir neurons are closely associated with sensory hair cells, and others, together with 5-HT-lir neurons, may be involved in the anlagen of adult ganglia. Thus, the nervous system of N. douglasiae glochidia is drastically different from other mollusks and lophotrochozoans because of the absence of an apical organ and the location and composition of FMRFamide and 5-HT cells. Morphological, molecular, and behavioral investigations of Unionoidea taxa need to be further conducted to investigate the parasite-host relationship, nerve-dependent regulation of parasite behavior, and evolution of mollusks.","output":"First Immunodetection of Sensory and Nervous Systems of Parasitic Larvae (Glochidia) of Freshwater Bivalve Nodularia douglasiae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human T-cell Immunoglobulin and Mucin-domain containing proteins (TIM1, 3, and 4) specifically bind phosphatidylserine (PS).

Here we show that TIM1 promotes infection of retroviruses and virus-like particles (VLPs) pseudotyped with a range of viral entry proteins, in particular those from the filovirus, flavivirus, New World arenavirus and alphavirus families. TIM1 also robustly enhanced the infection of replication-competent viruses from the same families, including dengue, Tacaribe, Sindbis and Ross River viruses. All interactions between TIM1 and pseudoviruses or VLPs were PS-mediated, as demonstrated with liposome blocking and TIM1 mutagenesis experiments. In addition, other PS-binding proteins, such as Axl and TIM4, promoted infection similarly to TIM1. Finally, the blocking of PS receptors on macrophages inhibited the entry of Ebola VLPs, suggesting that PS receptors can contribute to infection in physiologically relevant cells. Notably, infection mediated by the entry proteins of Lassa fever virus, influenza A virus and SARS coronavirus was largely unaffected by TIM1 expression. Taken together our data show that TIM1 and related PS-binding proteins promote infection of diverse families of enveloped viruses, and may therefore be useful targets for broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.","output":"TIM-family Proteins Promote Infection of Multiple Enveloped Viruses through Virion-associated Phosphatidylserine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is becoming a major hazard to public health worldwide.

The purpose of this study, the first including a large sample of the Spanish general population, was to analyze sexual behavior during the 99 days of confinement in Spain (INSIDE Project). METHOD: One thousand four hundred forty-eight Spanish people, between 18 and 60 years old, were evaluated through an online survey during April 2020. The variables analyzed were the physical and social environment during confinement, sexual desire, type of sexual activity, masturbation, sexual intercourse, online sexual activity, general sexual frequency, sexual fantasies, degree of self-control over sexual drive, sexual abuse, general impact of confinement on sexuality, and emotional mood. RESULTS: Confinement has affected the sexual life of half of the Spanish population (47.7%), especially women. Those who reported a worsening of their sexual life are almost three times more (37.9%) than those who reported an improvement (14.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Different factors have been significant predictors of the positive or negative evaluation about the impact of this confinement on sexual life, such as gender, couple life, privacy, stress level, and the perception of confinement as unbearable.

The most common mutation responsible for the onset of cystic fibrosis (CF), F508del, inhibits the biosynthesis and transport of the protein at PM, and also presents gating and stability defects of the membrane anion channel upon its rescue by the use of correctors and potentiators. This prompted a multiple drug strategy for F508delCFTR aimed simultaneously at its rescue, functional potentiation and PM stabilization. Since ganglioside GM1 is involved in the functional stabilization of transmembrane proteins, we investigated its role as an adjuvant to increase the effectiveness of CFTR modulators. According to our results, we found that GM1 resides in the same PM microenvironment as CFTR. In CF cells, the expression of the mutated channel is accompanied by a decrease in the PM GM1 content. Interestingly, by the exogenous administration of GM1, it becomes a component of the PM, reducing the destabilizing effect of the potentiator VX-770 on rescued CFTR protein expression/function and improving its stabilization. This evidence could represent a starting point for developing innovative therapeutic strategies based on the co-administration of GM1, correctors and potentiators, with the aim of improving F508del CFTR function.","output":"GM1 as Adjuvant of Innovative Therapies for Cystic Fibrosis Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which is known to be mediated by cytotoxic T-cell effectors and dysregulated inflammatory cytokines.

As no vaccine is available for COVID-19, the development of directly acting antiviral agents and preventive strategies have to be considered. Nature provides a huge reservoir of anti-infectious compounds, from which we can deduce innovative ideas, therapies, and products. Anti-adhesive natural products interact with the receptor-mediated recognition and early interaction of viruses with the host cells, leading to a reduced internalisation of the virus and reduced infections (e.g., procyanidin-B-2-di-O-gallate against influenza and herpes virus). Lignans like podophyllotoxin and bicyclol show strong antiviral activities against different viruses, and essential oils can directly interact with viral membranes and reduce the host's inflammatory responses (e.g., 1,8-cineol). Echinacea extracts stimulate the immune system, and bioavailable alkamides are key players by interacting with immunomodulating cannabinoid receptors. COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infections have, in part, successfully been treated in China by preparations from traditional Chinese medicine and, while it is too early to draw conclusions, some promising data are available.

An ageing population and increased comorbidities lead to more complex pharmacological therapies (polypharmacy). The particular picture provided by chronic conditions and polypharmacy can lead to longer hospital stays and a greater need for healthcare. Elderly patients are identified as being in the high-risk group for the development of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) due to the age-related decline of the immune system, known as immunosenescence. Comorbid conditions can often complicate infections, diminishing our ability to treat them effectively. Respiratory tract infections are the most common healthcare-associated infections, followed by urinary tract infections. HAIs in geriatric patients are responsible for longer hospital stays, extended antibiotic therapy, significant mortality, and higher healthcare costs. This is because the microorganisms involved are multidrug-resistant and, therefore, more difficult to eliminate. Moreover, geriatric patients are frequently transferred from one facility (nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, home care, and other specialty clinics) to another or from one hospital ward to another; these transitions cause care fragmentation, which can undermine the effectiveness of treatment and allow pathogens to be transferred from one setting to another and from one person to another. Multifactorial efforts such as early recognition of infections, restricted use of invasive devices, and effective infection control measures (surveillance, isolation practices, hand hygiene, etc.) can contribute to significant reduction of HAIs in geriatric patients.","output":"Epidemiology and Prevention of Healthcare-Associated Infections in Geriatric Patients: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Following the COVID-19 pandemic residents of nursing homes, their visitors and families as well as employees are faced with new challenges Protective measures have a strong impact on the well-being of all these groups of persons MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search was carried out for studies investigating the psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for residents, their visitors and families as well as nursing home staff Results were analyzed by narrative synthesis RESULTS: A total of 756 studies were screened and 15 studies were included These studies were conducted between February and June 2020 with participants from 14 countries Participants reported loneliness, grief and depressive symptoms among residents Some gave an account of fear as a reaction of residents to social distancing Residents with cognitive impairment suffered more although there are conflicting reports The well-being of visitors and friends was compromised and their feeling of loneliness increased Nursing home personnel reported fear of getting infected and of infecting residents or their own families Infected workers in the USA expressed anger about a lack of protection Furthermore, an increase in workload was reported CONCLUSION: Studies conducted during the first months of the pandemic reported negative consequences for the psychosocial well-being of residents, their visitors and nursing home staff Individual needs for future support of these groups are distinct and need further evaluation during the on-going pandemic","output":"[Psychosocial effects of the pandemic on staff and residents of nursing homes as well as their relatives-A systematic review]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Based on the severity of thrombocytopenia, patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) are at an increased risk of mucocutaneous or major bleeding.

CQ31 inhibits the M24B aminopeptidases prolidase (PEPD) and Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase 1 (XPNPEP1), leading to the accumulation of proline-containing peptides that inhibit DPP8/9 and thereby activate CARD8. NLRP1 is distinct from CARD8 in that it directly contacts DPP8/9's active site; these proline-containing peptides, unlike VbP, do not disrupt this repressive interaction and thus do not activate NLRP1.

Moreover, not only the underlying NAFLD may influence the progression of COVID-19, but the COVID-19 may affect the clinical course of NAFLD as well. However, comprehensive evidence on clinical outcomes in patients with NAFLD is not well characterized. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and meta-analysis the evidence on clinical outcomes in NAFLD patients with COVID-19. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central were searched from inception through November 2020. Epidemiological studies assessing the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with NAFLD were included. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess study quality. Generic inverse variance method using RevMan was used to determine the pooled estimates using the random-effects model. RESULTS: Fourteen studies consisting of 1851 NAFLD patients, were included. Significant heterogeneity was observed among the studies, and studies were of moderate to high quality [mean, (range):8 (6, 8)]. For NAFLD patients, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for the severe COVID-19 was 2.60 (95%CI:2.24-3.02; p < 0.001) (studies,n:8), aOR for admission to ICU due to COVID-19 was 1.66 (95%CI:1.26-2.20; p < 0.001) (studies,n:2), and aOR for mortality for was 1.01 (95%CI:0.65-1.58; p = 0.96) (studies,n:2).

We reviewed the main components of hospital preparedness in response to clustering of highly contagious diseases. A model for the initial hospital response to an epidemic in our referral Institute is discussed. Prompt recognition and identification is the initial and indispensable step in facing any communicable diseases, regardless of whether it is a prevalent, a newly emerging one or deliberately released. The importance of developing and implementing nontraditional methods of public health surveillance and a system that allows a wide and immediate dissemination of information and exchange of views on risk assessment and risk management are highlighted. Case identification and laboratory capabilities and isolation procedures are the essential components for an initial hospital response. The recent bioterrorist events and the worldwide outbreaks of highly contagious infectious diseases have evidenced the need for institutional preparedness at each hospital and for identification of referral centers for patient isolation and of laboratories with adequate capabilities.

Thus, we analyzed the available data on time to negative MERS-CoV test in patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection and asymptomatic positive contacts. METHODS: Data from repeated laboratory testing of respiratory samples received at the Saudi Arabian virology reference laboratory in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from September 1, 2012 to September 31, 2013 were recorded. A real-time RT-PCR test for MERS-CoV was used. Data were analyzed by origin of sample, sample type, and MERS-CoV PCR test results. RESULTS: Twenty-six individuals (13 patients and 13 contacts) had repeated testing done until a negative test was obtained. Most samples from MERS-CoV cases were tracheal aspirate/sputum (p = 0.0006) and most samples from contacts were nose and throat swabs (p = 0.0002).

Disease progression based on both onset and report dates as well as control measures as potential confounding were considered in the analyses. We found that stringent prevention and control measures intending to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, contributed to a significant decline in the concentrations of air pollutants except ozone (O(3)). Significant positive associations of short-term exposure to air pollutants, including particulate matter with diameters 2.5m (PM(2.5)), particulate matter with diameters 10m (PM(10)), and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) with daily new confirmed cases were observed during the epidemic.

METHODS We analyzed 319 patients (220 asymptomatic and 99 symptomatic) who underwent carotid angioplasty from 2002 until 2012 for CR that occurred after eversion endarterectomy. During this period, 7993 eversion endarterectomies were done for significant carotid artery stenosis. Significant CR was detected by ultrasound examination and confirmed by digital subtraction angiography or multidetector computed tomography angiography. After angioplasty (with or without stenting), color duplex ultrasound imaging was done after 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. End points encompassed myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death (fatal myocardial infarction, fatal cardiac failure, fatal stroke), and also puncture site hematoma and recurrent restenosis. Primary end points were analyzed as early results (30 days after the procedure), and secondary end points were long-term results (>30 days). Variables and risk factors influencing the early-term and long-term results were also analyzed. Median follow-up was 49.8  22.8 months (range, 17-121 months). RESULTS All but one procedure ended with a technical success (99.7%). In the early postoperative period, transient ischemic attack occurred in 2.8% of the patients and stroke in 1.6%, followed by one lethal outcome (0.3%). Stent thrombosis occurred in one patient (0.3%) several hours after the angioplasty, followed by urgent surgery and graft interposition. In the long-term follow-up, there were no transient ischemic attacks or strokes, non-neurologic mortality was 3.13%, and the recurrent restenosis rate was 4.4%. The rate of non-neurologic outcomes during the follow-up was significantly higher in asymptomatic patients than in symptomatic patients (4.54% vs 0%; P = .034). The statically highest rate of transient ischemic attack was verified in patients in whom Precise (Cordis Corporation, New Brunswick, NJ) stents was used (12.2%) and a Spider Fx (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) cerebral protection device (12.5%) was used.

The process is thus both low-cost and highly flexible, facilitating low sales prices and agile modifications of production capacity, two key features for pandemic response. The simplicity of this process is enabled by a novel unit operation that integrates cellular autolysis, autohydrolysis of nucleic acids, and contaminant precipitation, giving essentially complete removal of host cell DNA as well as reducing host cell proteins and endotoxin by 3.6 and 2.4 log10 units, respectively. This unit operation can be performed rapidly and in the fermentation vessel, such that Q-GRFT is obtained with 100% yield and >99.9% purity immediately after fermentation and requires only a flow-through membrane chromatography step for further contaminant removal.

Patients with cancer are thought to be at increased risk from SARS-COV-2 infection due to the immunodeficiency that results from the underlying neoplasm and treatment. The immune response to this infection has been the subject of great interest, with an extreme variation in clinical severity between infected individuals. Variation in the immune cell response (B, T, and NK lymphocytes, monocytes, and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), among others) and their function have been hypothesized to be responsible for this range of presentation. Methods:Two patients with a history of hematologic malignancies were matched with three non-cancer patients with similar baseline clinical characteristics and severity of COVID related illness. The critical group (CG) was defined as those requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) due to COVID related respiratory failure and the non-critical group (NCG) were hospitalized but did not require MV. All samples studied were obtained from peripheral blood and processed within 4-hours of collection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were isolated using ficoll density gradient separation. Flowcytometric analysis using CytekTM Aurora was done on fresh PBMC samples. Thirty antibody-based flow markers were used to identify 54 distinct immune cell populations. IRB approval was obtained. Results: Critical Group (CG):The CG included case 1, a 47 year-old (y.o.) female (F) with a history (hx) of acute myeloid leukemia and had an matched related donor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) 10-years prior remaining in remission, with hematologic recovery, and off immunosuppressants treated with remdesivir and coritcosteroids for COIVD directed therapy; and case 2, a 55 y.o. F with a hx of HIV treated with corticosteroids for COIVD directed therapy (see Figure 1a). Non-Critical Group (NCG):The NCG included case 3, a 73 y.o male (M) with hx of relapsed/refractory Philadelphia chromosome negative Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with loss of CD19 and CD22 expression following treatment with blinatumumab and inotuzumab, and most recently treated with decitabine/venetoclax; case 4, a 66 y.o. M with hx of cardiomyopathy; and case 6, a 54 y.o. M with hx of obesity. None of the NCG cases were treated with COVID directed therapy. See Table 1 for further clinical information. Immunophenotypic expression:Flow cytometry gating strategy done as outlined in Fig 1a. Case 1 had a high proportion of B-cells, CD8+ T-cells, and cells with exhaustion markers (CD8+CD94+ T-cells, CD4+PD1+ T-cells, CD4+PD1+CD94+ T-cells, PD1-CD94+ NK T-cells, Lag3+Cd11b- non-TB leukocytes) and MDSC immunophenotypes compared with matched case 2. Case 3 also had a high proportion of exhaustion markers (Lag3+CD39 low B-cells, CD8+PD1+ T-cells, CD8+CD94+PD1+ T-cells, CD4+PD1+CD94+ T-cells, PD1+CD94+ NK T-cells, PD1-CD94+ NK T-cells, Lag3+CD11b+, Lag3+CD11b- non-TB leukocytes) and high expression of immunosuppressive Treg and all MDSC; although high expression of granulocytic MDSC. Case 2 had a significant number of exhaustion and immunosuppressive cells as well. Cases 4 and 5 had a higher predominance of all T-cell subtypes and also had variable expression of exhaustion and immunosuppressive immunophenotypes (See Fib 1b). Conclusion:In our study of one critical and one non-critical patient with a history of hematologic malignancy matched with three non-cancer patients we demonstrate the high predominance of exhaustion markers (Lag3,PD1,CD94) and immunosuppressive cell types (Treg, granulocytic and monocytic MDSC). These findings are consistent with the fact that both CG and NCG, as hospitalized patients, represent the most severely ill COVID patient cohort. Of notable interest to the cancer population, cases 1 and 3 had a significant number of exhaustion and immunosuppressive immunophenotypes, suggestive of baseline exhaustion following alloHSCT even years after engraftment in case 1 and attenuated functional immunity in a patient undergoing active treatment in case 3. Interestingly, case 3 had lower expression of all MDSC, a known treatment effect of decitabine. Paired cytokine measurement and its effect on immunophenotype is underway.

The transferability, resistance phenotypes, plasmid replicon typing properties and genetic environments of fosA- and/or fosA3-positive strains were characterized. Five E. cloacae isolates were positive for fosA and three coharbored fosA and fosA3. No fosC determinant was detected. Transconjugants of fosA3 were successfully acquired, while the acquisition of fosA transconjugants was failed. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the three fosA3-positive isolates and their transconjugants were &#8805;256 mg/L, whereas the MICs of the five fosA-positive isolates ranged from 64 mg/L to 256 mg/L.

However, in some cases, patients have displayed DA-resistance with aggressive tumor behavior or are faced with recurrence after drug withdrawal. Also, currently used therapeutics have notorious side effects and impair the life quality of the patients. METHODS Since the amalgamation of clinical and laboratory data besides tumor histopathogenesis and transcriptional regulatory features of the tumor emerge to exhibit essential roles in the behavior and progression of prolactinomas, in this work, we integrated mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) level transcriptome data that exploit disease-specific signatures in addition to biological and pharmacological data to elucidate a rational prioritization of pathways and drugs in prolactinoma. RESULTS We identified eight drug candidates through drug repurposing based on mRNA-miRNA level data integration and evaluated their potential through in vitro assays in the MMQ cell line. Seven re-purposed drugs including 5-flourocytosine, nortriptyline, neratinib, puromycin, taxifolin, vorinostat, and zileuton were proposed as potential drug candidates for the treatment of prolactinoma. We further hypothesized possible mechanisms of drug action on MMQ cell viability through analyzing PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and cell cycle arrest via flow cytometry and western blotting. DISCUSSION We presented the transcriptomic landscape of prolactinoma through miRNA and mRNA level data integration and proposed repurposed drug candidates based on this integration. We validated our findings through testing cell viability, cell cycle phases, and PI3K/Akt protein expressions.

METHODS Between August 1998 and January 2010, 122 patients underwent laparoscopic resection for colorectal liver metastases during 135 procedures at Rikshospitalet. Patients undergoing surgery between August 1998 and June 2009 were included in research analysis. The patients had median Fong's and BPI's scores of 2 (0-5) and 7 (0-23), respectively. Mainstream analysis of hospital data was done on intent-to-treat basis. Intraoperative incidents and postoperative complications were analyzed according to the Satava and Clavien-Dindo classifications. Median follow-up was 24 (0-100) months. RESULTS One hundred fifty-one liver resections were performed in 107 patients during 118 procedures: 117 nonanatomic and 34 anatomic liver resections. There were 5 conversions to laparotomy (4.2%). The resection margin was free of tumor tissue in 141 (93.4%) of 151 specimens, and the distance between the resection margin and tumor tissue was median 6 (0-40) mm. Intraoperative incidents occurred in 14 cases (11.9%), including 5 (4.2%), 8 (6.8%), and 1 (0.8%) cases of grades I, II, and III, respectively. Postoperative complications were observed in 16 cases (14.3%), including 2, 3, 7, 3, 0, and 1 cases of grades I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, and V, respectively. During follow-up, 21 patients received repeat liver resection of recurrences (11 by laparoscopy and 10 by laparotomy).

Participants were selected by convenient sampling and interviewed using structured questionnaire. Responses were transcribed, translated and coded before analyzing for the themes by thematic analysis. Quantitative component of the study was analyzed by descriptive and inferential methods. Result: Mean age of the participants was 43.7 years (SD: 16.1). Most of them (63%) reported not having had an oral examination in the past year while 62% reported being unable to seek dental treatment during the pandemic. Pain, sequelae of pain and other self-perceived urgent causes were identified as the major problems faced by the participant. Similarly, the reasons for not being able to seek dental treatment were grouped as fear of transmission, lack of transportation and lockdown, unavailability of health services, misinformation, lack of communication from hospital regarding its services, and deferred treatment by the hospitals.

Multiple linear regression and structural equation model (SEM) were used to explore the possible factors to the societal influences and quality of life. Results: After multiple linear regression analysis, female, older, more education years, married, regular intake, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequency had positive association with SISQ. To physical component summary (PCS) of SF-12, chronic illness, sleep score, PTSD frequency, and social distance had negative association, and exercise habits had positive association. A mental component summary (MCS) value of SF-12, age, participate in social activities, and social information had positive association, and PTSD frequency, sleep score, social anxiety, and depression had negative association. Under SEM analysis, PTSD had positive influence on SISQ. Sleep score and MCS value had negative influences on SISQ. PTSD severity, older age, sleep score, smoking, and nursing staff had negative influences on PCS value. Young age, PTSD frequency, sleep score, and depression had negative influences on MCS value. Conclusion: Healthcare team members with severe PTSD symptoms suffered more societal influences. Relative to PTSD severity, PTSD frequency was more important to the quality of life.

However, acquired resistance occurs during its administration. To understand the molecular mechanisms of anlotinib resistance, we characterized chromatin accessibility in both the parental and anlotinib-resistant lung cancer cell line NCI-H1975 through ATAC-seq. Compared with the parental cells, we identified 2666 genomic regions with greater accessibility in anlotinib-resistant cells, in which angiogenesis-related processes and the motifs of 21 transcription factors were enriched. Among these transcription factors, TFAP2A was upregulated. TFAP2A knockdown robustly diminished tumor-induced angiogenesis and partially rescued the anti-angiogenic activity of anlotinib. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis indicated that 2280 genes were downregulated in anlotinib-resistant cells with TFAP2A knocked down, among which the PDGFR, TGF-, and VEGFR signaling pathways were enriched. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that TFAP2A binds to accessible sites within BMP4 and HSPG2.

The FCP role delivers a direct point of access for patients, providing assessment, diagnosis and management of MSK conditions. However, to date there is a limited understanding of the current models of FCP clinical practice and how FCP clinicians view them. Objectives: To gain a greater understanding of the current models of FCP practice and how FCP clinicians perceive these clinics. Methods: A non-experimental, cross-sectional descriptive survey was distributed electronically to FCP clinicians working in primary care. Ethical approval was gained from Coventry University Ethics Committee. Recruitment of FCP's was conducted between March and April 2021 with a non-probability, snowballing sampling method. The survey firstly collected data regarding clinician demographics such as;professional qualifications;duration of clinical practice;duration of time as an FCP. Secondly, their clinical model including;appointment format and duration;administrative time;and other non-patient facing time such as supervision and professional development. Thirdly, FCP perceptions of their current model of practice with the use of the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) Likert scale. And finally, open ended questions were incorporate allowing more detailed response of what clinicians perceived currently worked well and not so well in their model of practice. Results: A total of 129 FCP's completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents were chartered physiotherapists, with a mean qualification duration of 11-15 years. A large proportion 81.5% had been working within the FCP role for three years or less. The survey was conducted during the COVID 19 pandemic, 72% of respondents reported a clinical model alteration, utilising telephone or video consultation as a first point of triage, direct contact for clinical assessment only if deemed necessary. Face to face appointment durations of 20 min were reported by 52.75% of FCPs;however, 45.7% of clinicians felt appointments were too short. Regular supervision was reported by 31.8% of FCPs and regular CPD by 39.2%. Overall workload was considered too much by 58.9% of respondents. Analysis of the OLBI scale demonstrated all clinicians scored either moderate burnout (20.9%) or high burnout (79.1%), with no one scoring low. Conclusion(s): The FCP role presents the exciting opportunity for development of advanced practice skills, whilst providing excellent care pathways to patients presenting with MSK conditions. This study highlighted high levels of burnout and unsatisfactory workloads from FCP clinicians. This is concerning for the longevity and sustainability of the FCP role considering a large proportion of respondents had worked in the role less than 3 years. Impact: This research demonstrates the importance of the inclusion of administrative time, clinical supervision, professional development and consideration of appointment duration when developing FCP clinical models of practice. Further consideration of this may be advocated in clinicians who are less experienced and newer to the role.

Self-Trauma Theory and Linehans Biopsychosocial Model might explain the emergence of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) symptoms as mediators of the association between CM and the risk of SB. However, little is known regarding such relationships when the exposure is recent for young persons. Here, we study 187 youths aged 7C17, with or without mental disorders. We explore CM experiences (considering the severity and frequency of different forms of neglect and abuse), recent stressful life events (SLEs), some BPD traits (emotion dysregulation, intense anger and impulsivity), and the risk of SB (including NSSI, suicide threat, suicide ideation, suicide plan and suicide attempt). We study the direct and mediating relationships between these variables via a structural equation analysis using the statistical software package EQS. Our findings suggest that youths exposed to more severe/frequent CM have more prominent BPD traits, and are more likely to have experienced recent SLEs. In turn, BPD traits increase the risk of SLEs. However, only emotion dysregulation and recent SLEs were found to be correlated with SB. Therefore, targeted interventions on emotion dysregulation are necessary to prevent NSSI or SB in children and adolescents exposed to CM, as is the minimization of further SLEs.","output":"Risk of Suicidal Behavior in Children and Adolescents Exposed to Maltreatment: The Mediating Role of Borderline Personality Traits and Recent Stressful Life Events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Body mass index (BMI) is an inadequate marker of obesity, and cannot distinguish between fat mass, fat free mass and distribution of adipose tissue. The purpose of this study was twofold. First, to assess cross-sectional relationship of BMI with fat mass index (FMI), fat free mass index (FFMI) and ratio of fat mass to fat free mass (FM/FFM). Second, to study the association of FMI, FFMI and FM/FFM with physical function including sarcopenia, and cognition in pre-frail older adults. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 191 pre-frail participants  65 years, 57.1% females. Data was collected on demographics, cognition [Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)], function, frailty, calf circumference, handgrip strength (HGS), short physical performance battery (SPPB) and gait speed. Body composition was measured using InBody S10. FMI, FFMI and FM/FFM were classified into tertiles (T1, T2, T3) with T1 classified as lowest and T3 highest tertile respectively and stratified by BMI. RESULTS: Higher FFMI and lower FM/FFM in the high BMI group were associated with better functional outcomes. Prevalence of low muscle mass was higher in the normal BMI group. FMI and FM/FFM were significantly higher in females and FFMI in males with significant gender differences except for FFMI in  80 years old. Small calf circumference was significantly less prevalent in the highest tertile of FMI, FM/FMI and FFMI. Prevalence of sarcopenic obesity and low physical function (HGS, gait speed and SPPB scores) were significantly higher in the highest FMI and FM/FFM tertile. Highest FFMI tertile group had higher physical function, higher MoCA scores, lower prevalence of sarcopenic obesity and sarcopenia, After adjustment, highest tertile of FFMI was associated with lower odds of sarcopenia especially in the high BMI group. Highest tertile of FM/FFM was associated with higher odds of sarcopenia. Higher BMI was associated with lower odds of sarcopenia. CONCLUSION: FFMI and FM/FFM may be a better predictor of functional outcomes in pre-frail older adults than BMI. Cut-off values for healthy BMI values and role of calf circumference as a screening tool for sarcopenia need to be validated in larger population. Health promotion intervention should focus on FFMI increment.","output":"Relationship of Fat Mass Index and Fat Free Mass Index With Body Mass Index and Association With Function, Cognition and Sarcopenia in Pre-Frail Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The determinants of intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine and associated factors among nursing students during this pandemic need to be identified.

These practitioners are a population of special interest due to the frequency of their exposure to narratives and graphic images of sexual trauma. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 female South African psychologists. The data, which were analyzed using an interpretative phenomenological approach, revealed experiences characteristic of vicarious traumatization. Participants reported having an enhanced sense of personal vulnerability to sexual assault and heightened awareness of the betrayals of trust that women experience from male figures, which has led to increased mistrust of men and hypervigilance regarding the safety of their daughters. Internalization of feelings of helplessness experienced by the victim evoked self-blame for practitioners and appraisals of being complicit in abuse. Practitioners also experienced survivor guilt about being spared from harm. Symptoms of intrusive re-experiencing of client trauma and cognitive and behavioral disengagement were evident. These findings have important implications for clinical practice and underscore the necessity for clinicians to cultivate an awareness of the impact of treating sexual trauma and working in ways that are self-protective.","output":"The Ugliness of It Seeps into Me: Experiences of Vicarious Trauma among Female Psychologists Treating Survivors of Sexual Assault"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in health care facilities poses a challenge against pandemic control. Health care workers (HCWs) have frequent and high-risk interactions with COVID-19 patients. We undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine optimal testing strategies for screening HCWs to inform strategic decision-making in health care settings.Methods: We modeled the number of new infections, quality-adjusted life years lost, and net costs related to five testing strategies: (1) no tests, (2) only PCR test, (3) only IgG test, (4) conditional PCR test if IgG test is positive, and (5) concurrent PCR and IgG tests. We applied our model to four strata of HCWs, defined by the presence and timing of clinical presentation. We conducted sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in inputs.Findings: When screening asymptomatic and recently symptomatic HCWs, conducting only a PCR test offers the best health outcomes and fewest costs;it is associated with 28-144 fewer new infections over two weeks per 100 HCWs screened compared to no test, and saves between $810-$4,600 per test. When screening HCWs in the late clinical disease stage, PCR testing is associated with 495 additional infections per 100 HCWs screened compared to no screening. Depending on the degree of immunity conferred, IgG testing may avoid up to 37 additional infections.Interpretation: PCR testing is a beneficial strategy to identify infected HCWs and reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in health care settings. Utility of IgG testing depends on the time when the test is administered and immunity characteristics.

Design/methodology/approach: Previous literature is used to distinguish between various types of societal crises discussed in the study. Social enterprise responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recession and the racial uprising in the USA that all erupted at the start of the 2020 decade are explored to illustrate the need for different responses to each. Findings: The origin and manifestation of crises differ in that they may have public health, natural, economic or even intentionally man-made origins. In addition, in times of crisis, social enterprises must be prepared to innovate, adapt or at least manage the effects of one or more crises on their organizations. These innovations may be social, technology or economic innovations. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to knowledge about the role and value of social enterprise as a tool for addressing societal issues. The three types of crises explored in this paper will likely reoccur and evolve to manifest in new ways. As such, it is imperative that research on the efficacy of social enterprises during times of crisis are conducted to inform practice, policy and future research. Practical implications: This study aims to inform and encourage institutions, particularly social enterprises, to recognize that winter always comes. Crises always happen in life and how organizations respond to such crises will differ based on the type of crisis at hand. This study particularly contributes to knowledge by emphasizing the need for social enterprises to think about both economic uncertainty and the role they play in addressing crises in the long-term, not just when they occur.

In the training cohort, the area under curves (AUCs) were 0.822 (95% CI, 0.765C0.875) and the internal validation cohort was 0.762 (95% CI, 0.768C0.844). Further, we validated it in a prospective cohort with the AUCs of 0.705 (95% CI, 0.627C0.778). The internally bootstrapped calibration curve showed favorable consistency between prediction by nomogram and the actual situation. And DCA analysis also conferred high clinical net benefit. CONCLUSION: In this study, our predicting model based on five clinical characteristics of COVID\\\\19 patients will enable clinicians to predict the potential risk of developing critical illness and thus optimize medical management.","output":"Construction and validation of a machine learning\\\\based nomogram: A tool to predict the risk of getting severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health comunication is a critical component of pandemic mitigation, but mainstream prevention messaging often lacks social, cultural and linguistic relevance to vulnerable populations.

Serum ferritin generally represents a biomarker of choice when iron deficiency is suspected. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase-protein exhibiting elevated serum concentration in various inflammatory diseases. Here we focus on the role of serum ferritin for diagnostic and clinical management of patients with COVID-19 in comparison with other infectious and non-infectious diseases. METHODS: We examined scientific articles listed in PubMed reporting on ferritin in various infectious and non-infectious diseases. We then compared these results with nine current COVID-19 ferritin reports published in 2020. RESULTS: Several non-infectious, as well as non-COVID-19 infectious diseases, are characterised by a partly dramatic elevation of serum ferritin levels. All COVID-19 studies published between February and May 2020, which documented laboratory serum ferritin, indicate ferritin as a biomarker of COVID-19 severity in hospitalised patients. CONCLUSIONS: Serum ferritin may be considered both a prognostic and stratifying biomarker that can also contribute to therapeutic decision-making concerning patients with COVID-19. It should be emphasised, however, that most scientific reports refer to cohorts in the Asian region. Further validation in other cohorts is urgently required.","output":"Assessment of serum ferritin as a biomarker in COVID-19: bystander or participant?

We found that in every case, Fe, Ti, Al, Hg, Cu, Bi, and/or Si spherical or acicular NPs with a mean size of 36  17 nm were present in the AV axis in situ, freely and as conglomerates, within the mitochondria, sarcomeres, lysosomes, lipofuscin, and/or intercalated disks and gap junctions of Purkinje and transitional cells, telocytes, macrophages, endothelium, and adjacent atrial and ventricular fibers. Erythrocytes were found to transfer NPs to the endothelium. Purkinje fibers with increased lysosomal activity and totally disordered myofilaments and fragmented Z-disks exhibited NP conglomerates in association with gap junctions and intercalated disks. AV conduction axis pathology caused by environmental NPs is a plausible and modifiable risk factor for understanding common arrhythmias and reentrant tachycardia. Anthropogenic, industrial, e-waste, and indoor NPs reach pacemaker regions, thereby increasing potential mechanisms that disrupt the electrical impulse pathways of the heart. The cardiotoxic, oxidative, and abnormal electric performance effects of NPs in pacemaker locations warrant extensive research.

In 2018, the recovery rate of end-of-life passenger vehicles was less than 18% of the scrapped amount. Dynamic material flow analysis can predict the amount of end-of-life passenger cars in China in the future, and analyze the flow of materials in recycling system. Life cycle assessment can be used to quantify greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, this paper integrates these two methods into the model construction of recycling decision system. Meanwhile, sensitivity analysis of the important factors affecting the efficiency of the recovery system is carried out. Finally, the main recovery indexes of the system are predicted under three scenarios: low-speed, medium speed and high-speed development, which are set based on scrap volume, standard recovery rate, proportion of assembly into remanufacturing and carbon tax price. The research results show that in 2018, 656.9 kg/vehicle of iron, 150.2 kg/vehicle of aluminum and 7.9 kg/vehicle of copper are recovered from end-of-life passenger car in China, and the carbon emission during the recovery process is 651.1 kg of CO2eq/vehicle, with a total emission reduction of 3816.1 kgCO2eq/vehicle compared with the original production, and the economic benefit is about 5055.5 yuan/vehicle. The scenario prediction results show that by 2050, from the low-speed development scenario to the high-speed development scenario, the total amount of iron, aluminum and copper recovered rise from 3.96 million tons, 915 thousand tons and 46 thousand tons to 697 thousand tons, 1.61 million tons and 80 thousand tons respectively throughout the year. The carbon emission in the recovery process rise from 4.98 thousand tons to 9.32 million tons. Compared with the original production, the carbon emission reduction increases from 2.21 million tons to 38.3 million tons, the economic benefit increases from 58.9 billion yuan to 118.8 billion yuan, and the comprehensive benefit increases from 57 billion yuan to 111.6 billion yuan.","output":"End-of-life passenger vehicles recycling decision system in China based on dynamic material flow analysis and life cycle assessment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An online community is one of the important ways for people with mental disorders to receive assistance and obtain support.

As Lausanne was getting ready to host the 2020 winter Youth Olympic Games, we had the opportunity to reflect on these challenges and on what they mean for sports medicine practitioners. Elite sport pushes athletes to the limit, be it through their own intrinsic drive to achieve ever more, or through the pressures of the multiple stakeholders around sport. Whilst the occurrence of injuries and health problems are part of sport, our duty is to protect athletes, especially the younger ones. Beyond selection processes, talent identification and early-specialization, it is imperative to keep a strong focus on sustainable health and positive youth development. Our role is to support youth athletes (and non-Athletes) in their complete maturation process, providing education towards health and physical literacy, competence and autonomy. It is also to support them in their quest for performance. This is why we introduce the concept of Health for Performance. Putting complete health first is the best guarantee to mitigate the occurrence of avoidable injuries and health issues, and to achieve sustainable performance. This may include athletic success, but must not. Performance must be understood as the realization of one s potential on a path that involves growing, competing, learning, sharing and contributing. As a model and philosophy, Health for Performance can only succeed with strong interdisciplinary work and alignment across all stakeholders in youth sport, but it must start within our own medical supporting staffs. It is only from there that we can start a network beyond our familiar field to involve the wider world of sport. The COVID-19 crisis has forced sport to take a back seat, in order to preserve health.

We aimed to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare quality among medical centers in Taiwan. This was a retrospective study that collected anonymized data from the Taiwan Clinical Performance Indicator system, which was founded by the Joint Commission of Taiwan, an organization to promote, execute, and certify the nations healthcare quality policies. We explored quality indicators reported by more than three-quarters of medical centers in Taiwan from January 2019 to December 2020. The year 2019 was defined as the baseline period and 2020 was defined as the period after the start of the outbreak of COVID-19. Quality indicators from different regions were analyzed. Unscheduled returns of emergency patients within 72 h of their discharge, unscheduled returns of hospitalized patients within 14 days of their discharge, and unscheduled returns of surgical patients to the operating room during hospitalization all declined during the COVID-19 outbreak. Interestingly, the proportion of acute ischemic stroke patients receiving intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) increased during outbreak of COVID-19. There were significant regional variations in healthcare quality indicators among medical centers in northern and middle/southern Taiwan.

Due to the explorative as well as descriptive methodological approach, interview data are available and can be assigned to four central topics, which reveal a complex and sometimes conflictual reality of work and life in long-term care during the pandemic. On the one hand, the protective measures taken by the state and the institutions, as well as the resulting restrictions on the personal freedom of the residents are critically reflected and the degree of self-determination of the residents of nursing homes in the pandemic is questioned. On the other hand C given the pandemic-related measures C nursing activities in long-term care facilities as a place of work and life are described as challenging, especially regarding the changed nursing processes and quality of care, as well as due to the changed quality of relationships with the residents. ARGUMENTS: These four topics can basically be assigned to the ethical principles of autonomy and care and present a relevant concretization of the principle-oriented ethical challenges in long-term care during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the synopsis and interpretation of the results, it becomes apparent that the interviewed caregivers closely link the observance and implementation of the autonomy principle in everyday nursing care with the principle of care and the resulting well-being of the residents. CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly show that the paradigm shift in long-term care, which has been developed over the last few decades, was (temporarily massively) weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the reported moral uncertainties and conflicts make it clear that caregivers need support regarding the ethical reflection of their nursing actions and that a sustainable integration of ethics counselling in long-term care facilities may be a possible approach to a solution.","output":"Covid-19 Schutzma?nahmen in Alten- und Pflegeheimen: zwischen Autonomie und Frsorge C Ergebnisse einer Interviewstudie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Characterizing multiple risk stemming from automobiles are required from the viewpoint of priority setting for future risk management.

On the other hand, the health risks caused by NO(2) and PM(2.5) from automobiles were 137.6 DALYs, which was lower than the health risks due to automobile noise. These results indicate the effectiveness of DALYs as an indicator to characterize different kinds of burden of health and environmental impacts from automobiles, and they were successfully used to evaluate the effectiveness of risk reduction options such as the difference between open and closed windows. Furthermore, most people were found to have been exposed to 55C60 dB noise level. Although they easily get used to and can tolerate this level, it is also the stage at which health risks begin to occur.

The conditioned air directly blows into the dental treatment units, especially into the aerosol generating area, where the contamination is more concentrated. We hypothesise that these new designs could serve to isolate dental treatment units to function separately like closed dental operatories while keeping them open to each other.

Objective To assess the diagnostic accuracy of saliva NAAT for COVID-19. Data Sources In this systematic review, a search of the MEDLINE and medRxiv databases was conducted on August 29, 2020, to find studies of diagnostic test accuracy. The final meta-analysis was performed on November 17, 2020. Study Selection Studies needed to provide enough data to measure salivary NAAT sensitivity and specificity compared with imperfect nasopharyngeal swab NAAT as a reference test. An imperfect reference test does not perfectly reflect the truth (ie, it can give false results). Studies were excluded if the sample contained fewer than 20 participants or was neither random nor consecutive. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Data Extraction and Synthesis Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline was followed for the systematic review, with multiple authors involved at each stage of the review. To account for the imperfect reference test sensitivity, we used a bayesian latent class bivariate model for the meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was pooled sensitivity and specificity. Two secondary analyses were performed: one restricted to peer-reviewed studies, and a post hoc analysis limited to ambulatory settings. Results The search strategy yielded 385 references, and 16 unique studies were identified for quantitative synthesis. Eight peer-reviewed studies and 8 preprints were included in the meta-analyses (5922 unique patients). There was significant variability in patient selection, study design, and stage of illness at which patients were enrolled. Fifteen studies included ambulatory patients, and 9 exclusively enrolled from an outpatient population with mild or no symptoms. In the primary analysis, the saliva NAAT pooled sensitivity was 83.2% (95% credible interval [CrI], 74.7%-91.4%) and the pooled specificity was 99.2% (95% CrI, 98.2%-99.8%). The nasopharyngeal swab NAAT had a sensitivity of 84.8% (95% CrI, 76.8%-92.4%) and a specificity of 98.9% (95% CrI, 97.4%-99.8%). Results were similar in secondary analyses.

Our management of a case of CBPFM is presented to improve knowledge of its treatment. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 17-month-old Japanese girl presented with fever (39.1 C) and persistent cough. She was noted to be poorly developed (7.5 kg: -2SD). Chest X-ray radiography was suggestive of pneumonia involving the left lung; WBC was 41600/L and CRP was 12.9 mg/dL. Computed tomography, upper gastrointestinal series, and bronchoscopy identified a fistula between the oesophagus and the left lung and severe left pulmonary artery hypoplasia, typical of type II CBPFM. Her left thoracic cavity was small with sclerotic lung tissue. We customised management by commencing a trial of intensive duodenal tube feeding without oral ingestion. She gained weight and her pneumonia improved enough to enable thoracoscopic left pneumonectomy through an unconventional dorsal approach, necessary because of the location of her CBPFM. Surgery was successful and tolerated well with unremarkable postoperative recovery. Currently she is asymptomatic and growing well. DISCUSSION We used minimally invasive surgery (MIS) to resect an anomalous bronchus and perform a left pneumonectomy after two weeks of intensive conservative management, including nil-by-mouth to optimise her condition for surgery.

Using cross-sectional data from the DocStyles survey administered September-October 2020 (68% response rate), we compared changes in family planning-related clinical services and healthcare delivery strategies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed service provision issues among 1063 U.S. physicians whose practice provided family planning services just before the pandemic. About one-fifth of those whose practices provided the following services or strategies just before the pandemic discontinued these services during the pandemic: long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) placement (16%); LARC removal (17%); providing or prescribing emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) in advance (18%); and reminding patients about contraception injections or LARC removal or replacement (20%). Many practices not providing the following services or strategies just before the pandemic initiated these services during the pandemic: telehealth for contraception initiation (43%); telehealth for contraception continuation (48%); and renewing contraception prescriptions without requiring an office visit (36%). While a smaller proportion of physicians reported service provision issues in the month before survey completion than at any point during the pandemic, about one-third still reported fewer adult females seeking care (37%) and technical challenges with telehealth (32%).

The purpose of the review was to inform recommendations for rational use of PPE for emergency surgery staff, particularly in low resources environments where PPE shortages and high costs are expected to hamper the safety of healthcare workers (HCWs) and affect the care of trauma patients. Introduction: Many healthcare facilities in low-and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate these already strained surgical healthcare services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect healthcare workers from viral exposure. Inclusion criteria: This review included systematic reviews, experimental and observational studies evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in HCWs involved in emergency trauma surgery. Indirect evidence from other healthcare settings was considered, as well as evidence from other viral outbreaks summarised and discussed for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and over thirty other sources. The risk of bias assessment of the included studies was planned with the AMSTAR II tool for systematic reviews, the RoBII tool for randomised controlled trials, and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised studies. Data were extracted using a standardised data extraction tool and summarised narratively. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for grading the certainty of the evidence was followed. Results: We identified 17 systematic reviews that fulfilled our selection criteria and were included for synthesis. We did not identify randomised controlled trials during COVID-19 or studies additional to those included in the reviews that discussed other similar viral respiratory illnesses. Conclusions: The use of PPE drastically reduces the risk of COVID-19 compared with no mask use in HCWs in the hospital setting. N95 and N95 equivalent respirators provided more protection and were found to halve the risk of COVID-19 contagion in HCWs from moderate and high-risk environments. Eye protection also offers additional security and is associated with reduced incidence of contagion. These effects apply to emergency trauma care. Decontamination and reuse appear as feasible, cost-effective measures that would likely help overcome PPE shortages and enhance the allocation of limited resources. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS There is high certainty that the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks are associated with a reduced risk of coronaviruses respiratory illness when compared with no mask use. In moderate to high-risk environments, especially in aerosol-generating procedures, N95 respirators are associated with a more significant reduction in risk of COVID-19 infection compared with surgical masks. Eye protection also reduces the risk of contagion. Decontamination of masks and respirators with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, or dry heat is effective and does not affect PPE performance or fit.","output":"Personal protective equipment for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers involved in emergency trauma surgery during the pandemic: an umbrella review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has claimed nearly 900,000 lives worldwide and infected more than 27 million people. Researchers worldwide are studying ways to decrease SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 related deaths. Several studies found altitude having a negative association with both COVID-19 incidence and deaths. Ecuadorian data was used to explore the relationship between altitude and COVID-19. MethodsThis is an ecological study examining province-level data. To explore a relationship between altitude and COVID-19, this study utilized publicly available COVID-19 data and population statistics. ANOVA, correlation statistics, and a multivariate linear model explored the relationship between different Ecuadorian altitudes against incidence, mortality, and case-fatality rates. Populations statistics attributed to COVID-19 were included in the linear model to control for confounding factors. ResultsRegional differences were observed for incidence, mortality, and case fatality rate suggesting an association between altitude and SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 disease severity. In both the correlation analysis and linear model altitude showed a statistically significant negative correlation between altitude and COVID-19 mortality. ConclusionAltitude may have an effect on COVID-19 mortality rates.

The Pelvic Floor Anal Fissure (PAF)-study aims to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of PFPT on improvement on pelvic floor muscle tone and function, pain, healing of the fissure, quality of life and complaint reduction in patients with CAF. METHODS: The PAF-study is a single-centre, two armed, randomized controlled trial. Patients with CAF and pelvic floor dysfunction are eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria include abscess, fistula, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, anorectal malignancy, prior rectal radiation, and pregnancy. A total of 140 patients will be randomized for either PFPT or postponed treatment of PFPT. The primary outcome is tone at rest during electromyographic registration of the pelvic floor before and after therapy. Secondary outcomes consist of healing of the fissure, pain ratings, improvement of pelvic floor function, complaint reduction and quality of life. Primary and secondary endpoints are measured at 8 and 20 weeks and at 1-year follow-up. DISCUSSION: Currently, there is a gap in treatment modalities between conservative management and surgery.

Among the herbivores which attack it is a tiny mite, Aculus mosoniensis, which causes serious malformations of the growing tips. In order to determine whether this species is safe to use as a biological control agent in Europe, where the mite has already been recorded, and elsewhere within the invasive range of tree of heaven, host range testing is required. After testing several tree species related to tree of heaven, it was found that this mite was unable to reproduce on any other species except tree of heaven, and importantly there was no damage or sign of feeding on any of the test species. Thus we conclude that this is a safe biological control agent and will help to control this highly invasive tree. ABSTRACT: Tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima) is a fast-growing deciduous tree native to China, considered a serious invasive species worldwide, with several socio-economic and ecological impacts attributed to it. Chemical and mechanical methods have limited efficacy in its management, and biological controls may offer a suitable and sustainable option. Aculus mosoniensis (Ripka) is an eriophyid mite that has been recorded to attack tree of heaven in 13 European countries. This study aims to explore the host range of this mite by exposing 13 plant species, selected either for their phylogenetic and ecological similarity to the target weed or their economic importance. Shortly after inoculation with the mite, we recorded a quick decrease in mite number on all nontarget species and no sign of mite reproduction. Whereas, after just one month, the population of mites on tree of heaven numbered in the thousands, irrespective of the starting population, and included both adults and juveniles. Significantly, we observed evidence of damage due to the mite only on target plants. Due to the specificity, strong impact on the target, and the ability to increase its population to high levels in a relatively short amount of time, we find A. mosoniensis to be a very promising candidate for the biological control of tree of heaven.","output":"Field Assessment of the Host Range of Aculus mosoniensis (Acari: Eriophyidae), a Biological Control Agent of the Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The brain reninCangiotensin system continues to be enigmatic more than 40 years after the brain was first recognized to be a site of action of angiotensin II.

A brief description and nomenclature of the peptidases involved in the processing of angiotensin peptides in the brain is given. Of primary interest is the array of enzymes that degrade radiolabeled angiotensins in receptor binding assays. This poses major challenges to studies of brain angiotensin receptors and it is debatable whether an accurate determination of brain angiotensin receptor binding kinetics has yet been made. The quandary facing the investigator of brain angiotensin receptors is the need to protect the radioligand from metabolic alteration while maintaining the characteristics of the receptors in situ.

Considering the possibility of nasal self-sampling and the ease-of-use in performing the test, self-testing may be an option. Methods and Findings We performed a manufacturer-independent, prospective diagnostic accuracy study of nasal mid-turbinate self-sampling and self-testing when using a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT. Symptomatic participants suspected to have COVID-19 received written and illustrated instructions. Procedures were observed without intervention. For comparison, Ag-RDTs with nasopharyngeal sampling were professionally performed. Estimates of agreement, sensitivity, and specificity relative to RT-PCR on a combined oro-/nasopharyngeal sample were calculated. Feasibility was evaluated by observer and participant questionnaires. Among 146 symptomatic adults, 40 (27.4%) were RT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sensitivity with self-testing was 82.5% (33/40 RT-PCR positives detected; 95% CI 68.1-91.3), and 85.0% (34/40; 95% CI 70.9-92.9) with professional testing. The positive percent agreement between self-testing and professional testing on Ag-RDT was 91.4% (95% CI 77.6-97.0), and negative percent agreement 99.1% (95% CI 95.0-100). At high viral load (>7.0 log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/ml), sensitivity was 96.6% (28/29; 95% CI 82.8-99.8) for both self- and professional testing. Deviations in sampling and testing (incomplete self-sampling or extraction procedure, or imprecise volume applied on the test device) were observed in 25 out of the 40 PCR-positives. Participants were rather young (mean age 35 years) and educated (59.6% with higher education degree). Most participants (80.9%) considered the Ag-RDT as rather easy to perform. Conclusion Ambulatory participants suspected for SARS-CoV-2 infection were able to reliably perform the Ag-RDT and test themselves. Procedural errors might be reduced by refinement of the Ag-RDTs for self-testing, such as modified instructions for use or product design/procedures. Self-testing may result in more wide-spread and more frequent testing. Paired with the appropriate information and education of the general public about the benefits and risks, self-testing may therefore have significant impact on the pandemic.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 patient self-testing with an antigen-detecting rapid test: a head-to-head comparison with professional testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis (CF) programs and people with CF (PwCF) employed various monitoring methods for virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper characterizes experiences with remote monitoring across the U.S. CF community. METHODS The CF Foundation (CFF) sponsored distribution of home spirometers (April 2020 to May 2021), surveys to PwCF and CF programs (July to September 2020), and a second program survey (April to May 2021). We used mixed methods to explore access, use, and perspectives regarding the use of remote monitoring in future care. RESULTS By October 2020, 13,345 spirometers had been distributed, and 19,271 spirometers by May 2021. Programs (n=286) estimated proportions of PwCF with home devices increased over seven months: spirometers (30% to 70%), scales (50% to 70%), oximeters (5% to 10%) with higher estimates in adult programs for spirometers and oximeters. PwCF (n=378) had access to scales (89%), followed by oximeters (48%) and spirometers (47%), often using scales and oximeters weekly, and spirometers monthly. Over both surveys, some programs had no method to collect respiratory specimens for cultures associated with telehealth visits (47%, n=132; 41%, n=118). Most programs (81%) had a process for phlebotomy associated with a telehealth visit, primarily through off-site labs.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the predictive accuracy of host biomarkers at clinical presentation to the ED for adverse outcome. METHODS: Prospective observational study of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the ED of a Swiss hospital. Concentrations of inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction biomarkers were determined at clinical presentation. We evaluated the accuracy of clinical signs and these biomarkers in predicting 30-day intubation/mortality, and oxygen requirement by calculating the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve and by classification and regression tree analysis. RESULTS: Of 76 included patients with COVID-19, 24 were outpatients or hospitalized without oxygen requirement, 35 hospitalized with oxygen requirement, and 17 intubated/died. We found that soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells had the best prognostic accuracy for 30-day intubation/mortality (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.95) and IL-6 measured at presentation to the ED had the best accuracy for 30-day oxygen requirement (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.94). An algorithm based on respiratory rate and sTREM-1 predicted 30-day intubation/mortality with 94% sensitivity and 0.1 negative likelihood ratio. An IL-6-based algorithm had 98% sensitivity and 0.04 negative likelihood ratio for 30-day oxygen requirement. CONCLUSIONS: sTREM-1 and IL-6 concentrations in COVID-19 in the ED have good predictive accuracy for intubation/mortality and oxygen requirement. sTREM-1- and IL-6-based algorithms are highly sensitive to identify patients with adverse outcome and could serve as early triage tools.","output":"COVID-19 risk stratification algorithms based on sTREM-1 and IL-6 in emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the determinants of the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) in Africa, based on the framework of social determinants of health.

Non-rheumatic controls were randomly sampled 1:1 and matched by age, sex and PCR date. The main outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as death, invasive ventilation, intensive care unit admission or serious complications. We assessed the association between the outcome and the potential prognostic variables, adjusted by COVID-19 treatment, using logistic regression. RESULTS: The cohorts were composed of 456 rheumatic and non-rheumatic patients, in equal numbers. Mean age was 63 (IQR 53-78) years and male sex 41% in both cohorts. Rheumatic diseases were IA (60%) and CTD (40%). Most patients (74%) had been hospitalised, and the risk of severe COVID-19 was 31.6% in the rheumatic and 28.1% in the non-rheumatic cohort. Ageing, male sex and previous comorbidity (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular or lung disease) increased the risk in the rheumatic cohort by bivariate analysis.

METHODS: We retrospectively studied all consecutive patients with histologically confirmed FCD2 located in the central region operated between 2000 and 2019 at a single center. We analyzed electro-clinical and imaging features (including fMRI), seizure outcome, early and late postoperative neurological status correlating to anatomo-functional areas (primary motor cortex: PMC, paracentral lobule: PCL, supplementary motor area: SMA, precentral gyrus: PrCG, post-central gyrus: PoCG, central operculum: COp). RESULTS: 60 patients (35 females; 7-65 years) were included in the study. Epilepsy was characterized by early onset, high seizure frequency with clusters (30-90/day), drop-attacks and status epilepticus. Ictal semiology included sensory-motor auras, motor and postural manifestations, and post-ictal motor deficits. EEG and stereo-EEG patterns were like those typically recorded in FCD2. MRI was positive in 63% and FDG-PET in 86% of the patients. fMRI demonstrated activations close to the FCD2 (59%) or minor reorganization (41%) but none within the lesion. Seizure-free outcome (2-20-year follow-up) was obtained in 53 patients (88%), including 37 achieving Engel class IA (62%), correlating with complete FCD2 removal. Early transitory post-operative deficits occurred in 52 patients (87%), which were severe in 19, mostly after PMC, PCL and SMA resections, while PrCG, PoCG and COp resections were associated with minor/moderate deficits. Total recovery was observed in 21/52 patients (40%), while a permanent deficit (>2 years) persisted in 31 (minor: 19, moderate; 9, major: 3). The best outcome [seizure-freedom without deficit (48%) or with minor deficit (28%)] was significantly more frequent in children (p=0.025). Antiseizure medications were discontinued in 28 patients (47%). Quality of life correlated with seizure-free outcome and absence of postoperative deficit; 43 patients (72%) reported a schooling or socio-professional improvement. DISCUSSION: Excellent seizure outcome and low rates of major permanent disability can be achieved after central FCD2 resections despite functional risks. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: Due to its retrospective nature, this study provides class IV evidence that good seizure outcomes with minor additional deficits can be achieved after epilepsy surgery in the central region.","output":"Benefits and Risks of Epilepsy Surgery in Patients With Focal Cortical Dysplasia Type 2 in the Central Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Orofacial pain (OFP) disorders affect the maxillofacial complex and typically involve other locations in the head and neck Common etiologies of OFP disorders include odontogenic sources, temporomandibular disorders, neuropathic pain, chemosensory disorders, and headaches Less commonly, benign and malignant neoplasms can be associated with OFP complaints Patients with OFP symptoms require a thorough evaluation and are often referred to additional healthcare providers for interprofessional management In those OFP patients whose symptoms do not respond to conventional treatment(s), whose symptoms change over time, or who report positive responses to review of systems questions that suggest more extensive involvement, further investigation is warranted To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of nasopharyngeal extramedullary plasmacytoma, a localized malignant neoplasm, associated with persistent OFP","output":"Persistent orofacial pain associated with nasopharyngeal extramedullary plasmacytoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Currently, there is limited research on the prognostic value of NT\\\\proBNP (N\\\\terminal pro\\\\B\\\\type natriuretic peptide) as a biomarker in COVID\\\\19.

Individuals with pre-diabetes have a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which is reversible with a change in lifestyle. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to serious health complications. Our objective was to assess the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes, and to investigate the associated risk factors of each in the South African population. METHOD: This study made use of the South African Demographic Health Survey 2016 data. The study participants included 6442 individuals aged 15 years and older. A generalized additive mixed model was employed to account for the complex survey design of the study as well as well spatial autocorrelation in the data. RESULTS: The observed prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes was 67% and 22%, respectively. Among those who had never been tested for diabetes prior to the survey, 10% of females and 6% of males were found to be diabetic, and 67% of both males and females were found to be pre-diabetic. Thus, a large proportion of the South African population remains undiagnosed. The model revealed both common and uncommon factors significantly associated with pre-diabetes and diabetes. This highlights the importance of considering diabetic status as a three-level categorical outcome, rather than binary. In addition, significant interactions between some of the lifestyle factors, demographic factors and anthropometric measures were revealed, which indicates that the effects each these factors have on the likelihood of an individual being pre-diabetic or diabetic is confounded by other factors. CONCLUSION: The risk factors for diabetes and pre-diabetes are many and complicated. Individuals need to be aware of their diabetic status before health complications arise. It is therefore important for all stakeholders in government and the private sector of South Africa to get involved in providing education and creating awareness about diabetes. Regular testing of diabetes, as well as leading a healthy lifestyle, should be encouraged.","output":"Assessment of prevalence and risk factors of diabetes and pre-diabetes in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OSbjective : The regional distribution and transmissibility of existing COVID-19 variants of concern (VOC) has led to concerns about increased transmission, given the ability of VOCs to evade immunity as breakthrough infections increase. Methods : SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced (n=277) and analysed with all available genomes from Vietnam and ASEAN countries to understand the phylodynamics. The observed lineages were assigned using Pangolin nomenclature and spread patterns were investigated. Results : Between January 2020 and 08 November 2021, VOCs including alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P.1), and delta (B.1.617.2), were observed in ASEAN countries. While alpha and delta were the major VOCs in nine ASEAN countries, delta is the predominant. Among ASEAN countries, alpha VOC was first reported by Singapore, beta VOC by Malaysia, gamma VOC by Philippines and delta VOC by Singapore. Of the first 1000 genomes analysed from Vietnam, alpha and delta are the most represented, with delta being the dominant VOC since May 2021. The delta variant was introduced in early January 2021 and forms a large cluster within the representative genomes.

In recent years, the properties of the DMFE have been carefully described for some microorganisms. In most cases, however, this information has been obtained only for a single environment, and very few studies have explored the effect that environmental variation may have on the DMFE. Environmental effects are particularly relevant for the evolution of multi-host parasites and thus for the emergence of new pathogens. Here we characterize the DMFE for a collection of twenty single-nucleotide substitution mutants of Tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) across a set of eight host environments. Five of these host species were naturally infected by TEV, all belonging to family Solanaceae, whereas the other three were partially susceptible hosts belonging to three other plant families. First, we found a significant virus genotype-by-host species interaction, which was sustained by differences in genetic variance for fitness and the pleiotropic effect of mutations among hosts. Second, we found that the DMFEs were markedly different between Solanaceae and non-Solanaceae hosts. Exposure of TEV genotypes to non-Solanaceae hosts led to a large reduction of mean viral fitness, while the variance remained constant and skewness increased towards the right tail. Within the Solanaceae hosts, the distribution contained an excess of deleterious mutations, whereas for the non-Solanaceae the fraction of beneficial mutations was significantly larger. All together, this result suggests that TEV may easily broaden its host range and improve fitness in new hosts, and that knowledge about the DMFE in the natural host does not allow for making predictions about its properties in an alternative host.","output":"Effect of Host Species on the Distribution of Mutational Fitness Effects for an RNA Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remdesivir currently is the only recognized specific therapy, though with emergency use authorization (EUA), in Covid-19 The Ministry of Health &Family Welfare, Government of India has included it as a possible 'newer therapy' as Compassionate Emergency use under Named Patient Basis on June 13, 2020 and is being perceived as a ray of hope in Moderate to Severe Covid-19 cases","output":"Remdesivir in COVID-19 therapeutics  An interim status report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To identify virtual bioisosteric replacements of two GPR40 agonists.

The virus is still circulating in the world. The abnormal thoracic computerized tomographic (CT) scan findings vary widely among the studies of 2009 H1N1 influenza. We evaluated the thoracic CT findings in patients with 2009 H1N1 virus infection to describe findings compared to previously reported findings, and to suggest patterns that may be suggestive for 2009 influenza A (H1N1) in an appropriate clinical setting. METHODS: Retrospectively, the archive of all patients with a diagnosis of 2009 H1N1 influenza A were reviewed, in Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, central Iran, between September 23(rd) 2009 to February 20(th) 2010. Out of 216 patients with confirmed 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus, 26 cases with abnormal CT were enrolled in the study. Radiologic findings were characterized by the type and pattern of opacities and zonal distribution. RESULTS: Patchy infiltration (34.6%), lobar consolidation (30.8%), and interstitial infiltration (26.9%) with airbronchogram (38.5%) were the predominant findings in our patients. Bilateral distribution was seen in 80.8% of the patients. Only one patient (3.8%) showed ground-glass opacity, predominant radiographic finding in the previous reports and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). CONCLUSIONS: The most common thoracic CT findings in pandemic H1N1 were patchy infiltration, lobar consolidation, and interstitial infiltration with airbronchogram and bilateral distribution.

Topical NSAIDs are thought to afford efficacy that is comparable to oral formulations while reducing widespread systemic drug exposure, which may provide a benefit in terms of safety and tolerability. As a result, European treatment guidelines have, for many years, recommended the use of topical NSAIDs as a safe and effective treatment option for OA. Following the recent approval of several topical NSAID formulations by the US Food and Drug Administration, US treatment guidelines are increasingly recommending the use of topical NSAIDs as an alternative therapy and, in some cases, as a first-line option for OA. This commentary summarizes OA treatment guidelines that are currently available and discusses their potential evolution with regard to the increased inclusion of topical NSAIDs.","output":"Evolving guidelines in the use of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of osteoarthritis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: COVID-19 infection has manifested as a major threat to both patients and healthcare providers around the world. Radiation oncology institutions (ROI) deliver a major component of cancer treatment, with protocols that might span over several weeks, with the result of increasing susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and presenting with a more severe clinical course when compared with the general population. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate the impact of ROI protocols and performance on daily practice in the high-risk cancer patients during this pandemic. METHODS: We addressed the incidence of positive COVID-19 cases in both patients and health care workers (HCW), in addition to the protective measures adopted in ROIs in Germany, Austria and Switzerland using a specific questionnaire. RESULTS: The results of the questionnaire showed that a noteworthy number of ROIs were able to complete treatment in SARS-CoV?2 positive cancer patients, with only a short interruption. The ROIs reported a significant decrease in patient volume that was not impacted by the circumambient disease incidence, the type of ROI or the occurrence of positive cases. Of the ROIs 16.5% also reported infected HCWs. About half of the ROIs (50.5%) adopted a screening program for patients whereas only 23.3% also screened their HCWs. The range of protective measures included the creation of working groups, instituting home office work and protection with face masks. Regarding the therapeutic options offered, curative procedures were performed with either unchanged or moderately decreased schedules, whereas palliative or benign radiotherapy procedures were more often shortened. Most ROIs postponed or cancelled radiation treatment for benign indications (88.1%). The occurrence of SARS-CoV?2 infections did not affect the treatment options for curative procedures. Non-university-based ROIs seemed to be more willing to change their treatment options for curative and palliative cases than university-based ROIs. CONCLUSION: Most ROIs reported a deep impact of SARS-CoV?2 infections on their work routine. Modification and prioritization of treatment regimens and the application of protective measures preserved a well-functioning radiation oncology service and patient care.

Thus a research was conducted to examine the comparative use of water during pre- and post-COVID-19 lockdown pattern among post-primary schools in Iwo, Osun State, Nigeria. A survey was conducted among fifteen schools which were randomly selected, but with eight public and seven private schools for the investigation. Both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were used in data analysis. The results revealed that the major source of water to the schools investigated is ground water which is obtained through hand-dug wells and boreholes. It was further discovered that there was increase in water use during post-COVID-19 lockdown era as a result of the directive by the government that clean water should be provided for hand-washing by all schools regardless of the owner to curtail the spread of COVID-19 disease in the country. One sample t-test also revealed that there was a significant difference in water use at (p<0.01) level. It is recommended that the government and other stakeholders in water sector to ensure that all-time and non-seasonal dependent source of water be provided rather than ground water source which is susceptible to variations in water yields from seasonal variations.

A test group of 25 patients was used to validate the CNN qualitatively and quantitatively with 5 different image sets per patient: 4 min/bed position, 1.5 min/bed position with and without CNN, and 1 min/bed position with and without CNN. RESULTS: Difference in hotspot maximum or peak standardized uptake value between the standard 1.5 min and 1.5 min CNN images fell short of significance.

Methods: In this multicenter study we enrolled 543 patients, 57.8% males, median age 63 years (range 18-99) from three selected hospitals: University Hospital Tor Vergata in Rome, Fondazione IRCCS Ca 'Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, in Milan, S Chiara Hospital in Trento. We measured hs-cTnT in all patients to assess myocardial injury and correlations with patient's age, symptoms and disease course. Results: The data showed that, among the 543 patients studied, 257 patients (47.3%) had hs-cTnT values higher than the upper reference limit (URL) of 14 ng/L. Patients with high hs-cTnT had more frequently fever (p <0.01) and respiratory symptoms (p <0.01), compared to the group with hs-cTnT values below URL. The results showed also that patients with hs-cTnT above URL had a higher frequency of previous cardiovascular disease (p <0.01) as well as of hypertension (p<0.01). Instead, among 231 patients with no previous cardiovascular disease, 81 (31.5%) had hs-cTnT values above the URL.

METHODS: This study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee. A total of 82 patients with COVID-19 admitted from 10/1/202015/3/2020 were enrolled. RPA and perinephric fat stranding (PFS) were evaluated on NECT imaging. According to the presence of PFS, the patients were divided into two groups: Group A, 38 patients with PFS, and Group B, 44 patients without PFS. Clinical data, including age, gender, clinical classification, SCr levels, and RPA on NECT were analysed. The RPA and SCr of the two groups with COVID-19 were analysed to determine possible difference and correlation. Eighty subjects with no kidney diseases were randomly selected as control group to determine the RPA of normal kidney performed on the same CT scanner. RESULTS: Mean age, male to female ratio, number of severe and critical cases, and SCr of Group A were higher than those of Group B. Both mean RPA of Group A and Group B were lower than that of control. Mean RPA of Group A was even lower than that of Group B. A significant weak negative linear correlation between RPA on NECT and SCr in COVID-19 was indicated. CONCLUSIONS: Decrease in RPA on NECT was observed in patients with COVID-19 and a weak linear negative correlation with SCr levels was found. The presence of PFS suggested more severe renal impairment in COVID-19. RPA measurements and PFS could be useful in quantitative and qualitative evaluation of COVID-19 associated renal impairment on admission.","output":"COVID-19 associated kidney impairment in adult: qualitative and quantitative analyses with non-enhanced CT on admission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The exceptional competitiveness of the orthopedic surgery specialty, combined with the unclear impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on residency recruitment, has presented significant challenges to applicants and residency program directors. With limited in-person opportunities in the 2020-2021 application cycle, applicants have been pressed to gauge chances and best fit by browsing program websites. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the accessibility and content of accredited orthopedic surgery residency program websites during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using the online database of the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS), we compiled a list of accredited orthopedic surgery residency programs in the United States. Program websites were evaluated across four domains: program overview, education, research opportunities, and application details. Each website was assessed twice in July 2020, during a period of adjustment to the COVID-19 pandemic, and twice in November 2020, following the October ERAS application deadline. RESULTS: A total of 189 accredited orthopedic surgery residency programs were identified through ERAS. Of these programs, 3 (1.6%) did not have functional website links on ERAS. Data analysis of content in each domain revealed that most websites included program details, a description of the didactic curriculum, and sample rotation schedules. Between the two evaluation periods in July and November 2020, the percentage of program websites containing informative videos and virtual tours rose from 12.2% (23/189) to 48.1% (91/189; P<.001) and from 0.5% (1/189) to 13.2% (25/189; P<.001), respectively. However, the number of programs that included information about a virtual subinternship or virtual interview on their websites did not change. Over the 4-month period, larger residency programs with 5 or more residents were significantly more likely to add a program video (P<.001) or virtual tour (P<.001) to their websites. CONCLUSIONS: Most residency program websites offered program details and an overview of educational and research opportunities; however, few addressed the virtual transition of interviews and subinternships during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Orthopedic Surgery Residency Program Website Content and Accessibility During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Sarcopenia is an inevitable component of aging. It is officially recognized as a muscle disease with an ICD-10-MC diagnosis code that can be used to bill for care in some countries. Sarcopenia can be classified into primary or age-related sarcopenia and secondary sarcopenia. The condition is referred to as secondary sarcopenia when any other comorbidities are present in conjunction with aging. Secondary sarcopenia is more prevalent than primary sarcopenia and requires special attention. Exercise interventions may help in our understanding and prevention of sarcopenia with a specific morbidity Glomerular filtration rate that exercise improves muscle mass, quality or physical function in elderly subjects with cancer, type 2 diabetes, kidney diseases and lung diseases. In this review, we summarize recent research that has studied the impact of exercise on patients with secondary sarcopenia, specifically those with one comorbid condition. We did not discover any exercise intervention specifically for subjects with secondary sarcopenia (with one comorbidity). Even though there is a strong argument for using exercise to improve muscle mass, quality or physical function in subjects with cancer, type 2 diabetes, kidney diseases, lung diseases and many more, very few studies have reported baseline sarcopenia assessments. Based on the trials summarized in this review, we may propose but not conclude that resistance, aerobic, balance training or even walking can be useful in subjects with secondary sarcopenia with only one comorbidity due to the limited number of trials. This review is significant because it reveals the need for broad-ranging research initiatives involving secondary sarcopenic patients and highlights a large secondary sarcopenia research gap. ABSTRACT: Background: Sarcopenia has been recognized as an inevitable part of aging. However, its severity and the age at which it begins cannot be predicted by age alone. The condition can be categorized into primary or age-related sarcopenia and secondary sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is diagnosed as primary when there are no other specific causes. However, secondary sarcopenia occurs if other factors, including malignancy or organ failure, are evident in addition to aging. The prevalence of secondary sarcopenia is far greater than that of primary sarcopenia and requires special attention. To date, nutrition and exercise have proven to be the best methods to combat this disease. The impact of exercise on subjects suffering from sarcopenia with a specific morbidity is worthy of examination for understanding and prevention. The purpose of this review, therefore, is to summarize recent research that has investigated the impact of exercise in patients with secondary sarcopenia, specifically with one comorbidity. Methods: Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase and Medline databases were searched comprehensively with no date limit for randomized controlled trials. The literature was specifically searched for clinical trials in which subjects were sarcopenic with only one comorbidity participating in an exercise intervention. The most visible comorbidities identified and used in the search were lung disease, kidney disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, neurological diseases, osteoporosis and arthritis. Results: A total of 1752 studies were identified that matched the keywords. After removing duplicates, there were 1317 articles remaining. We extracted 98 articles for full screening. Finally, we included 21 relevant papers that were used in this review. Conclusion: Despite a strong rationale for using exercise to improve muscle mass, quality or physical function in subjects with cancer, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, lung disease and many more, baseline sarcopenia evaluation has been reported in very few trials. The limited number of studies does not allow us to conclude that exercise can improve sarcopenia in patients with other comorbidities.

We prospectively recruited four uncomplicated COVID-19 patients and four healthy controls (HCs) and evaluated the immune cell profile throughout the disease course. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected and submitted to a multi-panel flowcytometric assay. CD19(+)-B cells were upregulated, while CD4, CD8, and NK cells were downregulated in prolonged VRS patients. Additionally, the pro-inflammatory-Th1 population showed downregulation, followed by improvement along the disease course, while the immunoregulatory cells showed upregulation with subsequent decline. COVID-19 patients with longer VRS expressed an immune profile comparable to those with severe disease, although they remained clinically stable.

For the past months, the strategy was to mitigate infection risk for the healthcare team while still providing essential service to patients. Prolonged suspension of the outpatient clinics and endoscopy practice, however, is deemed unsustainable and could even be detrimental. It can compromise patient care and result in poor outcomes; hence, a well-crafted plan is needed for the gradual resumption of clinic operations and endoscopic procedures. SUMMARY: As the world begins to transition to the new normal, there are new health and safety issues to consider. Adaptive measures like telemedicine and electronic health records should be utilized to facilitate patient care while minimizing exposure. Careful patient screening, adequate supply of personal protective equipment, effective infection-control policies, as well as appropriate administrative modifications are needed for a safe return of gastroenterology practice. KEY MESSAGES: Ensuring the safety of patients, caregivers, and healthcare workers should remain as top priority. To help ease the transition as we move forward from this pandemic, we present a review of recommendations to guide gastroenterologists and endoscopy unit administrators in the gradual return to gastroenterology practice.","output":"Moving Forward: Gradual Return of Gastroenterology Practice during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The government of India is busy with many development projects, building infrastructures, introducing innovative technologies and expanding roadways that pave the way for future generations.

Word-representable graphs generalise several important and well-studied classes of graphs, and they can be characterised by semi-transitive orientations. Recognising word-representability is an NP-complete problem, and the bottleneck of the theory of word-representable graphs is how to convince someone, e.g.\\\\ a referee, that a graph is non-word-representable keeping in mind that references to (publicly available) software are not always welcome? (Word-representability can be justified by providing a semi-transitive orientation as a certificate that can be checked in polynomial time.) In the literature, a variety of (usually ad hoc) proofs of non-word-representability for particular graphs, or families of graphs, appear, but for a randomly selected graph, one should expect looking at $O(2^{\\\\#\\\\mbox{edges}})$ orientations and justifying that none of them is semi-transitive. Even if computer would print out all these orientations and would point out what is wrong with each of the orientations, such a proof would be essentially non-checkable by a human.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 7799 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospitals of Kermanshah province. Data gathered from February 18 to July 9, 2020, were obtained from the vice-chancellor for the health of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences. The performance of the models was compared according to the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: According to the decision tree model, the most important risk factors for death due to COVID-19 were age, body temperature, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), prior hospital visit within the last 14 days, and cardiovascular disease. Also, the multivariate logistic regression model showed that the variables of age [OR = 4.47, 95% CI: (3.16 -6.32)], shortness of breath [OR = 1.42, 95% CI: (1.0-2.01)], ICU admission [OR = 3.75, 95% CI: (2.47-5.68)], abnormal chest X-ray [OR = 1.93, 95% CI: (1.06-3.41)], liver disease [OR = 5.05, 95% CI (1.020-25.2)], body temperature [OR = 4.93, 95% CI: (2.17-6.25)], and cardiovascular disease [OR = 2.15, 95% CI: (1.27-3.06)] were significantly associated with the higher mortality of patients with COVID-19.

Understanding the mechanisms of their replication has important implications for global health and economic stability. Nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9) is an essential RNA binding protein for coronavirus replication. However, the mechanisms of the dimerization and nucleic acid binding of nsp9 remain elusive. Here, we report four crystal structures, including wild-type porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) nsp9, PDCoV nsp9-N7 (N-terminal 7 amino acids deleted), wild-type porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) nsp9, and PEDV nsp9-C59A mutant. These structures reveal the diverse dimerization forms of coronavirus nsp9. We first found that the N-finger of nsp9 from PDCoV plays a critical role in dimerization. Meanwhile, PEDV nsp9 is distinguished by the presence of a disulfide bond in the dimer interface. Interestingly, size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses indicate that the PDCoV nsp9-N7 and PEDV nsp9-C59A mutants are monomeric in solution. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and microscale thermophoresis analysis indicate that the monomeric forms of PDCoV nsp9 and PEDV nsp9 still have nucleic acid binding affinity, although it is lower than that of the wild type. Our results show that the diverse dimerization forms of coronavirus nsp9 proteins enhance their nucleic acid binding affinity.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses cause widespread respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system diseases in humans and other animals, threatening human health and causing economic loss.

Although a variety of locating devices are commercially available, their adoption has remained low in the past years. Several studies have explored barriers to the adoption of assistive technologies from the perspective of professional stakeholders, but in-depth explorations for locating technologies are sparse. Additionally, the inputs of business professionals are lacking. The aim of this study was to expand knowledge on barriers to the adoption of locating technologies from a multi-stakeholder professional perspective, and to explore strategies to optimize adoption. METHODS: In total, 22 professionals working in business (n = 7), healthcare (n = 6) and research (n = 9) fields related to gerontology and gerontechnology participated in our focus group study. Perceptions on the value of using locating technologies for dementia care, barriers to their adoption, as well as salient services and information dissemination strategies were explored. After verbatim transcription, transcripts were analysed following an inductive data-driven content analysis approach in MAXQDA. RESULTS: Six key adoption barriers centering on: (1) awareness-, (2) technological-, (3) product characteristic- and (4) capital investment-based limitations, (5) unclear benefits, as well as (6) ethical concerns emerged. The interplay between barriers was high. Five core themes on services and information dissemination strategies centering on: (1) digital autonomy support, (2) emergency support, (3) information dissemination actors, (4) product acquisition, and (5) product advertising were extracted. CONCLUSIONS: Our study with interdisciplinary stakeholders expands knowledge on barriers to the adoption of locating technologies for dementia care, and reinforces recommendations that an interdisciplinary strategy is needed to optimize adoption.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the health of athletes during COVID-19-related school closures and sport cancellations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: A national sample recruited via social media. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 13a??002 US adolescent athletes (age = 16.3  1.2 years, females = 52.9%, males = 47.0%) completed an anonymous online survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Demographic information collected was sex, grade, sport(s) played, and zip code. Assessments used were the General Anxiety Disorder 7-Item for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 for quality of life. Mental health, physical activity, and health-related quality-of-life variables were compared among sex, grade, sport(s) played, and poverty level using means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from the survey-weighted analysis of variance. RESULTS: Females reported a higher prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (females = 43.7% versus males = 28.2%). The Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale score was highest (best) for grade 9 (mean = 14.5, 95% CI = 14.0, 15.0) and lowest for grade 11 (mean = 10.9, 95% CI = 10.5, 11.3. The prevalence of depression symptoms was highest in team sport (74.1%) and lowest in individual sport (64.9%) participants. The total Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory score was lowest (worst) for athletes from counties with the highest poverty levels (high: mean = 74.5, 95% CI = 73.7, 75.3; middle: mean = 78.9, 95% CI = 78.0, 79.8; and low: mean = 78.3, 95% CI = 77.4, 79.1). CONCLUSIONS: The health of US adolescents during the COVID-19-related school closures and sport cancellations varied to differing degrees depending on sex, grade level, type of sport participation, and level of poverty.

Accurate characterization of tissue and delineation of resection margins are, therefore, essential to achieve optimal surgical results. Objectives The primary objective of this study was to develop and validate a mass spectrometry- based technique for the molecular characterization of high- and low-grade glioma tissue during surgery. Methods An electrosurgical knife is connected to a mass spectrometer (iKnife). Using this system, an aerosol created during electrosurgical resection is aspirated to a mass spectrometer to determine the molecular profile of the tissue within seconds. This rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) technique is used to create a chemical profile database and develop a real-time tissue recognition system based on machine learning. Results Classification models were built by analysing biopsies from 36 patients who underwent brain tumour resection. Our multivariate statistical model could differentiate between astrocytoma grade II and III, glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma grade II and III, and normal brain tissue with an 88% overall accuracy. Astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma grade II were separated from normal brain with a 96% correct classification rate. REIMS could differentiate between different percentages of GBM with 99.2% sensitivity and different percentages of astrocytoma grade II with 97.5% sensitivity. Conclusion Real-time information during electrosurgical dissection can improve intra-operative decision-making, leading to a more accurate tumour removal for different glioma subtypes.","output":"Towards real-time intraoperative tissue interrogation for REIMS-guided glioma surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Open innovation allows the hotel industry to create platforms and channels for collaboration with its customers, which results in a better understanding of their tastes and demands. In the current environment, which is full of uncertainty, many companies have seen their profits decrease, and even the permanence of their businesses endangered due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In such an environment, it is even more necessary to take into account the customers opinion about the service received, since once the customer makes use of the hotels services, he/she will recommend the hotel to third parties if he/she is satisfied with it. Through customer satisfaction and subsequent recommendations, the hotel thus obtains new clients and retains old ones. This feedback from the client allows for understanding their priorities in order to jointly design a tailor-made service. It is for this reason that this research has been carried out to analyze the service attributes evaluated by customers. In order to achieve the proposed objectives, a survey instrument was used, as well as a longitudinal study procedure applying logistic regression over a period of one year. The descriptive results and the logistic regression show the level of customer satisfaction with the service and the importance given to each of the selected attributes. In this way, the research shows in which areas innovation strategies should be sought. Although the research offers a model composed of five attributes to measure satisfaction through recommendation with a probability of more than fifty percent, it is necessary to take into account the limitations of the current environment due to COVID-19 or the possibility of extending the multidimensionality of the model. It is necessary to continue to work through open innovation platforms to keep contact with the customer and to update the examined attributes in order to obtain customer satisfaction and feedback. ? 2021 by the authors.

Iran was among the first countries that had to confront serious shortages in reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and ventilators availabilities throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the clinical course of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with different real-time RT-PCR test results during the first three weeks of the outbreak in Qazvin province, Iran. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, patients with a positive chest computed tomography (CT) scan for COVID-19 who were admitted to all 12 hospitals across Qazvin province, Iran, between February 20 and March 11, 2020, were included and followed up until March 27, 2020. A multivariate logistic regression model was applied to compare the independent associates of death among COVID-19 patients. Then, patients were categorized into six groups based on admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and rRT-PCR test status (positive, negative, or no test). Also, multilevel logistic regression was used to compare the odds of surviving in each group against the reference group (PCR negative patients not-received ICU) to show if the rational allocation of ICU occurred while its capacity is limited. Results: In this study, we included 998 patients (57% male;median age: 54 years) with positive chest CT scan changes. Among them, 558 patients were examined with rRT-PCR test and 73.8% tested positive. Case fatality rate (CFR) was 20.68 and 7.53% among hospitalized patients with positive and negative tests, respectively. While only 5.2% of patients were admitted to the ICU, CFR outside ICU was 17.70 and 4.65% in patients with positive and negative results not admitted to the ICU, respectively. Conclusions: Total CFR in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Qazvin province during the first three weeks of the pandemic was 11.7%. Also, according to the results, the main risk factors included a positive rRT-PCR test, age more than 70 years, and having two or more comorbidities or just immunodeficiency disorders. Hence, the ICU admission criteria or prioritized ICU beds allocation should be considered with more emphasis on rRT-PCR results when the capacity of ICU beds is low.","output":"Association Between rRT-PCR Test Results Upon Admission and Outcome in Hospitalized Chest CT-Positive COVID-19 Patients: A Provincial Retrospective Cohort with Active Follow-up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 is the coronavirus responsible for the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

Many studies support the overall safety of this sedation; however, adverse cardiovascular and respiratory events are reported in up to 70% of these procedures, more frequently in very young, very old, or sicker patients. Monitoring with pulse oximetry may underreport hypoventilation during sedation, particularly if supplemental oxygen is provided. Capnometry may result in false alarms during sedation when patients mouth breathe or displace sampling devices. Advanced monitor use during sedation may allow event detection before complications develop. This 2-part pilot study used advanced monitors during planned moderate sedation to (1) determine incidences of desaturation, low respiratory rate, and deeper than intended sedation alarm events; and (2) determine whether advanced monitor use is associated with fewer alarm events. METHODS Adult patients undergoing scheduled gastroenterology or interventional radiology procedures with planned moderate sedation given by dedicated sedation nurses under the direction of procedural physicians (procedural sedation team) were monitored per standard protocols (electrocardiography blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and capnometry) and advanced monitors (acoustic respiratory monitoring and processed electroencephalograpy). Data were collected to computers for analysis. Advanced monitor parameters were not visible to teams in part 1 (standard) but were visible to teams in part 2 (advanced). Alarm events were defined as desaturation-SpO2 92%; respiratory depression, acoustic respiratory rate 8 breaths per minute, and deeper than intended sedation, indicated by processed electroencephalograpy. The number of alarm events was compared. RESULTS Of 100 patients enrolled, 10 were excluded for data collection computer malfunction or consent withdrawal. Data were analyzed from 90 patients (44 standard and 46 advanced). Advanced had fewer total alarms than standard (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney = 2.073, P = 0.038; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney odds, 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.88). Similar numbers of standard and advanced had 1 alarm event (Wald difference, -10.2%; 95% CI, -26.4% to 7.0%; P = 0.237). Fewer advanced patients had 1 respiratory depression event (Wald difference, -22.1%; 95% CI, -40.9% to -2.4%; P = 0.036) or 1 desaturation event (Wald difference, -24.2%; 95% CI, -42.8% to -3.6%; P = 0.021); but there was no significant difference in deeper than intended sedation events (Wald difference, -1.38%; 95% CI, -20.21% to 17.49%; P = 0.887). CONCLUSIONS Use of advanced monitoring parameters during planned moderate sedation was associated with fewer alarm events, patients experiencing desaturation, and patients experiencing respiratory depression alarm events.

Lung Ultrasound (LUS) is a rapid, easy-to-perform, low cost tool which allows bedside investigation of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We aimed to investigate the typical ultrasound patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia and their evolution at different stages of the disease. METHODS: We performed LUS in twenty-eight consecutive COVID-19 patients at both admission to and discharge from one of the Padua University Hospital Intensive Care Units (ICU). LUS was performed using a low frequency probe on six different areas per each hemithorax. A specific pattern for each area was assigned, depending on the prevalence of A-lines (A), non-coalescent B-lines (B1), coalescent B-lines (B2), consolidations (C). A LUS score (LUSS) was calculated after assigning to each area a defined pattern. RESULTS: Out of 28 patients, 18 survived, were stabilized and then referred to other units. The prevalence of C pattern was 58.9% on admission and 61.3% at discharge. Type B2 (19.3%) and B1 (6.5%) patterns were found in 25.8% of the videos recorded on admission and 27.1% (17.3% B2; 9.8% B1) on discharge. The A pattern was prevalent in the anterosuperior regions and was present in 15.2% of videos on admission and 11.6% at discharge. The median LUSS on admission was 27.5 [21C32.25], while on discharge was 31 [17.5C32.75] and 30.5 [27C32.75] in respectively survived and non-survived patients. On admission the median LUSS was equally distributed on the right hemithorax (13; 10.75C16) and the left hemithorax (15; 10.75C17). CONCLUSIONS: LUS collected in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure at ICU admission and discharge appears to be characterized by predominantly lateral and posterior non-translobar C pattern and B2 pattern. The calculated LUSS remained elevated at discharge without significant difference from admission in both groups of survived and non-survived patients.","output":"Patients in intensive care unit for COVID-19 pneumonia: the lung ultrasound patterns at admission and discharge.

Therefore the objective of this study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the maternal mortality in the State of Bahia, Brazil. Methods: This study used state databases for data on maternal deaths and live births in Bahia, Brazil, from January 1, 2011 to September 30, 2020. The time trend of MMR was analyzed through polynomial regression analysis, of order 6. Predict monthly (Jan-Sep) and annual values,??for 2020, were estimated by the additive Holt-Winters exponential smoothing algorithm, with 95% confidence interval, and the accuracy MMR forecasts for 2020 was assessed by checking the smoothing coefficients and the mean errors. Results: Between January 1 and September 30, 2020, the MMR in Bahia, Brazil, was 79.51/100,000 live births, 60.7% higher than the expected ratio (49.48 [95% CI 60.27-38.70]). The increase on maternal mortality ratio relative to expected values was observed throughout the 2020 months. However, only from May, when the COVID-19 epidemic rose sharply, it exceeded the upper limit of the 95% CI of the monthly prediction. In August, we can observe a dramatical decrease in the maternal mortality ratio, followed by an increase in September.

The vaccine included A/NewCaledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/NewYork/55/2004 (H3N2), and B/Shanghai/361/2002 viral strains and was administered together with poly(I):poly(C(12)U) (Ampligen) as an adjuvant. At 14 days after the final inoculation, the inoculated mice were challenged with either the A/HongKong/483/97, the A/Vietnam/1194/04, or the A/Indonesia/6/05 strain of H5N1 influenza virus. Results. Compared with noninoculated mice, those inoculated intranasally manifested cross-reactivity of mucosal IgA and serum IgG with H5N1 virus, as well as both a reduced H5N1 virus titer in nasal-wash samples and increased survival, after challenge with H5N1 virus. Subcutaneous inoculation did not induce a cross-reactive IgA response and did not afford protection against H5N1 viral infection. Conclusions.

The clinic worked due to the established protocol, the patient's circuit was changed, with the buffer zone for the suspicious COVID-19 patient, where the patient was hospitalized until the negative PCR result. All patients having a negative PCR test benefited from both medical and / or surgical treatment depending on the type of ocular pathology. Results: 619 patients were examined in the emergency room, of which 61 patients were hospitalized in Clinic I Ophthalmology, \\"Sf. Spiridon\\" Hospital in Iasi, between March 16 and May 16, 2020. Most patients (59%) came from the neighboring counties (Suceava, Vaslui, Piatra Neamt, Bacau) the rest being from Iasi (41%). The age varied from 2 to 87 years, the average age being 51.72 +/- 22.16. Most frequently, patients were hospitalized with retinal detachment (29.5%), trauma (24.6%) and corneal sclerosis (13.1%), most cases being surgical. The average length of stay was 6.3 days. The average time of surgery stages was 45 minutes. The condition at discharge was in 60% of cases improved and 30% cured. All patients tested negative for COVID-19 PCR. Visual acuity and IOP showed slightly higher / lower changes at discharge than at the time of admission. Depending on the diagnosis, the average stay for the patients with retinal detachment was about 4 days, while for patients with glaucoma (13 days) or ulcer corneal (12 days), the long-term hospitalization exceeded 12 days.

Meta-analyses of pre-operative pain measurements resulted in a mean difference of -5.85 95% CI [-14.90; 3.19] on a 0-100 Visual Analogue Scale with a p-value of 0.17 and a very low certainty of evidence according to the GRADE rating. CONCLUSIONS We did not find a difference in pre-operative pain at rest between epidural analgesia and any other method of pre-operatively initiated analgesia. The studies were few, of low quality and the difference between the two interventions remains unknown. EDITORIAL COMMENT This trustworthy systematic review highlights that the existing evidence supporting preoperative epidural analgesia in patients with hip fracture is sparse and of low quality, with no firm evidence for benefit or harm.","output":"Pre-operative epidural analgesia in hip fracture patients - A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recognition of cell-surface glycans is an important step in the attachment of several viruses to susceptible host cells. The molecular basis of glycan interactions and their functional consequences are well studied for human norovirus (HuNoV), an important gastrointestinal pathogen. Histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), a family of fucosylated carbohydrate structures that are present on the cell surface, are utilized by HuNoVs to initially bind to cells. In this review, we describe the discovery of HBGAs as genetic susceptibility factors for HuNoV infection and review biochemical and structural studies investigating HuNoV binding to different HBGA glycans. Recently, human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) were developed as a laboratory cultivation system for HuNoV. We review how the use of this novel culture system has confirmed that fucosylated HBGAs are necessary and sufficient for infection by several HuNoV strains, describe mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization of infection that involve blocking of HuNoV binding to HBGAs, and discuss the potential for using the HIE model to answer unresolved questions on viral interactions with HBGAs and other glycans.","output":"Glycan Recognition in Human Norovirus Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:&nbsp;School closures due to Covid-19 have left 1.6 billion students around the world without in-person classes for a prolonged period of time.To date, no study has documented whether reopening schools in developing countries during the pandemic causally increased aggregate Covid-19 incidence and mortality with appropriate counterfactuals. Methods: We take advantage of the fact that 131 municipalities in S?o Paulo State, Brazil, reopened schools for in-person activities between October and December 2020, to estimate the causal effects of school reopening on municipal-level Covid-19 effective potential growth and deaths. We estimate treatment effects through a differences-in-differences strategy, comparing how outcomes evolved between municipalities that reopened schools and all others, before and after school reopening. We also estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by local characteristics. Last, we estimate the effects of school reopening on a local mobility index to shed light on the mechanisms behind its impacts on disease activity.\\\\ Findings: We find that school reopening did not increase Covid-19 incidence or mortality on average, up to 12 weeks after reopening. The counterfactual is critical for our conclusions: comparing only municipalities that reopened schools before and after reopening would lead us to conclude the opposite. Reopening schools did not affect disease activity even in poorer municipalities, in those with low-quality school infrastructure, with higher senior population share, or with higher baseline disease activity. We also find no effects of school reopening on the local mobility index. Interpretation: While keeping schools open during the pandemic could still increase risks for school staff and studentsfamilies, our findings suggest that it did not contribute to the aggregate disease activity. This was the case not only because schools typically represent only a small fraction of the overall municipal population, but also because counterfactual mobility during the pandemic was already substantial even in the absence of in-person classes Cmaking the marginal health benefits of keeping schools closed negligible in the aggregate.

The strategy of \\"Attack and Defend\\" was attempted to mitigate COVID-19 crisis worldwide. A list of precautionary measures were set by healthcare professional experts to protect public from infection, social physical distancing measures being the most efficient. On the other hand, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established protective guidelines for healthcare workers to guarantee a healthy workplace and safe environment. The physical distancing measures have obviously reshaped the relationship between family members leading to better quality of family life. Meanwhile, travel suspension also led to slightly higher health standards with less air pollution, lower traffic induced stress levels and subsequently a greener footprint. Herein, we intend to highlight the impact of COVID-19 pandemic protective measures on family connections, as well as on environmental health. Moreover, we aimed at pointing out the effect on Saudi Arabian cultural and humanitarian behavior in dealing with the pandemic under the governance care of the custodian of the two holy mosques; King Salman Al-Saud. In fact, a combination of restrictive and protective measures is the most efficient to curb COVID-19 spread. In addition to improving the quality of social life, this pandemic revealed a healthier climate, which will certainly be visible on a large scale. Certainly, all together with solidarity we will be able to restrain COVID-19 pandemic and have a better quality of life.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic's precautionary measures had hit the reset button of the quality of life at different aspects"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(D,[["render",P]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/38.md","filePath":"drive/38.md"}'),V={name:"drive/38.md"},z=Object.assign(V,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(R)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
