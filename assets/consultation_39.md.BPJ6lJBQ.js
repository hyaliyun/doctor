Still, the evidence for people with dementia in home care is unclear because a lot of studies are performed in a laboratory or institutional setting, and mainly use robots in prototype stages. OBJECTIVE This study aims to explore the effects of the refined, commercially-available, humanoid SAR Pepper combined with a tablet PC-based dementia training program (Coach Pepper) versus an exclusively tablet PC-based dementia training program on psychosocial and physical outcomes of people with dementia living at home, including caregivers and dementia trainers. We hypothesize that Coach Pepper has a more positive effect on the primary outcome motivation (stable or decreased apathy) of people with dementia. METHODS A mixed methods study will be performed, including a randomized controlled, parallel, 2-arm study with a complementary qualitative part. This sample includes 40 PWD living at home and 40 relatives, each complemented with five professional caregivers and dementia trainers. The intervention group will receive Coach Pepper (a SAR connected with a tablet PC-based dementia training program), and the control group will receive exclusively tablet PC-based training without the SAR. The duration of the intervention will be three weeks per household. Data will be collected at baseline and during and after the intervention by standardized questionnaires, sensor data of the robot, and tablet PC, as well as semistructured interviews, focus groups, and observation. RESULTS To date, no results are available for this study protocol. The study intervention started in May 2019 and will end in Spring 2020. CONCLUSIONS The intervention of this study can be seen as a nonpharmacological intervention, including cognitive and physical training by a robot.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of unidirectional barbed suture (V-LocTM 180; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) with the conventional polyglactin 910 suture (coated Vicryl; Covidien) for vaginal cuff closure in patients with benign uterine diseases undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Methods A prospective observational study was carried out at the department of obstetrics and gynecology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Rishikesh, for two years. A total of 109 patients with benign uterine diseases planned for TLH were included in the study. Laparoscopic vaginal cuff closure was performed with the unidirectional barbed suture (V-Loc) in 44 patients and with the standard polyglactin 910 suture (Vicryl) in 65 patients. The primary outcome measure was vaginal cuff closure time. Secondary outcome measures included total operative time, blood loss, average number of stitches, postoperative pain perception, duration of hospital stay, vaginal cuff-related complications, and dyspareunia. Results Demographic variables and baseline characteristics were similar in both groups except for body mass index (BMI). The mean vaginal cuff closure time was significantly less in the V-Loc group (8.84  2.18 min) than in the Vicryl group (11.66  1.74 min) (p = <0.01). Mean operative time was comparable in both groups (V-Loc group - 109.3633.02 and Vicryl group - 108.4940.48; p = 0.91). Other intraoperative parameters, such as blood loss and number of stitches in cuff closure, and postoperative characteristics, such as pain score, duration of hospital stay, vaginal cuff-related complications (vault cuff dehiscence, hematoma, or abscess), and dyspareunia, were comparable in both the groups. Conclusions The unidirectional barbed suture significantly reduces vaginal cuff closure time. It is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated alternative to conventional Vicryl suture for vaginal cuff closure in TLH without increasing the risk of postoperative vaginal complications particularly where affordability is not an issue and resources are accessible.","output":"Unidirectional Barbed Suture Versus Polyglactin 910 Suture for Vaginal Cuff Closure in Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global burden of hypertension (HTN) is immense and increasing In fact, HTN is the leading risk factor for adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes Due to the critical significance and increasing prevalence of the disease, several national and international societies have recently updated their guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HTN In consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic, this report provides clinicians with the best strategies to prevent HTN, manage the acute and long-term cardiac complications of HTN, and provide the best evidence-based care to patients in an ever-changing healthcare environment The overarching goal of the various HTN guidelines is to provide easily accessible information to healthcare providers and public health officials, which is key for optimal clinical practice However, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the ability to provide safe care to the most vulnerable hypertensive populations throughout the world Therefore, this review compares the most recent guidelines of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and multiple U S societies, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension, the 2019 National Institute for Care and Health Excellence, and the 2020 International Society of Hypertension While a partial emphasis is placed on the management of HTN in the midst of COVID-19, this review will summarize current concepts and emerging data from the listed HTN guidelines on the diagnosis, monitoring, management, and evidence-based treatments in adults","output":"State-of-the-Art Review: Hypertension Practice Guidelines in the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel disease of 2019 by name coronavirus (Covid - 19 or SARS - CoV - 2), was first detected in December of 2019 in the Seafood Market of Huanan in Wuhan region of China.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical and demographic characteristics of cluster cases and sporadic cases of COVID-19 in 141 patients in the main district of Chongqing during one month, between January and February 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study included 141 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. The diagnosis was confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. The patients were divided into cluster cases (n=90) and sporadic cases (n=51). Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the two study groups and included the presence of comorbidities, the presenting symptoms, chest computed tomography (CT) imaging findings, and laboratory findings. RESULTS The mean age of the 141 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was 47.3 years, and the most common presenting symptom was a persistent cough (48.9%). The 90 cluster cases (63.8%) were older than the sporadic cases, and cross-infection from family gathering occurred in 82.2%, and cough was more common than fever, and there was an increased prevalence of asymptomatic, mild, and moderate cases. Cluster cases showed fewer typical manifestations of COVID-19 on chest CT. However, the laboratory findings between the cluster and sporadic cases showed no significant differences.

Recent studies have examined the performance of fabrics under various conditions; however, the performance against violent respiratory events such as human sneezes is yet to be explored. Accordingly, we present a comprehensive experimental study using sneezes by a healthy adult and a tailored image-based flow measurement diagnostic system evaluating all dimensions of protection of commonly available fabrics and their layered combinations: the respiratory droplet blocking efficiency, water resistance, and breathing resistance. Our results reveal that a well-designed cloth mask can outperform a three-layered surgical mask for such violent respiratory events. Specifically, increasing the number of layers significantly increases the droplet blocking efficiency, on average by a??20 times per additional fabric layer. A minimum of three layers is necessary to resemble the droplet blocking performance of surgical masks, and a combination of cotton/linen (hydrophilic inner layer)-blends (middle layer)-polyester/nylon (hydrophobic outer layer) exhibited the best performance among overall indicators tested. In an optimum three-layered design, the average thread count should be greater than 200, and the porosity should be less than 2%. Furthermore, machine washing at 60 C did not significantly impact the performance of cloth masks.

Covid-19-positive patients had considerably worse outcomes than patients with negative test results, with 30-day mortality rates of 24% vs 11%, but lower levels of prehospital acuity (e.g. emergent transport rates of 14% vs 22%). About half (46%) of Covid-19-positive patients presented to dispatchers with primary complaints typically associated with Covid-19. Six thousand seven hundred seventy-six records were included in the assessment of predictive value. Sensitivity was 76% (95% CI 71-80) and 82% (78-86) for dispatch and ambulance suspicion respectively, while specificities were 86% (85-87) and 78% (77-79). CONCLUSIONS: While prehospital suspicion was strongly indicative of hospital-confirmed Covid-19, based on the sensitivity identified in this study, prehospital suspicion should not be relied upon as a single factor to rule out the need for isolation precautions. The data provided may be used to develop improved guidelines for identifying Covid-19 patients in the prehospital setting.","output":"Prehospital identification of Covid-19: an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We sought to determine whether immune reactivity occurs between anti-SARS-CoV-2 protein antibodies and human tissue antigens, and whether molecular mimicry between COVID-19 viral proteins and human tissues could be the cause. We applied both human monoclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (spike protein, nucleoprotein) and rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (envelope protein, membrane protein) to 55 different tissue antigens. We found that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies had reactions with 28 out of 55 tissue antigens, representing a diversity of tissue groups that included barrier proteins, gastrointestinal, thyroid and neural tissues, and more. We also did selective epitope mapping using BLAST and showed similarities and homology between spike, nucleoprotein, and many other SARS-CoV-2 proteins with the human tissue antigens mitochondria M2, F-actin and TPO. This extensive immune cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and different antigen groups may play a role in the multi-system disease process of COVID-19, influence the severity of the disease, precipitate the onset of autoimmunity in susceptible subgroups, and potentially exacerbate autoimmunity in subjects that have pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Very recently, human monoclonal antibodies were approved for use on patients with COVID-19. The human monoclonal antibodies used in this study are almost identical with these approved antibodies. Thus, our results can establish the potential risk for autoimmunity and multi-system disorders with COVID-19 that may come from cross-reactivity between our own human tissues and this dreaded virus, and thus ensure that the badly-needed vaccines and treatments being developed for it are truly safe to use against this disease.","output":"Reaction of Human Monoclonal Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Proteins With Tissue Antigens: Implications for Autoimmune Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an ongoing global crisis challenging the worldwide healthcare systems. Many patients present with a mismatch of profound hypoxemia and few signs of respiratory distress (i.e., silent hypoxemia). This particular clinical presentation is often cited, but data are limited. MAIN BODY: We describe dyspnea sensation as assessed by using the BORG scale in pulmonary patients admitted to the emergency room during a 4-week period and transferred to the respiratory department of Siloah Hospital, Hannover, Germany. From October 1 to November 1, 2020, 82 patients with hypoxemia defined as oxygen demand to achieve an oxygen saturation (SpO2) 92% were included. In 45/82 (55%) patients, SARS-CoV-2 was detected by PCR on admission. Among non-COVID patients, exacerbation of COPD was the main diagnosis (15/37, 41%). All subjects rated their perceived dyspnea using the modified Borg CR10 scale. Patients in the non-COVID group suffered from more dyspnea on the modified Borg CR10 scale (median 1, IQR: 0C2 vs. median 5, IQR: 3C6, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, silent hypoxemia as defined by the dyspnea Borg CR10 scale 5 was independently associated with COVID-19 and presence of severe hypocapnia with an odds ratio of 0.221 (95% confidence interval 0.054, 0.907, p 0.036).

ECG, clinical data and laboratory findings during ICU stay were extracted from medical records and ECGs obtained near ICU admission were reviewed by two independent physicians. RESULTS: Eighty patients had an acceptable ECG near ICU-admission. In the entire cohort 30-day mortality was 28%. Compared to patients with normal ECG, among whom 30-day mortality was 16%, patients with ECG fulfilling criteria for prior myocardial infarction had higher mortality, 63%, odds ratio (OR) 9.61 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.02C55.6) adjusted for Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 and patients with ST-T abnormalities had 50% mortality and OR 6.05 (95% CI 1.82C21.3) in univariable analysis.

Previously, most courses were organized for students in physical presence on campus, while a few institutions already complemented these with blended learning methods, combining digital teaching with clinical presence; however, the use of digital teaching was heterogeneous, ranging from the use of PowerPoint slides to the application of virtual patients and telemedicine. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify challenges and opportunities arising from the different tools used in digital teaching, such as recorded lectures or online seminars, and the role of hands-on clinical experience. In addition, the study examined student attitudes and experiences with the nearly all-digital semester beginning in spring 2020. These findings may help to better understand the impact of digital teaching on students and provide guidance on how to optimize digital medical teaching in the future. METHODS: A questionnaire with a 5-point Likert scale was developed to assess students experiences with digital teaching at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in a cross-sectional study. The questionnaire was distributed to all medical students at the University of Mainz, Germany, who attended an anesthesiology course with asynchronously recorded lectures replacing traditional on-campus lectures during the pandemic. A total of 766 students in 4 courses met these criteria and received the online questionnaire for anonymous and voluntary response. RESULTS: A total number of 141 students responded, resulting in a response rate of 18.4%. Almost all students had access to the appropriate technology to participate in digital courses and 80.9% indicated seeing more recorded lectures compared to previous face-to-face lectures on campus. Moreover, 67.4% reported that they paused the asynchronous lectures to look up additional information and 95.7% stated that they appreciated the possibility to view lectures regardless of time and location. Hence, 84.3% said they would prefer digital lectures over face-to-face lectures in the future; however, 28.4% missed the interaction with teachers during lectures. Thus, 94.3% of the students appreciated the online seminars in terms of theoretical knowledge but the majority missed the practical aspects in the courses. Overall, 78.0% responded that the digital availability of material and digital teaching formats helped them to enhance their independent learning abilities. CONCLUSION: This study highlights several opportunities and challenges associated with digital teaching. The availability of prerecorded lectures at any time and place seems to facilitate access and increases student motivation. It also promotes individualization of student learning. Main disadvantages are the lack of communication with teachers and other students as well as the missing opportunity to reinforce the theoretical knowledge through application in practical courses, which, however, are essential for medical education. Therefore, a possible solution in the future could be the introduction of the inverted classroom concept, as it focuses on application and deepening of clinical skills in interactive classes, while the theoretical knowledge acquisition is taught in a digital teaching environment. The present study proposes the introduction of blended learning concepts to enhance the benefits of digital teaching while minimizing the identified disadvantages.","output":"Chancen und Herausforderungen der zunehmenden Digitalisierung der Lehre im Fach An?sthesiologie aus Sicht der Studierenden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of COVID-19 disease continues to be a significant psychosocial status among health care workers (HCWs) and the general population worldwide.

In the medium run, fewer trips lead to the choice of less fuel-efficient vehicles. In addition, with lower annual driving costs to the city center, households change their location in the long run toward longer commuting trips, but cheaper housing, implying an adjustment in the real-estate market. These changes in vehicle choice and the urban form largely eliminate the initial environmental benefits.

Ideally, the style transfer manipulation should also preserve the semantic content of the source image. A commonly used approach to assist in transferring styles is based on Gram matrix optimization. One problem of Gram matrix-based optimization is that it does not consider the correlation between colors and their styles.

This was conducted using two model systems, the radiolabeled porcine peptide YY (pPYY) interacting with transfected human Y2 receptor (hY2R) and the bombesin antagonist RM26 binding to the naturally expressed gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR). By following the interaction over time, the affinity and kinetic properties such as association and dissociation rate were obtained. Additionally, data were analyzed using the Interaction Map method, which can evaluate a real-time binding curve and present the number of parallel interactions contributing to the curve. It was found that pPYY binds very slowly with an estimated time to equilibrium of approximately 12h. This may be problematic in standard end-point assays where equilibrium is required. The RM26 binding showed signs of heterogeneity, observed as two parallel interactions with unique kinetic properties.

Such an approach includes a health system framework focusing on upstream or mediating components, such as a statutory regulation, leadership, an information system, and staff trained in protective disciplines. Within the classical prevention framework, primary prevention needs to be complemented by occupational health services (secondary prevention) and workers compensation (tertiary prevention). A worker-centric approach recognises the ethical implications of screening health workers, as well as the stigma perceived by those diagnosed with tuberculosis. It also provides for the voiced experience of health workers and their participation in decision-making.

The mainstay of treatment for GIST is surgical resection. Laparoscopic wedge resection of gastric GIST using linear staplers has been commonly performed and shown to be feasible and safe. However, this technique is not suitable for tumors at particular anatomical locations such as the gastric cardia near the gastroesophageal junction, the lesser curvature of stomach, and the duodenum. The robotic surgery platform with augmented surgical skills has enabled precise dissection and suturing. We consider robotic GIST excision with primary suture closure to be useful for lesions in the above-mentioned locations. In this video, we demonstrate our techniques of robotic excision of gastric and duodenal GIST.

METHODS Patient reported outcomes (PROs), including the PROMIS Anxiety and Depression Short Forms and EQ-5D-3L, were collected at the time of clinical or telehealth evaluation from the COVID year (March 2020-February 2021) and were compared to assessments through February 2020 (a NOB-normative sample), reflecting what we would typically see in our regular clinic evaluations. RESULTS The COVID sample (N = 178) was primarily White (82%), male (55%), median age of 45 (range 18C79), and KPS 3 90 (50%). The majority had high grade (70%) brain (83%) tumors with 3 1 prior recurrence (60%) and 25% were on active treatment.

We find that NPC2 binds fluorescence- and spin-labeled analogues of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol (PI), and sphingomyelin.

Human, mouse and zebrafish genomes contain 18, 17 and 24 non-keratin IntFil genes, respectively.

Risk-benefit analysis of vaccination has been challenging because of rapidly evolving data, changing levels of transmission, and age-specific variation in rates of TTS, COVID-19, and CFR. We aim to optimise risk-benefit analysis by developing a model that enables inputs to be updated rapidly as evidence evolves. A Bayesian network was used to integrate local and international data, government reports, published literature and expert opinion. The model estimates probabilities of outcomes under different scenarios of age, sex, low/medium/high transmission (0.05%/0.45%/5.76% of population infected over 6 months), SARS-CoV-2 variant, vaccine doses, and vaccine effectiveness. We used the model to compare estimated deaths from vaccine-associated TTS with i) COVID-19 deaths prevented under different scenarios, and ii) deaths from COVID-19 related atypical severe blood clots (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis & portal vein thrombosis). For a million people aged []70 years where 70% received first dose and 35% received two doses, our model estimated <1 death from TTS, 25 deaths prevented under low transmission, and >3000 deaths prevented under high transmission. Risks versus benefits varied significantly between age groups and transmission levels. Under high transmission, deaths prevented by AZ vaccine far exceed deaths from TTS (by 8 to >4500 times depending on age). Probability of dying from COVID-related atypical severe blood clots was 58-126 times higher (depending on age and sex) than dying from TTS.

Thus, we describe the frequency and distribution of CXR findings, and their association with clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: All adult (&#8805; 18 years) patients presenting between 28th February-31st May to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan, who were COVID-19 positive on RT-PCR with CXR done on presentation, were included. A CXR Severity Score (CXR-SS) of 0-8 was used to quantify the extent of pulmonary infection on CXR, with a score of 0 being negative and 1-8 being positive. The patients' initial CXR-SS and their highest CXR-SS over the hospital course were used for analysis, with cut-offs of 0-4 and 5-8 being used to assess association with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients, with 76.7% males and mean age 56.1 years, were included in this study. Initial CXR was positive in 80% of patients, and 30.7% of patients had an initial CXR-SS between 5-8. The mortality rate was 16.7% and 30.6% patients underwent ICU admission with intubation (ICU-Int). On multivariable analysis, initial CXR-SS (1.355 [1.136-1.616]) and highest CXR-SS (1.390 [1.143-1.690]) were predictors of ICU-Int, and ICU-Int was independently associated with both initial CXR-SS 5-8 (2.532 [1.109-5.782]) and highest CXR-SS 5-8 (3.386 [1.405-8.159]). Lastly, age (1.060 [1.009-1.113]), initial CXR-SS (1.278 [1.010-1.617]) and ICU-Int (5.047 [1.731-14.710]), were found to be independent predictors of mortality in our patients. CONCLUSION: In a resource-constrained country like Pakistan, CXRs may have valuable prognostic utility in predicting ICU admission and mortality. Additional research with larger patient samples is needed to further explore the association of CXR findings with clinical outcomes.","output":"The association of chest radiographic findings and severity scoring with clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has, in the span of weeks, immobilized entire countries and mobilized leading institutions worldwide in a race towards treatments and preventions.

However, not all households are equal in terms of access to home deliveries. The onset of COVID-19 has brought to light access inequalities that preceded the pandemic and that the COVID-19 lockdown has exacerbated and made visible. The concept of home-based accessibility (HBA) is introduced, and novel research questions are addressed: (i) What type of households had zero home deliveries before COVID-19 lockdown? (ii) How the COVID-19 lockdown affected the type of households that receive home deliveries? and (iii) What are the implications of no access to home delivery services in terms of equity and environmental justice? To answer the first two questions, exploratory and confirmatory models with latent variables are estimated utilizing data collected from an online survey representative of the population in the Portland metropolitan region. Policy and environmental equity implications are discussed using the concept of home-based accessibility (HBA).

Despite massive research efforts to date, the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia remain largely unknown. The difficulty of brain research is largely a result of complex interactions between contributory factors at different scales: susceptible gene variants (molecular scale), synaptopathies (synaptic, dendritic, and cell scales), and alterations in neuronal circuits (circuit scale), which together result in behavioral manifestations (individual scale). It is likely that each scale affects the others, from the microscale to the mesoscale to the macroscale, and vice versa. Thus, to consider the intricate complexity of schizophrenia across multiple layers, we introduce a multi-scale, hierarchical view of the nature of this disorder, focusing especially on N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). The reason for placing emphasis on NMDAR is its clinical relevance to schizophrenia, as well as its diverse functions in neurons, including the robust supralinear synaptic integration provided by N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate (NMDA) spikes and the Ca2+ permeability of the NMDAR, which facilitates synaptic plasticity via various calcium-dependent proteins. Here, we review recent evidence implicating NMDARs in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia from the multi-scale perspective. We also discuss recent advances from optical techniques, which provide a powerful tool for uncovering the mechanisms of NMDAR synaptic pathology and their relationships, with subsequent behavioral manifestations.","output":"Multi-Scale Understanding of NMDA Receptor Function in Schizophrenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Handel's depiction of angels was the focus of the contribution from Mark Risinger (independent scholar, New York): he discussed contemporary theological and philosophical views on their function and existence, the dramatic role of angels in librettos and the remarkable consistency in Handel's musical depiction of these beings across his career, from La resurrezione (hwv47) in 1708 to Jephtha (hwv70) in 1751.

METHODS This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO: CRD42020188552). PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for (randomised) controlled trials. Included interventions were required to target antibiotic use, be set in the community pharmacy context, and be pharmacist-led. Primary outcomes were quality of antibiotic supply and adverse effects while secondary outcomes included patient reported outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the 'Cochrane suggested risk of bias criteria' and narrative synthesis of primary outcomes conducted. RESULTS Seventeen studies were included covering in total 3,822 patients (mean age 45.6 years, 61.9% female). Most studies used educational interventions. Three studies reported on primary outcomes, twelve on secondary outcomes and two on both. Three studies reported improvements in quality of dispensing, interventions led to more intensive symptom assessment (up to 30% more advice given) and a reduction of over-the-counter supply up to 53%. Three studies led to higher consumer satisfaction, effects on adherence from nine studies were mixed (risk difference 0.04 [-0.02,0.10]). All studies had unclear or high risks of bias across at least one domain, with large heterogeneity between studies. CONCLUSIONS Our review suggests some positive results from pharmacist-led interventions, but the interventions do not seem sufficiently effective as currently implemented.

This study aimed to determine if prevaccination cytokine levels are associated with antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. METHODS. A cross-sectional study was performed among 58 SOTRs before and after two-dose mRNA vaccine series, 35 additional SOTRs before and after a third vaccine dose, and comparison to 16 healthy controls (HCs). Antispike antibody was assessed using the IgG Euroimmun ELISA. Electrochemiluminescence detection-based multiplexed sandwich immunoassays (Meso Scale Diagnostics) were used to quantify plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations (n = 20 analytes) and compare concentrations between SOTRs and HCs, stratified by ultimate antibody response to the vaccine using Wilcoxon-rank-sum test with false discovery rates computed to correct for multiple comparisons. RESULTS. In the study population, 100% of HCs, 59% of SOTRs after 2 doses and 63% of SOTRs after 3 doses had a detectable antibody response. Multiple baseline cytokines were elevated in SOTRs versus HCs. There was no significant difference in baseline cytokine levels between SOTRs with high versus low-titer antibodies after 2 doses of vaccine. However, as compared with poor antibody responders, SOTRs who went on to develop a high-titer antibody response to a third dose of vaccine had significantly higher prethird dose levels of several innate immune cytokines including IL-17, IL-2Ra, IL-6, IP-10, MIP-1, and TNF- (false discovery rates < 0.05).

The time between capsule consumption and first count, however, is widely taken, without debate, to be 3 h. In the Covid-19 era, it is desirable to limit the time patients spend in the department. We, therefore, questioned the need for a 3 h interval between capsule administration and the initial count. METHODS: Using an uncollimated gamma camera, whole-body counting was performed at 5, 30 and 180 min after capsule ingestion in 24 patients with chronic diarrhoea. Geometric mean was taken of counts acquired from posterior and anterior projections. WBR was expressed as the ratio of 7 day-to-initial whole-body counts (%) to give WBR5, WBR30 and WBR180. A small meal was given at 60 min after capsule ingestion. RESULTS: There was a close correlation between WBR30 and WBR180 (y = 1.0x - 0.29%; r = 0.99). For WBR180 values of <15% (lower limit of normal), there was close agreement between WBR30 and WBR180 (bias 0.03%; precision 0.7%). WBR5 overestimated WBR180. However, cWBR5, obtained by multiplication of WBR5 by 0.75, also correlated closely with WBR180 (y = 1.2x - 4.5%; r = 0.97), and there was close agreement between cWBR5 and WBR180 for WBR180 values <15% (bias 0.08%, precision 1.3%).

ARDS is a severe, life-threatening medical condition characterized by widespread inflammation and vascular leak in the lungs. Although there is no proven therapy to reduce pulmonary vascular leak in ARDS, recent studies demonstrated that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib reinforces the endothelial barrier and prevents vascular leak in inflammatory conditions, while leaving the immune response intact. METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial of intravenous (IV) imatinib mesylate in 90 mechanically ventilated subjects with COVID-19-induced ARDS. Subjects are 18 years or older, admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation, meeting the Berlin criteria for moderate-severe ARDS with a positive polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV2. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either imatinib (as mesylate) 200 mg bis in die (b.i.d.) or placebo IV infusion for 7 days, or until ICU discharge or death. The primary study outcome is the change in Extravascular Lung Water Index (EVLWi) between day 1 and day 4. Secondary outcome parameters include changes in oxygenation and ventilation parameters, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, number of ventilator-free days during the 28-day study period, length of ICU stay, and mortality during 28 days after randomization. Additional secondary parameters include safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. DISCUSSION: The current study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of IV imatinib in mechanically ventilated subjects with COVID-19-related ARDS. We hypothesize that imatinib decreases pulmonary edema, as measured by extravascular lung water using a PiCCO catheter. The reduction in pulmonary edema may reverse hypoxemic respiratory failure and hasten recovery. As pulmonary edema is an important contributor to ARDS, we further hypothesize that imatinib reduces disease severity, reflected by a reduction in 28-day mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay.

However, national temporal trends of LEA incidence rates among US veterans and associated factors have not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To describe the temporal trends of LEA, characterize associated risk factors, and decompose the associations of these risk factors with changes in temporal trends of LEA among US veterans using Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) services between 2008 and 2018. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used VA data from 2008 to 2018 to estimate incidence rates of LEA among veterans using VA services. Cox regression models were used to identify risk factors associated with LEA. Decomposition analyses estimated the associations of changes in prevalence of risk factors with changes in LEA rates. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2007, to September 30, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Toe, transmetatarsal, below-knee, or above-knee LEA. RESULTS: A total of 6 493 141 veterans were included (median [interquartile range] age, 64 [54-76] years; 6 060 390 [93.4%] men). Veterans were studied for a median (interquartile range) of 10.9 (5.6-11.0) years.

Between 2008 and 2018, toe amputation rates increased by 3.24 (2.89-3.59) amputations per 10 000 persons, accounting for 62.0% of the total increase in LEA rates. Transmetatarsal amputations increased by 1.54 (95% CI, 1.27-1.81) amputations per 10 000 persons; below-knee amputation rates increased by 0.81 (95% CI, 0.56-1.05) amputations per 10 000 persons; and above-knee amputation rates decreased by 0.37 (95% CI, 0.14-0.59) amputations per 10 000 persons. Compared with men, women had decreased risk of any LEA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.34 [95% CI, 0.31-0.37]). Factors associated with increased risk of any LEA included Black race (HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.21-1.28]) or another non-White race (ie, Asian, Latino, or other; HR, 2.36 [95% CI, 2.30-2.42]), obesity (HR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.55-1.63]), diabetes (HR, 6.38 [95% CI, 6.22-6.54]), chronic kidney disease (CKD; eg, CKD stage 5: HR, 3.94 [95% CI, 3.22-4.83]), and smoking status (eg, current smoking: HR, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.92-2.03]). Decomposition analyses suggested that while changes in demographic composition, primarily driven by increased proportion of women veterans, associated with a decrease of 0.18 (95% CI, 0.14-0.22) LEA per 10 000 persons, and decreases in smoking rates, associated with a decrease of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.79-0.97) LEA per 10 000 persons. However, these were overwhelmed by increased rates of diabetes, associated with an increase of 1.86 (95% CI, 1.72-1.99) LEA per 10 000 persons; peripheral arterial disease, associated with an increase of 1.53 (95% CI, 1.41-1.65) LEA per 10 000 persons; CKD, associated with an increase of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.33-1.57) LEA per 10 000 persons; and other clinical factors, including body mass index, cancer, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, dementia, and hypertension, associated with an increase of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.33-1.57) LEA per 10 000 persons.

Schools provide opportunities for pupils to learn about the importance of hygiene and WASH-related practice, and build healthy habits and skills, with beneficial medium- and long-term consequences particularly in low- and middle-income countries: reducing pupils' absenteeism due to diseases, promoting physical, mental and social health, and improving learning outcomes. WASH services alone are often not sufficient and need to be combined with educational programmes. As pupils disseminate their acquired health-promoting knowledge to their (extended) families, improved WASH provisions and education in schools have beneficial effects also on the community. International organisations frequently roll out interventions in schools to improve WASH services and, in some cases, train pupils and teachers on safe WASH behaviours. How such interventions relate to local school education on WASH, health promotion and disease prevention knowledge, whether and how such knowledge and school books are integrated into WASH education interventions in schools, are knowledge gaps we fill. METHODS We analyzed how Kenyan primary school science text book content supports WASH and health education by a book review including books used from class 1 through class 8, covering the age range from 6 to 13 years. We then conducted a rapid literature review of combined WASH interventions that included a behaviour change or educational component, and a rapid review of international policy guidance documents to contextualise the results and understand the relevance of books and school education for WASH interventions implemented by international organisations. We conducted a content analysis based on five identified thematic categories, including drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, environmental hygiene & health promotion and disease risks, and mapped over time the knowledge about WASH and disease prevention. RESULTS The books comprehensively address drinking water issues, including sources, quality, treatment, safe storage and water conservation; risks and transmission pathways of various waterborne (Cholera, Typhoid fever), water-based (Bilharzia), vector-related (Malaria) and other communicable diseases (Tuberculosis); and the importance of environmental hygiene and health promotion. The content is broadly in line with internationally recommended WASH topics and learning objectives. Gaps remain on personal hygiene and handwashing, including menstrual hygiene, sanitation education, and related health risks and disease exposures. The depth of content varies greatly over time and across the different classes. Such locally available education materials already used in schools were considered by none of the WASH education interventions in the considered intervention studies. CONCLUSIONS The thematic gaps/under-representations in books that we identified, namely sanitation, hygiene and menstrual hygiene education, are all high on the international WASH agenda, and need to be filled especially now, in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Disconnects exist between school book knowledge and WASH education interventions, between policy and implementation, and between theory and practice, revealing missed opportunities for effective and sustainable behaviour change, and underlining the need for better integration. Considering existing local educational materials and knowledge may facilitate the buy-in and involvement of teachers and school managers in strengthening education and implementing improvements. We suggest opportunities for future research, behaviour change interventions and decision-making to improve WASH in schools.","output":"Kenyan school book knowledge for water, sanitation, hygiene and health education interventions: Disconnect, integration or opportunities?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on CT and MRI images acquired from normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) patients, using machine learning methods, we aim to establish a multimodal and high-performance automatic ventricle segmentation method to achieve an efficient and accurate automatic measurement of the ventricular volume.

Findings: First, job loss and reduction in state-owned enterprises have been significantly larger than in other types of organizations. Second, employees of foreign direct investment enterprises suffer a significantly lower labor income than those of other groups. Third, the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labor market are heterogeneous across industries and geographies.

First, although government support through taxes has been provided, the authors highlight evidence that there may be some additional benefit from targeting firms that have characteristics associated with layoffs or other negative labor responses. Second, the authors provide information that shows which firm characteristics are associated with particular labor market responses such as layoffs, which may help target stimulus packages. Although the COVID-19 pandemic affects most industries and occupations, heterogeneous firm responses suggest that there could be several varieties of targeted policies-targeting firms that are likely to reduce labor forces or firms likely to face reduced revenue. In this paper, the authors outline several industries and firm characteristics which appear to more directly be reducing employee counts or having negative labor responses which may lead to more costCeffect stimulus. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Different firm responses to the COVID-19 pandemic shocks: machine-learning evidence on the Vietnamese labor market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Essential workers in the United States need access to health care services for preventive care and for diagnosis and treatment of illnesses (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] or other infectious or chronic diseases) to remain healthy and continue working during a pandemic. This study evaluated access to health care services among selected essential workers. METHODS We used the most recent data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2017-2018, to estimate the prevalence of 4 measures of health care access (having health insurance, being able to afford to see a doctor when needed, having a personal health care provider, and having a routine checkup in the past year) by broad and detailed occupation group among 189 208 adults aged 18-64. RESULTS Of all occupations studied, workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations were most likely to have no health insurance (46.4%). Personal care aides were most likely to have been unable to see a doctor when needed because of cost (29.3%). Construction laborers were most likely to lack a personal health care provider (51.1%) and to have not had a routine physical checkup in the past year (50.6%). Compared with workers in general, workers in 3 broad occupation groups-food preparation and serving; building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; and construction trades-had significantly lower levels of health care access for all 4 measures. CONCLUSION Lack of health insurance and underinsurance were common among subsets of essential workers. Limited access to health care might decrease essential workers' access to medical testing and needed care and hinder their ability to address underlying conditions, thereby increasing their risk of severe outcomes from some infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Improving access to health care for all workers, including essential workers, is critical to ensure workers' health and workforce stability.","output":"Health Care Access Among Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers, 31 States, 2017-2018."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A growing body of evidence from preclinical and clinical studies has associated alterations of the gut microbiotaCbrain axis with the progression and development of a number of pathological conditions that also affect cognitive functions.

These psychological stress-related symptoms are associated with worse prognoses in SCIs and have been attributed to psychosocial stressors and losses of independence. Nevertheless, emotional and mental modifications after SCI could be related to changes in the volume of specific brain areas associated with information processing and emotions. Additionally, physiological modifications have been recognized as a predisposing factor for mental health depletion, including the development of gut dysbiosis.

Despite an overall expansion of medical indications for labor induction, there is little international consensus regarding the criteria for induction, or for the recommended methods among nulliparous women. In this light, we assessed variations in the practice of induction of labor among 21 birth units in a nationwide cohort of women with no prior vaginal birth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a prospective observational pilot study of women with induced labor and no prior vaginal birth, across 21 Norwegian birth units. We registered induction indications, methods and outcomes from 1 September to 31 December 2018 using a web-based case record form. Women were grouped into \\"Nulliparous term cephalic\\", \\"Previous cesarean section\\" and \\"Other Robson\\" (Robson groups 6, 7, 8 or 10). RESULTS: More than 98% of eligible women (n=1818) were included and a wide variety of methods was used for induction of labor. In nulliparous term cephalic pregnancies, cesarean section rates ranged from 11.1% to 40.6% between birth units, whereas in the previous cesarean section group, rates ranged from 22.7% to 67.5%. The indications \\"large fetus\\" and \\"other fetal\\" indications were associated with the highest cesarean rates. Failed inductions and failure to progress in labor contributed most to the cesarean rates. Uterine rupture occurred in two women (0.11%), both in the previous cesarean section group. In neonates, 1.6% had Apgar <7 at 5 minutes, and 0.4% had an umbilical artery pH <7.00. CONCLUSIONS: Cesarean rates and applied methods for induction of labor varied widely in this nationwide cohort of women without a prior vaginal birth. Neonatal outcomes were similar to those of normal birth populations. Results could indicate the need to move towards more standardized induction protocols associated with optimal outcomes for mother and baby.","output":"Induction of labor and nulliparity: A nationwide clinical practice pilot evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) is safe and effective, inherent surgeons' discomfort has prevented a large-scale adaptation of this technique. Recent advances in robotic technology suggest that da Vinci Single-Site? cholecystectomy (dVSSC) may overcome this issue by reducing the stress load of the surgeon compared to SILC. However, evidence to objectively assess differences between the two approaches is lacking. METHODS 60 patients [36 women, 24 men (mean age 52 years)] with benign gallbladder disease were randomly assigned to dVSSC (n = 30) or SILC (n = 30) in this single-centre, single-blinded controlled trial. The primary endpoint was surgeon's stress load. Secondary endpoints included operating time, conversion rates, additional trocar placement, blood loss, length of hospital stay, procedure costs, health-related quality of life, cosmesis and complications. Data were collected preoperatively, during the hospital stay, and at 1 and 12 months' follow-up. RESULTS The dVSSC group showed a significant reduction of mental stress load of the surgeon compared to SILC [Subjective Mental Effort Questionnaire (SMEQ) score: median 25.0 (range 8-89) vs. 42.5 (range 13-110) points; p = 0.002] and a trend towards reduced physical stress load [Local Experienced Discomfort (LED) score: median 8 (range 2-27) vs. 12 (range 0-64) points; p = 0.088]. The length of hospital stay was longer in the SILC group [mean 3.06 (median 2; range 1-26) vs. 1.9 (median 2; range 1-4) days, p = 0.034] but overall hospital costs were higher for dVSSC [median 9734 (range 5775-16729) vs. 6900 (range 4156-99977) CHF; p = 0.001]. There were no differences in the rate of postoperative complications that required re-intervention (Dindo-Clavien grade  IIIa; SILC n = 2 vs. dVSSC n = 0, p = 0.492) or other secondary endpoints.

We observed an immediate transcriptional activation of inflammatory pathways linked to the anti-viral response followed by increased expression of genes involved in ribosome and mitochondria function, thus hinting at rapid alterations in protein production and cellular energy supply. At later stages, metabolic processes, in particular those depending on cytochrome P450 enzymes, were downregulated. To gain a deeper understanding of the underlying transcriptional dynamics, we developed an ODE model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication.

We examine whether debt-for-climate swaps, instruments whereby debtor countries are relieved from their contractual debt obligations in return for local climate-related spending commitments, may be helpful in tackling worrying debt levels and climate concerns simultaneously. We point out that debt swaps do not have a great historical track record but that common flaws such as their piecemeal nature, lack of additionality and creation of parallel implementation structures, could be overcome by scaling up and careful design. To realize swaps full potential, a distinction needs to be made between situations where debt is clearly unsustainable and where it is high but sustainable. In the former case, deep and comprehensive debt restructuring should be the primary focus, rather than closely matching debt service savings with increased climate spending;in the latter case, stand-alone debt swaps may be used to transfer resources from creditors to debtor countries that are committed to climate investments but lack fiscal space. Another helpful differentiation is that between middle-income debtor countries, where debt swaps could finance climate mitigation interventions, and low-income debtors, where investments in adaption deserve prioritization. Finally, debt swap proposals need to be mindful of creditor incentives, including positive reputational payoffs, achieving greater scale using a multi-creditor set-up, at the same time as carefully considering governance credentials in each country context. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Debt-for-climate swaps: Killing two birds with one stone?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blood transfusion practice is an essential medical intervention; however, it poses problems of transmissibility of infectious diseases including malaria.

Subsequently, we assessed the behavior, neuronal function and morphology, neurotransmitter levels, hypothalamicCpituitaryCadrenal (HPA)-axis associated hormones, inflammatory cytokine levels, and miRNA/mRNA expression alterations in an in vitro/vivo depression model treated by the LBRD standard decoction. Finally, miRNA/mRNA regulatory networks were created through bioinformatics analysis, followed by functional experiments to verify its role in LBRD standard decoction treatment. RESULTS: A total of 32 prototype compounds were identified in the LBRD standard decoction, and the average quality of verbascoside in the fresh lily bulb decoction, fresh raw Rehmannia juice, and the LBRD standard decoction were 0.001264%, 0.002767%, and 0.009046% (w/w), respectively. Administration of the LBRD standard decoction ameliorated chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression-like phenotypes and protected PC12 cells against chronic corticosterone (CORT)-induced injury. The levels of neurotransmitter, cytokine, stress hormones and neuronal morphology were disrupted in the depression model, while LBRD standard decoction could work on these alterations. After LBRD standard decoction administration, four differentially expressed miRNAs, rno-miR-144-3p, rno-miR-495, rno-miR-34c-5p, and rno-miR-24-3p, and six differentially expressed mRNAs, Calml4, Ntrk2, VGAT, Gad1, Nr1d1, and Bdnf overlapped in the in vivo/vitro depression model. Among them, miR-144-3p directly mediated GABA synthesis and release by targeting Gad1 and VGAT, and miR-495 negatively regulated BDNF expression. The LBRD standard decoction can reverse the above miRNA/mRNA network-mediated GABA and BDNF expression in the in vivo/vitro depression model. CONCLUSION: Collectively, the multi-components of the LBRD standard decoction altered a series of miRNAs in depression through mediating GABAergic synapse, circadian rhythm, and neurotrophic signaling pathway etc., thereby abolishing inhibitory/excitatory neurotransmitter deficits, recovering the pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokine levels and regulating the HPA-axis hormone secretion to achieve balance of the physiological function of the whole body.

On univariate analysis, greater annual total cholesterol exposure was associated with higher SVG LCBI (r = 0.30, P = 0.042) and annual LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride exposure were associated with higher SVG maxLCBI4 mm (LDL-C: r = 0.41, P = 0.020; triglycerides: r = 0.36, P = 0.043). On multivariate analysis, the only independent predictor of SVG LCBI and maxLCBI4mm was SVG age. SVG percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 63% of the patients. An embolic protection device was used in 96% of SVG PCIs. Periprocedural myocardial infarction occurred in one patient.

The applicability of three inexpensive substrates, namely, Whatman 1PS, polyethylene-coated filter paper, and tracing paper, as holders for microvolumes of colloidal solutions was evaluated. Waterproof cellulose-based substrates demonstrated to be highly convenient platforms for analytical purposes, as they enabled in situ generation of volatiles and syringeless drop exposure unlike conventional single-drop microextraction approaches and can behave as sample compartments for smartphone-based colorimetric sensing in an integrated way. Remarkably, large drop volumes (20 L) of colloidal solutions can be employed for enrichment processes when using Whatman 1PS as holder. In addition, the stability and potential applicability of spherical, rod-shaped, and core-shell metallic NPs onto waterproof cellulose-based substrates was evaluated. In particular, Au@AgNPs showed potential for the colorimetric detection of in situ generated H2S, I2, and Br2, whereas AuNRs hold promise for I2, Br2, and Hg0 colorimetric sensing. As a proof of concept, a smartphone-based colorimetric assay for determination of acid-labile sulfide in environmental water samples was developed with the proposed approach taking advantage of the ability of Au@AgNPs for H2S sensing.

METHODS: Descriptive serial cross-sectional study based on secondary data on COVID-19 hospitalizations from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness records collected by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and COVID-19 case notification data from Brasil.io, a repository of public data. Fifty-six epidemiological weeks were split into four periods. The following variables were considered for each Brazilian Health Region, per period: number of hospitalizations, hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants, hospitalizations per 100 new cases notified in the Health Region, percentage of hospitalizations with ICU use, percentages of hospitalizations with invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support, percentage of hospitalizations resulting in death and percentage of hospitalizations with ICU use resulting in death. Descriptive statistics of the variables were obtained across all 450 Health Regions in Brazil over the four defined pandemic periods. Maps were generated to capture the spatiotemporal variation and trends during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. RESULTS: There was great variation in how COVID-19 hospitalizations grew and spread among Health Regions, with higher numbers between June and August 2020, and, especially, from mid-December 2020 to March 2021. The variation pattern in the proportion of ICU use in the hospitalizations across the Health Regions was broad, with no intensive care provision in large areas in the North, Northeast, and Midwest. The proportions of hospitalizations and hospitalizations with ICU use resulting in deaths were remarkably high, reaching medians of 34.0% and 62.0% across Health Regions, respectively.

In anticipation of the pressures of giving end-of-life care to COVID-19 positive patients during a pandemic, the decision was made to increase clinical staff resource in the community.AimThe aim was to upskill non-clinical and allied health professional staff in a very short space of time, to prepare them to give end-of-life care, alongside experienced colleagues.MethodA two-day intensive training course, based on the core attributes identified in a concept analysis of being prepared for end-of-life care (Griffith, 2018), was devised and delivered to non-clinical staff who volunteered to help. Attendees were relocated into three community teams, and partnered with experienced carers and registered nurses to ensure that they were supported in practice. Supervision and guidance was given by colleagues and managers.ResultsFollowing the teaching sessions, two staff members withdrew from the opportunity to take up a care role;six went ahead and joined the community teams. By the end of the first wave of COVID-19, three members of the fundraising team had returned to their usual roles, having enjoyed and benefitted from the experience, and gained greater insight into the service offered by our hospice. Two members of staff were successfully appointed to permanent roles in the community care team, and an allied professional remains in the role at the present time.

The SDH are defined as the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, and which are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels. Despite their influence on health, most of the SDH are targeted through government departments and ministries outside of the traditional health sector (e.g. education, housing). As such, the need for intersectoral and multisectoral approaches arises. Intersectoral and multisectoral approaches are thought to be essential to addressing many global health challenges our world faces today and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. There are various ways of undertaking intersectoral and multisectoral action, but there are three widely recognized approaches (Health in All Policies [HiAP], Healthy Cities, and One Health) that each have a unique focus. However, despite the widespread acceptance of the need for intersectoral and multisectoral approaches, knowledge around how to support, achieve and sustain multisectoral action is limited. The goal of this study is to assemble evidence from systematic approaches to reviewing the literature (e.g. scoping review, systematic review) that collate findings on facilitators/enablers and barriers to implementing various intersectoral and multisectoral approaches to health, to strengthen understanding of how to best implement health policies that work across sectors, whichever they may be. METHODS: An umbrella review (i.e. review of reviews) is to be undertaken to collate findings from the peer-reviewed literature, specifically from Ovid MEDLINE and Scopus databases. This umbrella review protocol was developed following the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P), and study design informed by the PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). DISCUSSION: Countries that employ multisectoral approaches are better able to identify and address issues around poverty, housing and others, by working collaboratively across sectors, with multisectoral action by governments thought to be required to achieve health equity.","output":"Intersectoral and multisectoral approaches to health policy: an umbrella review protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading globally with high disparity in the susceptibility of the disease severity.

The role of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in HM is poorly understood [1, 2]. This study evaluated SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the HM of vaccinated healthcare workers (HCW). METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective study of 122 HCWs was performed from February to April 2021 at the Hospital Universitario Nuestra Se?ora de Candelaria. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) against nucleocapsid protein and IgG, immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against spike 1 protein receptor-binding domain against SARS-CoV-2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-S1) were analyzed. Unvaccinated breastfeeding mothers without COVID-19 were the control group.The 98 vaccinated participants underwent serum and HM evaluation 14 days after receiving 2 doses of either BNT162b2 mRNA (94%) or mRNA-1273 (6%) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. The mean SARS-CoV-2 RBD-S1 IgG serum concentration was 3379.64 binding antibody units (BAUs)/mL with neutralizing antibody titers >560.9 BAUs/mL. Serum SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the 24 unvaccinated participants were negative. The HM from vaccinated participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-S1 IgG with a mean of 12.19 BAUs/mL compared to 0.02 BAUs/mL (P < .001) in HM from unvaccinated participants. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgA was noted in 89% of HM from vaccinated women; no anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgM was detected.A positive correlation was reported between anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-S1 IgG in serum and HM (r = 0.36; P < .001). This association was stronger if breastfeeding had been <24 months (r = 0.67; P < .001) vs 24 months (r = 0.32; P = 0.19). In subgroup analysis, breastfeeding for >24 months and high serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-S1 IgG levels predicted high HM IgG levels. This was an independent association in both linear and multiple regression models. Compared with breastfeeding <24 months, lactation >24 months was associated with increased HM anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-S1 levels. COMMENTS: This study in breastfeeding HCWs showed that the HM antibody levels were higher in women who had been breastfeeding for >24 months prior to receiving 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine compared to participants who had been breastfeeding <24 months. Limitations include lack of in vitro plaque reduction neutralization tests which is the gold standard for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 antibody deactivation effectiveness. The study was conducted at a single site and did not assess infant serology or clinical outcome.According to the authors, breastfeeding by vaccinated women during a pandemic when young children are ineligible for vaccination may be encouraged. These results support findings from other studies of vaccines, such as influenza, in which the HM of vaccinated women may confer protection to their infants [3]. The benefits of maternal immunization, including the duration of protection afforded by HM from maternal recipients of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, are research areas deserving of additional exploration. Additionally, further understanding of the association of the duration of receipt of HM from vaccinated women on infant immune responses would be beneficial in understanding the potential for passive protection through nutrition.","output":"Are SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Detectable in Human Milk After Vaccination Against COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Reduced time allocation, changes in teaching methods and Covid-19 have resulted in undergraduate anatomy teaching being marginalised.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a promising therapeutic target for pulmonary arterial hypertension. In the present study, we explored the effect of propofol on ACE2 expression in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs). METHODS HPAECs were treated with propofol in different concentrations (1, 10, 20, 40 or 50 mol/l) for different lengths of time (6, 12, 18, 24 or 30 h) with or without transcription inhibitor actinomycin D or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. RESULTS Propofol increased the ACE2 mRNA level in a dose- and time-dependent manner within 24 h. Propofol treatment dose-dependently increased the ACE2 protein level and the cell membrane ACE2 activity. Transcription inhibitor actinomycin D and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abrogated the augmenting effect of propofol on the mRNA level of ACE2 in HPAECs. CONCLUSION Propofol enhances the ACE2 expression in HPAECs by increasing the transcription of ACE2 via a PI3K-dependent mechanism, which leads to increased ACE2 activity on the cell membrane.

A comprehensive triangulated view on the barriers to dementia management emphasising teamwork is missing. AIM: To explore the barriers to the implementation of the Portuguese Dementia Strategy by primary care teams, from the perspectives of service users and professionals. METHODS: Purposive sampling was used to recruit 10 GPs, 8 practice nurses, 4 social workers, 8 people with dementia and 10 family carers from 6 practices in different social contexts within the Lisbon metropolitan area. The analytical framework combined codes derived from the transcripts with codes from the available literature. Themes focused on the access to professionals/community services, care coordination within healthcare teams, and between health and community services. FINDINGS: Several system barriers were identified (undefined roles/coordination within teams, time constraints, insufficient signposting to community services) along with individual barriers (limited competence in dementia, unrecognised autonomy, limited views on social health and quality of life (QoL)), hindering users access to dementia services. CONCLUSION: Enhanced competence in dementia, and nurse-led systematic care of people with dementia and their carers, are necessary.

In order to do this, we studied the results of arterial blood gases and portable spirometry in the immediate postoperative period and at the first and third postoperative day. Secondary objectives included evaluating whether this same pattern decreases the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) and hospital stay. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a prospective, randomized clinical study. Between January 2012 and June 2013, 50 patients who had undergone lung resection with posterolateral thoracotomy were assigned to one of two groups by a random number generator according to whether or not they would receive prophylactic BiPAP pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS The results of the gasometric and spirometric values were similar in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). There was not a decrease in the incidence of PPC in the group that received prophylactic BiPAP. Likewise, postoperative stay was similar in both groups. The BiPAP group was 6.60  4 days and the non BiPAP group was 6.84  3.94 days (p = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS One drawback of this work was the limited number of hours that BiPAP was employed, and when compared to other studies, the application of low-pressure support. We did not find any significant differences between using prophylactic BiPAP or not, suggesting that such treatment should not be performed indiscriminately.

Influenza can cause significant morbidity and mortality in young children, the elderly, pregnant and post-partum women, patients with co-morbidities and the immunocompromised. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are the treatment of choice for influenza due to widespread resistance to the adamantanes. NAIs are efficacious for the treatment of influenza in ambulatory patients with mild illness, when initiated within 48 h of symptom onset. Early treatment with NAIs has been shown to reduce otitis media in children, and lower respiratory tract complications, resulting in antibiotic therapy, in adults. Evidence on the efficacy of NAIs for the prevention of influenza-related complications in at-risk populations, based on reviews of data from randomised trials is inconclusive. However, observational studies suggest that in hospitalised patients early treatment with NAIs has been associated with reduced mortality. NAIs should be initiated as soon as possible in patients at high-risk of influenza-related complications, with suspected or proven influenza, hospitalised patients and patients with severe or progressive disease. NAIs can be considered in previously healthy patients when therapy can be initiated within 48 h of symptom onset. In previously healthy patients, the therapeutic efficacy of oseltamivir is time-dependent, with maximal benefit observed when therapy is initiated within 48 h of symptom onset. However, several observational studies suggest therapeutic benefit beyond 48 h, in hospitalised patients, severe disease, and patients at high risk of complications, including pregnant women. NAIs should be considered in patients at high risk of influenza-related complications who present late. Further studies are needed to define the optimal timing of NAIs. Oseltamivir-resistant virus has been widely reported but is predominantly an issue in H1N1 seasonal influenza. Zanamivir-resistant influenza virus is rare, and inhaled or intravenous (IV) zanamivir is the treatment of choice in proven or suspected oseltamivir-resistant virus. Intubated patients with severe influenza can be treated with oseltamivir (suspension) administered via nasogastric tube. The commercial dry powder formulation of zanamivir should not be administered, via nebulisation, as it has been associated with ventilator malfunction and mortality. In intubated patients, when there are concerns about gastric absorption, IV zanamivir should be obtained under Emergency Investigational New Drug access schemes. Currently available evidence does not support the use of high-dose or extended-duration oseltamivir in patients with severe influenza, but does require further investigation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has not been shown to be superior to conventional management in patients with influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome and should be considered as salvage therapy. Corticosteriods should not be used in the treatment of severe influenza as this has been associated with increased risk of mortality and bacterial superinfection.","output":"Seasonal Human Influenza: Treatment Options"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, much attention has been given to the idea of flattening the curve of cases to reduce the harmful effects of an over-loaded medical system. In this context, it is relevant to determine conditions to ensure that the health care threshold capacity will not be exceeded. If such a situa-tion is unavoidable, it would be useful to effectively quantify the potential negative impact produced. In this paper, we consider an epidemiological SIR model and a positive threshold M. Using a parametric expression for the solution curve of the SIR model and the properties of the Lambert W function, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the basic reproduction number R0 to ensure that the infected population I does not exceed M.

Broad-spectrum therapies capable of inhibiting CoV infections would address an immediate unmet medical need and could be invaluable in the treatment of emerging and endemic CoV infections.

GS-5734 was also effective against bat CoVs, prepandemic bat CoVs, and circulating contemporary human CoV in primary human lung cells, thus demonstrating broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of GS-5734 significantly reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory function. These data provide substantive evidence that GS-5734 may prove effective against endemic MERS-CoV in the Middle East, circulating human CoV, and, possibly most importantly, emerging CoV of the future.","output":"Broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 inhibits both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus diseases 2019 or COVID-19 has spread and infected millions of people around the world The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has taken an unprecedented toll on residents, business, commerce, and activity in many cities, including Jakarta, where there have been more than twelve thousand confirmed cases as of July 2020 The details of how COVID-19 spreads in Jakarta are still complicated and not completely understood because the number of infections is large and continues to climb This paper conducts a quantitative analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic spreading using Jakarta as a case study for the evaluation and decision-making process In this paper, time series models such as the Holt's exponential smoothing and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) were used to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases in Jakarta between March 1 and July 6 Recently, data exploration and comparative analysis of time series models have been conducted to determine the optimal models for forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases The result shows that ARIMA has the highest R-Squared (R2), and lowest (Mean Squared Error) MSE and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the best model to forecast the upcoming number of infected cases of COVID-19 in Jakarta Such a model shows promising results and fitting predictions in supporting data-driven policy in public health and epidemiology ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Forecasting for a data-driven policy using time series methods in handling COVID-19 pandemic in Jakarta"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-C19 pandemics caused significant damage to the system of physical education of students.

Although it is a very common understanding that face recognition is a closed problem, in reality it still has a lot of areas for improvements in the context of implementations. Development of a general-purpose face recognition-based attendance system is completely dependent on the availability of generalized face detection and recognition algorithms which can keep balance between speed, accuracy and anti-spoofing at the higher side of the benchmark. In some of the use cases, speed affects the usability and in some other use cases accuracy affects the usability.

As this is a highly contagious virus, it is imperative to understand RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp), the key component in virus replication. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome shares 80% sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV, their RdRps and nucleotidyl-transferases (NiRAN) share 98.1% and 93.2% identity, respectively. Sequence alignment of six coronaviruses demonstrated higher identity among their RdRps (60.9%C98.1%) and lower identity among their Spike proteins (27%C77%). Thus, a 3D structural model of RdRp, NiRAN, non-structural protein 7 (nsp7), and nsp8 of SARS-CoV-2 was generated by modeling starting from the SARS counterpart structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the binding poses of three viral RdRp inhibitors (Galidesivir, Favipiravir, and Penciclovir), which were recently reported to have clinical significance for SARS-CoV-2.

For real-life decision-making, we investigate the impact of the planning horizon on the optimal vaccination/social distancing strategy. We find that in order to reduce social distancing in the long run, without overburdening the health care system, it is essential to vaccinate the people with the highest contact rates first. That is also the case if the objective is to minimize fatalities provided that the social distancing measures are sufficiently strict.

Our aim is to investigate the potential effect of COVID-19 on intensive care unit (ICU) resources and mortality in northwestern Ontario. Methods: This study was conducted in northwestern Ontario which has a population of 230,000. A set of differential equations were used to represent a modified Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model with urban and rural hospital resources (i.e., ICU and hospital beds). Rural patients requiring ICU care flowed into the urban ICU. Sensitivity analyses were used to investigate the effect of poorer health status (i.e., increased hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality) and overcrowding (i.e., increased contact rate) in the rural population as compared to the urban population. Physical distancing within the urban population was modelled as a decreased contact rate. Results: At the highest contact rate, the peak in daily active cases, ICU bed requirements and mortality was higher and occurred earlier than lower contact rates. The urban population with a lower contact rate and baseline health status had a lower predicted prevalence of active cases and lower mortality than the rural population. Interpretation: An increased contact rate and worse health status in the rural population will likely increase the required ICU resources and mortality as compared to the urban population. Rural populations will likely be affected disproportionately more than urban populations.","output":"Investigating the implications of COVID-19 for the rural and remote population of Northern Ontario using a mathematical model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The escalation of the COVID-19 (corona virus) has caused economic crisis to majority countries in the world.

With the emergence of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the associated national lockdowns and restrictions, nursing home residents were restrained from being physically active. In our study, we aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19-related restrictions on PA promotion in nursing homes from an organizational-sociological lens. Methods: We collected data in eight nursing homes in Germany. Data collection included (i) semistructured interviews focusing on COVID-19-related restrictions and their effects on nursing homes from the home administrators' perspectives; (ii) open-ended surveys with nursing home staff and relatives focusing on daily routines and contact restrictions; and (iii) collection of documents such as care concepts, mission statements, and weekly activity plans. We analyzed all data with a reflexive thematic analysis approach. Results: We identified three stages of COVID-19-related changes in nursing homes that impacted PA promotion, as follows: (1) external closure and search for emergency control, (2) organizational adaptations to create a livable daily life in the internal environment, and (3) slow reintegration of interactions with the external organizational environment. Document analysis revealed that PA promotion was not part of decision programs or internal staff work descriptions. Rather, PA promotion was delegated to external service providers. The assignment of PA promotion to external providers was not structurally anchored in decision programs, which makes PA promotion not sustainable, particularly during unforeseen events that limit access to the organization. During the pandemic, executive staff believed in internal staff to buffer competencies with regard to PA promotion. Thus, executive staff often considered PA promotion relevant, even during the pandemic, but thought that PA promotion is a task that can be fulfilled by unqualified but motivated internal staff. Conclusion: While our study participants showed a high level of coping-capacity belief, it remains unclear which long-term impacts of COVID-19 on PA promotion in nursing homes are to be expected. At the practice level, executive staff in nursing homes that aim to promote PA within their organization should become aware that PA promotion needs to be incorporated into organizational structures to be implemented and continued in challenging times such as in a pandemic.","output":"I Trust in Staff's CreativityThe Impact of COVID-19 Lockdowns on Physical Activity Promotion in Nursing Homes Through the Lenses of Organizational Sociology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loss-of-function mutations in the synaptic protein neurexin1 (NRXN1) are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and many of these disorders are defined by core deficits in social cognition. Mouse models of Nrxn1 deficiency are not amenable to studying aspects of social cognition because, in general, mice do not engage in complex social interactions such as social play or prosocial helping behaviors. Rats, on the contrary, engage in these complex, well-characterized social behaviors. Using the Nrxn1tm1Sage Sprague Dawley rat, we tested a range of cognitive and social behaviors in juveniles with haplo- or biallelic Nrxn1 mutation. We found a deficit in ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of male and female neonatal rats with Nrxn1 deficiency. A male-specific deficit in social play was observed in Nrxn1-deficient juveniles, although sociability and social discrimination were unaltered. Nurturing behavior induced by exposure to pups was enhanced in male and female juveniles with biallelic Nrxn1 mutation. Performance in tasks of prosocial helping behavior and food retrieval indicated severe deficits in learning and cognition in juveniles with biallelic Nrxn1 mutation, and a less severe deficit in haploinsufficient rats, although Pavlovian learning was altered only in haploinsufficient males.

This study aimed to develop a practical framework for the ethical evaluation of PH programs. STUDY DESIGN: A multidisciplinary team developed an ethical framework to evaluate PH plans from 2015 to 2017. METHODS: In this study, the multi-method approach was used. First, a list of moral norms in PH policy and practice was drafted and completed in two interactive sessions. Then, the Delphi method was used for consensus about the structural components to be adopted in the framework. After developing the framework, its efficiency was assessed by evaluating Iran's Fourth Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control. RESULTS: The framework was developed in the following three sections: (i) determination of the general moral norms in PH practice and policy; (ii) five steps of evaluation; and (iii) a procedural evaluation step to ensure fair decision-making. The ratio of the ethical points of the PH plan increased by 46% after implementation of the framework, and the frequency of ethical points increased significantly after applying the framework (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The application of the framework for the ethical evaluation of various PH programs ensures a comprehensive and scientific-deliberative decision-making process, while also contributing to the development of the framework.","output":"An ethical framework for evaluation of public health plans: a systematic process for legitimate and fair decision-making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies on host-pathogen interaction have identified human ACE2 as a host cell receptor responsible for mediating infection by coronavirus (COVID-19) Subsequent studies have shown striking difference of allele frequency among Europeans and Asians for a polymorphism rs2285666, present in ACE2 It has been revealed that the alternate allele (TT-plus strand or AA-minus strand) of rs2285666 elevate the expression level of this gene upto 50%, hence may play a significant role in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility Therefore, we have first looked the phylogenetic structure of rs2285666 derived haplotypes in worldwide populations and compared the spatial frequency of this particular allele with respect to the COVID-19 infection as well as case-fatality rate in India For the first time, we ascertained a significant positive correlation for alternate allele (T or A) of rs2285666, with the lower infection as well as case-fatality rate among Indian populations We trust that this information will be useful to understand the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 susceptibility","output":"Genetic Association of ACE2 rs2285666 Polymorphism With COVID-19 Spatial Distribution in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The predominate role of internships on the retention of nursing students highlights the need to monitor internship experiences during a healthcare crisis like CoViD-19. OBJECTIVES: To explore the relation between internships experiences during a pandemic and student nurses commitment or intention-to-leave the nursing program; as well as the relation between internship experiences and commitment or intention-to-leave the nursing program. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study using a sample of 1.079 nursing students from18 nursing schools in Flanders, Belgium. Students from all study years were eligible to participate. METHODS: Online self-reporting survey during the first CoViD-19 wave (April-May 2020). Regression analyses were used to explore the association with students commitment or intention-to-leave. RESULTS: Students reported high levels of study commitment (4.06; SD 0.66; range 1-5), and an overall low intention-to-leave (1.64; SD 0.83; range 1-5). No difference in commitment or intention-to-leave were seen between students who did or did not had internship experience during CoViD-19 period. Need-supportive experiences - indicating that students felt competent, related to the team, and could be themselves on internship - coincided with high commitment. Conversely, need-frustrating experiences - indicating that students felt insecure, unrelated, and controlled by the nursing team C increased intention-to-leave nursing education. Students who felt pressured for an internship during the first wave of the CoViD-19 crisis, had more doubts to continue nursing education, and an increased chance on drop-out. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend nursing schools to assess student's motivation when making a substantiated decision concerning internships during a health crisis, as facing an imposed or subjective mandatory decision to go into clinical practice might lead to less commitment to the study program. For both teacher and staff mentors it is deemed important to discuss the internship climate with the student, in order to early identify need-frustrating issues during internship.","output":"Are internship experiences during a pandemic related to students commitment to nursing education?

How did these choristers fare during the COVID-19? 69% of the respondents claimed the church they performed in, used live online music that is being streamed live featuring just two or three members of the choir. In comparison, 14% used recorded music, either those performed by the church choristers themselves prior to the lockdown or other forms of gospel music already recorded. However, about 17% of the choristers claimed no music was used in their various churches during the online church services during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. This gave room for concern;this study identified problems associated with the low-performance level of church choristers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through questionnaires purposely distributed to over a hundred and thirty (134) choristers on the researcher's WhatsApp platforms, these respondents were equally asked to send the same to their friends or family who sing in the choir residing predominantly within the Lagos metropolis in Nigeria.Responses were, therefore, collated via the Google forms. Descriptive analyses were made. The chi-square test/cross-tabulation and the Kendal tau were used to find the correlation between online performance and social media use. The study finds that the use of social media does not have a relationship with online performance. The study's implication reveals that, if the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacts the choristers, then other aspects of the economy are not in saved hands from the havoc the pandemic has wrecked.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for its binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. It contains multiple dominant neutralizing epitopes and serves as an important antigen for the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we showed that immunization of mice with a candidate subunit vaccine consisting of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and Fc fragment of human IgG, as an immunopotentiator, elicited high titer of RBD-specific antibodies with robust neutralizing activity against both pseudotyped and live SARS-CoV-2 infections. The mouse antisera could also effectively neutralize infection by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 with several natural mutations in RBD and the IgG extracted from the mouse antisera could also show neutralization against pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV).

The recent introduction of knotless barbed sutures may address the shortcomings of conventional sutures and offer the additional benefit of reduced operating time. In this paper, we describe our experience with barbed sutures for body-contouring procedures. We share technical insights and evaluate postoperative complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective assessment of prospectively collected data over a period of more than 5 years was undertaken. Six hundred twenty-three consecutive patients underwent 695 body-contouring procedures with barbed suture closure. Patients were followed for at least 12 weeks postoperatively. Patient demographics, operation time as well as suture-related complications, such as wound dehiscence and wound site infection were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS Barbed sutures can facilitate skin closure, rectus plication, quilting, and deep layer closure in body-contouring procedures. The average operating time in our study cohort was 108 min with reduction mammoplasty being the quickest (94 min) and bodylift (156 min) being the slowest procedure. Sixty-eight patients experienced suture-related complications resulting in an overall complication rate of 9.7 % with thigh lift having the most (15 %) and reduction mammoplasty (7 %) the fewest adverse events. CONCLUSION The use of barbed sutures allows quick closure of lengthy body-contouring incision lines with low complication rates. Our observations support that barbed sutures are safe, convenient and effective. In our hands barbed sutures appear to be superior to traditional wound-closure techniques in body-contouring procedures.

We sought to determine clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 managed with invasive mechanical ventilation in an appropriately resourced US health care system. METHODS: Outcomes of COVID-19 infected patients requiring mechanical ventilation treated within the Inova Health System between March 5, 2020 and April 26, 2020 were evaluated through an electronic medical record review. RESULTS: 1023 COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to the Inova Health System during the study period. Of these, 164 (16.0%) were managed with invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients were followed to definitive disposition. 70/164 patients (42.7%) had died and 94/164 (57.3%) were still alive. Deceased patients were older (median age of 66 vs. 55, p <0.0001) and had a higher initial d-dimer (2.22 vs. 1.31, p = 0.005) and peak ferritin levels (2998 vs. 2077, p = 0.016) compared to survivors. 84.3% of patients over 70 years old died in the hospital. Conversely, 67.4% of patients age 70 or younger survived to hospital discharge. Younger age, non-Caucasian race and treatment at a tertiary care center were all associated with survivor status. CONCLUSION: Mortality of patients with COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is high, with particularly daunting mortality seen in patients of advanced age, even in a well-resourced health care system.

METHODS: The study sample was candidates for admission interviews held in the MMI format at a medical school in South Korea. In this six-station MMI, one station included a 2-min video clip of a patient-doctor communication scenario to assess candidate emphatic abilities, whereas paper-based scenarios were used in the other stations. Candidates perceptions and acceptability of using the video-based scenario in the empathy station were examined using a 41-item post-MMI questionnaire. Fairness of the test was assessed by means of differences in candidate perceptions and performance across different demographics or backgrounds. Construct validity was assessed by examining the relationship of candidate performances in the empathy station with those in other stations. The G-coefficient was analyzed to estimate the reliability of the test. RESULTS: Eighty-two questionnaires were returned, a 97.6% response rate. Candidates showed overall positive perceptions of the video-based scenario and they found it authentic and interesting. The test was fair as there were no differences in candidates perceptions of the patient-doctor relationship presented in the video clip and neither in their performance nor in their perceived difficulty of the station across demographics or backgrounds. Construct validity was established as candidate performance in the empathy station was not associated with that of any other stations. The G-coefficient was 0.74.

In primary sinonasal epithelial cells, we determined that HSP90 inhibition reduces T2R-stimulated NO production and ciliary beating, which likely limits pathogen clearance. In primary monocyte-derived macrophages, we found that HSP-90 is integral to T2R-stimulated NO production and phagocytosis of FITC-labeled Escherichia coli and pHrodo-Staphylococcus aureus. Our study demonstrates that HSP90 serves as an innate immune modulator by regulating NO production downstream of T2R signaling by augmenting eNOS activation without impairing upstream Ca2+ signaling. These findings suggest that HSP90 plays an important role in airway antibacterial innate immunity and may be an important target in airway diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, or cystic fibrosis.","output":"HSP90 Modulates T2R Bitter Taste Receptor Nitric Oxide Production and Innate Immune Responses in Human Airway Epithelial Cells and Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unlike tic-tac-toe or checkers, in which optimal play leads to a draw, it is not known whether optimal play in chess ends in a win for White, a win for Black, or a draw. But after White moves first in chess, if Black has a double move followed by a double move of White and then alternating play, play is more balanced because White does not always tie or lead in moves. Symbolically, Balanced Alternation gives the following move sequence: After White's (W) initial move, first Black (B) and then White each have two moves in a row (BBWW), followed by the alternating sequence, beginning with W, which altogether can be written as WB/BW/WB/WB/WB... (the slashes separate alternating pairs of moves). Except for reversal of the 3rd and 4th moves from WB to BW, this is the standard chess sequence. Because Balanced Alternation lies between the standard sequence, which favors White, and a comparable sequence that favors Black, it is highly likely to produce a draw with optimal play, rendering chess fairer. This conclusion is supported by a computer analysis of chess openings and how they would play out under Balanced Alternation.","output":"Fairer Chess: A Reversal of Two Opening Moves in Chess Creates Balance Between White and Black"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of problematic Internet use (PIU) in the post\\\\COVID\\\\19 pandemic era is not known.

METHODS: A total of 1070 nursing students were consecutively invited to participate in this study from the nursing schools of five universities. PIU and quality of life (QOL) were assessed using the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Brief Version (WHOQOL\\\\BREF), respectively. t Tests,  (2), tests, and KruskalCWallis tests were used to compare basic demographic and clinical characteristics between participants with and without PIU. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to examine independent correlates. RESULTS: The prevalence of PIU was 23.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.7%C25.8%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that second\\\\ (p = .024) and third\\\\year (p = .012) students were more likely to suffer from PIU compared with first year students. Students with more severe depressive (p = .014) and anxiety symptoms (p = .011) were independently and significantly associated with more severe PIU.

CONCLUSION AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Problematic Internet use (PIU) was common among nursing students in the post\\\\COVID\\\\19 era. Considering the negative impact of PIU on QOL and academic performance, regular screening should be conducted and effective interventions implemented for nursing students with PIU. This was the first study on the prevalence of PIU among nursing students in the post\\\\COVID\\\\19 era.

Sequence-independent amplification of nucleic acids combined with next-generation sequencing technology and bioinformatics analyses is a promising strategy for identifying pathogens in clinical and public health settings. It allows the characterization of hundreds of different known pathogens simultaneously and of novel pathogens that elude conventional testing. However, major hurdles for its routine use exist, including cost, turnaround time, and especially sensitivity of the assay, as the detection limit is dependent on viral load, host genetic material, and sequencing depth. To obtain insights into these aspects, we analyzed nasopharyngeal aspirates from a cohort of 81 Thai children with respiratory disease for the presence of respiratory viruses using a sequence-independent next-generation sequencing approach and routinely used diagnostic real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (real-time RT-PCR) assays. With respect to the detection of rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus, the next-generation sequencing approach was at least as sensitive as diagnostic real-time RT-PCR in this small cohort, whereas for bocavirus and enterovirus, next-generation sequencing was less sensitive than real-time RT-PCR. The advantage of the sequencing approach over real-time RT-PCR was the immediate availability of virus-typing information. Considering the development of platforms capable of generating more output data at declining costs, next-generation sequencing remains of interest for future virus diagnosis in clinical and public health settings and certainly as an additional tool when screening results from real-time RT-PCR are negative.","output":"Exploring the potential of next-generation sequencing in detection of respiratory viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Our study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with and without diabetes admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Methods This retrospective multicentre cohort study comprised 24 tertiary medical centres in France, and included 2851 patients (675 with diabetes) hospitalized for COVID-19 between 26 February and 20 April 2020. A propensity score-matching (PSM) method (1:1 matching including patients characteristics, medical history, vital statistics and laboratory results) was used to compare patients with and without diabetes (n = 603 per group). The primary outcome was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and/or in-hospital death. Results After PSM, all baseline characteristics were well balanced between those with and without diabetes: mean age was 71.2 years; 61.8% were male; and mean BMI was 29 kg/m2.

To date, multiple editorials and commentaries indicate the severity of the disruption without providing sufficient evidence with quantifiable data. METHODS: An online survey was submitted to the administrative offices of biomedical and medical PhD-programs at eight major universities in Sweden to gauge the impact of the pandemic on the students. It consisted of multiple-choice and open-ended questions where students could provide examples of positive and/or negative supervision strategies. Open answered questions were coded as either examples of positive or negative support. RESULTS: PhD students were divided into two groups: those with improved or unchanged supervision during the pandemic (group 1, n = 185), versus those whose supervision worsened (group 2, n = 69). Group 1 received more help from supervisors and more frequent supervision via both online and alternative platforms (email/messages and telephone). There was no significant difference in educational-stage, gender or caretaking responsibilities between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for the scientific community to learn how to provide the best possible supervision for PhD students during the pandemic. Our data suggests that more frequent supervision, and using a diverse array of meeting platforms is helpful. In addition, it is important for the students to feel that they have their supervisor's emotional support.

Although the disease burden in children and adolescents has been reasonably mild, they can transmit COVID-19 to others, thus vaccinating this age group may help to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. The main objective was to investigate the association between five psychological antecedents of vaccination hesitancy in COVID-19 immunised parents and their intention to have their child vaccinated against COVID-19. Further, we examined if parental vaccination history and conviction of the benefits of Swiss paediatric vaccination recommendations are associated with child vaccination intention, and where parents would like the vaccination performed. METHODS: A cross-sectional anonymous online survey in the COVID-19 vaccination centre Winterthur was conducted between 16 May and 30 September 2021. Individuals receiving COVID-19 vaccines in the vaccination centre were invited to participate. All individuals who participated in the survey after their first dose with children under 16 years were included in the analysis (n = 1318). Using multivariable logistic regression, the association between our main predictor variables, psychological antecedents (confidence, constraints, complacency, calculation, collective responsibility) measured by the validated 5C scale, and parents' intention to have their child vaccinated against COVID-19 was analysed, adjusted for parental vaccination history, conviction of benefits of vaccination recommendations for children and adults, children's age group, sociodemographic factors, and time-point of vaccine authorisation for 12-16-year-olds. RESULTS: 58.7% of the parents intended to vaccinate their child against COVID-19. Their preferred vaccination location for their child was the paediatrician or family doctor. Three psychological antecedents were associated with vaccination intention: confidence (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.76; borderline significant), calculation (AOR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58-0.81), and collective responsibility (AOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.47-2.52). Influenza vaccination (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.15-2.03) and conviction of the benefits of the Swiss vaccination recommendations for children and adolescents were independently associated with parental vaccination intention. CONCLUSIONS: Campaigns on COVID-19 vaccination for children may increase the intention of parents to have a child vaccinated when they address collective responsibility and calculation (weighing risks and benefits), independent of the conviction of the benefits of the vaccination recommendations, which was also a significant factor. The findings further show that parents of younger children favour their paediatrician or family doctor over vaccination centres as the vaccination setting for their child, an important finding for paediatric COVID-19 vaccination strategies.","output":"Confident and altruistic - parents' motives to vaccinate their children against COVID-19: a cross-sectional online survey in a Swiss vaccination centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Intravenous (IV) insertions are among the most performed procedures for children seeking medical care; they are often a painful and stressful experience for both children and their caregivers. Paediatric distress and pain that is inadequately treated may lead to a frightened and uncooperative child, repeated IV attempts and overall frustration with care for both the family and clinical team. We hypothesise that distraction via an immersive virtual reality (VR) experience may reduce the associated distress for children undergoing IV insertions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This two-armed randomised controlled superiority trial will be conducted in a Canadian paediatric emergency department and will aim to enrol 80 children overall. Children will be randomised to receive either departmental standard of care alone or standard of care plus an immersive VR experience. Children 6C17 years of age who are undergoing IV insertion and have topical anaesthetic application will be considered for inclusion. Our primary objective is to compare the reduction of distress between the two study arms. The primary outcome will be the childs observed distress score as measured by the Observational Signs of Behavioral Distress-Revised tool. Secondary outcomes include the childs pain intensity and fear, parental anxiety, satisfaction with the IV procedure, as well as adverse events.

The authors analyzed the outcome of surgically treated patients and how surgical resection was influenced by multiple embolizations. METHODS Thirty-one patients were included from January of 2000 to December of 2012. The mean patient age was 24.9 years. Anatomical involvement, definition of limits, functional impairment, number of embolizations, type of resection, reconstruction method, blood transfusion, and hospital stay were evaluated. Morbidity, mortality, and regrowth rates and need for additional procedures were evaluated. RESULTS Lesions were preferentially located at the orbits, cheeks, and lips. The number of embolizations per patient increased with lesion complexity. In 22 cases, total excision was accomplished, and in nine, subtotal resections were performed to favor function. After multiple embolizations, better lesion identification was observed. Primary closure was performed in 20 cases, local flaps were performed in seven cases, axial flaps were performed in two patients, and free flaps were performed in two cases. There were no deaths. Regrowth rates were influenced by limits between arteriovenous malformations and surrounding tissues (15.8 percent of cases with precise limits versus 58.3 percent of lesions with imprecise limits; p = 0.021) and by type of resection (18.2 percent of cases after total resection versus 66.7 percent after subtotal resections; p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS Multiple therapeutic embolizations seem to increase safety in the treatment of arteriovenous vascular malformations and suggest an additional positive effect besides bleeding control. Preoperative definition of limits and establishment of conditions for total resection are critical to determine management and risk of regrowth.

We examined self-reported completion of an advance directive, HCP, and attitudes toward ACP before and after COVID-19. Adjusted regressions were performed on attitudes toward ACP. Results: Participants' mean age was 64.2 years, most were non-Hispanic white (88.0%), men (96.0%), and identified as sexual minorities (96.0%). Many reported having an advance directive (59.6%) or HCP (67.3%). Most (57.6%) believed ACP to be more important now compared to the pre-pandemic era. Having an advance directive was associated with increase in age, higher education, living with other people, never having an AIDS diagnosis, and current undetectable viral load (p < 0.05).

The goal is to implement different strategies that allows to enhance and obtain health processes closer to standards. The Length Of Stay (LOS) is a very useful parameter for the management of services within the hospital and is an index evaluated for the management of costs. In fact, a patient's LOS can be affected by a number of factors, including their particular condition, medical history, or medical needs. To reduce and better manage the LOS it is necessary to be able to predict this value. METHODS: In this study, a predictive model was built for the total LOS of patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy, one of the most common emergency procedures. Demographic and clinical data of the 357 patients admitted at San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi dAragona University Hospital of Salerno (Italy) had used as independent variable of the multiple linear regression model. RESULTS: The obtained model had an R(2) value of 0.570 and, among the independent variables, the significant variables that most influence the total LOS were Age, Pre-operative LOS, Presence of Complication and Complicated diagnosis.

Child health professionals were concerned that this could contribute to the delayed diagnosis of life-threatening conditions, including childhood cancer (CC) and type 1 diabetes (T1DM).

Methods: We collected presentation route, timing and disease severity for children with newly diagnosed CC in three principal treatment centres, and T1DM in four centres between 1st January - 31st July 2020 and the corresponding period in 2019. We assessed the impact of lockdown on total diagnostic interval (TDI), patient interval (PI), system interval (SI) and disease severity. Findings: For CCs and T1DM, the route to diagnosis and severity of illness at presentation were unchanged across all time periods. Diagnostic intervals for CCs during lockdown were comparable to that in 2019 (TDI 4.6, PI 1.1 and SI 2.1 weeks), except for an increased PI in Jan-Mar 2020 (median 2.7 weeks). Diagnostic intervals for T1DM during lockdown were similar to that in 2019 (TDI 16 vs 15 and PI 14 vs 14 days), except for an increased PI in Jan-Mar 2020 (median 21 days).

The underlying reasons may be specific to the healthcare system in each country. Over the past decade, medicine has become an increasingly unpopular profession in China due to the heavy workload, long-term training, and inherent risks. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has placed the life-saving roles of healthcare professionals under the spotlight. This public health crisis may have a profound impact on career choices in Chinese population. METHODS: We conducted a questionnaire-based online survey among 21,085 senior high school students and 21,009 parents from 24 provinces (or municipalities) of China. We investigated the change of interest in medical study due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the potential motivational factors based on the expectancy-value theory framework. Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the correlation of static or dynamic interest in medical career pursuit with the reported number of COVID-19 cases. Logistic regression model was adopted to analyze the main factors associated with students choices. RESULTS: We observed an increased preference for medical study post the outbreak of COVID-19 in both students (17.5 to 29.6%) and parents (37.1 to 47.3%). Attainment value was found to be the main reason for the choice among students, with the contribution to society rated as the top motivation. On the other hand, the predominant demotivation in high school students was lack of interest, followed by concerns regarding violence against doctors, heavy workload, long-term training and heavy responsibility as a doctor. Additionally, students who were female, in the resit of final year, had highly educated parents and outside of Hubei province were significantly associated with a keen interest in pursuing medical study.

This study aimed to investigate the variations and drivers of multiple mortality causes. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cross-sectional surveillance study. SETTING: Original data in 1991 and 2000, and secondary data in 2010 and 2019 were collected from DSPs across China. PARTICIPANTS: Standardised mortality rates (SMRs) and crude mortality rates (CMRs) of the Chinese population in 1991, 2000, 2010 and 2019 were ascertained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in the Gini coefficients (G), computed using SMR, were decomposed into reranking (R) and proportionality (P) to identify variations in communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseases (CMNN); non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injury. The CMR difference (in %) was partitioned into the demographic structure and non-demographic factors using the mortality-rate-difference method. RESULTS: From 1991 to 2019, the overall CMR increased from 591.327/100 000 to 674.505/100 000, whereas the SMR continually decreased. An increasing concentration of NCDs contributed to the increased all-cause G from 0.443 to 0.560 during 1991C2019. Between 1991 and 2019, compared with CMNN (R=0.054) and NCDs (R=0.037), the ranking of injury changed the most (R=0.174). The ranking of diabetes, falls and road traffic accidents increased markedly over time. The decreased SMR of NCDs (P=?0.013) was mainly due to low-ranking causes, whereas changes in CMNN (P=0.003) and injury (P=0.131) were due to high-ranking causes. All-cause CMR increased by 14.06% from 1991 to 2019 due to greater contributions from the demographic structure (68.46%) than the non-demographic factors (?54.40%). Demographic structural changes accounted more for CMR increases in males (70.52%) and urban populations (75.58%). CONCLUSIONS: Prevention and control measures targeting NCDs and specific causes are imperatively needed, and should be strengthened as the population ages, especially for males and rural populations.","output":"Gini coefficient decomposition-based and mortality-rate-difference-based description of mortality causes in the Chinese population from 1991 to 2019: a retrospective cross-sectional surveillance study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The implementation of effective control measures in a timely fashion is crucial to control the epidemic outbreak of COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to analyze the control measures implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as evaluating the responses and outcomes at different phases for epidemic control in Taiwan. (2) Methods: This case study reviewed responses to COVID-19 and the effectiveness of a range of control measures implemented for epidemic control in Taiwan and assessed all laboratory-confirmed cases between 11 January until 20 December 2020, inclusive of these dates. The confirmation of COVID-19 infection was defined as the positive result of a reverse-transcriptaseCpolymerase-chain-reaction test taken from a nasopharyngeal swab. Test results were reported by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. The incidence rate, mortality rate, and testing rate were compiled, and the risk ratio was provided to gain insights into the effectiveness of prevention measures. (3) Results and Discussion: This study presents retrospective data on the COVID-19 incidence rate in Taiwan, combined with the vital preventive control measures, in a timeline of the early stage of the epidemic that occurred in Taiwan. The implementation of multiple strategy control measures and the assistance of technologies to control the COVID-19 epidemic in Taiwan led to a relatively slower trend in the outbreak compared to the neighboring countries. In Taiwan, 766 confirmed patients were included, comprised of 88.1% imported cases and 7.2% local transmission cases, within the studied period. The incidence rate of COVID-19 in Taiwan during the studied period was 32 per million people, with a mortality rate of 0.3 per million people. Our analysis showed a significantly raised incidence risk ratio in the countries of interest in comparison to Taiwan during the study period; in the range of 1.9 to 947.5. The outbreak was brought under control through epidemic policies and hospital strategies implemented by the Taiwan Government. (4) Conclusion: Taiwans preventive strategies resulted in a drastically lower risk for Taiwan nationals of contracting COVID-19 when new pharmaceutical drug or vaccines were not yet available. The preventive strategies employed by Taiwan could serve as a guide and reference for future epidemic control strategies.","output":"Effectiveness of Epidemic Preventive Policies and Hospital Strategies in Combating COVID-19 Outbreak in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a profound impact on the lives of high-risk drug users and on the services responding to their needs in at least two important ways: first, through the restrictive measures introduced to mitigate the spread of the virus and, second, as a result of extensive economic downturn.

A factor analysis was used to identify primary factors influencing overall CS. The authors then modeled how these primary factors, along with various demographic factors, influence sales metrics. The results are then compared with previous estimates of such drivers in pre-COVID tasting rooms. Findings The authors identified four main CS factors: Staff Interactions, Wine Tasting, COVID-19 Precautions and Ambience that play a significant role in overall CS. Of these, Wine Tasting was shown to have a positive influence on total amount spent and the number of bottles purchased, whereas COVID-19 Precautions positively impacted the number of bottles purchased.

Double-stranded RNAs, some in non-encapsidated forms are increasingly becoming causal agents for sporadic diseases and are consistently associated with a complex profile of dsRNAs, presumably of (multiple) viral origin present in the host while the same are conspicuously absent in healthy (looking) counterparts. The emergence of an unusual Agaricus bisporus mushroom 'patch disease' first reported in 1996, later termed as 'mushroom virus X' (MVX), exhibited a wide range of symptoms (e.g. barren patches beside healthy looking mushrooms, arrested pins, premature opening, brown, off-colour and distortions in shape). A variable compendium of novel 26 (dsRNA) elements, ranging in sizes between 20.2kb to 0.64kb, several of them (-17/26) in non-encapsidated form have been shown to occur in the diseased mushroom fruiting bodies and are thought to comprise multiple viruses. Ten years on, this devastating disease is now more widespread and prevalent in a number of European countries (e.g. The Netherlands, Ireland) ranging from occasional to severe outbreaks leading to crop losses. Impressive data has been accumulated on the symptoms, but the potential aetiological sources, biochemical and molecular characterizations corresponding to the symptoms vis-a-vis MVX linked dsRNAs still remain either elusive or unclear. We have overviewed mainly the molecular findings of research groups working on MVX in these countries together with our own work on MVX in Northern Ireland. To date, the results reviewed suggest that with the exception of 4 low molecular weight dsRNA bands (sizes 2.0. 1.8, 0.8 and 0.6 kb) which consistently were found synchronous to mushroom off-colour/browning symptoms in the UK and The Netherlands, other individual MVX dsRNAs or their banding patterns clearly lack credible relationship with other symptoms of the MVX disease complex. The issues in the molecular characterisation of the MVX dsRNAs include the disparate results on the molecular sequences obtained for some of these by the different research groups, the varying molecular methods or approaches adopted by them for deciphering the nucleotide sequences of the novel dsRNAs that are different from previously encountered mushroom viruses. The future outlook and general consensus among mushroom researchers worldwide is for an urgent need to recruit international taskforce and re-focus on clarifying the symptom vis-a-vis dsRNAs in the enigmatic MVX disease complex. As crossing the cellular membrane is a key step to infection process, we have also attempted to draw parallels with other viruses in terms of the potential cell entry mechanisms for MVX dsRNAs. In the light of MVX disease and A. bisporus being a commercial crop worldwide in agri-food markets, and taking cue from its nearest Basidiomycete model mushroom, Coprinus cinereus whose genome mapping is completed, we also propose that it may be timely for the international research groups to renew efforts to prop up a network for sequencing the host A. bisporus mushroom genome (-38 MB) for a better understanding of host-pathogen relationships.","output":"The enigma of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) associated with mushroom virus X (MVX)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is a global health concern that has become a pandemic over the past few months. This study aims at understanding the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients with pleural effusion. METHODS: COVID-19 patients were retrospectively enrolled from the Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Pharyngeal swabs from patients were tested using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Patients with COVID-19 were divided into two groups based on their computed tomography (CT) scans for the presence of pleural effusion at admission. We compared the clinical features, laboratory findings, scans and clinical outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: Pleural effusion was observed in 9.19% of the patients. Patients with pleural effusion were more likely to be severe or critical cases. Moreover, patients with pleural effusion were associated with increased mortality. Of the 799 discharged patients, patients with pleural effusion had longer hospital stays and duration of viral shedding since the onset of symptoms as compared with that for patients without pleural effusion. After discharge, 217 patients visited for a follow-up CT re-examination at the Union Hospital. The CT scans showed that patients with pleural effusion required a longer time to resolve the lung inflammation after the onset of COVID-19 as compared with the time required by patients without pleural effusion. CONCLUSION: This population of patients requires special attention and pleural effusion may be an indicator of poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Pleural effusion as an indicator for the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Determination of the mechanisms of interspecies transmission is of great significance for the prevention of epidemic diseases caused by emerging coronaviruses (CoVs). Recently, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was shown to exhibit broad host cell range mediated by surface expression of aminopeptidase N (APN), and humans have been reported to be at risk of PDCoV infection. In the present study, we first demonstrated overexpression of APN orthologues from various species, including mice and felines, in the APN-deficient swine small intestine epithelial cells permitted PDCoV infection, confirming that APN broadly facilitates PDCoV cellular entry and perhaps subsequent interspecies transmission. PDCoV was able to limitedly infect mice in vivo, distributing mainly in enteric and lymphoid tissues, suggesting that mice may serve as a susceptible reservoir of PDCoV. Furthermore, elements (two glycosylation sites and four aromatic amino acids) on the surface of domain B (S1(B)) of the PDCoV spike glycoprotein S1 subunit were identified to be critical for cellular surface binding of APN orthologues. However, both domain A (S1(A)) and domain B (S1(B)) were able to elicit potent neutralizing antibodies against PDCoV infection. The antibodies against S1(A) inhibited the hemagglutination activity of PDCoV using erythrocytes from various species, which might account for the neutralizing capacity of S1(A) antibodies partially through a blockage of sialic acid binding. The study reveals the tremendous potential of PDCoV for interspecies transmission and the role of two major PDCoV S1 domains in receptor binding and neutralization, providing a theoretical basis for development of intervention strategies. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses exhibit a tendency for recombination and mutation, which enables them to quickly adapt to various novel hosts. Previously, orthologues of aminopeptidase N (APN) from mammalian and avian species were found to be associated with porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) cellular entry in vitro. Here, we provide in vivo evidence that mice are susceptible to PDCoV limited infection. We also show that two major domains (S1(A) and S1(B)) of the PDCoV spike glycoprotein involved in APN receptor binding can elicit neutralizing antibodies, identifying two glycosylation sites and four aromatic amino acids on the surface of the S1(B) domain critical for APN binding and demonstrating that the neutralization activity of S1(A) antibodies is partially attributed to blockage of sugar binding activity. Our findings further implicate PDCoVs great potential for interspecies transmission, and the data of receptor binding and neutralization may provide a basis for development of future intervention strategies.","output":"Roles of Two Major Domains of the Porcine Deltacoronavirus S1 Subunit in Receptor Binding and Neutralization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Proteolytic processing of the Lassa virus envelope glycoprotein precursor GP-C by the host proprotein convertase site 1 protease (S1P) is a prerequisite for the incorporation of the subunits GP-1 and GP-2 into viral particles and, hence, essential for infectivity and virus spread. Therefore, we tested in this study the concept of using S1P as a target to block efficient virus replication. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We demonstrate that stable cell lines inducibly expressing S1P-adapted (1)-antitrypsin variants inhibit the proteolytic maturation of GP-C. Introduction of the S1P recognition motifs RRIL and RRLL into the reactive center loop of (1)-antitrypsin resulted in abrogation of GP-C processing by endogenous S1P to a similar level observed in S1P-deficient cells. Moreover, S1P-specific (1)-antitrypsins significantly inhibited replication and spread of a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the Lassa virus glycoprotein GP as well as authentic Lassa virus. Inhibition of viral replication correlated with the ability of the different (1)-antitrypsin variants to inhibit the processing of the Lassa virus glycoprotein precursor. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that glycoprotein cleavage by S1P is a promising target for the development of novel anti-arenaviral strategies.","output":"Inhibition of Lassa Virus Glycoprotein Cleavage and Multicycle Replication by Site 1 Protease-Adapted (1)-Antitrypsin Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cooperative research programs aimed at reducing biological threats have increased scientific capabilities and capacities in Kazakhstan.

Here, we address the growing controversy in the literature of whether hospitalization is a risk factor for long COVID. We found that hospitalization is associated with worse pulmonary restriction and reduction in diffusion capacity at 3 months post infection. However, the impact on functional, quality of life and mental health is equally severe in those who have and have not been hospitalized during the acute infection.

This work summarizes our preliminary findings on automatic detection of respiratory distress using well-known acoustic and prosodic features. Speech samples are collected from de-identified telemedicine phonecalls from a healthcare provider in Bangladesh. The recordings include conversational speech samples of patients talking to doctors showing mild or severe respiratory distress or asthma symptoms. We hypothesize that respiratory distress may alter speech features such as voice quality, speaking pattern, loudness, and speech-pause duration. To capture these variations, we utilize a set of well-known acoustic and prosodic features with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for detecting the presence of respiratory distress. Experimental evaluations are performed using a 3-fold cross-validation scheme, ensuring patient-independent data splits. We obtained an overall accuracy of 86.4\\\\% in detecting respiratory distress from the speech recordings using the acoustic feature set.

Here, we present the rationale and design of a large, international trial that combines features of adaptive platform trials with pragmatic point-of-care trials to determine best treatment strategies for patients admitted to an intensive care unit with severe community-acquired pneumonia. The trial uses a novel design, entitled a randomized embedded multifactorial adaptive platform. The design has five key features: 1) randomization, allowing robust causal inference; 2) embedding of study procedures into routine care processes, facilitating enrollment, trial efficiency, and generalizability; 3) a multifactorial statistical model comparing multiple interventions across multiple patient subgroups; 4) response-adaptive randomization with preferential assignment to those interventions that appear most favorable; and 5) a platform structured to permit continuous, potentially perpetual enrollment beyond the evaluation of the initial treatments. The trial randomizes patients to multiple interventions within four treatment domains: antibiotics, antiviral therapy for influenza, host immunomodulation with extended macrolide therapy, and alternative corticosteroid regimens, representing 240 treatment regimens. The trial generates estimates of superiority, inferiority, and equivalence between regimens on the primary outcome of 90-day mortality, stratified by presence or absence of concomitant shock and proven or suspected influenza infection. The trial will also compare ventilatory and oxygenation strategies, and has capacity to address additional questions rapidly during pandemic respiratory infections.

The earliest outbreak of yellow fever in Nigeria was reported in Lagos in 1864 with subsequent regular outbreaks reported until 1996. A large epidemic of yellow fever occurred in Oyo State in April and May 1987 following an epidemic of sylvatic yellow fever in Eastern Nigeria the previous year. For 21 years, no further confirmed cases were reported until September 2017 following which Nigeria has been responding to successive outbreaks. The renewed onset of yellow fever outbreaks in Nigeria followed a global trend of reports and from other African countries. Yellow Fever disease has no cure, but control is through vaccination and vector control. Eliminating Yellow fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy to improve high-risk countries prevention, preparedness, detection, management, and response to yellow fever outbreaks was developed by the WHO in 2017 and launched in Nigeria in April 2018. Yet, poor vaccination coverage continues to be a cause for concern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study that examines the resurgence of Yellow fever cases and outbreaks from 2013 to 2020 in Oyo State, Nigeria. The Yellow Fever data for both surveillance and routine Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) were the focus of the review. Surveillance data were retrieved from the States database reported by all 33 LGAs, maintained by the State and supported by the World Health Organization at the Zonal and State levels. The routine EPI data were retrieved from District Health Information Software (DHIS_2). The proportion of LGAs reporting at least one case of suspected yellow fever with a blood specimen and the number of suspected cases reported for each year within the period under review was measured. We also assessed the trend of confirmed cases and the incidence per 100,000 persons. Also, suspected cases of yellow fever were categorized into four age groups and their vaccination status was assessed. The States annual administrative routine vaccination coverage for yellow fever vaccine was compared with the number of confirmed cases for each year. RESULTS: The proportion of LGAs reporting at least a case of suspected yellow fever, with blood samples collected, ranged from 6.1 to 84.9% between 2014 and 2020 while a total of 9 confirmed (8 cases) and probable (1 case) cases of yellow fever were recorded. However, there were no confirmed cases from the year 2013 to 2016, including 2018 but an upward trend of incidence of the disease per 100,000 persons from 0% to 2013 through 2018, to 3.5% in 2019, and then to 5.6% in 2020 was observed. 93 of 240 (39%) suspected yellow fever cases reported during the given period were observed to have received yellow fever vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the increase in the circulation of the yellow fever virus in the state reiterates the state is at a high risk of yellow fever transmission and underlines the need for viable interventions such as environmental hygiene to rid the environment of the disease vectors ecological niche and improving routine EPI coverage to provide population immunity.","output":"Changing epidemiology of yellow fever virus in Oyo State, Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of fear of the coronavirus and related insecurities around the pandemic have fuelled nationalist and increased exclusionary tendencies in countries all over the world.

To date, over a hundred COVID-19 vaccines are known to be under development and the few that have been approved to fight the disease are using the spike protein as the primary target antigen. Although virus neutralizing epitopes are mainly located within the RBD of the spike protein, the presence of T cell epitopes, particularly the CTL epitopes that are likely to be needed for killing infected cells, has received comparatively little attention. In this study, we predicted several potential T cell epitopes with web-based analytic tools, and narrowed them down from several potential MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes by ELIspot and cytolytic assays to a conserved MHC-I epitope. The epitope is highly conserved in current viral variants including the most recent Omicron and compatible with presentation by most HLA alleles worldwide.

From that date, the Regional Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Trust (AREU) of the Lombardy region decided to apply Business Intelligence (BI) to the management of EMS during the epidemic. The aim of the study is to assess in this context the impact of BI on EMS management outcomes. METHODS: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, AREU is using BI daily to track the number of first aid requests received from 112. BI analyses the number of requests that have been classified as respiratory and/or infectious episodes during the telephone dispatch interview. Moreover, BI allows identifying the numerical trend of episodes in each municipality (increasing, stable, decreasing). RESULTS: AREU decides to reallocate in the territory the resources based on real-time data recorded and elaborated by BI. Indeed, based on that data, the numbers of vehicles and personnel have been implemented in the municipalities that registered more episodes and where the clusters are supposed to be. BI has been of paramount importance in taking timely decisions on the management of EMS during COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusions: Even if there is little evidence-based literature focused on BI impact within the health care, this study suggests that BI can be usefully applied to promptly identify clusters and patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and, consequently, make informed decisions that can improve the EMS management response to the outbreak.","output":"Business Intelligence applied to Emergency Medical Services in the Lombardy region during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The enforced lockdown amid COVID-19 pandemic eased anthropogenic activities across India.

Furthermore, rural data are rarely centralized, precluding comparability across urban and rural regions. OBJECTIVEThe purpose of this study is to assess hospitalization rates and all-cause inpatient mortality among persons with definitive COVID-19 diagnoses residing in rural and urban areas. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTSThis retrospective cohort study from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) examines a cohort of 573,018 patients from 27 US hospital systems presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 2020 and March 2021, of whom 117,897 were hospitalized. A sample of 450,725 hospitalized persons without COVID-19 diagnoses was identified for comparison. EXPOSURESZIP Codes provided by source hospital systems were classified by urban-rural gradient through a crosswalk to the US Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESPrimary outcomes were hospitalization and all-cause mortality among hospitalized patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis and mixed effects logistic regression were used to estimate 30-day survival in hospitalized patients and associations between rurality, hospitalization, and inpatient mortality while controlling for major risk factors. RESULTSRural patients were more likely to be older, white, have higher body mass index, and diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 later in the pandemic compared with their urban counterparts. Rural compared with urban inhabitants had higher rates of hospitalization (23% vs. 19%) and all-cause mortality among hospitalized patients (16% vs. 11%). After adjustment for demographic and baseline differences, rural residents (both urban adjacent and non-adjacent) with COVID-19 were more likely to be hospitalized (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 1.41, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.37-1.45 and AOR 1.42, CI 1.35-1.50) and to die or be transferred to hospice (AOR 1.62, CI 1.30-1.49 and 1.38, CI 1.30-1.49), respectively.

Many countries already have detailed plans for vaccine targeting based on minimising severe illness, death and healthcare burdens. Normally, relatively simple relationships between epidemiological parameters, vaccine efficacy and vaccine uptake predict the success of any immunisation programme. However, the dynamics of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is made more complex by age-dependent factors, changing levels of infection and the potential relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as the perceived risk declines. In this study we use an age-structured mathematical model, matched to a range of epidemiological data, to consider the interaction between the UK vaccination programme and future relaxation (or removal) of NPIs. Our predictions highlight the population-level risks of early relaxation leading to a pronounced wave of infections, and the individual-level risk relative to vaccine status. While the novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for this outbreak, this is highly contingent on the transmission blocking action of the vaccine and the population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored as vaccine programmes are rolled out in the UK and other countries.","output":"Vaccination and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions: when can the UK relax about COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review article provides a brief historical perspective on the use of DBS for tremor, reviews the various etiologies for tremor that can be effectively managed with DBS therapy, discusses the DBS targets that have been used for suppression of tremor, and reviews in detail important aspects of DBS surgical technique, including significant technological advances over the past several years that, when applied, can substantially improve the outcomes of DBS for tremor.

Concerns exist regarding the quality of TURBT, early recurrence rate and the high-risk patient cohort that makes this approach less popular in some centers. The Primary Outcome was to determine 30-day readmission rate and 30-day morbidity using the Clavien-Dindo classification. The Secondary Outcomes were to determine patient cohort selection, quality of TURBT and early recurrence rate and to report patient feedback following day-case TURBT. Materials & Methods: A retrospective audit of day-case TURBTs in a District General Hospital (DGH) over 3 years pre-COVID19 (January 2017 - March 2020) was performed. We only included patients who underwent a TURBT and excluded any cystoscopy, biopsy or fulguration. A day-case TURBT pathway is in place, for postoperative recovery, instillation of intravesical chemotherapy postoperatively if required and re-admission for trial without catheter when indicated in the hospital. Case notes were reviewed manually. Feedback was obtained from patients who had new tumour TURBT in the last year using hospital patient feedback forms. Results: We included 77 patients who underwent TURBT in the day-case theatre, of these 5 patients required in-patient stay after the surgery. Of the remaining 72 discharged on the same day, 8 were re-admitted (11%) for Clavien-Dindo I complications. The mean age of the patients was 71 years (34-94 years);77% (59/77) were male;reported ASA scores were 3/77 ASA 1 (4%), 43/77 ASA 2 (56%), 28/77 ASA 3 (36%);30% (23/77) patients were on anticoagulants or antiplatelets;the average tumour size was 2cm (1mm C 5cm), 69% (53/77) were papillary in nature and 36/77 were newly diagnosed tumours (47%) and the remainder were recurrences or re-resections. Of the new tumours, 32/36 (89%) received mitomycin C as indicated. On final histology, muscle was present in specimen in 50/77 (65%). The readmission/failed discharge group had a higher rate of older patients, with higher ASA scores and longer operative times, however resection quality and tumour characteristics were not different from the day-case TURBTs. The recurrence rate at first check cystoscopy for the newly diagnosed tumours was 3% (1/36) while 1 patient had residual disease in a bladder diverticulum. All patients reported an overall positive experience. Conclusions: In the first of its kind audit patients reported outcomes after day-case TURBT, though readmission rate was relatively higher than previous reports in the literature, the overall patient experience was favorable and the outcomes of TURBT quality and early recurrence were satisfactory. The data obtained can provide guidance to employ better patient selection to reduce readmission rates.

AIM: This study aimed at evaluating the impact of information dissemination and public mental healthcare needs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. It also hopes to determine if there is an unmet need for telepsychiatry in Nigeria. SETTING: Community-based study covering the North, South and West of Nigeria. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study using an on-line survey form via the snowballing sampling method. RESULTS: Social media was identified as the main source of information concerning COVID-19, and half of the respondents opined that information dissemination was inadequate. Psychological distress was present in 90.5% of the participants and 61.8% admitted that this distress was worsened by fake news and myths concerning COVID-19. However, 53.8% of the participants were willing to access mental healthcare services, with telepsychiatry being the preferred choice. CONCLUSION: There is a need to implement a national public mental health service during this emergency. Telepsychiatry has numerous advantages in this context and maybe an opportunity to roll out a novel means of delivering mental healthcare.","output":"Mental health distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria: Need for psychological intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: This study aims to explore the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on media habits and consumption in Spain, one of the most severely affected countries Methodology: A representative online survey of the Spanish population (N = 1,500 participants) was conducted from March 13 to 30, 2020, coinciding with the first weeks of home confinement The sample was studied according to two variables, gender (Women N = 750;Men N = 750) and age (18-39 years individuals, N = 720;over 40 years individuals N = 780) to detect the most relevant specificities of each group The sampling error is +/- 4 38% at a 95% confidence Results: Results highlight that television is the most used media when it comes to finding out about the virus, before digital media It should be noted that infoshow-type television programs manage to accumulate more audience than the traditional news programs The least used media to get information about the evolution of the Covid-19 are the Internet, social networks, radio, information by relatives or acquaintances, and traditional print press Although radio consumption seems not to be significant to stay informed, this medium is the most credible, in addition to television Finally, the consumption of over-the-top (OTT) platforms has grown considerably during this period Discussion: Television recovers the audience of the youngest targets that it seemed to have lost in in favor of digital media Conclusions: An increasingly complex and competitive media landscape is consolidating","output":"Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on media consumption in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The events surrounding COVID-19, combined with the mandatory quarantines widely imposed in Asia and Europe since the virus outbreak, have reignited discussion of the balance between individual rights and liberties and public health during epidemics and pandemics.

Several patient groups are theorized to be at particular risk. Since specific vaccination guidelines for these patients are based on expert opinion, we performed a retrospective monocentric analysis of the tolerability of adenoviral vector and mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in a cohort of patients allegedly at high risk of IHR. Reactions were assessed immediately on-site by allergists during a monitored vaccination protocol and after 3C7 days through telephone interviews. The cohort included 196 patients (aged 12C84 years) with primary mast cell disease (pMCD, 50.5%), idiopathic anaphylaxis (IA, 19.9%), hereditary angioedema (HAE, 5.1%) or miscellaneous indications (24.5%). Twenty-five immediate reactions were observed in 221 vaccine doses (11.3%). Most occurred in IA or miscellaneous patients. None fulfilled anaphylaxis criteria and most were mild and self-limiting. Reaction occurrence was significantly associated with female sex. In total, 13.5% of pMCD patients reported mast cell activation-like symptoms within 72 h post-vaccination. All pediatric pMCD patients (n = 9, 12C18 years) tolerated both mRNA-based vaccine doses. In summary, adenoviral vector and mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines were safe and well-tolerated in patients with pMCD, HAE, and IA. No anaphylaxis was observed. The mild and subjective nature of most reactions suggests a nocebo effect associated with vaccination in a medicalized setting.

Due to the complexity of the chemical constituent, however, the underlying pharmacological mechanism of action of XCD is still unclear. To explore its protective mechanism on ALI, firstly, a network pharmacology experiment was conducted to construct a component-target network of XCD, which identified 46 active components and 280 predicted target genes. Then, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ALI model rats treated with and without XCD and 753 DEGs were found. By overlapping the target genes identified using network pharmacology and DEGs using RNA-seq, and subsequent proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network analysis, 6 kernel targets such as vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), AKT1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and gene of phosphate and tension homology deleted on chromsome ten (PTEN) were screened out to be closely relevant to ALI treatment. Verification experiments in the LPS-induced ALI model rats showed that XCD could alleviate lung tissue pathological injury through attenuating proinflammatory cytokines release such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1. Meanwhile, both the mRNA and protein expression levels of PI3K, mTOR, HIF-1, and VEGF in the lung tissues were down-regulated with XCD treatment. Therefore, the regulations of XCD on PI3K/mTOR/HIF-1/VEGF signaling pathway was probably a crucial mechanism involved in the protective mechanism of XCD on ALI treatment.

In consideration of spine trainees and the spine fellow application pipeline, the current study aims to evaluate for deviations in trends found in applications to an orthopaedic surgery residency program from the 2021 cycle compared to six years prior. Methods After institutional review board approval, applications to a single orthopaedic surgery residency program from application cycles 2015 to 2021 were evaluated in the Electronic Residency Application System (ERAS) and analyzed for trends. Supplementary information was taken from publicly available ERAS statistics. Results Compared to existing trends, the ERAS 2021 cycle had a greater number of applicants, more research items, and lower rates of USMLE Step 2 test administration.

New lipids will be required, but also better understanding LNP interactions with the biological environment. Herein, we model protein corona formation on PEG-ylated DLin-MC3-DMA LNPs and identify time-dependent maturation steps that critically unlock their cellular uptake and mRNA delivery. Uptake requires active serum proteins and precedes after a significant (2 hours) lag-time, which we show can be eliminated by pre-incubating LNPs for 3-4 hours in serum-containing media. This indicates an important role of protein corona maturation for the pharmacokinetic effects of these LNPs. We show, using single-nanoparticle imaging, NMR diffusometry, SANS, and proteomics, that the LNPs, upon serum exposure, undergo rapid PEG-shedding (30 minutes), followed by a slower rearrangement of the adsorbed protein layer. The PEG-shedding coincides in time with high surface abundance of Apolipoprotein A-II, whereas the LNPs preferentially bind Apolipoprotein E when their maximum uptake-competent state is reached. Finally, we show that pre-incubation of the LNPs enables rapid uptake and allows pulse-chase video-microscopy colocalization experiments with sufficiently short pulse durations to gain improved mechanistic understanding of how intracellular trafficking events determine delivery efficacy, emphasizing early endosomes as important delivery-mediating compartments.","output":"Time evolution of PEG-shedding and serum protein coronation determines the cell uptake kinetics and delivery of lipid nanoparticle formulated mRNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the systems that people depend on are increasingly strained by the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, public health impacts are manifesting in different ways beyond morbidity and mortality for elderly populations.

MeV is responsible for major morbidity and mortality in non-vaccinated populations. ERDRP-0519, a pan-morbillivirus small molecule inhibitor for the treatment of measles, targets the morbillivirus RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRP) complex and displayed unparalleled oral efficacy against lethal infection of ferrets with CDV, an established surrogate model for human measles. Resistance profiling identified the L subunit of the RdRP, which harbors all enzymatic activity of the polymerase complex, as the molecular target of inhibition. Here, we examined binding characteristics, physical docking site, and the molecular mechanism of action of ERDRP-0519 through label-free biolayer interferometry, photoaffinity cross-linking, and in vitro RdRP assays using purified MeV RdRP complexes and synthetic templates. Results demonstrate that unlike all other mononegavirus small molecule inhibitors identified to date, ERDRP-0519 inhibits all phosphodiester bond formation in both de novo initiation of RNA synthesis at the promoter and RNA elongation by a committed polymerase complex. Photocrosslinking and resistance profiling-informed ligand docking revealed that this unprecedented mechanism of action of ERDRP-0519 is due to simultaneous engagement of the L protein polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase)-like domain and the flexible intrusion loop by the compound, pharmacologically locking the polymerase in pre-initiation conformation. This study informs selection of ERDRP-0519 as clinical candidate for measles therapy and identifies a previously unrecognized druggable site in mononegavirus L polymerase proteins that can silence all synthesis of viral RNA. Importance The mononegavirus order contains major established and recently emerged human pathogens. Despite the threat to human health, antiviral therapeutics directed against this order remain understudied. The mononegavirus polymerase complex represents a promising drug target due to its central importance for both virus replication and viral mitigation of the innate host antiviral response. In this study, we have mechanistically characterized a clinical candidate small-molecule MeV polymerase inhibitor. The compound blocked all phosphodiester bond formation activity, a unique mechanism of action unlike all other known mononegavirus polymerase inhibitors. Photocrosslinking-based target site mapping demonstrated that this class-defining prototype inhibitor stabilizes a pre-initiation conformation of the viral polymerase complex that sterically cannot accommodate template RNA. Function-equivalent druggable sites exist in all mononegavirus polymerases. In addition to its direct anti-MeV impact, the insight gained in this study can therefore serve as a blueprint for indication spectrum expansion through structure-informed scaffold engineering or targeted drug discovery.","output":"Therapeutic Targeting of Measles Virus Polymerase with ERDRP-0519 Suppresses All RNA Synthesis Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a narrative reflection about my experience of the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreaks across countries between January and early March 2020.

Immediate triage of suspected patients with chest infections caused by COVID-19 using chest CT may be of assistance when results from definitive viral testing are delayed. PURPOSE: To develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) system to score the likelihood and extent of pulmonary COVID-19 on chest CT scans using the CO-RADS and CT severity scoring systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CORADS-AI consists of three deep learning algorithms that automatically segment the five pulmonary lobes, assign a CO-RADS score for the suspicion of COVID-19 and assign a CT severity score for the degree of parenchymal involvement per lobe. This study retrospectively included patients who received an unenhanced chest CT scan due to clinical suspicion of COVID-19 at two medical centers. The system was trained, validated, and tested with data from one of the centers. Data from the second center served as an external test set. Diagnostic performance and agreement with scores assigned by eight independent observers were measured using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, linearly-weighted kappa and classification accuracy. RESULTS: 105 patients (62  16 years, 61 men) and 262 patients (64  16 years, 154 men) were evaluated in the internal and the external test set, respectively. The system discriminated between COVID-19 positive and negative patients with areas under the ROC curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91-0.98) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84-0.93). Agreement with the eight human observers was moderate to substantial with a mean linearly-weighted kappa of 0.60  0.01 for CO-RADS scores and 0.54  0.01 for CT severity scores. CONCLUSION: CORADS-AI correctly identified COVID-19 positive patients with high diagnostic performance from chest CT exams, assigned standardized CO-RADS and CT severity scores in good agreement with eight independent observers and generalized well to external data.","output":"Automated Assessment of CO-RADS and Chest CT Severity Scores in Patients with Suspected COVID-19 Using Artificial Intelligence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: This study aimed to describe the change in surgical practice and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mortality after surgical resection of colorectal cancer during the initial phases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHOD: This was an international cohort study of patients undergoing elective colon or rectal cancer resection, without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Centres entered data from their first recorded case of COVID-19 until 19 April 2020. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included anastomotic leak, postoperative SARS-CoV-2, and a comparison with a pre-pandemic European Society of Coloproctology cohort data. RESULTS: From 2073 patients in 40 countries, 1.3% (27/2073) had a defunctioning stoma and 3.0% (63/2073) had an end stoma instead of an anastomosis only. 30-day mortality was 1.8% (38/2073), the incidence of postoperative SARS-CoV-2 was 3.8% (78/2073), and the anastomotic leak rate was 4.9% (86/1738). Mortality was lowest in patients without a leak or SARS-CoV2 (14/1601, 0.9%), and highest in patients with both a leak and SARS-CoV-2 (5/13, 38.5%). Mortality was independently associated with an anastomotic leak (adjusted odds ratio 6.01, 95% confidence interval 2.58-14.06), postoperative SARS-CoV-2 (16.90, 7.86-36.38), male sex (2.46, 1.01-5.93), age >70 years (2.87, 1.32-6.20), and advanced cancer stage (3.43, 1.16-10.21). Compared to pre-pandemic data, there were fewer anastomotic leaks (4.9% versus 7.7%), an overall shorter length of stay (6 versus 7 days), but higher mortality (1.7% versus 1.1%). CONCLUSION: Surgeons need to further mitigate against both SARS-CoV-2 and anastomotic leak when offering surgery during current and future COVID-19 waves based on patient, operative, and organisational risks.","output":"P85 Outcomes from elective colorectal cancer surgery during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a substantial threat to people's lives and health due to its high infectivity and rapid spread. Computed tomography (CT) scan is one of the important auxiliary methods for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. However, CT image lesion edge is normally affected by pixels with uneven grayscale and isolated noise, which makes weak edge detection of the COVID-19 lesion more complicated. In order to solve this problem, an edge detection method is proposed, which combines the histogram equalization and the improved Canny algorithm. Specifically, the histogram equalization is applied to enhance image contrast. In the improved Canny algorithm, the median filter, instead of the Gaussian filter, is used to remove the isolated noise points. The K-means algorithm is applied to separate the image background and edge. And the Canny algorithm is improved continuously by combining the mathematical morphology and the maximum between class variance method (OTSU). On selecting four types of lesion images from COVID-CT date set, MSE, MAE, SNR, and the running time are applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The average values of these evaluation indicators are 1.7322, 7.9010, 57.1241, and 5.4887, respectively. Compared with other three methods, these values indicate that the proposed method achieves better result.

CHIKV is an enveloped virus belonging to the Togaviridae family and enters its host cell primarily via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Upon internalization, the endocytic vesicle containing the virus particle moves through the cell and delivers the virus to early endosomes where membrane fusion is observed. Thereafter, the nucleocapsid dissociates and the viral RNA is translated into proteins. In this study, we examined the importance of the microtubule network during the early steps of infection and dissected the intracellular trafficking behavior of CHIKV particles during cell entry. We observed two distinct CHIKV intracellular trafficking patterns prior to membrane hemifusion. Whereas half of the CHIKV virions remained static during cell entry and fused in the cell periphery, the other half showed fast-directed microtubule-dependent movement prior to delivery to Rab5-positive early endosomes and predominantly fused in the perinuclear region of the cell. Disruption of the microtubule network reduced the number of infected cells. At these conditions, membrane hemifusion activity was not affected yet fusion was restricted to the cell periphery. Furthermore, follow-up experiments revealed that disruption of the microtubule network impairs the delivery of the viral genome to the cell cytosol.

The incision is made in the abdomen, preferably in the umbilicus. Certain peculiarities are noted in this approach, such as the difficulty, and sometimes the impossibility, of centering the image, the need to move both the camera and instruments together, requiring even more delicate and precise movements than in laparoscopy. Since information on training for LESS is scarce in the current literature, the authors report their experience with five different cases of this nature, performed in two porcine models, and then discuss a training plan for LESS. METHODS Five LESS procedures were performed in two pigs using different training techniques: two (one single-port and one single-incision) transumbilical laparoscopic cholecystectomies; one right-sided single-incision laparoscopic radical nephrectomy; one single-incision transumbilical laparoscopic radical nephrectomy; and one single-port transumbilical laparoscopic nephrectomy. DISCUSSION Different from what was observed in the transition from open surgery to laparoscopy, the Halstedian model should not be used in the teaching of LESS since this procedure requires that professionals partner together, thus requiring not only the training of surgeons, but of the whole team.

We find that an increase in the transmission rates among children from reopening schools is unlikely to significantly increase the number of cases, unless this is accompanied by a change in adult behaviour. We also find that there is a risk of undetected outbreaks occurring in communities that have low access to healthcare and that are socially isolated from more privileged communities. The greater the degree of inequity and extent of social segregation, the longer it will take before any outbreaks are detected. A well-established evidence for health inequities, particularly in accessing primary healthcare and testing, indicates that Mori and Pacific peoples are at a higher risk of undetected outbreaks in Aotearoa New Zealand.

METHODS: During the fall 2020 semester, athletes and staff in both programs were tested daily using Quidels Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA), with positive antigen results requiring confirmatory testing with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We used genomic sequencing to investigate transmission dynamics in these two outbreaks. RESULTS: In Outbreak 1, 32 confirmed cases occurred within a university athletics program after the index patient attended a meeting while infectious despite a negative antigen test on the day of the meeting. Among isolates sequenced from Outbreak 1, 24 (92%) of 26 were closely related, suggesting sustained transmission following an initial introduction event. In Outbreak 2, 12 confirmed cases occurred among athletes from two university programs that faced each other in an athletic competition despite receiving negative antigen test results on the day of the competition. Sequences from both teams were closely related and unique from strains circulating in the community, suggesting transmission during intercollegiate competition.

The timing and severity of a resurgence, however, varies in magnitude given multiple factors: relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, the rate of waning immunity, the transmissibility of variants of concern, and the protective characteristics of the vaccines against infection and severe disease. To prevent large-scale resurgence, booster vaccination and/or re-introduction of public health mitigation may be needed.","output":"Fall 2021 Resurgence and COVID-19 Seroprevalence in Canada: Modelling waning and boosting COVID-19 immunity in Canada, A Canadian Immunization Research Network Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the significant changes of economic growth rate, energy structure, and energy efficiency in China, whether energy policies should be adjusted is worthy of attention. This paper employs ARDL-ECM and Toda-Yamamoto causality to investigate the relationship between renewable energy, non-renewable energy, carbon emissions, economic growth, gross fixed capital formation, and urban population spanning the period 1960-2019 in China. The examined results of ARDL-ECM indicate that renewable energy both have positive impact on GDP in the short term and long term but non-renewable energy only have positive impact on GDP in the short term. Additionally, based on Toda-Yamamoto causality, this paper finds a unidirectional Granger causality running from economic growth to energy consumption and from energy consumption to carbon emissions. And there is a unidirectional Granger causality running from GDP to non-renewable energy consumption. It is worth noting that renewable energy consumption and economic growth have positive bidirectional influence on each other. The study findings suggest that stricter energy conservation and pollution emission reduction policy should be implemented and renewable energy should be applied on a larger scale in order to achieve the goal of sustainable economic development.","output":"Nexus among economic growth, carbon emissions, and renewable and non-renewable energy in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the early months of the COVID-19 epidemic, some have wondered if the force of this global experience will solve the problem of vaccine refusal that has vexed and preoccupied the global public health community for the last several decades. Drawing on historical and epidemiological analyses, we critique contemporary approaches to reducing vaccine hesitancy and articulate our notion of vaccine confidence as an expanded way of conceptualizing the problem and how to respond to it. Intervening on the rush of vaccine optimism we see pervading present discourse around the COVID-19 epidemic, we call for a re-imagination of the culture of public health and the meaning of vaccine safety regulations. Public confidence in vaccination programs depends on the work they do for the communitysocial, political, and moral as well as biological. The concept of public health and its programs must be broader than the delivery of the vaccine technology itself. The narrative work and policy actions entailed in actualizing such changes will, we expect, be essential in achieving a true vaccine confidence, however the public reacts to the specific vaccine that may be developed for COVID-19.","output":"Vaccine confidence in the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Frequent travel between the Southern border states in the USA, Mexico, and Latin American countries increases the risk of the Zika virus (ZIKV) spread. Patient education on virus transmission is fundamental in decreasing the number of imported cases, particularly among pregnant women. METHODS: The study used cross-sectional methodology to investigate information sources and knowledge concerning the ZIKV virus among 300 under-served pregnant Latinas recruited from prenatal care clinics in the North Texas region. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression models were used to investigate associations between the primary outcomes and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Physicians, nurses, and families are the major sources for pregnancy information, while media/internet (65%) and physician/nurse (33%) are the main sources for ZIKV information. Less than one-half of the mothers reported that their physician/nurse did not discuss safe sexual practices or inquired about their sexual practices. A considerable proportion of women from the community clinic were neither warned nor queried about travel to ZIKV risk countries. There is an overall understanding of Zika virus transmission, symptoms, complications, and recommended guidelines. Younger age and single mother status are risk factors for lack of ZIKV knowledge. Foreign-born mothers are 2.5C3.0 times more likely to have knowledge on disease transmission, symptoms, and microcephaly condition. While, younger mothers (18C24) are less likely to have knowledge of ZIKV infection symptoms (fever, rash and pink eye) and transmission of infection via unprotected sexual (vaginal, anal, or oral) behavior, compared to older mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions are needed to heighten the knowledge of ZIKV, particularly among women of reproductive age and their male partners in the community health care setting. Our study underscores the need for health care providers to be trained in delivering messages to enhance risk perception during health emergencies to vulnerable and underserved families (lower economic background, language ability, and culture).

We illustrate how linking large-scale administrative data can enable auditing mobility data for bias in the absence of demographic information and ground truth labels. More precisely, we show that linking voter roll data -- containing individual-level voter turnout for specific voting locations along with race and age -- can facilitate the construction of rigorous bias and reliability tests.

In addition to encoding the amino acid sequence for Gag, the underlying RNA sequence could encode cis-acting elements or nucleotide biases that are necessary for viral replication. Furthermore, RNA sequences that inhibit viral replication could be suppressed in gag. However, the functional relevance of RNA elements and nucleotide biases that promote or repress HIV-1 replication remain poorly understood. RESULTS: To characterize if the RNA sequence in gag controls HIV-1 replication, the matrix (MA) region was codon modified, allowing the RNA sequence to be altered without affecting the protein sequence. Codon modification of nucleotides (nt) 22-261 or 22-378 in gag inhibited viral replication by decreasing genomic RNA (gRNA) abundance, gRNA stability, Gag expression, virion production and infectivity. Comparing the effect of these point mutations to deletions of the same region revealed that the mutations inhibited infectious virus production while the deletions did not. This demonstrated that codon modification introduced inhibitory sequences. There is a much lower than expected frequency of CpG dinucleotides in HIV-1 and codon modification introduced a substantial increase in CpG abundance. To determine if they are necessary for inhibition of HIV-1 replication, codons introducing CpG dinucleotides were mutated back to the wild type codon, which restored efficient Gag expression and infectious virion production. To determine if they are sufficient to inhibit viral replication, CpG dinucleotides were inserted into gag in the absence of other changes. The increased CpG dinucleotide content decreased HIV-1 infectivity and viral replication. CONCLUSIONS: The HIV-1 RNA sequence contains low abundance of CpG dinucleotides. Increasing the abundance of CpG dinucleotides inhibits multiple steps of the viral life cycle, providing a functional explanation for why CpG dinucleotides are suppressed in HIV-1.

In general, anxiety and poor health are higher in parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) than parents of children without ASD. However, the symptoms of anxiety, depression and poor mental health are likely to be more escalated in parents of children with ASD during COVID-19, possibly due to the emergency measures involving suspension of essential services, closure of schools, work-from-home policy and lack of professional support, etc. AIM: This empirical research aimed to explore the attitude, anxiety and perceived mental health care of parents of children with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD A total of 211 participants, including mothers and fathers of children with ASD from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, participated in this online study. Along with demographic details, data on attitude, anxiety, mental health status and perceived mental health care were obtained using both self-reported questionnaire and reference standard questionnaire. The collected data were analysed using t-test, Pearson correlation analysis and linear regression analysis. The responses to open-ended questions were also collected and analysed qualitatively. RESULTS The study revealed that attitudes towards taking care of children with ASD were affected by parents' age and child's age, and mothers were more affected. Further, the anxiety of parents during COVID-19 was significantly higher than before the COVID-19 situation. It was found that parents' mental status during COVID-19 mediated the interaction between anxiety and perceived mental health care. Finally, the open-ended questions indicated that parents sought support from teachers, family members and therapists to deal with children with ASD during the pandemic outbreak. In the context of perceived mental health care, besides psychological and financial support, other measures like training sessions, online classes, etc., were recommended. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study insisted on the importance of support from government and local health authorities to introduce interventions for parents and children with ASD to improve the overall mental health.","output":"Attitude, anxiety and perceived mental health care needs among parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Saudi Arabia during COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poor psychiatric status and sleep quality were common among frontline healthcare workers (FHWs) during the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but the change in these mental health outcomes overtime remained unknown.

The respiratory symptoms largely mimic those of pneumonia with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. The effects on respiratory physiology are not yet fully understood, but evidence is emerging that there is much dysfunctional breathing reported but little information on tidal ventilation from the acute phase of the infection. Structured light plethysmography (SLP) is a contactless technique of respiratory function testing that measures tidal breathing parameters by assessing thoracoabdominal displacement. METHODS: In a postdischarge clinic, SLP was performed routinely on 110 hospitalised patients recovering from COVID-19 who had been screened for respiratory symptoms to confirm any respiratory changes occurring after the disease. Patients were categorised based on their hospital treatment in (1) the intensive therapy unit (ITU) (requiring intubation) (n=65) or (2) respiratory wards only (n=45). Data from these two patient cohorts were compared with preacquired data from healthy controls (n=30). RESULTS: We have found a significantly increased respiratory rate (p=0.006) in ITU patients compared with the healthy cohort and also a significant decrease in the inspiratory time (p=0.01), expiratory time (p=0.005) and the total breathing cycle (p=0.008). There were no significant differences between ITU and ward patients and no significant differences in healthy compared with ward patients. We examined the variability of breathing (entropy) both in terms of the breath-to-breath interval and the volume-to-volume change. The breath-to-breath interval alone was significantly lower in ITU patients compared with healthy cohorts (p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that abnormalities in tidal breathing can be detected in COVID-19 recovery patients, and SLP may be a promising tool in assessing the aftermath of diseases such as COVID-19, particularly if more intensive management strategies such as mechanical ventilation are required.","output":"Measurement of breathing in patients with post-COVID-19 using structured light plethysmography (SLP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infants growing up in an environment where more than one language is spoken tend to follow the early milestones of early language development.

Using eye tracking and a McGurk paradigm, we studied face scanning patterns when 7- to 10-month-old infants were viewing articulation of audiovisually congruent and incongruent syllables. We found that monolingual infants decreased their attention to the mouth and increased their attention to the eyes of speaking faces when presented with incongruent articulation, typically leading to the McGurk illusion during adulthood. In bilingual infants, no differences in face scanning patterns were observed between audiovisually congruent and incongruent articulation, suggesting that the increased variability in their speech experience may lead to more tolerance to articulatory inconsistencies.

However, 1xBEP results are based solely on five controlled trials from high-volume centers. We analyzed the outcome in a real-life population. Patients and Methods: In a multicentric international study, 423 NS CS1 patients receiving 1xBEP were retrospectively evaluated. Median follow-up was 37 (range, 6-89) months. Primary end points were relapse-free and overall survival evaluated after 5 years. We also looked at associations of relapse with clinico-pathological factors using stratified Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression models. Treatment modality and outcome of recurrences were analyzed descriptively. Results: The 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 96.2%. Thirteen patients (3.1%; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-5.04%) relapsed after a median time of 13 months, of which 10 were salvaged (77%). Relapses were mostly confined to retroperitoneal nodes. Three patients succumbed, two to disease progression and one to toxicity of chemotherapy. Pathological stage >pT2 was significantly associated with relapse rate.

A random\\\\effects model was employed for pooling the data. The risk of bias and quality of included studies was assessed using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies. Results The present meta-analysis comprises 10 retrospective and two prospective studies (6,976 COVID-19 patients). The serum analysis revealed significantly higher levels of alanine aminotransferases and aspartate aminotransferases and significantly lower albumin levels. Moreover, insignificant increases in serum levels of total bilirubin were observed. Upon subgroup analysis of six studies (severe cases, n=131; non-severe cases, n=334) stratified on the basis of disease severity, we found that these abnormalities were relatively higher in severe cases of COVID-19 (albumin [weighted mean difference (WMD), 34.03 g/L; 95% CI, 27.42 to 40.63; p<0.0001; I(2)=96.83%); alanine transaminase (ALT) [WMD, 31.66 U/L; 95% CI, 25.07 to 38.25; p<0.0001; I(2)=55.64%]; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [WMD, 41.79 U/L; 95% CI, 32.85 to 50.72; p<0.0001; I(2)=51.43%]; total bilirubin [WMD, 9.97 mol/L; 95% CI, 8.46 to 11.48; p<0.0001; I(2)=98%]) than in non-severe cases. Conclusion Deranged liver enzymes serve as prognostic factors to assess the severity of COVID-19.

An outbreak of this disease has been reported in mainland China with the city of Wuhan as the recognized epicenter. The disease has also been exported to other countries, including the Philippines, but the level of spread is still under control (as of 08 February 2020). To describe and predict the dynamics of the disease, several preliminary mathematical models are formulated by various international study groups. Here, the insights that can be drawn from these models are discussed, especially as inputs for designing strategies to control the epidemics. Proposed model-based strategies on how to prevent the spread of the disease in local setting, such as during social gatherings, are also presented. The model shows that the exposure time is a significant factor in spreading the disease. As crowd density increases, the higher the chance an infected person could infect other people. The attendees of the social gathering should have effective protection or preventive measures (e.g., administrative and engineering controls) to minimize further disease transmission.","output":"Insights from early mathematical models of 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease (COVID-19) dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study tested the Career Construction Model of Adaptation (CCMA) in a sample of Afghanistan?s working adults amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Whether patients with COVID-19 present specific manifestations of proximal tubule dysfunction remains unknown. To test this, we examined a cohort of 49 patients requiring hospitalization in a large academic hospital in Brussels, Belgium. There was evidence of proximal tubule dysfunction in a subset of patients with COVID-19, as attested by low-molecular-weight proteinuria (70-80%), neutral aminoaciduria (46%), and defective handling of uric acid (46%) or phosphate (19%). None of the patients had normoglycemic glucosuria. Proximal tubule dysfunction was independent of pre-existing comorbidities, glomerular proteinuria, nephrotoxic medications or viral load. At the structural level, kidneys from patients with COVID-19 showed prominent tubular injury, including in the initial part of the proximal tubule, with brush border loss, acute tubular necrosis, intraluminal debris, and a marked decrease in the expression of megalin in the brush border. Transmission electron microscopy identified particles resembling coronaviruses in vacuoles or cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum in proximal tubule cells.

Objective: We aimed to assess STD in health care professionals (HCPs), mainly allergists, affected by COVID-19. We carried out a survey to evaluate the association between STD and its severity and demographic characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, and hospital admission. METHODS We designed a 15-item questionnaire comprising various sections, as follows: demographics, diagnostic characteristics, STD patterns, medication use, and comorbidities. The questionnaire was developed using Google forms. It was distributed to members of the Spanish Society of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (SEAIC) and sent via social media to be completed by HCPs with COVID-19. RESULTS The survey was completed by HCPs (n=234), of whom 76.5% were aged 55 years and 73.5% were female. STD was detected in 74.4% of respondents, of whom 95.6% reported moderate-severe impairment. Mean time until recovery of taste dysfunction was 21.6 (24.0) days in HCPs aged 55 years and 33.6126.2 days in those aged >55 years (P=.019). Analysis stratified by severity of STD showed that more than a half of COVID-19 patients presented severe loss of smell. Older age (>55 years) was associated with fever, anorexia, lower frequency of headache, and longer persistence of taste dysfunction.

Many of these variants are suggested to be more transmissible as well as less responsive to neutralization by vaccine-induced antibodies. Viral whole-genome sequencing is the current standard for tracking these variants. However, whole-genome sequencing is costly and the technology and expertise are limited to larger reference laboratories.

Older adults (65+ years) were 1 of the highest user groups of in-person health care services prior to the pandemic. Social distancing guidelines and high rates of mortality from coronavirus infections among older adults made receiving in-person health care services challenging for older adults. The provision of virtual care technologies can help to ensure continuity of care and provide essential health care services during the pandemic to those at high risk of contracting the COVID-19 coronavirus, including older adults. It is also essential to understand and address potential socioeconomic, demographic, and health disparities in the demand for and use of virtual care technologies among older adults. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate socioeconomic disparities in the demand for and use of virtual visits during the COVID-19 pandemic among older adults in Canada. METHODS: A cross-sectional web survey was conducted with 12,052 Canadians over the age of 16 years, selected from Legers Lger Opinion panel from July 14 to August 6, 2021. Associations between socioeconomic factors and the demand for and use of virtual visits were tested using 2 tests and logistic regression models for telephone visits, video visits, and secure messaging. Weighting was applied using the 2016 census reference variables to render a representative sample of the Canadian population. RESULTS: A total of 2303 older adults were surveyed. Older adults expressed the highest demand for and use of telephone visits, following by video visits and secure messaging. eHealth literacy was positively associated with the use of all 3 virtual care modalities. Higher income was negatively associated with the use of video visits (odds ratio [OR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.428-0.974, P=.03). Having no private insurance coverage was negatively associated with use of secure messaging (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.539-0.983, P=.04), but living in a rural community (OR 0.172, 95% CI 1.12-2.645, P=.01) and being born outside of Canada (OR 0.150, 95% CI 1.041-2.173, P=.03) were positively associated with the use of secure messaging. Higher education (OR 0.078, 95% CI 0.633-0.97, P=.02) and being non-White (OR=0.054, 95% CI 0.312-0.92, P=.02) were negatively associated with the use of the telephone. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that compared to video visits and secure messaging, the demand for and use of telephone visits were more prevalent among older adults during the pandemic. The gaps between the demand for and use of video and secure messaging services remain substantial. Our results highlight socioeconomic disparities among older adults that could potentially explain this trend.

METHODS This retrospective study involved subjects from seven centers that were admitted and found to be positive for H1N1 or COVID-19 real-time polymerase chain reaction test. RESULTS A total of 143 patients with H1N1 and 309 patients with COVID-19 were involved in the study. H1N1 patients were younger than COVID-19 ones. While 58.7% of H1N1 patients were female, 57.9% of COVID-19 patients were male. Complaints of fever, cough, sputum, sore throat, myalgia, weakness, headache, and shortness of breath in H1N1 patients were statistically higher than in COVID-19 ones. The duration of symptoms until H1N1 patients were admitted to the hospital was shorter than that for COVID-19 patients. Leukopenia was more common in COVID-19 patients. C-reactive protein levels were higher in COVID-19 patients, while lactate dehydrogenase levels were higher in H1N1 ones. The mortality rate was also higher in H1N1 cases.

From 2012, ALSPAC has identified G1 participants who were pregnant (or their partner was) or had become parents, and enrolled them, their partners, and children in the ALSPAC-Generation 2 (ALSPAC-G2) study, providing a unique multi-generational cohort. At present, approximately 1,100 G2 children (excluding those in utero) from 810 G1 participants have been enrolled. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ALSPAC rapidly deployed two online questionnaires; one during the initial lockdown phase in 2020 (9 th April-15 th May), and another when national lockdown restrictions were eased (26 th May-5 th July). As part of this second questionnaire, G1 parents completed a questionnaire about each of their G2 children. This covered: parental reports of children's feelings and behaviour since lockdown, school attendance, contact patterns, and health. A total of 289 G1 participants completed this questionnaire on behalf of 411 G2 children.

This limitation is particularly concerning as preliminary data indicate that veterans may experience a higher rate of mortality compared to their civilian counterparts. One factor that may contribute to increased rates of death among veterans with COVID-19 is tobacco use. Indeed, findings from a recent meta-analysis highlight the association between lifetime smoking status and COVID-19 progression to more severe or critical conditions including death. Notably, prevalence rates of tobacco use are higher among veterans than civilians. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to examine demographic and medical variables that may contribute to likelihood of death among veterans testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we examined the unique influence of lifetime tobacco use on veteran mortality when added to the complete model. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted on 440 veterans (80.5% African American/Black) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (7.3% deceased) at a large, southeastern Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital between March 11, 2020 and April 23, 2020, with data analysis occurring from May 26, 2020 to June 5, 2020.

We hereby, report on the vulnerability of ozone due to COVID-19 lockdown whose levels flutter from surging to saturation in a highly polluted Indian capital, due to significant decline in anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors. Average observed levels stabilized at 30 ppb, 12 ppb, 740 ppb, and 900 ppb for ozone (O(3)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) respectively during lockdown period from 27(th) March to 10(th) April 2020. The NO(2), CO and VOC declined by 50 %, 37 %, 38 % respectively during the lockdown period of 2020 as compared to similar period in 2019. The anomalous response of ozone during the lockdown is explained by resolving the poorly known complex O(3)-NO(x)-VOCs mechanism with the help of data from air monitoring stations in Delhi, India.

In normal metal/ferromagnet bilayers, a concerted action of the interconversions, the spin Hall effect and its inverse effect of normal metals, results in spin Hall magnetoresistance, whose sign is always positive regardless of the sign of spin Hall conductivity of normal metals. Here we report that the spin Hall magnetoresistance of Ta/NiFe bilayers is negative, necessitating an additional interconversion process. Our theory shows that the interconversion owing to interfacial spin-orbit coupling at normal metal/ferromagnet interfaces can give rise to negative spin Hall magnetoresistance. Given that recent studies found the conversion from charge currents to spin currents at normal metal/ferromagnet interfaces, our work provides a missing proof of its reciprocal spin-current-to-charge-current conversion at same interface. Our result suggests that interfacial spin-orbit coupling effect can dominate over bulk effects, thereby demanding interface engineering for advanced spintronics devices.","output":"Negative spin Hall magnetoresistance of normal metal/ferromagnet bilayers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Quinones are reactive to proteins containing cysteine residues and the main protease in Covid-19 contains an active site that includes Cys145. Embelin, a quinone natural product, is known to have antiviral activity against influenza and hepatitis B. Preliminary studies by our group also indicate its ability to inhibit HSV-1 in cultured cells. METHODS: Docking and DFT methods applied to the protease target. RESULTS: a mechanism for this inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease is described, specifically due to formation of a covalent bond between S(Cys145) and an embelin C(carbonyl). This is assisted by two protein amino acids (1) N(imidazole-His41) which is able to capture H[S(Cys145)] and (2) HN(His163), which donates a proton to embelin O(carbonyl) forming an OH moiety that results in inhibition of the viral protease. A similar process is also seen with the anti-inflammatory drugs methyl prednisolone and dexamethasone, used for Covid-19 patients. Methyl prednisolone and dexamethasone are methide quinones, and possess only one carbonyl moiety, instead of two for embelin. Additional consideration was given to another natural product, emodin, recently patented against Covid-19, as well as some therapeutic quinones, vitamin K, suspected to be involved in Covid-19 action, and coenzyme Q10. All show structural similarities with embelin, dexamethasone and methyl prednisolone results.

METHODS: This was a single-center group comparative retrospective analysis of the electronic medical records of patients treated for COVID-19Crelated impairments from March 19, 2020, through August 14, 2020, and a reference population of medically complex patients discharged between December 1, 2019, and February 29, 2020. This study was conducted to evaluate patient outcomes in response to the holistic treatment approach of the facility. RESULTS: Of the 127 total COVID-19 admissions, 118 patients were discharged by the data cutoff. At admission, 29.9% (38/127) of patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mean age of the COVID-19 cohort was lower than that of the reference cohort (63.3, 95% CI 61.1-65.4 vs 65.5, 95% CI 63.2-67.8 years; P=.04). There were similar proportions of males and females between cohorts (P=.38); however, the proportion of non-White/non-Caucasian patients was higher in the COVID-19 cohort than in the reference cohort (odds ratio 2.79, 95% CI 1.5-5.2; P=.001). The mean length of stay in the COVID-19 cohort was similar to that in the reference cohort (25.5, 95% CI 23.2-27.9 vs 29.9, 95% CI 24.7-35.2 days; P=.84). Interestingly, a positive correlation between patient age and length of stay was observed in the COVID-19 cohort (r(2)=0.05; P=.02), but not in the reference cohort. Ambulation assistance scores improved in both the reference and COVID-19 cohorts from admission to discharge (P<.001). However, the mean assistance score was greater in the COVID-19 cohort than in the reference cohort at discharge (4.9, 95% CI 4.6-5.3 vs 4.1, 95% CI 3.7-4.7; P=.001). Similarly, the mean change in gait distance was greater in the COVID-19 cohort than in the reference cohort (221.1, 95% CI 163.2-279.2 vs 146.4, 95% CI 85.6-207.3 feet; P<.001).

METHODS: We included 273 adult patients with confirmed severe COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China from February 10 to March 8, 2020. Clinical characteristics and risk factors for outcomes were compared between the young and middle-aged and the elderly severe patients. RESULTS: Hemoglobin, neutrophil percentage, inflammatory markers, hepatic, renal, and cardiovascularparameters differed between the non-elderly and elderly severe patients. In young and middle-aged patients, critical patients showed higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) during hospitalization than severe patients. However, in the elderly patients, critical patients showed decreased hsCRP during hospitalization and higher proBNP values. The hsCRP fluctuation and proBNP were independent risk factors for intensive care unit (ICU) admission in young and middle-aged severe patients (OR=1.068) and elderly severe patients (OR=1.026), respectively. CONCLUSION: The study revealed different potential causes of disease and predictive factors for non-elderly and elderly critical patients and treatment recommendations. Deterioration of inflammatory state was the main cause of ICU admission in young and middle-aged severe COVID-19 patients, while a decline in hsCRP was not associated with better outcomes in elderly severe patients, indicating the need for different treatments for non-elderly and elderly severe patients. Anti-inflammatory therapy with corticosteroids should be considered in the early disease stage among non-elderly severe patients, but cardiovascular protection plays a more important role in elderly severe patients.","output":"Different characteristics of critical COVID-19 and thinking of treatment strategies in non-elderly and elderly severe adult patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The recent COVID-19 outbreak has forced notable adjustments to surgical procedure preparation, including neurosurgical services. However, due to the uniqueness of the recent situation, neurosurgical centers, especially those located in low-resource settings, are facing several challenges such as a lack of coordination, poor equipment, and shortage of medical personnel. Therefore, several guidelines from local authorities and international neurosurgical bodies have been published to help clinicians manage their patients. In addition, the academic health system (AHS), which is an integrated system containing a medical institution, universities, and a teaching hospital, may play some role in the management of patients during COVID-19. The objective of this study was to describe how each hospital in the authors' network adjusted their neurosurgical practice and how the AHS of the Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) played its role in the adaptation process during the pandemic. METHODS The authors gathered both local and national data about the number of COVID-19 infections from the government's database. To assess the contribution of the AHS to the efforts of each hospital to address the pandemic, questionnaires were given to 6 neurosurgeons, 1 resident, and 2 general surgeons about the management of neurosurgical cases during the pandemic in their hospitals. RESULTS The data illustrate various strategies to manage neurosurgical cases by hospitals within the authors' networks. The hospitals were grouped into three categories based on the transmission risk in each region. Most of these hospitals stated that UGM AHS had a positive impact on the changes in their strategies. In the early phase of the outbreak, some hospitals faced a lack of coordination between hospitals and related stakeholders, inadequate amount of personal protective equipment (PPE), and unclear regulations. As the nation enters a new phase, almost all hospitals had performed routine screening tests, had a sufficient amount of PPE for the medical personnel, and followed both national and international guidelines in caring for their neurosurgical patients. CONCLUSIONS The management of neurosurgical procedures during the outbreak has been a challenging task and a role of the AHS in improving patient care has been experienced by most hospitals in the authors' network. In the future, the authors expect to develop a better collaboration for the next possible pandemic.","output":"The adjustment of neurosurgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic: a case study at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital as a part of an academic health system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of druggable targets, and their biological functions depend on different ligands and intracellular interactomes. Some microRNAs (miRNAs) bind as ligands to RNA-sensitive toll-like receptor 7 to regulate the inflammatory response, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of cancer or neurodegeneration. It is unknown whether miRNAs bind to angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 receptor (AGTR2), a critical protective GPCR in cardiovascular diseases, as ligands or intracellular interactomes. Here, screening for miRNAs that bind to AGTR2, we identified and confirmed that the pre-miRNA hsa-let-7a-2 non-competitively binds to the intracellular third loop of AGTR2. Functionally, intracellular hsa-let-7a-2 overexpression suppressed the Ang II-induced AGTR2 effects such as cAMP lowering, RhoA inhibition, and activation of Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1, whereas hsa-let-7a-2 knockdown enhanced these effects. Consistently, overexpressed hsa-let-7a-2 restrained the AGTR2-induced antiproliferation, antimigration, and proapoptosis of cells, and vasodilation of mesenteric arteries. Our findings demonstrated that hsa-let-7a-2 is a novel intracellular partner of AGTR2 that negatively regulates AGTR2-activated signals.","output":"Pre-miRNA Hsa-Let-7a-2: a Novel Intracellular Partner of Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor Negatively Regulating its Signals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Pearl article recounts the story of a US corporation, Lennar, the nations leading homebuilder, an essential function in the US (not allowed to lock down), when faced with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at the end of February 2020.

Methods: A combined Markov decision tree model compared clinical and economic outcomes of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (BNT162b2) versus no vaccination in individuals aged []12 years. Age-stratified epidemiological, clinical, economic, and humanistic parameters were derived from existing data and published literature. Scenario analysis explored the impact of using lower and upper bounds of parameters on the results. The health benefits were estimated as the number of COVID-19 symptomatic cases, hospitalizations and deaths averted, and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) saved. The economic benefits were estimated as the amount of healthcare and societal cost savings associated with the vaccine-preventable health outcomes. Results: It was estimated that, in 2021, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (BNT162b2) contributed to averting almost 9 million symptomatic cases, close to 700,000 hospitalizations, and over 110,000 deaths, resulting in an estimated $30.4 billion direct healthcare cost savings, $43.7 billion indirect cost savings related to productivity loss, as well as discounted gains of 1.1 million QALYs. Scenario analyses showed that these results were robust; the use of alternative plausible ranges of parameters did not change the interpretation of the findings. Conclusions: The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (BNT162b2) contributed to generate substantial public health impact and vaccine-preventable cost savings in the first year of its rollout in the US. The vaccine was estimated to prevent millions of COVID-19 symptomatic cases and thousands of hospitalizations and deaths, and these averted outcomes translated into cost-savings in the billions of US dollars and thousands of QALYs saved.

We analyzed the role of testosterone in the immune response, and we hypothesized possible mechanisms to explain the high incidence of COVID-19 infection and a worse clinical course in elderly male patients. Testosterone may impair the immune response, and this effect could explain the greater susceptibility of men to infection. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a crucial role in the entry of the virus into the respiratory epithelial cells, leading to COVID-19 disease. It is crucial to emphasize that testosterone levels and chemical castration (e.g. by androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer) may have contrasting roles in the phases of COVID-19 infection. Whereas low testosterone levels may be protective against the initial susceptibility (due to a restoration of immunological functions and a block of TMPRSS2), low testosterone may stimulate a worse clinical course in the advanced COVID-19 infection as it could exacerbate or activate the cytokine storm.

We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income, and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic.

Its detection for further treatment poses a severe threat to researchers, scientists, health professionals, and administrators worldwide. One of the daunting tasks during the pandemic for doctors in radiology is the use of chest X-ray or CT images for COVID-19 diagnosis. Time is required to inspect each report manually. While a CT scan is the better standard, an X-ray is still useful because it is cheaper, faster, and more widely used. To diagnose COVID-19, this paper proposes to use a deep learning-based improved Snapshot Ensemble technique for efficient COVID-19 chest X-ray classification. In addition, the proposed method takes advantage of the transfer learning technique using the ResNet-50 model, which is a pre-trained model. The proposed model uses the publicly accessible COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset consisting of 2905 images, which include COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal chest X-ray images. For performance evaluation, the model applied the metrics such as AU-ROC, AU-PR, and Jaccard Index. Furthermore, it also obtained a multi-class micro-average of 97% specificity, 95% f(1)-score, and 95% classification accuracy.

In this study, 18 fecal specimens were collected from seriously ill calves on this farm during the diarrhea outbreak, and analysed for common enteropathogens by enzymatic immunoassay (EIA). In a post-outbreak investigation, 418 and 1372 specimens collected from animals of various age groups were further analysed for rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. by EIA and PCR, respectively, to assess their roles in the occurrence of diarrhea on the farm. Cryptosporidium spp. were genotyped using established techniques. Initial EIA tests showed that 15/18 seriously ill calves during the outbreak were positive for Cryptosporidium parvum, while 8/18 were positive for rotavirus. The overall infection rate of Cryptosporidium in pre-weaned calves on the farm was 22.7%, with odds of the Cryptosporidium infection during the outbreak 4.4C23.5 times higher than after the outbreak. Four Cryptosporidium spp. were identified after the outbreak including C. parvum (n = 79), Cryptosporidium ryanae (n = 48), Cryptosporidium bovis (n = 31), and Cryptosporidium andersoni (n = 3), with co-infections of multiple species being detected in 34 animals. Infection with C. parvum (73/79) was found in the majority of calves aged 3 weeks, consistent with the age of ill calves during the outbreak. All C. parvum isolates were identified as subtype IIdA19G1. In the post-outbreak investigation, C. parvum infection was associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves, C. ryanae infection was associated with moderate diarrhea in both pre- and post-weaned calves, while no association was identified between rotavirus infection and the occurrence of diarrhea. Results of logistic regression analysis further suggested that C. bovis infection might also be a risk factor for moderate diarrhea in calves. Thus, we believe this is the first report of a major outbreak of severe diarrhea caused by C. parvum IIdA19G1 in dairy calves. More attention should be directed toward preventing the dissemination of this virulent subtype in China.","output":"Outbreak of cryptosporidiosis due to Cryptosporidium parvum subtype IIdA19G1 in neonatal calves on a dairy farm in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Influenza is one of the most common causes of acute respiratory tract infections around the world. Influenza viruses can cause seasonal epidemics. There remains limited information on the impact of both seasonal influenza A and influenza B related hospitalisations from neurological complications in paediatric populations in Asia. Objectives: To examine both the clinical spectrum and healthcare burden of influenza-associated neurological complications (IANCs) within the paediatric population of Hong Kong. Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective study to identify all paediatric patients (<18 years) admitted to a public hospital in Hong Kong with a confirmed influenza A or B infection between 2014 and 2018 using the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System of the Hospital Authority. The clinical spectrum of the paediatric patients with IANCs was studied. The clinical burden of paediatric influenza patients with IANCs were compared to paediatric influenza patients without neurological complications. Results: A total of 28,016 children admitted to the paediatric wards diagnosed to have influenza A or B infection were identified, accounting for 5.7% (28,016/489,955) of total paediatric admissions. 67.3% had influenza A and 32.7% had influenza B, and 8.9% had IANCs. The mean annual incidence of IANCs in children was 57 per 100,000 population. The spectrum of IANCs in our paediatric patients included febrile seizures (80.6%), myositis (11.4%), seizures with fever (5.4%), influenza-associated encephalitis/encephalopathy (IAE) (2.6%) and rarely Guillain-Barr syndrome (0.04%). Most paediatric patients with IANCs (85.5%) presented at a young age of <6 years. Paediatric patients with IANCs had significant longer hospital stays (p < 0.001), higher percentages of mechanical ventilation use (p < 0.05) and PICU admissions (p < 0.001), and higher mortality rates (p < 0.001) compared to those without neurological complications. Amongst those with IANCs, IAE was the sole cause of all seven reported mortalities. Conclusions: Seasonal influenza A & B is a common cause of hospitalisation for paediatric patients in Hong Kong. We found neurological complications from influenza A and B caused a significantly higher clinical burden compared to those without neurological complications. Children in younger age groups (<6 years old) are at highest risk and thus increasing vaccination coverage to this age group is recommended.","output":"Clinical Spectrum and Burden of Influenza-Associated Neurological Complications in Hospitalised Paediatric Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Accurate seroprevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations could clarify the extent to which current testing strategies are identifying all active infection, and hence the true magnitude and spread of the infection. Our primary objective was to identify valid seroprevalence studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and compare their estimates with the reported, and imputed, COVID-19 case rates within the same population at the same time point. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe-PMC for published studies and pre-prints that reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and/or IgA antibodies for serosurveys of the general community from 1 Jan to 12 Aug 2020. RESULTS: Of the 2199 studies identified, 170 were assessed for full text and 17 studies representing 15 regions and 118,297 subjects were includable. The seroprevalence proportions in 8 studies ranged between 1%-10%, with 5 studies under 1%, and 4 over 10%-from the notably hard-hit regions of Gangelt, Germany; Northwest Iran; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Stockholm, Sweden. For seropositive cases who were not previously identified as COVID-19 cases, the majority had prior COVID-like symptoms. The estimated seroprevalences ranged from 0.56-717 times greater than the number of reported cumulative cases-half of the studies reported greater than 10 times more SARS-CoV-2 infections than the cumulative number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence is well below \\"herd immunity\\" in all countries studied. The estimated number of infections, however, were much greater than the number of reported cases and deaths in almost all locations. The majority of seropositive people reported prior COVID-like symptoms, suggesting that undertesting of symptomatic people may be causing a substantial under-ascertainment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Comparison of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections with cumulative and imputed COVID-19 cases: Systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of clinical closure and delayed orthodontic care delivery in terms of types of emergencies, pain intensity, and disability experienced by orthodontic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study using an electronic survey that was distributed to orthodontic patients who were not seen in clinic for 2 to 3 months due to clinic closure. The survey included demographics, types of orthodontic emergencies, Numerical Rating Scale, and Manchester Orofacial Pain Disability Scale. RESULTS: There were a total of 150 respondents with mean age of 20 years; 57.33% were female patients. The most common reported orthodontic emergencies were poking wire 30%, debonded brackets 27.3%, bad odor 24%, sharp ligature tie 20%, inflammation and bleeding 9.3%, ulcer 8.7%, and problematic palatal device 8%. Pain was significantly associated with poking wire (P < 0.001), sharp ligature tie (P < 0.01), ulcer (P < 0.05), and problematic palatal device (P < 0.01). Poking wire, sharp ligature tie, and problematic palatal device were found to be significant predictors of pain intensity. Median pain intensity was 3, similar to the median disability score. There was a significant association between pain intensity and disability score (P < 0.01). With each unit increase in pain intensity, the disability score increased by 1.18. CONCLUSIONS: Delay in receiving orthodontic care could result in an orthodontic emergency, yet pain and disability resulting from these events are minimal.

Vulnerability of a geographical region/country to COVID-19 has been a topic of interest, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like India to assess the multi-factorial impact of COVID-19 on the incidence, prevalence or mortality data. Datasets and Methods Based on publicly reported socio-economic, demographic, health-based and epidemiological data from national surveys in India, we compute contextual, COVID-19 Vulnerability Indices (cVIs) across multiple thematic resolutions for different geographical and spatial administrative regions. These multi-resolution cVIs were used in regression models to assess their impact on indicators of the spread of COVID-19 such as the average time-varying instantaneous reproduction number. Results Our observational study was focused on 30 districts of the eastern Indian state of Odisha. It is an agrarian state, prone to natural disasters and one of the largest contributors of an unprotected migrant workforce. Our analyses identified housing and hygiene conditions, availability of health care and COVID preparedness as important spatial indicators. Conclusion Odisha has demonstrated success in containing the COVID-19 infection to a reasonable level with proactive measures to contain the spread of the virus during the first wave. However, with the onset of the second wave of COVID, the virus has been making inroads into the hinterlands and peripheral districts of the state, burdening the already deficient public health system in these areas. The vulnerability index presented in this paper identified vulnerable districts in Odisha. While some of them may not have a large number of COVID-19 cases at a given point of time, they could experience repercussions of the pandemic. Improved understanding of the factors driving COVID-19 vulnerability will help policy makers prioritise resources and regions leading to more effective mitigation strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","output":"Role of Multi-resolution Vulnerability Indices in COVID-19 spread: A Case Study in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of water drive gas reservoirs (WDGRs) with fractures or strong heterogeneity is severely influenced by water invasion. Accurately simulating the rules of water invasion and drainage gas recovery countermeasures in fractured WDGRs, thereby revealing the mechanism of water invasion and an appropriate development strategy, is important for formulating water management measures and enhancing the recovery of gas reservoirs. In this work, physical simulation methods were proposed to gain a better understanding of water invasion and to optimize the water control of fractured WDGRs. Five groups of experiments were designed and conducted to probe the impacts of the distance between the fractures and the gas well, the drainage position, the drainage timing and the aquifer size on the water invasion and production performance of a gas reservoir. The gas and water production and the internal pressure drop were monitored in real time during the experiments. Based on the above experimental works, a theoretical analysis was conducted to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the gas reservoir recovery via the gas well production performance, water invasion, dynamic pressure drop and residual gas and water distribution analysis. The results show that when the fracture scale was appropriate, a gas well drilled close to a fracture (Experiment 1-3) or a high-permeability formation could also produce gas and achieve drainage efficiently. The recovery factor of Experiment 1-3 reached 62.5%, which was 24.6% and 21.1% higher than those of Experiments 1-1 and 1-2, respectively, which had wells drilled in low-permeability areas. Draining water near an aquifer can effectively inhibit water invasion during the early stage of gas recovery. The setup in Experiment 2-1 effectively inhibited water invasion and avoided the formation of water-sealed volumes of gas to recover 30% more gas than recovered with that of Experiment 1-1 without drainage wells. A shorter distance between the drainage well and the aquifer increased the drainage capacity and decreased the gas production capacity, respectively (Well 2 at Point A vs Point B). A larger aquifer had a lower gas recovery, which reduced the economic benefit. For example, due to an infinitely large aquifer, the reserves in Experiment 4-1 were developed by a single well, the gas recovery was only 33.4%. These research results are expected to be beneficial for the preparation of development plans and the optimization of water control measures for WDGRs.","output":"Physical simulation for water invasion and water control optimization in water drive gas reservoirs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Measure the effect of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators on gas exchange in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19.

Methods: 539 study subjects (449 patients and 90 controls) were included in the clinical trial. The patients had either primary (n=90), or secondary immunodeficiency disorders due to human immunodeficiency virus infection (n=90), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation/chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (n=90), solid organ transplantation (SOT) (n=89), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n=90).

Models using EHR data to predict OUD often rely on case/control classifications focused on extreme opioid use. There is a need to expand this work to characterize the spectrum of problematic opioid use. Methods: Using a large academic medical center database, we developed 2 data-driven methods of OUD detection: (1) a Comorbidity Score developed from a Phenome-Wide Association Study of phenotypes associated with OUD and (2) a Text-based Score using natural language processing to identify OUD-related concepts in clinical notes. We evaluated the performance of both scores against a manual review with correlation coefficients, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and area-under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Records with the highest Comorbidity and Text-based scores were re-evaluated by manual review to explore discrepancies. Results: Both the Comorbidity and Text-based OUD risk scores were significantly elevated in the patients judged as High Evidence for OUD in the manual review compared to those with No Evidence (p = 1.3E-5 and 1.3E-6, respectively). The risk scores were positively correlated with each other (rho = 0.52, p < 0.001). AUCs for the Comorbidity and Text-based scores were high (0.79 and 0.76, respectively).

Such research is important for designing interventions to increase compliance. Methods: We used cross-sectional data from 20,947 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study collected 17 November to 23 December 2020. Self-report compliance was assessed with six behaviours: mask wearing, hand washing, indoor household mixing, outdoor household mixing, social distancing, and compliance with other guidelines. Patterns of compliance behaviour were identified using latent class analysis, and multinomial logistic regression was used to assess demographic, socioeconomic and personality predictors of behaviour patterns. Results: We selected a four latent class solution. Most individuals reported similar levels of compliance across the six behaviour measures. High levels of compliance was the modal response. Lower self-reported compliance was related to young age, high risk-taking behaviour, low confidence in government, and low empathy, among other factors. Looking at individual behaviours, mask wearing had the highest level of compliance whilst compliance with social distancing was relatively low. Conclusion: Results suggest that individuals choose to comply with all guidelines, rather than some but not others.

We used anonymized smartphone mobility measures to quantify the mobility level needed to control SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., mobility threshold), and the difference relative to the observed mobility level (i.e., mobility gap). METHODS: We conducted a time-series study of the weekly incidence of SARSCoV-2 in Canada from Mar. 15, 2020, to Mar. 6, 2021. The outcome was weekly growth rate, defined as the ratio of cases in a given week versus the previous week. We evaluated the effects of average time spent outside the home in the previous 3 weeks using a log-normal regression model, accounting for province, week and mean temperature. We calculated the SARS-CoV-2 mobility threshold and gap. RESULTS: Across the 51-week study period, a total of 888 751 people were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Each 10% increase in the mobility gap was associated with a 25% increase in the SARS-COV-2 weekly case growth rate (ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.20-1.29). Compared to the prepandemic baseline mobility of 100%, the mobility threshold was highest in the summer (69%; interquartile range [IQR] 67%-70%), and dropped to 54% in winter 2021 (IQR 52%-55%); a mobility gap was present in Canada from July 2020 until the last week of December 2020.

A key variable in such models is the reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection. Here, we show that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate.

The repurposed FDA-approved antivirals were taken as standard molecules for this study. Long term (1.1 s) MD simulations were performed to analyze the conformational space of the binding pocket of Mpro bound to the selected molecules. RESULTS: The molecules DSPD-2 and DSPD-6 showed more favorable MM-PBSA interaction energies and were seated deep inside the binding pocket of Mpro than the topmost antiviral drug (Saquinavir). Moreover, DSPD-5 also exhibited comparable binding energy to Saquinavir. The analysis of per residue contribution energy and SASA studies indicated that the molecules showed efficient binding by targeting the S1 subsite of the Mpro binding pocket.

We investigated the consistency of the association between thalamus volume and cognition in MS for two common automated segmentation approaches, as well as fully manual outlining. METHODS Standardized neuropsychological assessment and 3-Tesla 3D-T1-weighted brain MRI were collected (multi-center) from 57 MS patients and 17 healthy controls. Thalamus segmentations were generated manually and using five automated methods. Agreement between the algorithms and manual outlines was assessed with Bland-Altman plots; linear regression assessed the presence of proportional bias. The effect of segmentation method on the separation of cognitively impaired (CI) and preserved (CP) patients was investigated through Generalized Estimating Equations; associations with cognitive measures were investigated using linear mixed models, for each method and vendor. RESULTS In smaller thalami, automated methods systematically overestimated volumes compared to manual segmentations [=(-0.42)-(-0.76); p-values < 0.001). All methods significantly distinguished CI from CP MS patients, except manual outlines of the left thalamus (p = 0.23). Poorer global neuropsychological test performance was significantly associated with smaller thalamus volumes bilaterally using all methods. Vendor significantly affected the findings. CONCLUSION Automated and manual thalamus segmentation consistently demonstrated an association between thalamus atrophy and cognitive impairment in MS. However, a proportional bias in smaller thalami and choice of MRI acquisition system might impact the effect size of these findings.","output":"Manual and automated tissue segmentation confirm the impact of thalamus atrophy on cognition in multiple sclerosis: A multicenter study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"African Americans are disproportionately affected by COVID-19-related disease and mortality due to long-standing social, political, economic, and environmental injustice; and COVID-19 inequities are exacerbated by institutional distrust.

In prostate cancer (PCa), however, there is still no consensus about the usefulness of miR-21 as an indicator of disease progression. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the value of miR-21 expression as a prognostic measurement in PCa patients. Medline (Ovid), EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for relevant publications between 2010 to 2021. Studies exploring the relationship between miR-21 expression, PCa prognosis and clinicopathological factors were selected for review. Those reporting hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were subject to meta-analyses. Fixed-effect models were employed to calculated pooled HRs and 95% CIs. Risk of bias in each study was assessed using QUIPS tool. Certainty of evidence in each meta-analysis was assessed using GRADE guidelines. A total of 64 studies were included in the systematic review. Of these, 11 were eligible for inclusion in meta-analysis. Meta-analyses revealed that high miR-21 expression was associated with poor prognosis: HR=1.58 (95% CI=1.19-2.09) for biochemical recurrence, MODERATE certainty; HR=1.46 (95% CI=1.06-2.01) for death, VERY LOW certainty; and HR=1.26 (95% CI=0.70-2.27) for disease progression, VERY LOW certainty. Qualitative summary revealed elevated miR-21 expression was significantly positively associated with PCa stage, Gleason score and risk groups. This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that elevated levels of miR-21 are associated with poor prognosis in PCa patients. miR-21 expression may therefore be a useful prognostic biomarker in this disease.","output":"Prognostic value of miR-21 for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Critically ill COVID-19 patients have relatively well-preserved lung mechanics despite severe gas exchange abnormalities, a feature not consistent with classical ARDS but more consistent with pulmonary vascular disease.

Materials and Methods: BIA were grouped according to the time it was performed. Two comparisons were done: an independent sample comparison (ISC) and a paired sample comparison (PSC) considering patients with at least one BIA in P1 and P2. Age, height, gender, weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat mass (BFM), free fat mass (FFM), skeletal muscle mass (SMM), percentage of body fat (PBF), visceral fat area (VFA) were compared. Statistical significance level was defined for a p value<0.05. Results and Discussion: A total of 3.358 BIA were performed, and 2.771 and 112 were selected for IS and PS, respectively. In ISC, despite an unchanged weight, BFM, FFM, PBF and VFA increased and SSM decreased on P2(p<0.015 for all).

We studied behavioral dynamics of mask use through the first two COVID waves in Panama, to improve implementation of effective, low-cost public health containment measures, when populations are exposed to novel air-borne pathogens. MethodsMask use behavior was recorded from pedestrians in four Panamanian populations (August to December 2020). We recorded facial coverings; and if used, the type of mask, and gender and estimated age of the wearer. FindingsPeople were highly compliant (> 95%) with mask mandates, and demonstrated important population-level behaviours: 1) decreasing use of cloth masks over time, and increasing use of surgical masks; 2) mask use was 3-fold lower in sub-urban neighborhoods than other public areas; and 3) young people were least likely to wear masks. InterpretationResults help focus highly-effective, low-cost, public health interventions for managing and controlling a pandemic. Considerations of behavioural preferences for different masks, relative to pricing and availability, are essential for optimizing public health policies. Policies to increase availability of effective masks, and behavioral nudges to increase acceptance, and to facilitate mask usage, during the on-going SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and for future pandemics of respiratory pathogens, are key tools, especially for nations lagging in access to expensive vaccines and pharmacological approaches.

As of July 2020, there were 8,475 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ethiopia, and a total of 52 cases and 1 death were reported in Debre Berhan where this study was conducted. Under these conditions, we sought to assess what undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University knew about COVID-19 and how it shaped their attitudes and practices regarding this disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to assess undergraduate student knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 in Debre Berhan University, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March 18-24, 2020 among undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University. A two-stage cluster sampling technique was employed with a total sample size of 634. Proportional allocation of samples was used to the randomly selected colleges, and a systematic random sampling technique was employed to recruit the students. The data were checked for completeness, coded, entered into Epi-Data VS 3.1, and then exported into STATA&#8482; Version 14 software for analysis. Descriptive statistics were conducted. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors. Factors were selected with the entry method. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the associations between variables and knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP). RESULTS: From a total of 546 included participants, more than half of them, 307 (57%) were males. Seventy-three percent of them heard about novel coronavirus from social media. In this study, 73.8% of the participants were knowledgeable, and their overall attitude was favorable. Approximately 71.4% correctly responded that the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Nearly half, 229 (42%) of the students approved that they had no concern of being infected with COVID-19. Moreover, most participants showed poor practices; more than half of the study subjects were not maintaining a physical distance. In multivariable analyses, people older than 25 years (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI; 1.2, 4.6) and those who lived in urban areas (AOR = 4.3, 95% CI; 2.6, 15.8) were significantly more knowledgeable about COVID-19. Furthermore, those students that have information about COVID-19 (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI; 1.6, 8.7) was significantly associated with the attitude undergraduate students had about COVID-19 as compared with its counterpart. CONCLUSION: The undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University were moderately knowledgeable about COVID-19 and had an optimistic attitude towards its resolution. However, this optimism may lead to poor public health practices within this community. Therefore, greater efforts need to be made through more comprehensive and directed actions and awareness campaigns to increase the knowledge, attitude and practice of the students.","output":"Assessment of undergraduate student knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19 in Debre Berhan University, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Genetic variant classification is a challenge in rare adult-onset disorders as in SCA-PRKCG (prior spinocerebellar ataxia type 14) with mostly private conventional mutations and nonspecific phenotype. We here propose a refined approach for clinicogenetic diagnosis by including protein modeling and provide for confirmed SCA-PRKCG a comprehensive phenotype description from a German multi-center cohort, including standardized 3D MR imaging. METHODS This cross-sectional study prospectively obtained neurological, neuropsychological, and brain imaging data in 33 PRKCG variant carriers. Protein modeling was added as a classification criterion in variants of uncertain significance (VUS). RESULTS Our sample included 25 cases confirmed as SCA-PRKCG (14 variants, thereof seven novel variants) and eight carriers of variants assigned as VUS (four variants) or benign/likely benign (two variants). Phenotype in SCA-PRKCG included slowly progressive ataxia (onset at 4-50 years), preceded in some by early-onset nonprogressive symptoms. Ataxia was often combined with action myoclonus, dystonia, or mild cognitive-affective disturbance. Inspection of brain MRI revealed nonprogressive cerebellar atrophy. As a novel finding, a previously not described T2 hyperintense dentate nucleus was seen in all SCA-PRKCG cases but in none of the controls. INTERPRETATION In this largest cohort to date, SCA-PRKCG was characterized as a slowly progressive cerebellar syndrome with some clinical and imaging features suggestive of a developmental disorder. The observed non-ataxia movement disorders and cognitive-affective disturbance may well be attributed to cerebellar pathology. Protein modeling emerged as a valuable diagnostic tool for variant classification and the newly described T2 hyperintense dentate sign could serve as a supportive diagnostic marker of SCA-PRKCG.","output":"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14: refining clinicogenetic diagnosis in a rare adult-onset disorder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health systems are attempting to capture social determinants of health (SDoH) in electronic health records (EHR) and use these data to adjust care plans. To date, however, methods for identifying social needs, which are the SDoH prioritized by patients, have been underexplored, and there is little guidance as to how clinicians should act on SDoH data when caring for patients. Moreover, the unintended consequences of collecting and responding to SDoH are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to use two data sources, EHR data and patient interviews, to describe divergences between the EHR and patient experiences that could help identify gaps in the documentation of SDoH in the EHR; highlight potential missed opportunities for addressing social needs, and identify unintended consequences of efforts to integrate SDoH into clinical care. METHODS: We are conducting a qualitative study that merges discrete and free-text data from EHRs with in-depth interviews with women residing in rural, socioeconomically deprived communities in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Participants had to confirm that they had at least one visit with the large health system that serves the region. Interviews with the women included questions regarding health, interaction with the health system, and social needs. Next, with consent, we extracted discrete data (eg, diagnoses and medication orders) for each participant and free-text clinician notes from this health systems EHRs between 1996 and the year of the interview. We used a standardized protocol to create an EHR narrative, a free-text summary of the EHR data. We used NVivo to identify themes in the interviews and the EHR narratives. RESULTS: To date, we have interviewed 88 women, including 51 White women, 19 Black women, 14 Latina women, 2 mixed Black and Latina women, and 2 Asian Pacific women. We have completed the EHR narratives on 66 women. The women range in age from 18 to 90 years. We found corresponding EHR data on all but 4 of the interview participants. Participants had contact with a wide range of clinical departments (eg, psychiatry, neurology, and infectious disease) and received care in various clinical settings (eg, primary care clinics, emergency departments, and inpatient hospitalizations). A preliminary review of the EHR narratives revealed that the clinician notes were a source of data on a range of SDoH but did not always reflect the social needs that participants described in the interviews. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide unique insight into the demands and consequences of integrating SDoH into clinical care.

Instead, it exploits common features of languages, such as part-of-speech tags used in Universal Dependencies. Equally important, SentiCode enables sentiment analysis in multi-language and multi-domain environments simultaneously. Several experiments were conducted using machine/deep learning techniques to evaluate the performance of SentiCode in multilingual (English, French, German, Arabic, and Russian) and multi-domain environments. In addition, the vocabulary proposed by SentiCode and the effect of each token were evaluated by the ablation method.

Acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine was inferred if participants indicated that they \\"definitely or probably will accept vaccination against COVID-19 once a vaccine is available.\\" Associations were explored by applying a modified Poisson regression to estimate and infer adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: In total, 53.1% (1257/2368) of the participants were willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine once available. Male subjects were more willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine than females (58.3% vs. 50.9%, P < 0.001). Subjects who viewed vaccines in general to have health-related risks were less willing to accept vaccination (aPR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.35-0.44). Moreover, participants who previously received an influenza vaccine were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine (aPR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.31-1.58).

First, we evaluated the neutralizing antibody response, measured by plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT(80)), and clinical response of the two viruses in groups of four ewes each. The virus dose was 110(5)plaque forming units (PFU). Control groups of four ewes each were also inoculated with a similar dose of RVF MP-12 or the parent recombinant virus (arMP-12). Neutralizing antibody was first detected in 3 of 4 animals inoculated with arMP-12NSm21/384 on Day 5 post inoculation and all four animals had PRNT(80) titers of 1:20 on Day 6. Neutralizing antibody was first detected in 2 of 4 ewes inoculated with arMP-12NSs16/198 on Day 7 and all had PRNT(80) titers of 1:20 on Day 10. We found the mean PRNT(80) response to arMP-12NSs16/198 to be 16- to 25-fold lower than that of ewes inoculated with arMP-12NSm21/384, arMP-12 or RVF MP-12. No abortions occurred though a single fetal death in each of the arMP-12 and RVF MP-12 groups was found at necropsy. The poor PRNT(80) response to arMP-12NSs16/198 caused us to discontinue further testing of this candidate and focus on arMP-12NSm21/384. A dose escalation study of arMP-12NSm21/384 showed that 110(3)plaque forming units (PFU) stimulate a PRNT(80) response comparable to doses of up to 110(5)PFU of this virus. With further study, the arMP-12NSm21/384 virus may prove to be a safe and efficacious candidate for a livestock vaccine.

Among the types of sports facilities frequently used within the residential area, the most common facilities were private sports facilities (22.97%), other sports facilities (20.60%), and public sports facilities (18.97%), although the utilization rate for other sports facilities increased after the COVID-19 outbreak. After the COVID-19 outbreak, 34.12% of men and 29.72% of women responded that there had been a change in their participation in regular sports activities. Both before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, walking was the most common activity, although the participation rate increased from 29.23% in 2019 to 35.70% in 2020. The rankings and participation rates for indoor sports activities (bodybuilding, swimming, etc.) tended to decrease, while those for outdoor sports activities (climbing, cycling, etc.) tended to increase. These changes may be explained in part by the increasing concern regarding infection with increasing age, except among teenagers, and by economic factors. While participation in physical activity provides numerous health benefits, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on regular participation in sports activities. The results of this survey suggest that government action is required to enhance participation in sports activities, even in the face of a pandemic.","output":"Participation in Sports Activities before and after the Outbreak of COVID-19: Analysis of Data from the 2020 Korea National Sports Participation Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has affected 212 countries around the world, killing nearly 300,000 and infecting more than 4.4 million by May 14, 2020.

This multicenter study was conducted to determine the prevalence of OAB symptoms and their impact on the HRQoL of medical and dentistry students. METHODS: This study was conducted in a cross-sectional design in the 3 main universities in Palestine. In addition to the sociodemographic, health, and academic characteristics of the medical and dentistry students, the questionnaire also contained the OAB symptom bother (6-items) and HRQoL (13-items) Short-Form (OAB-q SF) scales. KruskalCWallis test, MannCWhitney U test, Pearson Chi-Square/Fisher's Exact Test, Spearmans rank correlations, and a multiple linear regression model were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Responses were collected from medical and dentistry students (n = 402). The median OAB symptom bother score was 54.1 [44.8, 81.9] and the median HRQoL score was 94.4 [88.4, 94.4]. There was a strong negative correlation between the OAB and HRQoL scores (Spearmans rho = 64.4%, p value < 0.001). OAB scores were significantly higher among dentistry students, females, who had chronic disease, and those who reported stressful life. HRQoL scores were significantly higher among medicine students, those who reported less stressful life, and those who reported satisfaction with their social life. Dentistry students, female, and those who self-reported high stress were 1.94-fold (95% CI 1.05, 3.56), 1.91-fold (95% CI 1.16, 3.14), and 1.88-fold (95% CI 1.21, 2.91) more likely to report less than optimal HRQoL compared to medicine students, male, and those who self-reported low stress, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that OAB symptoms were prevalent among medical and dentistry students across Palestinian universities. Decision makers in academia, healthcare authorities, and advocacy groups might need to design appropriate interventions to address health and wellbeing issues of medical and dentistry students. Using appropriate diagnostic procedures, reducing stress, and improving the social life might help in reducing the burden on OAB and improve the HRQoL of medical and dentistry students. More investigations should be conducted to investigate if such interventions are effective in reducing OAB symptoms and improving HRQoL.

Moreover, instructors can use the platform to revise or assess answer sheets with instructorshandwriting through web interfaces or apps. Important features of the integrated platform for teachers are (1) grading answer sheets by handwriting, (2) correcting mistakes in the answer sheets by handwriting, (3) writing down instructorscomments on studentsanswer sheets directly, and (4) choosing examples to demonstrate during class presentation, in a single window through web applications. To evaluate MSFT performance and service level for students, a questionnaire survey was conducted for 51 students and separated into an experimental group and a control group.

This exploratory study analyzes the experiences of the stigma associated with COVID-19 lockdown in people with different previous diagnoses 2 and 5 weeks after the beginning of the state of emergency in Spain. Gender and age were controlled as covariables and 1,052 people participated in the study. The diagnosis groups were: Psychiatry and mental health (n = 71), Cardiovascular disease (n = 42), Neurological disease (n = 23), Lung disease (n = 53), and No diagnosis (n = 863). The instruments used to measure the stigma were the Intersectional Day-to-Day Discrimination Index and two items of the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale. Analysis of covariance of repeated measures and analysis of variance, including Scheffe's post hoc test, were performed. We found significant differences in stigma among the first and second evaluation. Regarding the previous diagnosis, no differences were found at Time 1, but significant differences were found at Time 2, with those having a previous psychiatric or mental health diagnosis reporting higher levels of perceived discrimination and internalized stigmatization. Our results suggest that people with previous stigmatizing conditions might be more vulnerable to experiencing stigma in a confinement situation. In order to reduce the burden of the COVID-19 stigma, health interventions should also consider the resulting intersection of effects on internalized stigma and perceived discrimination.

For the kinetics evaluation, cut-off-indices from serial NP specimens were used according to the number of days PSO. Both RATs showed sensitivity of 91.3?100% for specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) < 25. The specificity of AFIAS was 98.7?98.9% and that of ichroma(TM) was 100.0%. The kappa values of AFIAS and ichroma(TM) for the molecular testing of specimens with Ct < 25 (RdRP) were 0.97 and 1.00, respectively. The sensitivity of AFIAS and ichroma(TM) for all genes was lower for specimens collected at 8?14 PSO than for those collected before 7-days PSO.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a negative regulator of angiotensin II in the reninCangiotensin system, has been reported to have a crucial role in ALI. Downregulation of ACE2 is always associated with the ALI or ARDS induced by avian influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and sepsis. However, the molecular mechanism of the decreased expression of ACE2 in ALI is unclear. Here we show that avian influenza virus H5N1 induced the upregulation of miR-200c-3p, which was then demonstrated to target the 3-untranslated region of ACE2. Then, we found that nonstructural protein 1 and viral RNA of H5N1 contributed to the induction of miR-200c-3p during viral infection. Additionally, the synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA (poly (I:C)), bacterial lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid can all markedly increase the expression of miR-200c-3p in a nuclear factor-B-dependent manner. Furthermore, markedly elevated plasma levels of miR-200c-3p were observed in severe pneumonia patients. The inhibition of miR-200c-3p ameliorated the ALI induced by H5N1 virus infection in vivo, indicating a potential therapeutic target. Therefore, we identify a shared mechanism of viral and bacterial lung infection-induced ALI/ARDS via nuclear factor-B-dependent upregulation of miR-200c-3p to reduce ACE2 levels, which leads increased angiotensin II levels and subsequently causes lung injury.","output":"miRNA-200c-3p is crucial in acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent estimates by World Health Organization (WHO, Geneva, Switzerland) and United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) show a significant decline in vaccinal coverage rates in both pediatric and adult populations.

The vertices of the trees are 50 states, DC and NYC in the USA. The weights of the edges are assigned by the reciprocal of the sum of cases or deaths of COVID-19.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many clinical sites are experimenting with new models of care delivery including virtual GMVs using telehealth. Little research has focused on which clinicians offer this type of care, how the GMV approach affects the ways they practice, and their job satisfaction.

AIM Combining dual-energy X-ray and bone turnover markers (BTM) to explore the VitD level in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients in Harbin and monitor its effect on the anti-osteoporosis effect of ZOL. METHODS A total of 120 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) were enrolled .These patients were divided into two groups with 25(OH)D levels = 10ng/ml as a critical point, and each group was randomly divided into experimental groups and control groups). All of the patients were conducted 5 mg ZOL. Then the experimental group was given calcitriol and calcium carbonate, and the control group was only given calcium carbonate. BTM were measured at baseline, 24h, 3 months and 6 months. We also measured bone mineral density (BMD) of bilateral hips (TH BMD) and lumbar spine (LS BMD) at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS The VitD deficiency rates of the patients enrolled were 84.1%. There was an inverse relationship between the baseline level of VitD and the serum levels of P1NP / -CTX, (r=-0.452,p=0.00; r=-0.225, p=0.01). Comparing with baseline, the level of serum P1NP,-CTX in each group declined significantly after the treatment (P<0.05). The mean decreasing rates of P1NP and -CTX in the both experimental groups were significantly higher than that of the corresponding control groups at the same time point (P<0.05), after 6 months of medication.

Patients were recruited from the World Trade Center Health Program. Non-WTC PC samples were frequency matched on age, race/ethnicity and Gleason score. Bisulfite-treated DNA was extracted from tumor tissue blocks and used to assess global DNA methylation with the MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Differential and pathway enrichment analysis were conducted. RNA from the same tumor blocks was used for gene expression analysis to further support DNA methylation findings. Methylation data were generated for 28 samples (13 WTC and 15 non-WTC). Statistically significant differences in methylation were observed for 3,586 genes; on average WTC samples were statistically significantly more hypermethylated (p=0.04131). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed hypermethylation in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, mitotic spindle, TNFA signaling via NFKB, WNT signaling, and TGF beta signaling pathways in WTC compared to non-WTC samples. The androgen response, G2M and MYC target pathways were hypomethylated. These results correlated well with RNA gene expression.

METHODS: Sixteen patients with COVID-19 ARDS received a complete coagulation profile at the admission in the intensive care unit. Ten patients were followed in the subsequent 7 days, after increasing the dose of low molecular weight heparin, antithrombin levels correction, and clopidogrel in selected cases. RESULTS: At baseline, the patients showed a pro-coagulant profile characterized by an increased clot strength (CS, median 55 hPa, 95% interquartile range 35-63), platelet contribution to CS (PCS, 43 hPa; interquartile range 24-45), fibrinogen contribution to CS (FCS, 12 hPa; interquartile range 6-13.5) elevated D-dimer levels (5.5 g/mL, interquartile range 2.5-6.5), and hyperfibrinogenemia (794 mg/dL, interquartile range 583-933).

However, little is known about the economic burden of lung cancer in China. METHODS: A prevalence-based approach was adopted to estimate the economic burden of lung cancer, including direct expenditure (medical and non-medical) and indirect cost (disability and premature death). Data on direct expenditure and work-loss days per patient in each year post-diagnosis were obtained from two primary surveys. Other parameters were obtained from literatures and official reports. Projections were conducted based on varying parameters. All expenditure data were reported in United States dollars (USD) using 2017 value (exchange rate: 1 USD= 6.760 CNY), with the discount rate of 3%. RESULTS: The total economic burden of lung cancer was estimated to be 25,069 million USD in China in 2017 (0.121% of gross domestic productivity, GDP). The estimated direct expenditure was 11,098 million USD, up to 1.43% of total healthcare expenditure for China, covering 10,303 million USD and 795 million USD for medical and non-medical expenditure, respectively. The estimated indirect cost was 13,971 million, including 1,517 million USD due to disability and 12,454 million USD due to premature death. Under current assumptions, the projected total economic burden would increase to 30.1 billion USD, 40.4 billion USD, and 53.4 billion USD in 2020, 2025, and 2030, accounting for 0.121%, 0.131%, and 0.146% of Chinas GDP, respectively. However, if China meets the United Nation sustainable development goal of reducing premature death from non-communicable diseases by one-third by 2030, the total economic burden in 2030 would be 31.9 billion USD, 0.087% of Chinas GDP. CONCLUSIONS: The economic burden of lung cancer in China in 2017 is substantial and more likely to increase significantly in the future. Policy makers need to take urgent actions in budget making for health systems. The economic burden could be alleviated by reducing the disease burden of lung cancer via effective control and prevention actions.","output":"Population-level economic burden of lung cancer in China: Provisional prevalence-based estimations, 2017?2030"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Quercetin is one of the main dietary flavonoids and undergoes a substantial intestinal phase-II metabolism.

KEY FINDINGS Phase-II metabolites of quercetin were detected and quantified in aspirated intestinal fluids. Metabolites appeared almost immediately after administration, indicating an intestinal metabolism and apical excretion into the lumen. Quercetin-3'-O-glucuronide was found to be the main intestinal metabolite. Our results could not conclude on the enterohepatic recycling of quercetin or its metabolites, although several individual profiles showed distinctive peaks. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the intestinal metabolism and excretion of quercetin and its conjugates in humans and gives insights into the relevant concentrations which should be used to investigate potential food-drug interactions in vitro.","output":"Intestinal disposition of quercetin and its phase-II metabolites after oral administration in healthy volunteers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A hypothesis is proposed that the cytokine storm syndrome, which complicates COVID-19 in some patients, is a consequence of antibody-dependent enhancement of virus infection, which is in turn happens due to a change in dominant antigenic determinants of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein The antibody-dependent enhancement of virus infection is a phenomenon in which virus-specific antibodies that are not neutralizing enhance the entry of infectious virus into immune cells causing their death Antibody-dependent enhancement has been reported for different coronaviruses This phenomenon happens due to a decrease in the binding strength of neutralizing antibodies to the virus, which converts these antibodies into suboptimal-not neutralizing ones According to our hypothesis, such a decrease in affinity may be associated with a change in the conformation of the viral S-protein We believe that this conformational change is the major factor in the switching of antibodies affinity, which triggers antibody-dependent enhancement However, other factors that contribute to antigen drift and antigenic determinant changes may also play a role","output":"Change of Antigenic Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 Virus S-Protein as a Possible Cause of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Virus Infection and Cytokine Storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus pandemic is a turning point for the payment industry, as those businesses have invested heavily in digital and mobile prosperity. During the coronavirus pandemic, digital payments kept economies going and helped to minimize peoples exposure to the virus. E-wallet is an electronic device or online service that enables electronic transactions to be made by a person. The applicant can store funds and that money will be used to make payments to pay taxes, to buy food, to book a ticket, and some others. It is still new to the Malaysian especially at rural areas for instance in Kemaman, Terengganu. Consumers in rural areas are still using cash payment rather than e-wallet due to the lack of awareness and knowledge of the system. This study found the factor affecting the intention to use the e-wallet based on the theory of acceptance and use of technology which are social influence, perceived security, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness. Methodology: This study used a qualitative and quantitative method such as interview and observation (qualitative) to verify of questionnaires (quantitative). The respondents were from 18 to 46 years and above who use debit card or cashless payment to make transaction. Then for analysing data we used SPSS20. Findings: The study found that 89% of respondents know and use e-wallets for shopping, prepaid/postpaid payments, and other utilities. The result showed that the factor of perceived ease of use of e-wallet is high compared to others. This means that the Malaysia rural community also knows that e-wallet application eases their way of doing some purchasing online because they were able to buy anytime without worry anymore about Coronavirus infection. However, e-wallet is still challenging for elderly to understand the process from the beginning of the download of the application, setting it in the smart-phone, choosing the product or shop, and controlling their cash flow. Application: Today, people need a fast, simple, and secure way to get everythings done right. Therefore, the easiest and most secure way to buy and pay is through e-wallet. Instead of knowing, people at the rural area are interested in using e-wallet as the improvement bring enjoyable and comfortable instruction provided. Thus, shoppers also need to prepare all types of payment transactions if there are people who choose to pay with e-wallet instead of cash or card. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"E-Wallet Awareness: The Expansion of Knowledge in Rural Area in Terengganu Malaysia Due to Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has high morbidity and mortality, and spreads rapidly in the community to result in a large number of infection cases. This study aimed to compare clinical features in adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia to those in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: Clinical presentations, laboratory findings, imaging features, complications, treatment and outcomes were compared between patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and patients with CAP. The study group of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia consisted of 120 patients. One hundred and thirty-four patients with CAP were enrolled for comparison. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had lower levels of abnormal laboratory parameters (white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level) and more extensive radiographic involvement. More severe respiratory compromise resulted in a higher rate of intensive care unit admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mechanical ventilation (36% vs 15%, 34% vs 15% and 32% vs 12%, respectively; all p < .05). The 30 day mortality was more than twice as high in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (12% versus 5%; p = .063), despite not reaching a statistically significant difference.

To date, 3 bocaviruses, canine bocaviruses 1 to 3 (CBoV-1-3), have been shown to affect dogs with different disease manifestations reported for infected animals. We used next-generation sequencing to identify a novel strain of canine CBoV-2 (CBoV TH-2016) in a litter of puppies that died in Thailand from acute dyspnea and hemoptysis, for which no causal pathogen could be identified in routine assays. Analysis of the complete coding sequences of CBoV TH-2016 showed that this virus was most closely related to a strain previously identified in South Korea (isolate 14D193), with evidence of genetic recombination in the VP2 gene with related strains from South Korea and Hong Kong. Use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed the presence of CBoV TH-2016 in several tissues, suggesting hematogenous virus spread, while only intestinal tissue was found to be positive by in situ hybridization and electron microscopy. Histologic small intestinal lesions associated with CBoV TH-2016 infection were eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies within villous enterocytes without villous atrophy or fusion, similar to those previously considered pathognomonic for CBoV-1 infection. Therefore, this study provides novel insights in the pathogenicity of canine bocavirus infections and suggests that a novel recombinant CBoV-2 may result in atypical findings of CBoV infection.

Although off-label prescribing (ie, for a nonapproved indication) is legal in most countries, it tends to shift the burden of liability and cost to physicians and patients, respectively. Nevertheless, in urgent public health crises, it is often the only realistic source of a meaningful potential solution. To be considered for real-world repurposing, drug candidates should ideally have a track record of safety, affordability, and wide accessibility. Although thousands of such drugs are already available, the absence of a central repository of off-label uses presents a barrier to the immediate identification and selection of the safest, potentially useful interventions. Using the current COVID-19 pandemic as an example, we provide a glimpse at the extensive literature that supports the rationale behind six generic drugs, in four classes, all of which are affordable, supported by decades of safety data, and pleiotropically target the underlying pathophysiology that makes COVID-19 so dangerous.

Our results show that many nucleotide analogs can be incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and that the incorporation of some of them leads to chain termination. The discrimination values of nucleotide analog over those of natural nucleotide were measured to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. In agreement with the data published in literature, we found that the incorporation efficiency of remdesivir-TP is higher than ATP, and incorporation of remdesivir-TP caused delayed chain termination which can be overcome by higher concentrations of the following nucleotide to be incorporated. Our data also showed that the delay chain termination pattern caused by remdesivir-TP incorporation is different for different template sequence. Multiple incorporations of remdesivir-TP caused chain termination in our assay condition. Incorporation of sofosbuvir-TP is very low suggesting that sofosbuvir may not be very effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a comparison, 2'-C-methyl-GTP can be incorporated into RNA efficiently, and the derivative of 2'-C-methyl-GTP may have therapeutic application in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This requirement has impeded use of telemedicine to expand OUD treatment, and many policymakers have called for its removal. During the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning March 16, 2020, the requirement was temporarily waived. It is unclear whether clinicians who treat OUD patients perceive telemedicine to be a safe and effective means of OUD medication initiation. OBJECTIVE: To understand clinician use of and comfort level with using telemedicine to initiate patients on medication for opioid use disorder. DESIGN: National survey administered electronically via WebMD/Medscapes online clinician panel in fall 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 602 clinicians (primary care providers, psychiatrists, nurse practitioners or certified nurse specialists, and physician assistants) participated in the survey. MAIN MEASURES: Frequency of video, audio-only, and in-person visits for medication initiation, comfort level with using video for new patient visits with OUD. KEY RESULTS: Clinicians varied substantially in their use of telemedicine for medication initiation. Approximately 25% used telemedicine for most initiations while 40% used only in-person visits. The majority (55.8%) expressed at least some discomfort with using telemedicine for treating new OUD patients, although clinicians with more OUD patients were less likely to express such discomfort. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that a permanent relaxation of the Ryan Haight requirement may not result in widespread adoption of telemedicine for OUD medication initiation without additional supports or incentives.

This paper examines the cumulative and independent effects of COVID- and non-COVID-related discrimination, exposure to violence, traditional and cyberbullying victimization on support for VR. In addition, we investigate whether depression mediates the relationship between these forms of social adversity and support for VR. METHODS: A total of 6003 young adults (M(age) = 27, SD(age) = 4.40, range 18C35) living in metropolitan areas in Canada responded to an online survey. We used multivariable regression models, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, to infer covariate adjusted associations between social adversity measures and support for VR. Additionally, we conducted a formal mediation analysis to estimate the proportion mediated by depression. RESULTS: There was a cumulative relationship between experiences of social adversity and support for VR ( = 1.52; 95% CI: 1.32, 1.72).

METHODS: An European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) task force formulated four research questions to be addressed by systematic literature review (SLR). The SLR results informed consensus statements. One overarching principle, 10 points to consider (PTC) and a research agenda were proposed. Task force members rated their level of agreement (1C10) for each PTC. RESULTS: Epidemiological and demographic characteristics should be measured in all clinical trials and studies in at-risk individuals. Different at-risk populations, identified according to clinical presentation, were defined: asymptomatic, musculoskeletal symptoms without arthritis and early clinical arthritis. Study end-points should include the development of subclinical inflammation on imaging, clinical arthritis, RA and subsequent achievement of arthritis remission. Risk factors should be assessed at baseline and re-evaluated where appropriate; they include genetic markers and autoantibody profiling and additionally clinical symptoms and subclinical inflammation on imaging in those with symptoms and/or clinical arthritis. Trials should address the effect of the intervention on risk factors, as well as progression to clinical arthritis or RA. In patients with early clinical arthritis, pharmacological intervention has the potential to prevent RA development. Participants knowledge of their RA risk may inform their decision to participate; information should be provided using an individually tailored approach.

Evidence from prior epidemics suggests increased alcohol consumption during quarantine and times of high stress are associated with a greater chance of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD). This study examines alcohol sales data to ascertain how individuals are interacting with alcohol during the pandemic.Materials and method: Monthly off premises alcohol sales data for select US alcoholic beverage control states were used to construct monthly sales patterns from 2015 to 2020. An independent samples t-test was used to determine if COVID-19 era alcohol sales were higher than those that occurred from 2015 to 2019.Results: Alcohol sales from March to August 2020 were significantly higher than sales from the same span of months from 2015 to 2019 (t=-2.47, p<.05). The associated monthly percentage increase in sales ranged from 14 to 44% with the overall trend indicating a move toward pre-pandemic sales totals.Conclusion: As COVID-19 continues to disrupt typical ways of being across the globe, the implications of increased sales of alcohol should not be overlooked. Taken together, the evidence on increased use during isolation and later AUD diagnosis coupled with the ABC state sales figures here, point to a potential increase in the development of AUD and an increase in alcohol-related harms.","output":"Alcohol sales during COVID-19 social restrictions: Initial evidence from Alcoholic Beverage Control states"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Despite thousands of influenza cases annually recorded by surveillance systems around the globe, estimating the transmission patterns of seasonal influenza is challenging. Methods We develop an age-structured mathematical model to influenza transmission to analyze ten consecutive seasons (from 2010-2011 to 2019-2020) of influenza epidemiological and virological data reported to the Italian surveillance system. Results We estimate that 18.4%-29.3% of influenza infections are detected by the surveillance system. Influenza infection attack rate varied between 18.0% and 35.6% and is generally larger for seasons characterized by the circulation of A/H3N2 and/or B types/subtypes. Individuals aged 14 years or less are the most affected age-segment of the population, with A viruses especially affecting children aged 0-4 years. For all influenza types/subtypes, the mean effective reproduction number is estimated to be generally in the range 1.1-1.4 (8 out of 10 seasons) and never exceeding 1.55. The age-specific susceptibility to infection appears to be a type/subtype-specific feature. Conclusions The results presented in this study provide insights on type/subtype-specific transmission patterns of seasonal influenza that could be instrumental to fine-tune immunization strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at limiting seasonal influenza spread and burden.","output":"Characterizing the transmission patterns of seasonal influenza in Italy: lessons from the last decade"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systematic reviews are a cornerstone of today's evidence-informed decision making. With the rapid expansion of questions to be addressed and scientific information produced, there is a growing workload on reviewers, making the current practice unsustainable without the aid of automation tools. While many automation tools have been developed and are available, uptake seems to be lagging. For this reason, we set out to investigate the current level of uptake and what the potential barriers and facilitators are for the adoption of automation tools in systematic reviews. We deployed surveys among systematic reviewers that gathered information on tool uptake, demographics, systematic review characteristics, and barriers and facilitators for uptake. Systematic reviewers from multiple domains were targeted during recruitment; however, responders were predominantly from the biomedical sciences. We found that automation tools are currently not widely used among the participants. When tools are used, participants mostly learn about them from their environment, for example, through colleagues, peers, or organization. Tools are often chosen on the basis of user experience, either by own experience or from colleagues or peers. Lastly, licensing, steep learning curve, lack of support, and mismatch to workflow are often reported by participants as relevant barriers. While conclusions can only be drawn for the biomedical field, our work provides evidence and confirms the conclusions and recommendations of previous work, which was based on expert opinions. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance that organizations and best practices in a field can have for the uptake of automation tools for systematic reviews.","output":"Usage of automation tools in systematic reviews."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Oral bleeding after dental extraction in patients on non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is a frequent problem. We investigated whether 10% tranexamic acid (TXA) mouthwash decreases post-extraction bleeding in patients treated with NOACs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The EXTRACT-NOAC study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, clinical trial. Patients were randomly assigned to 10% TXA or placebo mouthwash and were instructed to use the mouthwash once prior to dental extraction, and thereafter for 3 times a day for 3 days. The primary outcome was the number of patients with any post-extraction oral bleeding up to day 7. Secondary outcomes included periprocedural, early, and delayed bleeding, and the safety outcomes included all thrombotic events. The first patient was randomized on February 9, 2018 and the last patient on March 12, 2020. Of 222 randomized patients, 218 patients were included in the full analysis set, of which 106 patients were assigned to TXA (74.8 (8.8) years; 81 men) and 112 to placebo (72.7 (10.7) years; 64 men). Post-extraction bleeding occurred in 28 (26.4%) patients in the TXA group and in 32 (28.6%) patients in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 1.42; P = 0.72). There were 46 bleeds in the TXA group and 85 bleeds in the placebo group (rate ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.05; P = 0.07). TXA did not reduce the rate of periprocedural bleeding (bleeding score 4  1.78 versus 4  1.82, P = 0.80) and early bleeding (rate ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.37). Delayed bleeding (rate ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.89) and bleeding after multiple extractions (rate ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.78) were lower in the TXA group. One patient in the placebo group had a transient ischemic attack while interrupting the NOAC therapy in preparation for the dental extraction. Two of the study limitations were the premature interruption of the trial following a futility analysis and the assessment of the patients compliance that was based on self-reported information during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In patients on NOACs undergoing dental extraction, TXA does not seem to reduce the rate of periprocedural or early postoperative oral bleeding compared to placebo. TXA appears to reduce delayed bleeds and postoperative oral bleeding if multiple teeth are extracted.

Keeping food-production workers safe is essential. During the COVID-19 pandemic, safety has meant added workplace protections. Guidance about protections came early from the Federal Government. Absent from such guidance were strategies to screen workers for the causative virus. Without viral screening, some food companies had outbreaks; some facilities had to close. Companies interested in worker screenings had to devise their own strategies. One company devised a strategy having three main goals: (1) detecting asymptomatic infections, before opportunity for spread; (2) identifying workplace clusters, to indicate potential protection breakdowns; (3) comparing company results to community rates. The company decided on pilot screenings at two U.S. production plants. Screenings involved mandatory viral testing (through reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) and optional antibody testing (both immunoglobulins G and M). Pilot screenings showed benefits along with limitations: (1) detecting asymptomatic infections, but at questionably relevant time points; (2) identifying infection clusters, but with uncertain sites of transmission; (3) showing relatively low rates of infection, but absent details for meaningful community comparisons. Establishing a worker screening process was an enormous undertaking. Company employees had to stretch job roles and were distracted form usual responsibilities. Whether other companies would find sufficient benefits to justify screening costs is unclear. Moving forward, new Federal leadership could provide greater support for, and assistance with, worker screenings.

Compared to previous years, there was a 66% reduction in student lab dissection times for the first\\\\year medical students (MS1s) at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. Complete Anatomy (CA), a three\\\\dimensional (3D) anatomy atlas, was provided as an additional educational resource to supplement the in person cadaveric dissection labs. The aim of this study is to increase student engagement by producing tailored anatomical modules in CA and to evaluate their effects on students stress levels and summative practical exam performance throughout the Clinically Oriented Anatomy (COA) block. We hypothesized that the CA modules would allow current MS1s to perform to the same academic standard as students who did not have these COVID\\\\19 limitations and reduce their exam stress. METHODS: Learning modules were created that displayed 3D anatomical structures corresponding to each of the 27 COA in person dissection labs. The CA modules consisted of content and quizzes that MS1s could access either outside or inside the lab. At the end of each of the three COA units and at the end of the COA block, students were surveyed about their participation and satisfaction with the modules. Students performance on module quizzes was compared to their performance on summative practical exams. Additionally, the Class of 2023s performance in COA was compared to the Class of 2024s, with the latter taking the block under pandemic restrictions. RESULTS: Throughout the block, 82%\\\\95% (unit 1 n=97/102, unit 2 n=67/72, unit 3 n=107/130) of survey respondents reported using the modules as a study aid and 55%\\\\79% used the modules for all 27 anatomy labs. Additionally, 75%\\\\87% of MS1s rated the modules as very useful or higher on a Likert\\\\scale survey, with a majority of surveyed students using both the content and quizzes. At the end of the block a second survey showed 74% (n=70/94) of students strongly agreed or agreed that using the modules reduced their stress, and 80% (n=75/94) strongly agreed or agreed that modules allowed them to continue their learning outside of the lab. MS1 performance in the COA block was positively correlated with performance on CA quizzes (r=0.46, p<0.0001). Further, there was no significant difference between the 2023 and 2024 MS1 classes in summative practical exam scores for units 1 and 3, as well as in the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) exam. However, there was a significant increase in summative practical exam performance in the Class of 2024 for unit 2 (p<0.0001) as compared to the Class of 2023. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that the CA modules facilitated student engagement in anatomy and positively enhanced their medical education throughout the COA block. Although dissection time and lab access were limited, the CA modules benefitted the students and could have potentially compensated for that lost time.","output":"Effect of a Three\\\\Dimensional Anatomy Atlas on Medical Education Under Pandemic Restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a method for tracking individual quantum dot (QD) labeled proteins inside of live cells that uses four overlapping confocal volume elements and active feedback once every 5 ms to follow three-dimensional molecular motion.

The present study focused on larval development after the exposure of two F. enigmaticus populations (Mediterranean and Atlantic, collected in Italy and Portugal, respectively) to different trace elements (copper, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and lead) at different concentrations. Results of larval development assays were presented as the percentage of abnormal developed larvae. The effect, measured in terms of EC50 for all toxicants tested, showed that mercury was the most toxic metal for larvae of both populations. Specifically, the tested trace elements may be racked in the following order from the highest to the lowest toxicity: Mediterranean: mercury > copper > lead > arsenic > cadmium; Atlantic: mercury > copper > cadmium > arsenic > lead. Responses of both populations were similar for arsenic. Lead was the least toxic element for the Atlantic population, while cadmium showed the least toxicity for the Mediterranean population. These preliminary results demonstrate the sensitivity and suitability of the organisms to be used in ecotoxicological bioassays and monitoring protocols. Moreover, chemical analyses on soft tissues and calcareous tubes of collected test organisms and their sampling site water were performed, to identify and quantify the concentration of the tested trace elements in these 3 matrices. Populations exhibited less sensitivity to a certain element together with a relevantly higher concentration of the same element in soft tissues. This may indicate a certain resistance to particular contaminant toxic effects by organisms that tend to accumulate the same toxicant. This highlights the potential correlation between wild-caught test organisms' responses and a deep characterization of the sampling site to identify putative abnormalities or differences in model organism response during bioassay execution.","output":"Relationship between wild-caught organisms for bioassays and sampling areas: Widespread serpulid early-development comparison between two distinct populations after trace element exposure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel corona virus pandemic in 2020 has created havoc across the world.

Little is known on the sociodemographic or smoking-related traits associated with flavored cigarette use in the Asian context. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in JanuaryCMarch 2020 of 1123 Singaporean adult (aged 21C69 years) current smokers using a self-completed online or postal questionnaire. We used descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses to compare the answers of flavored and non-flavored cigarette users and fitted a multivariate logistic regression model to identify correlates of flavored cigarette use. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 85.2% reported ever use and 52.7% of respondents with a regular brand reported current use of flavored cigarettes. Older age 40C49 years (AOR= 0.63) age 50 years (AOR=0.60), Indian ethnicity (AOR=0.39), and a moderate (AOR=0.57) or high (AOR=0.34) dependence level were correlated with non-flavored cigarette use, while female gender (AOR=2.53) and a later initiation age (16C20 years: AOR=1.72; age 21 years: AOR=2.19) were correlated with flavored cigarette use.

Key findings revealed that students who accessed lecture recordings reported an enhanced learning experience. They stated that the availability of lecture recordings created an inclusive learning environment for students with learning disabilities and fostered flexible learning for those who would otherwise be unable to attend lectures either due to sickness or work commitments. Data also suggest that students utilised lecture recordings as supplementary learning resources rather than a substitute for regular lecture attendance. Our findings substantiated previous research studies and additionally demonstrated the various ways in which students engage with lecture recordings.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the practical and ethical problems of allocating limited medical resources such as intensive care unit beds and ventilators became critical. Although different countries have proposed different guidelines to manage this emergency, these proposed criteria do not sufficiently consider people living with disabilities. People living with disabilities are therefore at a higher risk of exclusion from medical treatments as physicians tend to assume they have poor quality of life, whereas access to medical treatment should be based on several parameters, including clinical data and prognosis. However, the COVID-19 pandemic shifts the medical paradigm from person-centred medicine to community-centred medicine, challenging the main ethical theories. We reviewed the main guidelines and recommendations for resources allocation and examined their position toward persons with disabilities. Based on our findings, we propose criteria for not discriminating against people with disabilities in allocating resources. The shift from person-centred to community-centred medicine offers opportunities but also risks sacrificing the most vulnerable people.

METHODS: In December 2020, during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, we conducted an Internet\\\\based nationwide health survey of Japanese workers (CORoNaWork study). A database of 27 036 participants was created. The intensity of PWHS was measured using a four\\\\point Likert scale.

We aimed to describe variation in diagnostic evaluation and empirical acyclovir treatment of infants aged 0 to 60 days presenting with fever and determine the association between testing and length of stay (LOS). METHODS In this retrospective 44-hospital observational study, we used the Pediatric Health Information System database to identify infants aged 60 days evaluated for fever in emergency departments from January 2016 through December 2017. We described hospital-level variation in laboratory testing, including HSV, imaging and other diagnostic evaluations, acyclovir use, and LOS. We assessed the relationship between HSV testing and LOS using generalized linear mixed effects models adjusted for age and illness severity. RESULTS In 24 535 encounters for fever, the median HSV testing frequency across hospitals was 35.6% (interquartile range [IQR]: 28.5%-53.5%) for infants aged 0 to 21 days and 12% (IQR: 8.6%-15.7%) for infants aged 22 to 60 days. Among HSV-tested patients, median acyclovir use across hospitals was 79.2% (IQR: 68.1%-89.7%) for those aged 0 to 21 days and 63.6% (IQR: 44.1%-73%) for those aged 22 to 60 days. The prevalence of additional testing varied substantially by hospital and age group. Risk-adjusted LOS for HSV-tested infants was significantly longer than risk-adjusted LOS for those not tested (2.6 vs 1.9 days, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Substantial variation exists in diagnostic evaluation and acyclovir use, and infants who received HSV testing had a longer LOS than infants who did not. This variability supports the need for further studies to help clinicians better risk-stratify febrile infants and to guide HSV testing and treatment decisions.","output":"Variation in Diagnostic Testing and Empiric Acyclovir Use for HSV Infection in Febrile Infants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phylogenetic analysis of complete genomes of the avian coronaviruses avian infectious bronchitis (AIBV) and turkey coronavirus (TCoV) supported the hypothesis that numerous recombination events have occurred between these viruses.

Survey items were analyzed via descriptive statistics by question. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 40.8% (n = 223) with the majority of respondents in an attending-level role. We observed that musculoskeletal components of the exam were rated as the most reliable components of a telemedicine exam and 86.5% of survey respondents reported engaging the patient or patient caregiver to help conduct the virtual exam. However, 65.7% of providers reported not being able to elicit the information needed from a telemedicine visit to make a complete clinical assessment. We also noted areas of disagreement regarding areas of patient engagement and confidentiality. We found that approximately one-third (35.8%) of those surveyed felt that their level of burnout was increased due to telemedicine.

The objectives of this research are: to propose a phylogenetic hypothesis for Mischonyx based on Total Evidence (TE); propose taxonomic changes based on the phylogeny; and analyze the phylogenetic hypothesis biogeographically. Using the exemplar approach to taxon selection, we studied 54 specimens, 15 outgroups and 39 ingroup taxa using seven molecular markers (28S, 12S and 16S ribosomal genes, citochrome oxidase subunit I gene, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase gene, internal transcribed spacer subunit 2 and histone H3 gene), totaling 3,742 bp, and 128 morphological characters. We analyzed the dataset under three optimality criteria: Maximum likelihood (ML), Maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian. We discuss the transformation of character states throughout the phylogeny, the different phylogenetic hypotheses using different datasets and the congruence of evidence between the clades obtained by the phylogenetic analysis and the biogeographical hypothesis for the Atlantic Forest areas of endemism. We estimate that Mischonyx clade diverged 50.53 Mya, and inside the genus there are two major clades. One of them cointains species from Paran, Santa Catarina, South of S?o Paulo and Serra do Mar Areas of Endemism and the other has species from Espinha?o, Bocaina, South coast of Rio de Janeiro and Serra dos rg?os Areas of Endemism. The first split inside these two clades occurred at 48.94 and 44.80 Mya, respectively. We describe three new species from Brazil: Mischonyx minimus sp. nov.

Furthermore, we report a preclinical characterization package for a soluble receptor decoy engineered to be catalytically inactive and immunologically inert, with broad neutralization capacity, that represents an attractive therapeutic alternative in light of the mutational landscape of COVID-19. This construct efficiently neutralized four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The decoy also displays antibody-like biophysical properties and manufacturability, strengthening its suitability as a first-line treatment option in prophylaxis or therapeutic regimens for COVID-19 and related viral infections. IMPORTANCE Mutational drift of SARS-CoV-2 risks rendering both therapeutics and vaccines less effective. Receptor decoy strategies utilizing soluble human ACE2 may overcome the risk of viral mutational escape since mutations disrupting viral interaction with the ACE2 decoy will by necessity decrease virulence, thereby preventing meaningful escape. The solution described here of a soluble ACE2 receptor decoy is significant for the following reasons: while previous ACE2-based therapeutics have been described, ours has novel features, including (i) mutations within ACE2 to remove catalytical activity and systemic interference with the renin/angiotensin system, (ii) abrogated FcR engagement, reduced risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, and reduced risk of hyperinflammation, and (iii) streamlined antibody-like purification process and scale-up manufacturability indicating that this receptor decoy could be produced quickly and easily at scale.

However, the rate of MTB and rifampicin resistant-MTB (RR-MTB) in the Nepalese setting has not been studied extensively. Therefore, the present study aims to assess the rate of MTB and RR-MTB and further determine the factors associated with it. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study, among national representative data of 990 consecutive presumptive TB resister of patients subjected to the GeneXpert test that presented to the tuberculosis referral hospital, was conducted over a one year period from February 2018 to January 2019. Significance for the difference for categorical data was performed by Chi-square test and factors associated with MTB and RR-MTB were assessed using binary logistic regression yielding OR with 95%CI. RESULTS: Of total 990 presumptive tuberculosis analyzed cases, median ages of the patients were 3919.09 years and two-thirds of the patients were male 653 (66.0%). The estimated prevalence of MTB in presumptive TB patients was 13.8% (95%CI: 11.88%C16.16%), and risk for MTB was significantly associated with previously treated patients: OR: 10.4 (P<0.001).

Therefore, the main aim of the current study was to assess preconception care utilization and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics of public health facilities in Hosanna town. METHODS: A facility based cross-sectional study design was carried out from July 30, 2020 to August 30, 2020. Data were collected through face-to-face interview among 400 eligible pregnant women through systematic sampling technique. Epi-data version 3.1 and SPSS version 24 was used for data entry and analysis respectively. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify association between dependent and independent variables. Crude and adjusted odds ratio with respective 95% confidence intervals was computed and statistical significance was declared at p-value <0.05. RESULT: This study revealed that 76 (19%, 95% Cl (15.3, 23.2) study participants had utilized preconception care. History of family planning use before the current pregnancy (AOR = 2.45; 95% Cl (1.270, 4.741), previous history of adverse birth outcomes (AOR = 3.15; 95% Cl (1.650, 6.005), poor knowledge on preconception care (AOR = 0.18; 95% Cl (0.084, 0.379) and receiving counseling on preconception care previously (AOR = 2.82; 95% Cl (1.221, 6.493) were significantly associated with preconception care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that nearly one-fifth of pregnant women have utilized preconception care services. History of family planning use before the current pregnancy, previous history of adverse birth outcomes, poor knowledge on preconception care and receiving counseling on preconception care previously were significantly associated with preconception care utilization. Integrating preconception care services with other maternal neonatal child health, improving womens/couples knowledge & strengthening counseling services is pivotal.","output":"Utilization of preconception care and associated factors in Hosanna Town, Southern Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim.

Some of these adaptations - in particular, the transition of patient care to virtual visits are revolutionary. Increased vigilance by health care organization and workers to minimize the spread of infection to others as well for personal protection may result in lasting behavioral change that will prevent hospital acquired or transmitted infections and may lead to reduced morbidity and mortality from the regular \\"flu\\".

The current study investigated SARS-CoV-2 viral load, biodistribution and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in patients suffering from severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: This is a retrospective single-center study in 23 patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS. Data were collected within routine intensive care. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was assessed via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Overall, 478 virology samples were taken. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody detection of blood samples was performed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Most patients (91%) suffered from severe ARDS during ICU treatment with a 30-day mortality of 30%. None of the patients received antiviral treatment. Tracheal aspirates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 100% of the cases, oropharyngeal swabs only in 77%. Blood samples were positive in 26% of the patients. No difference of viral load was found in tracheal or blood samples with regard to 30-day survival or disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 was never found in dialysate. Serologic testing revealed significantly lower concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgM and IgA antibodies in survivors compared to non-survivors (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 induced ARDS is accompanied by a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in tracheal aspirates, which remained detectable in the majority throughout intensive care treatment. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was never detected in dialysate even in patients with RNAemia.

This article reviews recent literature and offers opinions on filter practices. IVC filtration is most likely to benefit patients at high risk of iatrogenic pulmonary embolus during endovenous intervention. Filters should be used selectively in patients with acute trauma or undergoing bariatric surgery. Retrieval should be attempted for perforating filter and fractured filter fragments when imaging suggests feasibility and favorable risk-to-benefit ratio. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered when removing filters with confirmed gastrointestinal penetration. Anticoagulation solely because of filter presence is not recommended except in patients with active malignancy. Anticoagulation while filters remain in place may decrease long-term filter complications in these patients. Patients with a filter and symptomatic IVC occlusion should be offered filter removal and IVC reconstruction. Physicians implanting filters may maximize retrieval by maintaining physician-patient relationships and scheduling follow-up at time of placement. Annual follow-up allows continued evaluation for removal or replacement appropriateness. Advanced retrieval techniques increase retrieval rates but require caution. Select cases may require referral to experienced centers with additional retrieval resources.

The growing number of patients in critical conditions has required a reorganization of the hospitals wards and of other healthcare structures, by changing the working routines of health professionals. The aim of the study is to explore if and how the nursing care towards Covid-19 positive patients have changed during the pandemic. METHOD: Qualitative study with a phenomenological approach conducted through semi-structured interviews. Interviews have been carried out during the months of October and November 2020. Our research involved 21 nursing professionals attending post-graduate courses at the Department of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Parma (academic year 2019/2020) and who have worked during the pandemic period in health services structures and organizations. RESULTS: The interviews showed how, during the period of the pandemic emergency, the care relationship between nurses and patients has changed because of the priority given to clinical and technical practices, in some cases, life-saving. This happened due to different factors such as the nurses fear of being infected by the virus and the lack of a sufficient time to ensure an holistic and integrated approach towards an increasing number of patients in highly complex conditions. Thus, the dimension of caring has been consciously overshadowed. CONCLUSIONS: The health emergency that has hit Italy since the first months of 2020 has shown structural limits and gaps of public health policies, hospital settings and national health services organization that already existed in the pre-pandemic period. It also highlighted how, even before Covid-19, nursing was already in part denoted by a loss of caring, a missed nursing care.","output":"Taking care.

While controlling this communicable disease is of utmost importance, the long-term effect on individuals with non-communicable diseases (NCD) is significant. Although certain NCDs appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with NCDs may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions. Infection containment measures will have substantial short- and long-term consequences; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing NCD risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms. Vitamin D levels might decrease and there might be a rise in mental health disorders. Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression. We may have opportunities to learn from this unprecedented crisis on how to leverage healthcare technologies and improve procedures to optimize healthcare service provision. This article discusses how the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures could hit the most frail individuals, worsening the condition of NCD patients, while further jeopardizing the sustainability of the healthcare systems.

As with humans, AdV infections in animals can cause diseases that range from asymptomatic to fatal. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and diversity of AdVs in: (i) fecal samples of apes and monkeys from different African countries (Republic of Congo, Senegal, Djibouti and Algeria), (ii) stool of humans living near gorillas in the Republic of Congo, in order to explore the potential zoonotic risks. Samples were screened by real-time and standard PCRs, followed by the sequencing of the partial DNA polymerase gene in order to identify the AdV species. The prevalence was 3.3 folds higher in NHPs than in humans. More than 1/3 (35.8%) of the NHPs and 1/10 (10.5%) of the humans excreted AdVs in their feces. The positive rate was high in great apes (46%), with a maximum of 54.2% in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and 35.9% in gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), followed by monkeys (25.6%), with 27.5% in Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) and 23.1% in baboons (seven Papio papio and six Papio hamadryas). No green monkeys (Chlorocebus sabaeus) were found to be positive for AdVs. The AdVs detected in NHPs were members of Human mastadenovirus E (HAdV-E), HAdV-C or HAdV-B, and those in the humans belonged to HAdV-C or HAdV-D. HAdV-C members were detected in both gorillas and humans, with evidence of zoonotic transmission since phylogenetic analysis revealed that gorilla AdVs belonging to HAdV-C were genetically identical to strains detected in humans who had been living around gorillas, and, inversely, a HAdV-C member HAdV type was detected in gorillas. This confirms the gorilla-to-human transmission of adenovirus. which has been reported previously. In addition, HAdV-E members, the most often detected here, are widely distributed among NHP species regardless of their origin, i.e., HAdV-E members seem to lack host specificity. Virus isolation was successful from a human sample and the strain of the Mbo024 genome, of 35 kb, that was identified as belonging to HAdV-D, exhibited close identity to HAdV-D members for all genes. This study provides information on the AdVs that infect African NHPs and the human populations living nearby, with an evident zoonotic transmission. It is likely that AdVs crossed the species barrier between different NHP species (especially HAdV-E members), between NHPs and humans (especially HAdV-C), but also between humans, NHPs and other animal species.","output":"Adenovirus Infections in African Humans and Wild Non-Human Primates: Great Diversity and Cross-Species Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 have been approved for treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancers. In contrast, triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that a subset of TNBC critically requires CDK4/6 for proliferation, and yet, these TNBC are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition due to sequestration of CDK4/6 inhibitors into tumor cell lysosomes. This sequestration is caused by enhanced lysosomal biogenesis and increased lysosomal numbers in TNBC cells. We developed new CDK4/6 inhibitor compounds that evade the lysosomal sequestration and are efficacious against resistant TNBC. We also show that coadministration of lysosomotropic or lysosome-destabilizing compounds (an antibiotic azithromycin, an antidepressant siramesine, an antimalaria compound chloroquine) renders resistant tumor cells sensitive to currently used CDK4/6 inhibitors. Lastly, coinhibition of CDK2 arrested proliferation of CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant cells. These observations may extend the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors to TNBCs that are refractory to current anti-CDK4/6 therapies.","output":"Increased lysosomal biomass is responsible for the resistance of triple-negative breast cancers to CDK4/6 inhibition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Once the slave plantation outposts of European colonialism, then a domain of U.S. imperialism, over recent decades the Caribbean has become engulfed in novel forms of accumulation and social relations.

This review compiles existing DDI studies in elderly, obese, and pregnant populations that include a control group without the condition of interest. The impact of physiological changes on the magnitude of DDIs was then analyzed by comparing the exposure of a medication in presence and absence of an interacting drug for the special population relative to the control population. Aging does not alter the magnitude of DDIs as the related physiological changes impact the victim and perpetrator drugs to a similar extent, regardless of their elimination pathway.

The recent demonstration that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Covid-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine (ChA) favors the production of anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-PF4) antibodies, blood clots, and thrombocytopenia raises the question of whether other anti-CoViD-19 vaccines favor the same patterns of events. We assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (SAEs) documented in the EudraVigilance European database up to April 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of ChA compared to that of recipients of the BNT162b2 Covid-19 (Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccine (BNT). ChA administration was associated with a much higher frequency of SAEs in each AE Reaction Group as compared with that elicited by BNT. When considering AEs caused by thrombocytopenia, bleeding and blood clots, we observed 33 and 151 SAEs/1 million doses in BNT and ChA recipients, respectively. When considering patients with AEs related to cerebral/splanchnic venous thrombosis, and/or thrombocytopenia, we documented 4 and 30 SAEs and 0.4 and 4.8 deaths/1 million doses for BNT and ChA recipients, respectively. The highest risk following ChA vaccination is in young people and, likely, women of reproductive age, as suggested by hypothesized scenarios. In conclusion, the immune reaction promoted by ChA vaccine may lead to not only thrombocytopenia and cerebral/splanchnic venous thrombosis but also other thrombotic and thromboembolic SAEs. These events are not favored by BNT vaccine.

We tested the hypothesis that the SGLT2i, empagliflozin, improves non-endothelial dependent coronary microvascular function, thereby leading to better cardiac function. METHODS Patients with DM2 followed at the endocrinology outpatient clinic at Bispebjerg University Hospital were included in a double blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Participants were allocated equally to each treatment sequence using simple randomization and treated with empagliflozin 25 mg and placebo for 12 weeks, interrupted by 2 weeks wash-out period. The primary outcome was coronary microvascular function, assessed as coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) and measured with transthoracic doppler echocardiography. Echocardiographic parameters of cardiac function were measured, and blood samples were analyzed for a broad panel of cardiovascular biomarkers. RESULTS Thirteen patients were randomized to each sequence and 10 and 9 completed the study according to protocol, respectively, and were included in the analysis of outcome parameters. We found no improvement in CFVR (change in the empagliflozin period was -0.16 (SD 0.58)). There were no effects on cardiac systolic function or indicators of cardiac filling pressure. Well-known effects of empagliflozin were obtained, such as weight loss and reduction in Hba1c level. Creatinine level increased but remained within normal range.

FHF induced by MHV-3 is a type of severe liver damage imbalanced by regenerative hepatocellular activity, which is related to numerous factors. The complement system plays an important role in host defense and inflammation and is involved in first-line immunity and/or pathogenesis of severe organ disorders. In this study, we investigated the role of aberrant complement activation in MHV-3 infection-induced FHF by strategies that use C3-deficient mice and intervene in the complement system. Our results showed that mice deficient in C3 had more severe liver damage, a higher viral load in the liver and higher serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines than wild-type controls. Treatment of C57BL/6 mice with C3aR antagonist or anti-C5aR antibody reduced liver damage, viral load, and serum IFN- concentration compared with the control group. These findings indicated that complement system acts as a double-edged sword during acute MHV-3 infection. However, its dysregulated activation leads to sustained inflammatory responses and induces extensive liver damage. Collectively, by investigating the role of complement activation in MHV-3 infection, we can further understand the pathogenic mechanism of betacoronavirus, and appropriate regulation of immune responses by fine-tuning complement activation may be an intervention for the treatment of diseases induced by betacoronavirus infection.","output":"A Dual Role of Complement Activation in the Development of Fulminant Hepatic Failure Induced by Murine-Beta-Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the time of COVID-19, medical facilities struggling to fight against the pandemic. Most of the countries face a tough time fighting against this virus outbreak. Even developed countries are struggling to deal with this virus outbreak. Common problem countries face is a lack of medical staff and medical equipment. Machine learning has the potential to play an important role in a different area of medical facilities. With the help of the machine learning model, an effective diagnostic tool can be built which helps in the time of scarcity of medical staff. However medical data is imbalanced and this skew nature of data prevent machine learning algorithm from achieving high accuracy. To deal with this problem of imbalanced data, we proposed a modified decision tree algorithm that uses a minority sensitive Gini index called Mgini. In an imbalanced dataset of COVID-19, it is important to focus on the reduction of overall misclassification cost instead of trying improvement in accuracy value. Mgini is useful splitting criteria when the misclassification cost of the minority sample is huge as compared to the majority class. The use of this proposed new Gini index as a splitting criterion in the decision tree reduces the misclassification cost. Mgini based decision tree has higher accuracy and low misclassification cost as compare to the traditional Gini index based CART algorithm. Our proposed cost-sensitive approach improves imbalanced data classification without the use of data level sampling techniques.","output":"Mgini - Improved Decision Tree using Minority Class Sensitive Splitting Criterion for Imbalanced Data of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents an innovative application to identify areas vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) considering a combination of spatial analysis and a multi-criteria learning approach.

Guidelines recommend nonopioid therapies, but the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions for opioid misuse is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) for the reduction of opioid misuse and chronic pain. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This interviewer-blinded randomized clinical trial enrolled patients from primary care clinics in Utah between January 4, 2016, and January 16, 2020. The study included 250 adults with chronic pain receiving long-term opioid therapy who were misusing opioid medications. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with MORE (comprising training in mindfulness, reappraisal, and savoring positive experiences) or supportive group psychotherapy (control condition) across 8 weekly 2-hour group sessions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were (1) opioid misuse assessed by the Drug Misuse Index (self-report, interview, and urine screen) and (2) pain severity and pain-related functional interference, assessed by subscale scores on the Brief Pain Inventory through 9 months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were opioid dose, emotional distress, and ecological momentary assessments of opioid craving. The minimum intervention dose was defined as 4 or more completed sessions of MORE or supportive group psychotherapy. RESULTS: Among 250 participants (159 women [63.6%]; mean [SD] age, 51.8 [11.9] years), 129 were randomized to the MORE group and 121 to the supportive psychotherapy group. Overall, 17 participants (6.8%) were Hispanic or Latino, 218 (87.2%) were White, and 15 (6.0%) were of other races and/or ethnicities (2 American Indian, 3 Asian, 1 Black, 2 Pacific Islander, and 7 did not specify). At baseline, the mean duration of pain was 14.7 years (range, 1-60 years), and the mean (SD) morphine-equivalent opioid dose was 101.0 (266.3) mg (IQR, 16.0-90.0 mg). A total of 203 participants (81.2%) received the minimum intervention dose (mean [SD], 5.7 [2.2] sessions); at 9 months, 92 of 250 participants (36.8%) discontinued the study. The overall odds ratio for reduction in opioid misuse through the 9-month follow-up period in the MORE group compared with the supportive psychotherapy group was 2.06 (95% CI, 1.17-3.61; P = .01). At 9 months, 36 of 80 participants (45.0%) in the MORE group were no longer misusing opioids compared with 19 of 78 participants (24.4%) in the supportive psychotherapy group. Mixed models demonstrated that MORE was superior to supportive psychotherapy through 9 months of follow-up for pain severity (between-group effect: 0.49; 95% CI, 0.17-0.81; P = .003) and pain-related functional interference (between-group effect: 1.07; 95% CI, 0.64-1.50; P < .001). Participants in the MORE group reduced their opioid dose to a greater extent than those in the supportive psychotherapy group. The MORE group also had lower emotional distress and opioid craving. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, among adult participants in a primary care setting, the MORE intervention led to sustained improvements in opioid misuse and chronic pain symptoms and reductions in opioid dosing, emotional distress, and opioid craving compared with supportive group psychotherapy. Despite attrition caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the vulnerability of the sample, MORE appeared to be efficacious for reducing opioid misuse among adults with chronic pain.

This brought them into focus as promising therapeutic targets, albeit the close homology to some of the human macrodomains raised concerns regarding potential cross-reactivity and adverse effects for the host. Here, we evaluate the structure and function of the macrodomain of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We show that it can antagonize ADP-ribosylation by PARP14, a cellular (ADP-ribosyl)transferase necessary for the restriction of coronaviral infections. Furthermore, our structural studies together with ligand modelling revealed the structural basis for poly(ADP-ribose) binding and hydrolysis, an emerging new aspect of viral macrodomain biology. These new insights were used in an extensive evolutionary analysis aimed at evaluating the druggability of viral macrodomains not only from the Coronaviridae but also Togaviridae and Iridoviridae genera (causing diseases such as Chikungunya and infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus disease, respectively).

A worsening of preexisting psychiatric disorders was observed during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak, and several studies suggest that those with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be more affected than any other group of people. In the face of worsening OCD symptoms, there is a need for mental health professionals to provide the support needed not only to treat patients who still report symptoms, but also to improve relapse prevention. In this line, it is recommended to improve alternative strategies such as online consultations and digital psychiatry. The aim of this study is to develop augmented reality (AR) stimuli that are clinically relevant for patients with cleaning OCD and assess their efficiency to obtain emotionally significant responses. Four AR stimuli were developed: a plastic bag full of garbage, a piece of bread with mold, a dirty sports shoe, and a piece of rotten meat. All stimuli were shown to a clinical group (17 patients with cleaning OCD) and a control group (11 patients without OCD). Relevant results were the design of the AR stimuli. These stimuli were validated with the statistical difference in perceived anxiety in the meat stimuli between the clinical and control groups. Nevertheless, when looking at effect sizes, all stimuli present effect sizes from small (plastic bag) to large (meat), with both shoe and bread between small and medium effect sizes.

While it is known that fused cells are specialized, it is unclear whether cell-fusion itself contributes to programmatic-changes that generate the new cellular state. Here, we address this by employing a fusogen-mediated, cell-fusion system to create syncytia from undifferentiated cells. RNA-Seq analysis reveals VSV-G-induced cell fusion precedes transcriptional changes. To gain mechanistic insights, we measure the plasma membrane surface area after cell-fusion and observe it diminishes through increases in endocytosis. Consequently, glucose transporters internalize, and cytoplasmic glucose and ATP transiently decrease. This reduced energetic state activates AMPK, which inhibits YAP1, causing transcriptional-reprogramming and cell-cycle arrest. Impairing either endocytosis or AMPK activity prevents YAP1 inhibition and cell-cycle arrest after fusion. Together, these data demonstrate plasma membrane diminishment upon cell-fusion causes transient nutrient stress that may promote transcriptional-reprogramming independent from extrinsic cues.","output":"YAP1 nuclear efflux and transcriptional reprograming follow membrane diminution upon VSV-G-induced cell fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Predicting the evolution of mortality rates plays a central role for life insurance and pension funds.Various stochastic frameworks have been developed to model mortality patterns taking into account the main stylized facts driving these patterns. However, relying on the prediction of one specific model can be too restrictive and lead to some well documented drawbacks including model misspecification, parameter uncertainty and overfitting. To address these issues we first consider mortality modelling in a Bayesian Negative-Binomial framework to account for overdispersion and the uncertainty about the parameter estimates in a natural and coherent way. Model averaging techniques are then considered as a response to model misspecifications. In this paper, we propose two methods based on leave-future-out validation which are compared to the standard Bayesian model averaging (BMA) based on marginal likelihood. An intensive numerical study is carried out over a large range of simulation setups to compare the performances of the proposed methodologies. An illustration is then proposed on real-life mortality datasets which includes a sensitivity analysis to a Covid-type scenario. Overall, we found that both methods based on out-of-sample criterion outperform the standard BMA approach in terms of prediction performance and robustness.","output":"Bayesian model averaging for mortality forecasting using leave-future-out validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recently published article described the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of molnupiravir, a novel antiviral agent with potent activity against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19.

The article analyses several articles written by specialists in two Mexican journals Salud Pblica de Mxico and Gnero y Salud en Cifras.

We could observe that the research on the increase in the number of caesarean sections has indeed gained in importance, also the research on the non-medical criteria. We also noticed that the two reviews analyzed, rarely link their reflections to the category of obstetric violence.

However, several aspects of this effect remain poorly understood, for example regarding the role of prior religiosity and stress-induced anxiety. This paper explores these aspects in the context of the recent coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). The latter has impacted dramatically on many people's well-being; hence it can be considered a highly stressful event. Through online questionnaires administered to UK (n = 140) and USA (n = 140) citizens professing either Christian faith or no religion, this paper examines the impact of the coronavirus crisis upon common people's religious beliefs. Anxiety about the coronavirus and prior religiosity showed an interaction effect upon change in religious beliefs (t(276) = 2.27, p = .024): for strong believers higher anxiety about coronavirus was associated with increased strengthening of religious beliefs (r = .249), while for non-believers higher anxiety about coronavirus was associated with increased scepticism towards religious beliefs (r = - .157). These observations are consistent with the notion that stress-induced anxiety enhances support for an individual's existing ideology already embraced before a stressful event occurs.

Nabs were detected by a cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test (CPE-based VNT), carried out with SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: MT350282) ResultsA total of 78 male volunteers provided 316 samples, spanning a total of 4820 days of study. Although only 25% of donors kept nAb titers [a?]160, after a median of 100 days after the onset of disease, there was a high probability of sustaining nAB titers [a?]160 in volunteers whose initial nAb titer was [a?]1280, weight [a?] 90kg or BMI classified as overweight or obese, evidenced by Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox hazard regression. There was no correlation between ABO group, ABO antibody titers and persistent high nAb titers.

Materials and methods Computed tomography (CT) scans from major trauma patients (considered as a random population sample) from the radiology department of St Georges University Hospitals NHS Trust, London, have been used to explore COVID-19 disease at the population level. Results At lockdown on 23 March 2020 in the catchment area of St Georges University Hospitals NHS Trust, an earlier paper showed that there was a high prevalence of disease of >20%. With further follow-up and at the end of lockdown, it have been now estimated that around 57% of the population had been affected, which was similar to that predicted from a simple model based on average household size and prevalence at lockdown. With an average household size of around three persons, there was a 2-week sustain period and a 5-week decline period before the prevalence of the disease returned to background levels. Conclusions The present results suggest that the effect of lockdown is dependent on the disease prevalence at the start of lockdown and the average household size.

Several studies from New York, Italy, and China confirm that patients with diabetes are at a much higher risk for mortality due to COVID-19. Besides respiratory illness, COVID-19 increases cardiac injury and diabetic ketoacidosis. In the absence of specific guidelines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 for patients with diabetes, they remain at higher risk and are more susceptible to COVID-19. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of basic knowledge on how diabetes affects pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In patients with diabetes, impaired glucose use alters metabolic and consequently biological processes instigating pathological remodeling, which has detrimental effects on cardiovascular systems. A majority of biological processes are regulated by noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs), which have emerged as a promising therapeutic candidate for several diseases. In consideration of the higher risk of mortality in patients with diabetes and COVID-19, novel diagnostic test and treatment strategy are urgently warranted in post-COVID-19 era.

To build up a reliable, interpretable mortality prediction model with strong foresight, we have performed an international, bi-institutional study from China (Wuhan cohort, collected from January to March) and Germany (Wrzburg cohort, collected from March to September). A Random Forest-based machine learning approach was applied to 1,352 patients from the Wuhan cohort, generating a mortality prediction model based on their clinical features. The results showed that five clinical features at admission, including lymphocyte (%), neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, could be used for mortality prediction of COVID-19 patients with more than 91% accuracy and 99% AUC. Additionally, the time-series analysis revealed that the predictive model based on these clinical features is very robust over time when patients are in the hospital, indicating the strong association of these five clinical features with the progression of treatment as well. Moreover, for different preexisting diseases, this model also demonstrated high predictive power. Finally, the mortality prediction model has been applied to the independent Wrzburg cohort, resulting in high prediction accuracy (with above 90% accuracy and 85% AUC) as well, indicating the robustness of the model in different cohorts. In summary, this study has established the mortality prediction model that allowed early classification of COVID-19 patients, not only at admission but also along the treatment timeline, not only cohort-independent but also highly interpretable.

METHODS: The systematic review herein (PROSPERO CRD42020200647) evaluated to what extent differences in government-imposed stringency and timeliness of response to COVID-19 moderate the prevalence of depressive symptoms across 33 countries (k=114, N=640,037). We included data from six lower-middle-income countries, nine upper-middle-income countries, and 18 higher-income countries. Government-imposed stringency and timeliness in response were operationalized using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response (Stringency) Index. RESULTS: The overall proportion of study participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms was 21.39% (95% CI 19.37C23.47).

Evidence of this phenomenon in Germany, however, is sparse. Recently, we reported the first construction and validation of a German questionnaire. This study aimed to understand this phenomenon better in a sample of young (<= 35 years) German physicians. METHODS: The electronic questionnaire (SeViD-I survey) was administered for 6 weeks to a sample of young physicians in training for internal medicine or a subspecialty. All physicians were members of the German Society of Internal Medicine. The questionnaire had three domains - general experience, symptoms, and support strategies - comprising 46 items. Binary logistic regression models were applied to study the influence of various independent factors on the risk of becoming a second victim, the magnitude of symptoms and the time to self-perceived recovery. RESULTS: The response rate was 18% (555/3047). 65% of the participants were female, the mean age was 32 years. 59% experienced second victim incidents in their career so far and 35% during the past 12 months. Events with patient harm and unexpected patient deaths or suicides were the most frequent key incidents. 12% of the participants reported that their self-perceived time to full recovery was more than 1 year or have never recovered. Being female was a risk factor for being a second victim (odds ratio (OR) 2.5) and experiencing a high symptom load (OR 2). Working in acute care was promoting a shorter duration to self-perceived recovery (OR 0.5). Support measures with an exceptionally high approval among second victims were the possibility to discuss emotional and ethical issues, prompt debriefing/crisis intervention after the incident and a safe opportunity to contribute insights to prevent similar events in the future. CONCLUSION: The second victim phenomenon is frequent among young German physicians in internal medicine. In general, these traumatic events have a potentially high impact on physician health and the care they deliver.

Some enzymatic activities are generally associated with RNA viruses such as RNA- or DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, RNA helicases or proteases. Some viral enzyme activities are however unique to some viral families. This is the case of two 3'-5' exoribonuclease activities identified in arenavirus and coronavirus proteomes. Arenaviruses have a segmented ambisense single stranded RNA genome of negative polarity while coronaviruses have a positive single-stranded genomic RNA. Although both enzymes belong to the same exo(ribo)nuclease superfamily, available data indicate that they are involved in very different pathways. Indeed, the exoribonuclease activity carried by the arenavirus nucleoprotein seems to counteract the innate immunity antiviral response while the exoribonuclease activity carried by the coronavirus nsp14 protein is likely involved in a unique RNA repair mechanism. In this review, we present our current knowledge about these two viral enzymes and their functions in the viral life cycle.","output":"Structures and exoribonuclease activity fonctions in arenavirus and coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pericytes in the brain are candidate regulators of microcirculatory blood flow because they are strategically positioned along the microvasculature, contain contractile proteins, respond rapidly to neuronal activation, and synchronize microvascular dynamics and neurovascular coupling within the capillary network.

The development, identity, specialization, and progeny of different subtypes of pericytes, however, remain unclear. Pericytes perform brain-wide transportation engineering functions in the capillary network, instructing, integrating, and coordinating signals within the cellular communicome in the neurovascular unit to efficiently distribute oxygen and nutrients (goods and services) throughout the microvasculature (transportation grid).

These situations, while relevant, do not cover all situations in which CD8+ T cell memory is relevant. It is increasingly clear that CD8+ T cells with a memory phenotype form in response to infections with extensive or prolonged tissue inflammation, for example, influenza, herpes, and more recently, COVID-19. In these circumstances, inflammatory mediators expectedly affect forming memory CD8+ T cells, especially in tissues in which pathogens establish. Notwithstanding recent important discoveries, many outstanding questions on how inflammation shapes CD8+ T cell memory remain unanswered.

This research indicates that nationalists largely consist of conservative country leaders, social elites, populists, and individuals in the middle-lower class, many of whom uphold racism and extreme nationalism, and that globalists largely consist of international organizations and regional leaders, medical practitioners, intellectuals and philanthropic entrepreneurs, the middle-upper class population. This social group distinction is clarified in accordance with converse ethical value perspectives, ideologies, social group-economic interests, and even national competition positions. Regarding cultural and institutional basics, nationalists uphold neoliberalism, social Darwinism, the law of jungle, and individualism, whereas globalists advocate for social democracy and collectivistic ethnic codes.

The tumor microenvironment promotes the secretion of diverse cytokines, in different types and stages of cancers. These cytokines may inhibit tumor development but alternatively may contribute to chronic inflammation that supports tumor growth in both autocrine and paracrine manners and have been linked to poor cancer outcomes. Such distinct sets of cytokines from the tumor microenvironment can be detected in the circulation and are thus potentially useful as biomarkers to detect cancers, predict disease outcomes and manage therapeutic choices. Indeed, analyses of circulating cytokines in combination with cancer-specific biomarkers have been proposed to simplify and improve cancer detection and prognosis, especially from minimally-invasive liquid biopsies, such as blood. Additionally, the cytokine signaling signatures of the peripheral immune cells, even from patients with localized tumors, are recently found altered in cancer, and may also prove applicable as cancer biomarkers. Here we review cytokines induced by the tumor microenvironment, their roles in various stages of cancer development, and their potential use in diagnostics and prognostics. We further discuss the established and emerging diagnostic approaches that can be used to detect cancers from liquid biopsies, and additionally the technological advancement required for their use in clinical settings.","output":"Tumor-Induced Inflammatory Cytokines and the Emerging Diagnostic Devices for Cancer Detection and Prognosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between taste and smell losses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and to elucidate whether taste preference influences such taste loss. METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted in 366 Thai participants, including 122 who were confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive by RT-PCR (case group) and 244 who were SARS-CoV-2-negative (control group). Taste, smell, and appetite changes were assessed by self-reported visual analog scale. Preference for sweet, salty, umami, sour, bitter, and spicy were judged using the validated TASTE-26 questionnaire. RESULTS: Partial taste and smell losses were observed in both groups, while complete losses (ageusia and anosmia) were detected only in the case group. Moreover, only ageusia and anosmia were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (P < 0.001, odds ratio of 14.5 and 27.5, respectively). Taste, smell, and appetite scores were more severely reduced in the case group (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that anosmia and ageusia were the best predictors of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, followed by appetite loss and fever. Simultaneous losses of taste and smell but not taste preferences were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (P < 0.01, odds ratio 2.28). CONCLUSIONS: Complete, but not partial, losses of taste and smell were the best predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Summary Background Data: Acute appendicitis is the most commonly performed emergency surgery in the United States and is unlikely to improve without medical or surgical intervention. Dramatic reductions in ED visits prompted concern that individuals with serious conditions, such as acute appendicitis, were deferring treatment for fear of contracting COVID-19. Methods: Patients from 146 hospitals with diagnosed appendicitis and arrival between March 2016 and May 2020 were selected. Electronic medical records data were retrospectively reviewed to retrieve patient data. Daily admissions were averaged from March 2016 through May 2019 and compared with March 2020. April-specific admissions were compared across the 5-year pre-COVID-19 period to April 2020 to identify differences in volume, demographics, disease severity, and outcomes. Results: Appendicitis patient admissions in 2020 decreased throughout March into April, with April experiencing the fewest admissions. April 2020 experienced a substantial decrease in patients who presented with appendicitis, dropping 25.4%, from an average of 2030 patients (2016-2019) to 1516 in 2020. An even greater decrease of 33.8% was observed in pediatric patients (age &lt;18). Overall, 77% of the 146 hospitals experienced a reduction in appendicitis admissions. There were no differences between years in percent of patients treated nonoperatively (P = 0.493) incidence of shock (P = 0.95), mortality (P = 0.24), or need for postoperative procedures (P = 0.81). Conclusions: Acute appendicitis presentations decreased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, while overall management and patient outcomes did not differ from previous years. Further research is needed focusing on putative explanations for decreased hospital presentations unrelated to COVID-19 infection and possible implications for surgical management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

As of December 16, Omicron has been detected in 89 countries (WHO, 2021b). The thread posed by Omicron is highly uncertain. Methods and findingsFor the analysis of the impact of Omicron on infection pressure and hospitalization needs we developed an open-source stochastic SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) fast-model for simulating the transmission in the transition stage from the prevailing variant (most often Delta) to Omicron. The model is capable to predict trajectories of infection pressure and hospitalization needs, considering (a) uncertainties for the (Omicron) parametrization, (b) pre-existing vaccination and/or partial immunity status of the population, and demographic specific aspects regarding reference hospitalization needs, (c) effects of mitigating measures including social distancing and accelerated vaccination (booster) campaigns. ConclusionsThe SIR model approach yields results in fair agreement with Omicron transmission characteristics observed in South Africa and prognosis results in Europe (UK and Netherlands). The equations underlying the SIR formulation allows to effectively explore the effect of Omicron parametrization on anticipated infection growth rates and hospitalization rates relative to the prevailing variant.

Epithelial-immune cell interactions and elevated cytokine and chemokine levels, i.e. cytokine storm, seem to play a central role in severity and lethality in COVID-19. The present perspective places a central cellular pro-inflammatory signal pathway, NF-B, in the context of recently published data for COVID-19 and provides a hypothesis for a therapeutic approach aiming at the simultaneous inhibition of whole cascades of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

Clinical parameters and investigations within 24 hours of admission were retrieved from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Influenza PCR were sent for 925 AECOPD cases (mean age 75 years, 87.9% male). There were 90 PCR positive cases (68 Influenza A, 22 Influenza B). Influenza PCR positive cases had higher temperatures, higher heart rates, lower white cell and lower eosinophil counts. Age, gender, COPD severity, comorbidities and smoking status were similar in both groups. There were no differences in blood pressure, oxygen status, neutrophil or lymphocyte counts, C reactive protein, procalcitonin or chest X-ray consolidation between groups. Higher temperature, higher heart rate, white cell count in the lowest quartile (Q1 < 8.1 x10(9)/L) and non-eosinophilic exacerbations predicted influenza PCR positivity on univariate logistic regression and these factors remained significant after multivariate adjustment (temperature adjusted odds ratio [adj OR] 1.324 [1.009C1.737], p = 0.043; heart rate adj OR 1.017 [1.004C1.030], p = 0.011; white cell count Q1 adj OR 3.330 [1.690C6.562], p = 0.001; eosinophilic exacerbations adj OR 0.390 [0.202C0.756], p = 0.005).

Social determinants of health (SDoH) could account for disparities in disease incidence and outcomes. We investigated the association between zip code racial composition and COVID-19 incidence and case fatality in Oakland County, MI. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study using publicly available data on COVID-19 in 70 zip codes in Oakland County, MI. We obtained demographic surrogate markers of SDoH by zip code from the US Census Bureau website. Using negative binomial regression models, we investigated the association between the percentage of Blacks in each zip code and COVID-19 incidence and case fatality, including markers of SDoH as potential confounders. RESULTS: Reported COVID-19 cases ranged from 13.2 to 255.2 per 10,000 population. Each percentage increase in Blacks within a zip code was associated with a 3% increase in COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 1.02 to 1.04, p  0.0001), and this remained significant after adjusting for income or poverty level, number of persons per household, mode of transportation, age, and level of education (incidence rate ratio: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.03, p  0.0001). Zip codes with a higher percentage of Blacks also experienced a faster increase in COVID-19 rates from April 3 to May 16. However, the proportion of Blacks in a zip code was not associated with case fatality. CONCLUSION: Zip codes with larger Black populations were disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

At the same time, Malaysian citizens have been inundated with the overabundance of news and information about COVID-19 since it hit the world in December 2019. Recent study by ISIS Malaysia discovered that WhatsApp and Facebook are the most used social media for misinformation at 39% and 34%, respectively. This phenomenon is termed as an infodemic which occurs when there is an excessive amount of information with undetermined level of accuracy. Hence, this situation makes it difficult for people to find reliable and truthful sources of information when they require it. Infodemiology is the scientific term used to describe the massive spread of information in a digital format particularly on the Internet which aims to guide the stakeholders such as the government on public health policy. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques hold potential solutions to address infodemic issue. This paper conceptualizes an Infodemiology Framework for COVID-19 and future pandemics towards addressing the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation on the Internet. Leveraging on AI techniques such as classification via clustering and decision tree algorithms, the research works will be conducted in five phases beginning with dataset collection phase, model building and algorithm selection phase, model refinement phase, model verification phase, and the model deployment phase.

METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional population-based study of 23,555 Black men and 146,889 NHW men diagnosed with PCa in the California Cancer Registry from 2004 to 2017. We conducted multivariable logistic regression to examine the association of year of diagnosis, block group-level neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), marital status, and insurance type on differences in PCa risk profiles between Black and NHW men. RESULTS High PSA (>20 ng/mL), GS, stage, individually and combined PCa risk profiles were more common among Black men versus NHW men. In fully-adjusted models, relative to NHW men, we observed a persistent 67% increased odds of high PSA among Black men. NSES was the factor most strongly associated with racial disparity in high PSA, accounting for 25% of the difference.

In addition to being a target of the virus, the kidney also seems to have substantial influence on the outcomes of the disease. Methods: Data was obtained by a comprehensive and non-systematic search in the PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus and SciELO databases, using mainly the terms \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"COVID-19\\", \\"chronic kidney disease\\", \\"renal transplantation\\", acute kidney injury\\" and \\"renal dysfunction\\". Discussion: The membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and this interaction may lead to an imbalance of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS), associated with worse clinical presentations of COVID-19, including acute pulmonary injury, hyperinflammatory state and hematological alterations. In the framework of renal diseases, development of acute kidney injury is associated mostly with immune alterations and direct cytopathic lesions by the virus, leading to higher mortality. As for chronic kidney disease, the patients at a non-terminal stage have worse prog-nosis, while the hemodialysis patients appear to have mild courses of COVID-19, probably due to lower chances of being affected by the cytokine storm. Furthermore, the current scenario is unfavorable to kidney donation and transplantation. The relationship between COVID-19 and immunosuppression in kidney transplantation recipients has been greatly discussed to determine whether it increases mortality and how it interacts with immunosuppressive medications. Conclusion: The kidney and the RAS exert fundamental roles in the SARS-CoV-2 infection and more research is required to have a complete understanding on the repercussions caused by COVID-19 in renal diseases.","output":"COVID-19 and Renal Diseases: An Update."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandemia de Covid-19 y la crisis sanitaria en Chile han evidenciado y acentuado ciertas desigualdades socioeconmicas, de edad y gnero.

In this study, we prepared core-shell particles using a melanin precursor polymer, that is, polytyrosine (PTy), as a shell layer by the oxidative polymerization of tyrosine ethyl ester (Ty) in the presence of cerium oxide (CeO2) core particles. Inspired by skin tanning, irradiating the CeO2@PTy core-shell particles with UV or natural sunlight caused melanization by extending the -conjugated length of PTy, producing colloidal particles with the ability to absorb light. The pellet samples consisting of CeO2@PTy particles appeared whitish because of multiple scattered light. In contrast, the light absorption capacity of CeO2@PTy UV or CeO2@PTy Sun particles after light irradiation suppressed scattered light, dramatically improving the visibility of the structural color of the pellet samples made from these particles. Thus, a new method has been developed to control the visualization of structural colors to the human eye by irradiating the melanin precursor polymer with light.","output":"Control of Structural Coloration by Natural Sunlight Irradiation on a Melanin Precursor Polymer Inspired by Skin Tanning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, the authors describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric graduate medical education (GME), including the impact on clinical experiences for trainees, teaching methods used, trainee wellness, GME leader wellness and support, and the traditional interview process.

We aimed to identify the ideal timing of bowel preparation to achieve optimal colon cleansing with no increased risk of aspiration. METHODS A total of 892 consecutive patients undergoing simultaneous esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were prospectively recruited. Residual gastric volume (RGV) and pH of gastric contents were measured at EGD, and patients' characteristics, runway time (duration between completion of the final liter of bowel preparation and colonoscopy commencement), and cleansing quality were recorded. RESULTS A shorter runway time resulted in better colon cleansing (r = -0.124, P < 0.001). No correlation between runway time and RGV or pH was found (r = -0.017, P = 0.62 and r = -0.030, P = 0.47, respectively). RGV and pH did not differ significantly with runway time of 4 or 5 h. RGV with runway time 3 h was 35.9  11.8 mL and 17.4  0.6 mL after runway time >3 h (P < 0.001). No aspiration pneumonia occurred. The only factors independently related to higher RGV were younger age and male sex. CONCLUSIONS The consumption of bowel preparation agent within 3-4 h before propofol sedation resulted in a similar RGV and pH as those achieved by more prolonged fasting, with no increased risk of aspiration even in patients perceived to be at high risk.","output":"Split-dose bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol for colonoscopy performed under propofol sedation.

In England, which has a publicly funded universal health care system, the use of core inpatient services by adults 65 years and older is equal across groups defined by education level, after controlling for health status. However, variation among these groups in the use of outpatient and emergency department care developed between 2010 and 2015, a period of relative financial austerity. Based on England's experience, introducing universal health care in the United States seems likely to reduce, but not entirely eliminate, inequalities in health care use across different population groups. CONTEXT: Expanding access to health care is once again high on the US political agenda, as is concern about those who are being left behind. But is universal health care that is largely free at the point of use sufficient to eliminate inequalities in health care use? To explore this question, we studied variation in the use of hospital care among education\\\\level\\\\defined groups of older adults in England, before and after controlling for differences in health status. In England, the National Health Service (NHS) provides health care free to all, but the growth rate for NHS funding has slowed markedly since 2010 during a widespread austerity program, potentially increasing inequalities in access and use. METHODS: Novel linkage of data from six waves (2004\\\\2015) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) with participants hospital records (Hospital Episode Statistics [HES]) produced longitudinal data for 7,713 older adults (65 years and older) and 25,864 observations. We divided the sample into three groups by education level: low (no formal qualifications), mid (completed compulsory education), and high (at least some higher education). Four outcomes were examined: annual outpatient appointments, elective inpatient admissions, emergency inpatient admissions, and emergency department (ED) visits. We estimated regressions for the periods 2004\\\\2005 to 2008\\\\2009 and 2010\\\\2011 to 2014\\\\2015 to examine whether potential education\\\\related inequalities in hospital use increased after the growth rate for NHS funding slowed in 2010. FINDINGS: For the study period, our sample of ELSA respondents in the low\\\\education group made 2.44 annual outpatient visits. In comparison, after controlling for health status, we found that participants in the high\\\\education group made an additional 0.29 outpatient visits annually (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11\\\\0.47). Additional outpatient health care use in the high\\\\education group was driven by follow\\\\up and routine appointments. This inequality widened after 2010. Between 2010 and 2015, individuals in the high\\\\education group made 0.48 (95% CI, 0.21\\\\0.74) more annual outpatient visits than those in the low\\\\education (16.9% [7.5% to 26.2%] of annual average 2.82 visits). In contrast, after 2010, the high\\\\education group made 0.04 (95% CI, ?0.075 to 0.001) fewer annual ED visits than the low\\\\education group, which had a mean of 0.30 annual ED visits. No significant differences by education level were found for elective or emergency inpatient admissions in either period. CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for demographics and health status, there was no evidence of inequality in elective and emergency inpatient admissions among the education groups in our sample. However, a period of financial budget tightening for the NHS after 2010 was associated with the emergence of education gradients in other forms of hospital care, with respondents in the high\\\\education group using more outpatient care and less ED care than peers in the low\\\\education group. These estimates point to rising inequalities in the use of hospital care that, if not reversed, could exacerbate existing health inequalities in England. Although the US and UK settings differ in many ways, our results also suggest that a universal health care system would likely reduce inequality in US health care use.","output":"Educational Inequalities in Hospital Use Among Older Adults in England, 2004\\\\2015"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In conditions of the deep crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to reboot the tourism industry.

Therefore, the purpose of this article is to compare the features of tourism branding in Ukraine and Poland, taking into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism industry and consumer behavior. The study is grounded on the use of general and specific methods based on a systematic approach to the study of tourism branding opportunities in Ukraine and Poland before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: analysis and synthesis - used to compare the competitiveness of tourism, brand, development status and trends in the tourism industry of countries;deduction and induction - used to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourism development and outline the problems of competitiveness of countries' tourism;ion and generalization - used to provide recommendations on how to improve countries' tourism branding. The article revealed that tourism plays a significant role in the economy of Ukraine and Poland and is closely linked with other industries. A comparison of the weaknesses and strengths of the countries' tourism competitiveness made it possible to identify basic components that need to be improved. It was found that Ukraine and Poland are in constant search of optimal tourist brands. The authors investigated the specifics and retrospective development of tourist brands by government bodies in both countries.

This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, with cells positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein observed in the swim bladder. Several variants of concern were also tested with no evidence of increased infectivity in our model. Low infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in zebrafish larvae was not due to the host type I interferon response, as comparable viral loads were detected in type I interferon-deficient animals. Mosaic overexpression of human ACE2 was not sufficient to increase SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in zebrafish embryos or in fish cells in vitro.

In Canada, between January 2016 and March 2020, a total of 16,364 people died due to opioid-related overdose. The World Health Organization reports that 70% of the 0.5 million deaths worldwide caused by drugs are related to opioid overdose. Although supervised consumption sites or safe injection sites have been shown to be effective in reducing the harms associated with the use of illicit substances and increasing uptake of addiction treatment and other health services, there is still significant stigma associated with them, and it is unlikely that all of the people who would benefit from supervised consumption service will ever access a site. OBJECTIVE: To help prevent deaths in populations that cannot or will not access physical safer consumption services in Alberta, we propose to provide virtual (telephone-based) overdose response services, staffed by people with lived experience.The primary outcome for this study is uptake of the service as measured by the number of calls to the service. Secondary outcomes will include patterns of use of the phone line (days of the week and time of calls) and outcomes from the calls (number of emergency medical services dispatches for overdoses from the service and the results of those dispatches). METHODS: This phase 1 clinical study is set to officially launch in early May 2020. The service will be available to up to 15 participants who self-disclose as using opioids unobserved and have given informed consent for both data collection and interviews. This group will have access to a toll-free telephone number and be invited to call when they plan to use opioids alone. RESULTS: The analysis will include mixed methods. To improve the design of the service and ensure safety of all involved, quantitative data will be collected on phone calls and participant health care usage, while qualitative data will be collected from both participants and virtual overdose response operators CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial aims to test the feasibility of a service that provides virtual overdose response in order to help prevent deaths in populations that cannot or will not access physical supervised consumption services in Alberta.

The predominant type in 2013 was HAdV-7, which differed from 2011 and 2012, when HAdV-3 was more common. There was a trend towards pneumonia being more common in patients infected with HAdV-7 than in patients infected with other types, although this did not reach statistical significance (OR 2.8, 95% CI, 0.9 to 8.7). CONCLUSION The emergence of HAdV-7 in a population where other HAdV types had circulated previously may have caused the outbreak in Singapore, and this was associated with more serious infections in children. Young age (<2 years) and significant comorbidities were associated with more severe HAdV infection.","output":"Risk Factors for Severe Adenovirus Infection in Children during an Outbreak in Singapore."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) were originally discovered as by-products and mediators of chronic inflammation such as in atherosclerosis. Over the last years, an increasing body of evidence led to the notion that OxPL not only contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory processes but in addition play an integral role as modulators of inflammation during acute infections. Thereby, host defense mechanisms involve the generation of oxygen radicals that oxidize ubiquitously present phospholipids, which in turn act as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These OxPL-derived DAMPs can exhibit both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions that ultimately alter the host response to pathogens. In this review, we summarize the currently available data on the role of OxPL in infectious diseases.","output":"Accumulating evidence for a role of oxidized phospholipids in infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With an estimated annual worldwide death toll of between 290 000 and 650 000, seasonal influenza remains one of the deadliest respiratory diseases Influenza vaccines provide moderate to high protection and have been on the World Health Organizations Model List of Essential Medicines since 1979 Approximately 490 million doses of influenza vaccine are produced per year, but an investigation of geographic allocation reveals enormous disparities Here, we present two maps that visualise the inequality of the distribution across 195 countries: a conventional choropleth map and a cartogram In combination, these two maps highlight the widespread lack of coverage in Africa and many parts of Asia As COVID-19 vaccines are now being distributed in developed countries, data for seasonal influenza vaccine distribution emphasises the need for policymakers to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Environment & Planning A is the property of Sage Publications Inc and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Mapping the inequality of the global distribution of seasonal influenza vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A dot blot hybridization assay, using a biotinylated cDNA probe, was able to detect feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) RNA in Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf-4) cells infected with the FIPV isolates DF2, 79-1146, UCDI, and UCD2. The probe cross-hybridized in the dot blot assay with nucleic acid of a closely related feline coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV)-79-1683. To construct the probe, a 2.5 kilobase cDNA, prepared from FIPV-DF2 genomic RNA, was molecularly cloned. The recombinant cDNA clone was digested with the restriction endonuclease Rsa I, and an 870 basepair Rsa I fragment was isolated from vector DNA by agarose electrophoresis and glassmilk purification. This fragment was complementary to the 3 three fourths of the nucleocapsid gene. The hybridization probe was prepared by random primed labeling in the presence of biotin-11-dUTP. Using an avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and chemiluminescent substrate detection system, virus could be detected in as few as 3000 infected cells. In an in vivo study, the probe was used to detect FIPV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) isolated at various post-infection days (PID) from cats experimentally infected with the FIP-producing coronavirus isolate FIPV-79-1146 or FIPV-DF2. Viral RNA could be detected in as few as 12 000 PBML isolated from cats at PID 7 and in 50 000 PBML at PID 22. There was no consistent pattern, however, between hybridization results and prognosis or severity of disease at the time of sampling. Despite some cross-hybridization with FECV RNA, this probe should be useful for diagnosis of FIP, because cats infected with FECV most likely do not become viremic.","output":"Detection of feline infectious peritonitis virus infection in cell cultures and peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes of experimentally infected cats using a biotinylated cDNA probe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"'Public engagement' describes a collaborative relationship between scientists and the public we serve.

MTLV establishes a persistent infection and can be recovered indefinitely from infected mice, but nothing is known about requirements for this persistent infection. In order to determine whether T lineage lymphocytes are required for infection, young adult athymic nude (nulnu) mice and euthymic littermates were infected with MTLV and tested for virus shedding. Although euthymic littermates regularly shed virus, in the nude mice only about 20% of isolation attempts up to 100 days postinfection were positive. Blind passage yielded an additional three isolations out of 14 samples (21 %). In addition, unlike many other herpesviruses, the virus did not replicate in a number of epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines that were tested. These data confirm that the virus is preferentially T lymphotropic and suggest that infection may require T lineage lymphocytes.","output":"Mouse thymic virus (MTLV; Murid Herpesvirus 3) infection in athymic nude mice: Evidence for a T lymphocyte requirement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To study and compare the outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with the internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in the eyes with recalcitrant diabetic macular edema (DME) with and without vitreomacular traction. METHODS: A comparative prospective interventional study was undertaken in which group 1 included 45 eyes of 45 patients with DME with vitreomacular tractional component and group 2 included 45 eyes of 45 patients with recalcitrant DME without a tractional component. Both groups underwent standard PPV with ILM peeling. All the patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. The parameters evaluated were changes in the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) parameters, and occurrence of any intraoperative/postoperative surgical complication. RESULTS: The mean CMT improved significantly from 540.6 and 490.2 m at the baseline to 292.5 and 270.6 m at 6 months in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P < 0.001). The mean BCVA logMAR improved from 0.78  0.21 to 0.62  0.22 in group 1 and 0.84  0.19 to 0.65  0.21 in group 2 at 6 months follow-up which was not statistically significant.

While N-chlorotaurine (also known as taurine chloramine; TauCl) has anti-inflammatory effects in cells, its effects against pulmonary and systemic inflammation after lung infection has not been elucidated. In the present study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of the taurine derivative, TauCl against Escherichia coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pneumonia in obese mice maintained on a high fat diet. In this study, TauCl was injected intraperitoneally 1 h before intratracheal LPS administration. While body weight was decreased by 7.5% after LPS administration, TauCl treatment suppressed body weight loss. TauCl also attenuated the increase in lung weight due to lung edema. While LPS-induced acute pneumonia caused an increase in cytokine/chemokine mRNA expression, including that of IL-1, -6, TNF-, MCP-1, TauCl treatment attenuated IL-6, and TNF-alpha expression, but not IL-1 and MCP-1. TauCl treatment partly attenuated the elevation of the serum cytokines. Furthermore, TauCl treatment alleviated skeletal muscle wasting. Importantly, LPS-induced expression of Atrogin-1, MuRF1 and IB, direct or indirect targets for NFB, were suppressed by TauCl treatment.

Gamma sterilization is attractive for PPE reuse because it can sterilize large quantities of material through hermetically sealed packaging, providing safety and logistic benefits. The Gamma Irradiation Facility at Sandia National Laboratories was used to irradiate N95 filtering facepiece respirators to a sterilization dose of 25 kGy(tissue). Aerosol particle filtration performance testing and electrostatic field measurements were used to determine the efficacy of the respirators after irradiation. Both respirator models exhibited statistically significant decreases in particle filtering efficiencies and electrostatic potential after irradiation. The largest decrease in capture efficiency was 40-50% and peaked near the 200 nm particle size. The key contribution of this effort is correlating the electrostatic potential change of individual filtration layer of the respirator with the decrease filtration efficiency after irradiation.

Every state in the United States enacted policies to encourage distancing and some mandated staying home. Understanding how these policies interact with individuals' voluntary responses to the COVID-19 epidemic is a critical initial step in understanding the role of these nonpharmaceutical interventions in transmission dynamics and assessing policy impacts. We use variation in policy responses along with smart device data that measures the amount of time Americans stayed home to disentangle the extent that observed shifts in staying home behavior are induced by policy. We find evidence that stay-at-home orders and voluntary response to locally reported COVID-19 cases and deaths led to behavioral change. For the median county, which implemented a stay-at-home order with about two cases, we find that the response to stay-at-home orders increased time at home as if the county had experienced 29 additional local cases. However, the relative effect of stay-at-home orders was much greater in select counties. On the one hand, the mandate can be viewed as displacing a voluntary response to this rise in cases. On the other hand, policy accelerated the response, which likely helped reduce spread in the early phase of the pandemic. It is important to be able to attribute the relative role of self-interested behavior or policy mandates to understand the limits and opportunities for relying on voluntary behavior as opposed to imposing stay-at-home orders.","output":"Measuring voluntary and policy-induced social distancing behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most important concerns for managing public health is the prevention of infectious diseases. Although vaccines provide the most effective means for preventing infectious diseases, there are two main reasons why it is often difficult to reach a socially optimal level of vaccine coverage: (i) the emergence of operational issues (such as yield uncertainty) on the supply side, and (ii) the existence of negative network effects on the consumption side. In particular, uncertainties about production yield and vaccine imperfections often make manufacturing some vaccines a risky process and may lead the manufacturer to produce below the socially optimal level. At the same time, negative network effects provide incentives to potential consumers to free ride off the immunity of the vaccinated population. In this research, we consider how a central policy-maker can induce a socially optimal vaccine coverage through the use of incentives to both consumers and the vaccine manufacturer. We consider a monopoly market for an imperfect vaccine; we show that a fixed two-part subsidy is unable to coordinate the market, but derive a two-part menu of subsidies that leads to a socially efficient level of coverage.","output":"Operational issues and network effects in vaccine markets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modeling immunity in vitro has the potential to be a powerful tool for investigating fundamental biological questions, informing therapeutics and vaccines, and providing new insight into disease progression.

The COVID-19 vaccines are poised to change this outcome;however, inequitable access and decades of medical mistreatment have resulted in healthcare mistrust and an associated low uptake within this group. Loma Linda University (LLU) houses the largest mass vaccination site in San Bernardino County (SBC) California;nevertheless, there has been a perpetual low representation of Black vaccinees. To increase the number of Black persons vaccinated, a selected team at LLU leveraged a community-academic partnership model to address vaccine hesitancy and increase access to the COVID-19 vaccines. The objective of this study was to evaluate the number of Black persons vaccinated in community settings compared to the mass clinic. Methods LLU developed a tiered approach to increase COVID-19 vaccinations within Black SBC communities. The first tier engaged faith leaders with the academic community in disseminating COVID-19 health information, the second included culturally representative LLU healthcare professionals in the delivery of COVID-19 educational webinars, and the third was to conduct low barrier, remote-site vaccination clinics, within targeted Black communities. Following these efforts, we compared the number of Black individuals vaccinated in the LLU mass clinic to those vaccinated in the community remote-site clinics. Results The remote-site COVID-19 vaccination clinics commenced in February 2021. From February 1 until April 30, 2021, 24,808 individuals were vaccinated in the LLU mass clinic with a first dose (Pfizer or Moderna) or single dose (Janssen) of a COVID-19 vaccine, however, only 908 (3.7%) were Black vaccinees. Contrastingly, the LLU remote site clinics vaccinated 1,542 individuals with a first or single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Of those vaccinees, 675 (44%) were Black. Conclusion The multi-tiered community approach (remote-site vaccination clinics) resulted in a necessary overrepresentation of Black vaccinees, previously underrepresented in the LLU traditional mass vaccination clinic effort (44% vs. 3.7%, respectively).

Therefore, the present study was conducted to explain the experiences, challenges and adaptation strategies in patients with COVID-19 in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: The present study was performed with a qualitative approach and phenomenological method among 33 patients with COVID-19. From July 20 to September 21, access to participants and data collection were done in person (15 people) and by phone (18 people) through targeted sampling and snowball and semi-structured interviews. Data management was carried out using MAXQDA-2018 software and its analysis was done by the Colaizzi analysis method. Guba and Lincoln's criteria were also observed to improve the quality of results. RESULTS: After analyzing the data, two main categories and 17 subcategories were obtained, including (1) experiences and challenges (ignoring the disease, blaming, physical health disorders, mental problems, guilt, and remorse, being blamed, living a life of disappointment and ambiguity, emotional challenges, frustrating reactions from others, helplessness and limitation) and (2) disease adaptation strategies (spirituality, learning about COVID-19, doing valuable and fun activities, participating in treatment, strengthening one's spirit and hope, trying to make up for past mistakes and virtual communication). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, interventions and policies such as increasing people's health knowledge and literacy to get acquainted with the symptoms of the disease and prompt referral for diagnosis and treatment, teaching stress and psychological pressure management techniques, instructing families to continue emotional and social support for patients and strengthening and reproducing the strategies patients use, along with teaching disease coping skills, harnessing the potential of cyberspace and the media can make it easier to tolerate illness and get back to life.","output":"Explaining Experiences, Challenges and Adaptation Strategies in COVID-19 Patients: A Qualitative Study in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A case-control study was performed to examine age, gender, and ABO blood groups in 1014 Iraqi hospitalized cases with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 901 blood donors (control group) The infection was molecularly diagnosed by detecting coronavirus RNA in nasal swabs of patients Results: Mean age was significantly elevated in cases compared to controls (48 2  13 8 vs 29 9  9 0 year;probability [p] &lt; 0 001) Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated the predictive significance of age in COVID-19 evolution (Area under curve = 0 858;95% CI: 0 841 C 0 875;p &lt; 0 001) Males outnumbered females in cases (60 4 vs 39 6%) and controls (56 vs 44%) Stratification by age group (&lt; 30, 30 C 39, 40 C 49 and  50 years) revealed that 48 3% of cases clustered in the age group  50 years ABO blood group analysis showed that group A was the most common among cases, while group O was the most common among controls (35 5 and 36 7%, respectively) Blood groups A (35 5 vs 32 7;corrected p [pc] = 0 021), A+AB (46 3 vs 41 7%;pc = 0 021) and A+B+AB (68 0 vs 63 3%;pc = 0 007) showed significantly elevated frequencies in cases compared to controls Logistic regression analysis estimated odds ratios (ORs) of 1 53 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1 16 - 2 02), 1 48 (95% CI: 1 14 - 1 93) and 1 50 (95% CI: 1 17 - 1 82) for blood groups A, A+AB and A+B+AB, respectively Blood group frequencies showed no significant differences between age groups of cases or controls Regarding gender, male cases were marked with increased frequency of group A (39 9 vs 28 9%) and decreased frequency of group O (25 9 vs 41 0%) compared to female cases Independent re-analysis of ABO blood groups in male and female cases demonstrated that group A was increased in male cases compared to male controls (39 9 vs 33 1%;OR = 1 65;95% CI: 1 24 - 2 21;pc = 0 006) On the contrary, no significant differences were found between females of cases and controls Conclusions: The study results indicated that blood group A may be associated with an increased risk of developing COVID-19, particularly in males","output":"Association between ABO blood groups and susceptibility to COVID-19: profile of age and gender in Iraqi patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to impact every industry and test problem-solving capabilities and innovation across the board;education is no exception. As institutions continue to adapt to the impacts of the current public health crisis, colleges and universities are also navigating federal policy prompted by the pandemic. Literature has shown the positive influence of organizations, such as the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP), and, we argue that they can take a more active intermediary approach, that of an Organizational Buffer, to best support their students during times of uncertainty. Current research highlights the disconnect between STEM education and policy, as well as how the pandemic is disproportionately impacting communities of color. The pervasiveness of whiteness within educational policy and the negative impacts of unequal distribution of resources on students of color in STEM highlight the need to center race in a theoretical framework and policy. The purpose of this study was to understand the policy and communication responses to the pandemic as they pertained to supporting student success in STEM. Using the Theory of Racialized Organizations, which is a qualitative case study approach that leverages diffractive readings, was implemented to understand whether educational policy and communication responses during this time have or perpetuated inequitable systems. Guided by the research question, in what ways do pandemic policies and communications bolster the success of underrepresented minoritized students (URM) majoring in STEM, our study found four versions of policymaking (i.e., Performative, Picking Winners and Losers, Stay in your Lane, and Time Burden) that emerged and did not support URM STEM students equitably and consistently.

METHODS This research used a double-blind parallel-group design with a placebo control (n = 76) and randomized group (n = 181), with all participants being between 18 and 75 years old. Fifteen minutes before each radiotherapy, participants in the intervention group were given a gel containing 3% sodium pentaborate pentahydrate, while those in the placebo group received a gel with no chemical substance. Dermatitis, erythema, dry desquamation, and moist desquamation were compared between the 2 groups.

Experimentally infected camelids clear infectious virus within one week and mount an effective adaptive immune response. Here, transcription of immune response genes was monitored in the respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected alpacas. Concomitant to the peak of infection, occurring at 2 days post inoculation (dpi), type I and III interferons (IFNs) were maximally transcribed only in the nasal mucosa of alpacas, provoking the induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) along the whole respiratory tract. Simultaneous to mild focal infiltration of leukocytes in nasal mucosa and submucosa, upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 and dampened transcription of pro-inflammatory genes under NF-B control were observed. In the lung, early (1 dpi) transcription of chemokines (CCL2 and CCL3) correlated with a transient accumulation of mainly mononuclear leukocytes. A tight regulation of IFNs in lungs with expression of ISGs and controlled inflammatory responses, might contribute to virus clearance without causing tissue damage. Thus, the nasal mucosa, the main target of MERS-CoV in camelids, is central in driving an efficient innate immune response based on triggering ISGs as well as the dual anti-inflammatory effects of type III IFNs and IL10. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the etiological agent of a respiratory disease causing high mortality in humans. In camelids, the main MERS-CoV reservoir host, viral infection leads to subclinical disease. Our study describes transcriptional regulations of innate immunological pathways underlying asymptomatic clinical manifestations of alpacas in response to MERS-CoV. Concomitant to the peak of infection, these animals elicited a strong transient interferon response and induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 in the nasal mucosa. This was associated to a dimmed regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of interferon stimulated genes along the whole respiratory mucosa, leading to the rapid clearance of the virus. Thus, innate immune responses occurring in the nasal mucosa appear to be the key in controlling MERS-CoV disease by avoiding a cytokine storm. Understanding on how asymptomatic host reservoirs counteract MERS-CoV infection will aid in the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines.","output":"Type I and III IFNs produced by the nasal epithelia and dimmed inflammation are key features of alpacas resolving MERS-CoV infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Telemedicine use in otolaryngology waxed and waned during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in the U.S. Assessing the patterns of telemedicine use and its perceived limitations during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 allows identification and correction of impediments to consistent telemedicine use by otolaryngologists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Full-time faculty of 2 academic otolaryngology departments in New York City were surveyed regarding their telemedicine use from March through August 2020 during the \\"first wave\\" of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on these findings, a method of \\"augmented outpatient otolaryngology teleconsultation\\" designed to enhance the quality of the physical examination was developed and employed from August to December 2020. Patients receiving this augmented teleconsult were anonymously surveyed about their telemedical experience. RESULTS: Telemedicine use by faculty was minimal prior to the pandemic, but as total outpatient volume decreased 65-84% across subspecialties, it was used by all otolaryngologists during COVID-19. Physicians were less confident in making a telemedical diagnosis at all phases of the study in all subspecialties. Patients who had an augmented otolaryngology teleconsultation were satisfied with it, believed it facilitated earlier care, limited the time and cost of travel to the physician's office and felt their physician was able to perform a sufficient physical examination. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 crisis, physicians utilized teleotolaryngology to provide care but were less satisfied with their ability to make an accurate diagnosis.

Proper quantification of uncertainty helps to provide valuable information to obtain accurate diagnosis. This paper reviewed related studies conducted in the last 30 years (from 1991 to 2020) in handling uncertainties in medical data using probability theory and machine learning techniques. Medical data is more prone to uncertainty due to the presence of noise in the data. So, it is very important to have clean medical data without any noise to get accurate diagnosis. The sources of noise in the medical data need to be known to address this issue. Based on the medical data obtained by the physician, diagnosis of disease, and treatment plan are prescribed. Hence, the uncertainty is growing in healthcare and there is limited knowledge to address these problems.

In patients screened or admitted to suburban and rural hospitals in Arizona, mortality increased with co-infection. The impact of bacterial coinfections on the immune response was studied by comparing white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte counts as well as the relationship between duration of steroid use and mortality in coinfected COVID-19 patients investigated. METHODS A chart review of 677 SARS-CoV-2 patients was conducted at during December 2020 to March 2021. Patients solely infected with COVID-19 (COVID-19 patients) were compared to patients with concurrent bacterial or fungal infections (coinfected patients). Parameters included admission duration, ICU duration, mortality, WBC, lymphocytes, and duration of steroid use. WBC and lymphocytes were compared amongst COVID-19 and coinfected patients that survived or that expired during their hospital stay. COVID-19 positive patients not admitted to hospital were used as controls. RESULTS The admitted and ICU duration of coinfected patients was significantly (p < 0.05) higher (12.93 vs 10.92 days) than COVID-19 patients (6.39 vs 4.38 days), as was mortality rate (22.5% vs 9.8%). WBC was higher (9.4x103) in coinfected patients than COVID-19 alone (7.9x103). Lymphocytes were lower (2.03x103) in coinfected patients compared to COVID-19 alone (2.41x103). A significant difference in WBC was seen between expired COVID-19 patients (10.1x103), expired coinfected patients (10.01x103) and COVID-19 non-admitted patients (6.44x103). Lymphocytes were lower in surviving coinfected patients (I.96x103) and expired COVID-19 patients (I.61x103) than COVID-19 non-admitted patients (7.33x 103).

Our preliminary data suggest that these parameters (PVV and SVV) are not useful in monitoring patient stability or the need for volume replacement during intraoperative phlebotomy prior to cardiac surgery.","output":"Pulse Pressure Analysis to Guide Intraoperative Phlebotomy Prior to Cardiac Surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES In patients with coronavirus disease 2019-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome, sedatives and opioids are commonly administered which may lead to increased vulnerability to neurologic dysfunction. We tested the hypothesis that patients with coronavirus disease 2019-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome are at higher risk of in-hospital mortality due to prolonged coma compared with other patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome matched for disease severity. DESIGN Propensity-matched cohort study. SETTING Seven ICUs in an academic hospital network, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA). PATIENTS All mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients between March and May 2020 were identified and matched with patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome of other etiology. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Using clinical data obtained from a hospital registry, we matched 114 coronavirus disease 2019 patients to 228 noncoronavirus disease 2019-related acute respiratory distress syndrome patients based on baseline disease severity. Coma was identified using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale less than or equal to -3. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were used to assess the percentage of comatose days, sedative medications used, and the association between coronavirus disease 2019 and in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality (48.3% vs 31.6%, adjusted odds ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.34-3.44; p = 0.002), the percentage of comatose days (66.0%  31.3% vs 36.0%  36.9%, adjusted difference, 29.35; 95% CI, 21.45-37.24; p < 0.001), and the hypnotic agent dose (51.3% vs 17.1% of maximum hypnotic agent dose given in the cohort; p < 0.001) were higher among patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Brain imaging did not show a higher frequency of structural brain lesions in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (6.1% vs 7.0%; p = 0.76). Hypnotic agent dose was associated with coma (adjusted coefficient, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.78; p < 0.001) and mediated (p = 0.001) coma. Coma was associated with in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 5.84; 95% CI, 3.58-9.58; p < 0.001) and mediated 59% of in-hospital mortality (p < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the content and characteristics of TikTok videos that are related to an important aspect of community mitigationthe use of masks as a method for interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In total, 100 trending videos with the hashtag #WearAMask (ie, a campaign on TikTok), along with 32 videos that were posted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and involved masks in any way (ie, all related WHO videos at the time of this study), were included in our sample. We collected the metadata of each post, and created content categories based on fact sheets that were provided by the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We used these fact sheets to code the characteristics of mask use. RESULTS: Videos that were posted on TikTok and had the hashtag #WearAMask garnered almost 500 million views, and videos that were posted by the WHO garnered almost 57 million views. Although the ratio of the number of trending #WearAMask videos to the number of WHO videos was around 3:1, the #WearAMask videos received almost 10 times as many cumulative views as the WHO videos. In total, 68% (68/100) of the trending #WearAMask videos involved humor and garnered over 355 million cumulative views. However, only 9% (3/32) of the WHO videos involved humor. Furthermore, 27% (27/100) of the trending #WearAMask videos involved dance and garnered over 130 million cumulative views, whereas none of the WHO videos involved dance.

Management of these hernias is challenging. The recurrence rate after surgical repair is high because of the difficulty of prosthetic material fixation; there is no consensus regarding the best method of repair. METHODS We introduced a novel combined laparoscopic-perineal dual fixation technique in the repair of perineal hernias after APR. This technique begins with a perineal approach under laparoscopic vision. After excision of the hernia sac, the mesh is introduced and fixed anteriorly to the urogenital diaphragm and laterally to the sacrotuberous ligament and the surrounding scar tissue. The perineal incision is then closed. Next, the mesh is fixed to the sacrum with ProTack? and is fixed again to the sacrotuberous ligament via a laparoscopic approach. RESULTS The dual fixation repair method is successful and without difficulties, with no recurrence at 13-month follow-up.

METHODS Data of patients with rectal malignancies diagnosed in the Netherlands between 1989 and 2018 were retrieved from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and grouped according to the RARECARE cancer list. Age-standardised incidence rates were calculated using the European Standard Rate. The Joinpoint Regression Program was used for analysing trends and joinpoints and for the estimation of annual percentage changes (APCs). Patient characteristics, treatment details and relative survival (RS) were reported for different histological types of rectal malignancies and compared between different time periods. RS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test. RESULTS A total of 88,299 cases of rectal malignancies were included of which 2125 (2.5%) were categorised as rare histological subtypes. The incidence of rectal neuro-endocrine tumours (NET) (APC: 6.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.4%; 7.1%), rectal sarcoma (APC: 5.8%, 95% CI: 2.9%; 8.7%) and rectal adenocarcinoma (APC 1.0%, 95% CI: 0.26%; 1.8%) increased.

Although the possible effect of ACE2 gene polymorphism remains unknown, human ACE2 receptor expression influences SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 disease outcome. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between ACE gene I/D polymorphism, ACE2 receptor gene polymorphism, and COVID-19 severity. ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and ACE2 receptor gene rs2106809 and rs2285666 polymorphisms were determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism methods, respectively, in 155 COVID-19 patients who were divided into three groups (mild, moderate, and severe) according to clinical symptoms. However, the distribution of genotype and allele frequencies of ACE gene I/D, ACE2 receptor gene rs2106809, and rs2285666 polymorphisms were not statistically significant in all groups. In conclusion, in the study population, ACE gene I/D, ACE2 receptor gene rs2106809, and rs2285666 polymorphisms were not associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection. Although ACE2 receptor gene expression may affect the susceptibility to COVID-19, there is no existing evidence that the ACE or ACE2 gene polymorphisms are directly associated with COVID-19 severity.

COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a pandemic infection that has caused significant mortality and economic losses. Potential therapies and prophylaxis against COVID-19 are urgently needed to combat this novel infection. As a result of in vitro evidence suggesting zinc sulphate may be efficacious against COVID-19, our hospitals began using zinc sulphate as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.Aim. To compare outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients ordered to receive hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin plus zinc sulphate versus hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone.Methodology. This was a retrospective observational study. Data was collected from medical records for all patients with admission dates ranging from 2 March 2020 through to 11 April 2020. Initial clinical characteristics on presentation, medications given during the hospitalization, and hospital outcomes were recorded. The study included patients admitted to any of four acute care NYU Langone Health Hospitals in New York City. Patients included were admitted to the hospital with at least one positive COVID-19 test and had completed their hospitalization. Patients were excluded from the study if they were never admitted to the hospital or if there was an order for other investigational therapies for COVID-19.Results. Patients taking zinc sulphate in addition to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (n=411) and patients taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone (n=521) did not differ in age, race, sex, tobacco use or relevant comorbidities. The addition of zinc sulphate did not impact the length of hospitalization, duration of ventilation or intensive care unit (ICU) duration. In univariate analyses, zinc sulphate increased the frequency of patients being discharged home, and decreased the need for ventilation, admission to the ICU and mortality or transfer to hospice for patients who were never admitted to the ICU. After adjusting for the time at which zinc sulphate was added to our protocol, an increased frequency of being discharged home (OR 1.53, 95a??% CI 1.12-2.09) and reduction in mortality or transfer to hospice among patients who did not require ICU level of care remained significant (OR 0.449, 95a??% CI 0.271-0.744).Conclusion.

SETTING: Raghudeep Eye Hospital, India. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Ten patients attending ophthalmic outpatient clinic (OPD) and operating room (OR) were included. Using Schlieren imaging, exhaled airflow patterns were documented with/without an N95 mask or face shield during respiratory activities. Recordings were performed with and without room air conditioning turned on. Exhaled airflow patterns in OPD and OR when using vs not using these infection control measures and the impact of room air circulation on these were compared. RESULTS: Five patients each in OPD and OR were included. There was a forward stream of exhaled air from the patient's mouth/nose during all respiratory activities. An N95 mask dampened its intensity and forward transmission. Taping the mask around the nasal bridge further reduced airflow leakage. A mechanical barrier in front of the patient's face blocked forward propagation of the exhaled airflow. Turning on a forceful and direct draft of air over the surgeon's working area dampened and diverted the exhaled airflow away from the surgeons' breathing area. This effect was particularly pronounced in the OR, with the overhead laminar airflow. CONCLUSIONS: Using high force airflow with the draft facing downward can dampen and divert the exhaled airflow away from healthcare providers.

Nunatsiavut is one of the four Inuit land claim areas in northern Canada making up the Inuit homeland, or Inuit Nunangat. It is situated in northern Labrador in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Methods This qualitative study consisted of key informant interviews conducted from July 2020-December 2020 with policy actors that spanned the Nunatsiavut Government (regional Inuit government), Government of Newfoundland and Labrador (provincial government), the Government of Canada (federal government), non-governmental organizations and private industry. Participants were asked about their role, policy gaps and opportunities for improving policies that pertain to food security in Nunatsiavut. It also included initial insights from emergency food security measures implemented during the first wave of COVID-19 in 2020. Results Fifteen key informant interviews were completed, and three participants provided written responses. The results were reported as per the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ): 32Citem checklist. Seven participants (39%) stated they developed policy, six participants (33%) stated they both developed and implemented policy and five participants (28%) stated they implemented policy. Seven themes were identified from discussions with policy actors. Policy recommendations to improve food security include improving transportation, social policies, and policy coherence in policy implementation. Five separate themes were identified from discussions on implementing emergency food security measures during the first wave of COVID-19 in Nunatsiavut.

Early in the pandemic, our health system created an admission order set which included daily d-dimer, c-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ferritin. Given more available outcomes data, limiting standing order of studies that do not affect daily management could result in significant cost savings to the health system without adverse patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine ordering and utilization patterns of inflammatory markers by physicians caring for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infections. Methods An anonymous 10-question survey was distributed to 125 physicians (Infectious Diseases, Hospitalist, Pulmonary and Critical Care faculty). Responses were tallied and values greater than 50% were identified as the majority of the surveyed group. Results Of the 125 physicians surveyed, 77 (62%) responded. A total of 57.1% (44/77) of physicians reported ordering daily inflammatory markers for 3-10 days from admission. Another 31.2% (24/77) ordered markers until clinical improvement or hospital discharge. D-dimer was used for care decisions by 83.1% (64/77) of respondents;93.8% (60/64) of those reported utilizing it in determining anticoagulation dose. CRP was used by 61% (47/77) of physicians to help identify a secondary infection or determine steroid dose or duration. LDH and ferritin were not used for management decisions by the majority of physicians. Inflammatory markers were not used routinely after isolation precautions had been discontinued, even when ongoing care required mechanical ventilation. Conclusion Of the markers studied, both d-dimer and CRP were considered useful by most respondents. LDH and ferritin were used less frequently and were not considered as useful in guiding medical decision making. Discontinuation of standing daily LDH and ferritin orders is believed to have potential to result in cost savings to the health care system with no adverse patient outcomes.

In this study, computational screening is performed by molecular docking of 1615 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Several promising approved drugs, including Simeprevir, Ergotamine, Bromocriptine and Tadalafil, stand out as the best candidates based on their binding energy, fitting score and noncovalent interactions at the binding sites of the receptor. All selected drugs interact with the key active site residues, including His41 and Cys145. Various noncovalent interactions including hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, piCsulfur and piCpi interactions appear to be dominant in drugCMpro complexes. MD simulations are applied for the most promising drugs. Structural stability and compactness are observed for the drugCMpro complexes. The protein shows low flexibility in both apo and holo form during MD simulations. The MM/PBSA binding free energies are also measured for the selected drugs. For pattern recognition, structural similarity and binding energy prediction, multiple linear regression (MLR) models are used for the quantitative structuralCactivity relationship.

METHODS: We performed a nationwide, single-center, prospective cohort study of FSHD in childhood assessing muscle functioning, imaging, and quality of life over 2 years of follow-up. RESULTS: We included 20 children with genetically confirmed FSHD who were 2 to 17 years of age. Overall, symptoms were slowly progressive, and the mean FSHD clinical score increased from 2.1 to 2.8 (p = 0.003). The rate of progression was highly variable. At baseline, 16 of 20 symptomatic children had facial weakness; after 2 years, facial weakness was observed in 19 of 20 children. Muscle strength did not change between baseline and follow-up. The most frequently and most severely affected muscles were the trapezius and deltoid. The functional exercise capacity, measured with the 6-minute walk test, improved. Systemic features were infrequent and nonprogressive. Weakness-associated complications such as lumbar hyperlordosis and dysarthria were common, and their prevalence increased during follow-up. Pain and fatigue were frequent complaints in children, and their prevalence also increased during follow-up. Muscle ultrasonography revealed a progressive increase in echogenicity. DISCUSSION: FSHD in childhood has a slowly progressive but variable course over 2 years of follow-up. The most promising outcome measures to detect progression were the FSHD clinical score and muscle ultrasonography. Despite this disease progression, an improvement on functional capacity may still occur as the child grows up. Pain, fatigue, and a decreased quality of life were common symptoms and need to be addressed in the management of childhood FSHD.

However, the advent of COVID-19 pandemic and the noted potential contamination of bank notes and coinage revealed a steep support toward cashless payments and supported an immediate need to amend legislations and protocols to maintain the efficiency and stability of banking systems while catering for the shift in user demand. This chapter surveys the shift created by the COVID-19 pandemic from cash-based to cashless systems in cities and unveils how payment giants and information and communication technology corporations have been active in providing the underlaying foundation that would be critical in supporting the transition.","output":"The Forceful Reevaluation of Cash-Based Transactions by COVID-19 and Its Opportunities to Transition to Cashless Systems in Digital Urban Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 has emerged as a significant global concern, triggering harsh public health restrictions in a successful bid to curb its exponential growth. As discussion shifts towards relaxation of these restrictions, there is significant concern of second-wave resurgence. The key to managing these outbreaks is early detection and intervention, and yet there is a significant lag time associated with usage of laboratory confirmed cases for surveillance purposes. To address this, syndromic surveillance can be considered to provide a timelier alternative for first-line screening. Existing syndromic surveillance solutions are however typically focused around a known disease and have limited capability to distinguish between outbreaks of individual diseases sharing similar syndromes. This poses a challenge for surveillance of COVID-19 as its active periods tend to overlap temporally with other influenza-like illnesses. In this study we explore performing sentinel syndromic surveillance for COVID-19 and other influenza-like illnesses using a deep learning-based approach. Our methods are based on aberration detection utilizing autoencoders that leverages symptom prevalence distributions to distinguish outbreaks of two ongoing diseases that share similar syndromes, even if they occur concurrently. We first demonstrate that this approach works for detection of outbreaks of influenza, which has known temporal boundaries. We then demonstrate that the autoencoder can be trained to not alert on known and well-managed influenza-like illnesses such as the common cold and influenza. Finally, we applied our approach to 2019C2020 data in the context of a COVID-19 syndromic surveillance task to demonstrate how implementation of such a system could have provided early warning of an outbreak of a novel influenza-like illness that did not match the symptom prevalence profile of influenza and other known influenza-like illnesses.","output":"An aberration detection-based approach for sentinel syndromic surveillance of COVID-19 and other novel influenza-like illnesses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant global social and economic disruption.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective and prospective study of pediatric patients hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infections and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at eight sites in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. RESULTS: We identified 281 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections and divided them into three groups based on clinical features. Overall, 143 (51%) had respiratory disease, 69 (25%) had MIS-C, and 69 (25%) had other manifestations including gastrointestinal illness or fever. Patients with MIS-C were more likely to identify as non-Hispanic black compared with patients with respiratory disease (35% versus 18%, P=.02). Seven patients (2%) died and 114 (41%) were admitted to the ICU. In multivariable analyses, obesity (OR=3.39, 95% CI:1.26-9.10, P=.02) and hypoxia on admission (OR=4.01; 95% CI:1.14-14.15; P=.03) were predictive of severe respiratory disease.

We aimed to evaluate (a) substances and dosages provided, and (b) effectiveness and safety of the program. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of all COVID-19 isolation hotel shelter residents during May 2021. We extracted data on medication and alcohol dosages provided each day. The primary outcome was residents prematurely leaving isolation against public health orders. Adverse events included (a) overdose; (b) intoxication; and (c) diversion, selling, or sharing of medications or alcohol. Results: Over 25 days, 77 isolation hotel residents were assessed (mean age 42 +/- 14 years; 24% women). Sixty-two (81%) residents were provided medications, alcohol, or cigarettes. Seventeen residents (22%) received opioid agonist treatment medications (methadone, buprenorphine, or slow-release oral morphine) and 27 (35%) received hydromorphone tablets. Thirty-one (40%) residents received stimulant tablets with methylphenidate (27; 35%), dextroamphetamine (8; 10%), or lisdexamfetamine (2; 3%). Six residents (8%) received benzodiazepines. Forty-two (55%) residents received alcohol, including 41 (53%) with strong beer, three (3%) with wine, and one (1%) with hard liquor. Over 14 days in isolation, mean daily dosages increased of hydromorphone (45 +/- 32 to 57 +/- 42mg), methylphenidate (51 +/- 28 to 77 +/- 37mg), dextroamphetamine (33 +/- 16 to 46 +/- 13mg), and alcohol (12.3 +/- 7.6 to 13.0 +/- 6.9 standard drinks). Six residents (8%) left isolation prematurely, but four of those residents returned. Over 1,059 person-days in isolation, there were zero overdoses. Documented concerns regarding intoxication occurred six times (0.005 events/person-day) and medication diversion or sharing three times (0.003 events/person-day). Conclusions: An emergency safe supply and managed alcohol program, paired with housing, was associated with low rates of adverse events and high rates of successful completion of the 14-day isolation period in COVID-19 isolation hotel shelters.

METHODS We developed a retrospective cohort study that involved patients undergoing MV in the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Causal mediation analysis was conducted to assess the relationship of ondansetron use and mortality and explore the potential causal pathway mediated by the NLR or PLR. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. RESULTS A total of 17,927 eligible patients was obtained (5665 had taken ondansetron before MV initiation and 12,262 patients had not). The OR for 28-day mortality for ondansetron use uncorrelated with the mediator (NLR, PLR) was 0.72 (95%CI=0.64-0.81, P <0.001). Ondansetron was also associated with a reduction in 28-day mortality after controlling for the mediator of NLR (OR = 0.98, 95%CI = 0.97-0.99, P < 0.01). For the indirect effect, the NLR could explain 13.47% (95%CI = 8.59-20.54%, P < 0.01) of the impact of ondansetron use on 28-day mortality. The proportion mediated increased to 21.50% (95%CI = 12.36-47.44%, P < 0.01) for 90-day mortality.

To catalyze and inform a developing research field, we undertook a prioritization exercise to identify global research questions. METHODS: We used a modified Delphi process to identify potential research priorities for understanding and addressing respectful care for newborns. Based on a literature review and expert discussions, we sent an open-ended questionnaire to participants in Round 1. The results were consolidated and used to create the Round 2 questionnaire, which asked participants to rank the preliminary list of research questions in 3 categories (descriptive, implementation, and measurement). Responses were weighted by rank and collated to generate a prioritized, consensus-based list of research questions. FINDINGS: Round 1 resulted in 70 research questions from 25 respondents, and 52 participants completed the Round 2 ranked survey. Most participants identified themselves as researchers (53.2%), program designers, implementers, or evaluators (56.5%). More than half of the participants reported working primarily in low-income countries (66%). Top descriptive questions were on understanding manifestations and definitions of disrespectful care among newborns and which perceptions and beliefs held by health workers affect the quality of care provided. Top implementation questions were around how to promote respectful care as a standard, challenges faced by health facilities, and identification of effective advocacy strategies. Top measurement questions were on quantitative and qualitative metrics and the impact of experiences on health outcomes.

The rise of the more infectious delta variant has recently indicated the value of reinstating previously relaxed non-pharmacological and test-driven preventative measures. These efforts have been met with resistance, due, in part, to a lack of site-specific quantitative evidence which can justify their value. As vaccination rates continue to increase, a gap in knowledge exists regarding appropriate thresholds for escalation and de-escalation of COVID-19 preventative measures. MethodsWe conducted a series of simulation experiments, trialing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in a hypothesized working environment that is subject to COVID-19 infections from the surrounding community. We established cohorts of individuals who would, in simulation, work together for a set period of time. With these cohorts, we tested the rates of workplace and community acquired infections based on applied isolation strategies, community infection rates (CIR), scales of testing, non-pharmaceutical interventions, variant predominances and testing strategies, vaccination coverages, and vaccination efficacies of the members included. Permuting through each combination of these variables, we estimated expected case counts for 33,462 unique workplace scenarios. ResultsWhen the CIR is 5 new confirmed cases per 100,000 or fewer, and at 50% of the workforce is vaccinated with a 95% efficacious vaccine, then testing daily with an antigen-based or PCR based test in only unvaccinated workers will result in less than one infection through 4,800 person weeks. When the community infection rate per 100,000 persons is less than or equal to 60, and the vaccination coverage of the workforce is 100% with 95% vaccine efficacy then no masking or routine testing + isolation strategies are needed to prevent workplace acquired infections regardless of variant predominance. Identifying and isolating workers with antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 testing methods results in the same or fewer workplace acquired infections than testing with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. ConclusionsSpecific scenarios exist in which preventative measures taken to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread, including masking, and testing plus isolation strategies can safely be relaxed. Further, efficacious testing with quarantine strategies exist for implementation in only unvaccinated cohorts in a workplace. Due to shorter turnaround time, antigen-based testing with lower sensitivity is more effective than PCR testing with higher sensitivities in comparable testing strategies. The general reference interactive heatmap we provide can be used for site specific, immediate, parameter-based case count predictions to inform appropriate institutional policy making.","output":"Optimized Post-Vaccination Strategies and Preventative Measures for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Akbari discusses the political theories of authoritarianism and the current discussions on authoritarian surveillance He scrutinizes Iran's inability to apply its political surveillance tools during a public health crisis and argues for an analytical integration of other sociopolitical concepts and economic potentialities into discussions of authoritarian surveillance Furthermore, he proposes a situated understanding of authoritarian surveillance contextualized within social, political, economic, and historical interrelations","output":"Authoritarian Surveillance: A Corona Test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: IgY antibodies are serum immunoglobulin in birds, reptiles and amphibians, and are transferred from serum to egg yolk to confer passive immunity to their embryos and offspring. Currently, the oral passive immunization using chicken IgY has been focused as an alternative to antibiotics for the treatment and control of diarrhea in animals and humans. This systematic review was focused to determine the effect of IgY in controlling and preventing diarrhea in domesticated animals including Piglets, Mice, Poultry and Calves. METHODS AND RESULTS: Previous research reports focused on treatment effect of Chicken IgY against diarrhea were retrieved from different electronic data bases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPRINGER-LINK, WILEY, AGRICOLA, MEDWELL Journals, Scientific Publish, Chinese articles from Core periodicals in 2012). A total of 61 studies in 4 different animal classes met the inclusion criteria. Data on study characteristics and outcome measures were extracted. The pooled relative risk (RR) of 49 studies of different animals [Piglets C 22; Mice C 14; Poultry C 7 and Calves C 6] in meta-analyses revealed that, IgY significantly reduced the risk of diarrhea in treatment group when compare to the placebo. However, the 95% confidence intervals of the majority of studies in animal class piglets and calves embrace RR of one. The same results were obtained in sub group analyses (treatment regiment C prophylactic or therapeutic; pathogen type C bacterial or viral). Perhaps, this inconsistency in the effect of IgY at the individual study level and overall effect measures could be influenced by the methodological heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis demonstrated the beneficial effect of IgY. This supports the opinion that IgY is useful for prophylaxis and treatment.

METHODS In total 33 911 babies born to 5 designated hospitals in Nanshan District of Shenzhen city from October 2017 to December 2019 were included. All subjects underwent concurrent hearing and deafness genetic screening covering 21 variants of 4 genes including GJB2, SLC26A4, GJB3 and Mt12SrRNA. For those with positive results, Sanger sequencing was carried out for confirmation. RESULTS 93.32% subjects passed the first-round hearing screening, and 87.01% passed the recheck testing. The overall detection rate was 4.18%. The detection rates for GJB2, SLC26A4, GJB3 and Mt12srRNA variants were 1.98%, 1.58%, 0.37% and 0.25%, respectively. 126 and 84 subjects were found with high risk for delayed-onset and drug-induced hearing loss, respectively. In addition, 4 and 5 subjects were found to harbor homozygous/compound heterozygous variants of the GJB2 and SLC26A4 genes, respectively. Concurrent screening showed that subjects (with heterozygous variants) who did not passed the two round hearing test were as follows: GJB2 with 6.75% in the first round and 2.61% in the second round testing, SLC26A4 (3.3%/1.2%), GJB3 (0.72%/0.14%) and 12SrRNA (0.36%/Nil), respectively. Moreover, the No-pass rate in the subjects with homozygous or compound variants in single gene, heterozygous variant in single gene, heterozygous variant in multiple genes, and homozygous variant in GJB3 gene were significantly higher than the subjects with negative results of genetic screening. CONCLUSION Concurrent newborn genetic screening can enhance the effectiveness of hearing screening and enable earlier identification and intervention for children with hearing impairment. Follow-up can improve the diagnostic rate for children who are positive for the concurrent screening. Nevertheless, genetic and hearing screening cannot replace the diagnostic testing.

Patients with kidney failure, who often use ACEi/ARB, are at higher risk of more severe COVID-19. However, there are no data available on the association of ACEi/ARB use with COVID-19 severity in this population. Methods: Data were retrieved from the ERACODA database of kidney transplant and dialysis patients affected by COVID-19, between February 1 and October 1 2020, and had information on 28-day mortality. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for the relation between ACEi/ARB use and 28-day mortality risk. Additionally, we studied the association of ACEi/ARB discontinuation with 28-day mortality. Results: We evaluated 1,511 patients, 459 kidney transplant recipients and 1,052 dialysis patients. At COVID-19 diagnosis, 189 (41%) of the transplant and 288 (27%) of the dialysis patients were on ACEi/ARB. In transplant, 88 (19%) and in dialysis patients 244 (23%) died within 28 days of initial presentation. In transplant and dialysis patients, there was no association between ACEi/ARB use and 28-day mortality in both crude and adjusted models (adjusted HR=1.12, 95%CI: 0.69-1.83 in transplant; 1.04, 95%CI: 0.73-1.47 in dialysis patients). Among transplant recipients, ACEi/ARB discontinuation was associated with higher mortality risk after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities, but the association was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for COVID-19 severity (adjusted HR=1.36, 95%CI: 0.40-4.58). Among dialysis patients, ACEi/ARB discontinuation was not associated with mortality in any model. Similar results were obtained across subgroups when ACEi and ARB were studied separately and when other outcomes for COVID-19 severity were studied e.g., hospital admission, intensive care unit admission or need for ventilator support.

This implementation science case study examines the use of a collaborative team approach (CTA) as a scale-out strategy to foster the integration of an evidence-based group mental health intervention, the Youth Readiness Intervention, into youth employment programs tied to regional economic development in Sierra Leone. METHODS: A case study methodology is used to explore the feasibility and acceptability of integrating an evidence-based intervention, the Youth Readiness Intervention (YRI), into youth entrepreneurship programs (ENTR) in Sierra Leone, facilitated by the CTA. The authors analyzed field notes logged during program implementation, 8 weeks of supervision notes, 20 interviews with agency leaders and front-line staff delivering the YRI within this alternate delivery platform. Quantitative dissemination and implementation interviews administered to youth, facilitators, and agency leaders were analyzed using descriptive statistics and mixed linear models. A linked Hybrid Type II effectiveness-implementation cluster randomized trial is evaluating the clinical effectiveness of the YRI within this delivery platform. RESULTS: Extant data indicate the strong feasibility and acceptability of integrating the YRI into the ENTR program. Facilitators of integration of the YRI into the ENTR include mission alignment of the organizations with the delivery of psychosocial interventions, shared commitment to serving vulnerable youth, support from local District Youth Councils, and high interest from the youth served. Barriers include perceived competition between frontline organizations seeking funding for psychosocial interventions, and challenges in flexibility between donors and implementation partners operating in a fragile/post-conflict setting. The CTA was a feasible and acceptable strategy to support fidelity and quality improvement while scaling out the YRI. CONCLUSIONS: Youth entrepreneurship and livelihood programs offer a promising mechanism for expanding the reach of evidence-based interventions to youth in fragile and post-conflict settings.

The research and medical communities are increasingly considering ways of reducing stigma, and health professionals have a role to play in normalising abortion as part of routine sexual and reproductive healthcare (SRH). We sought to investigate how health professionals may normalise abortion and challenge prevailing negative sociocultural narratives. METHODS: As part of the Sexuality and Abortion Stigma Study (SASS), qualitative secondary analysis was conducted on two datasets containing health professionals' accounts of providing abortion in Scotland and England. A subsample of 20 interviews were subjected to in-depth, thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four key themes were identified in heath professionals' accounts: (1) encountering resistance to abortion from others working in SRH; (2) contending with prevailing negative sociocultural narratives of abortion; (3) enacting overt positivity towards abortion provision; and (4) presenting abortion as part of normal, routine healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that negative attitudes toward abortion persist both inside and outside of healthcare systems, and need to be challenged in order to destigmatise those accessing and providing services. Health professionals can play a key role in normalising abortion, through the ways in which they frame their work and present abortion to women they treat, and others more widely. Our analysis suggests a key way to achieve this is by presenting abortion as part of normal, routine SRH, but that appropriate support and structural change are essential for normalisation to become embedded.","output":"Normalising abortion: what role can health professionals play?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Until recently, presidential job approval has been positively correlated with a healthy economy.

However, the mechanisms of its infection and replication in host cells are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the structure and function of DWV 3C protease (3Cpro), which is necessary for the cleavage of the polyprotein to synthesize mature viral proteins. Thus, it is one of the nonstructural viral proteins essential for the replication. We found that the 3Cpros of DWV and picornaviruses share common enzymatic properties, including sensitivity to the same inhibitors, such as rupintrivir. The predicted structure of DWV 3Cpro by AlphaFold2, the predicted rupintrivir binding domain, and the protease activities of mutant proteins revealed that it has a Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad. Moreover, 3Cpros of other Iflaviruses and Dicistrovirus appear to contain Asn, Ser, Asp, or Glu as the third residue of the catalytic triad, suggesting diversity in insect RNA viruses. Both precursor 3Cpro with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and mature 3Cpro are present in DWV-infected cells, suggesting that they may have different enzymatic properties and functions. DWV 3Cpro is the first 3Cpro characterized among insect RNA viruses, and our study uncovered both the common and unique characteristics among 3Cpros of Picornavirales. Furthermore, it would be possible to use the specific inhibitors of DWV 3Cpro to control DWV infection in honey bees in future. IMPORTANCE The number of managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies has considerably declined in many developed countries in the recent years. Deformed wing virus (DWV) vectored by the mites is the major threat to honey bee colonies and health. To give insight into the mechanism of DWV replication in the host cells, we studied the structure-function relationship of 3C protease (3Cpro), which is necessary to cleave a viral polyprotein at the specific sites to produce the mature proteins. We found that the overall structure, some inhibitors, and processing of 3Cpro are shared between Picornavirales; however, there is diversity in the catalytic triad. DWV 3Cpro is the first viral protease characterized among insect RNA viruses and reveals the evolutionary history of 3Cpro among Picornavirales. Furthermore, DWV 3Cpro inhibitors identified in our study could also be applied to control DWV in honey bees in future.","output":"DWV 3C Protease Uncovers the Diverse Catalytic Triad in Insect RNA Viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Proteins with low complexity regions (LCRs) have atypical sequence and structural features. Their amino acid composition varies from the expected, determined proteome-wise, and they do not follow the rules of structural folding that prevail in globular regions. One way to characterize these regions is by assessing the repeatability of a sequence, that is, calculating the local propensity of a region to be part of a repeat. RESULTS: We combine two local measures of low complexity, repeatability (using the RES algorithm) and fraction of the most frequent amino acid, to evaluate different proteomes, datasets of protein regions with specific features, and individual cases of proteins with extreme compositions. We apply a representation called low complexity triangle as a proof-of-concept to represent the low complexity measured values. Results show that proteomes have distinct signatures in the low complexity triangle, and that these signatures are associated to complexity features of the sequences. We developed a web tool called LCT (http://cbdm-01.zdv.uni-mainz.de/~munoz/lct/) to allow users to calculate the low complexity triangle of a given protein or region of interest. CONCLUSIONS: The low complexity triangle proves to be a suitable procedure to represent the general low complexity of a sequence or protein dataset. Homorepeats, direpeats, compositionally biased regions and globular regions occupy characteristic positions in the triangle. The described pipeline can be used to characterize LCRs and may help in quantifying the content of degenerated tandem repeats in proteins and proteomes.","output":"Assessing the low complexity of protein sequences via the low complexity triangle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Along with the rapid transmission of COVID-19, adherence to preventive behaviours plays a crucial role with respect to the control of COVID-19. However, different individuals psychological characteristics and risk perception result in various forms of response to preventive behaviours. Based on the Health Belief Model, this study identifies the factors associated with preventive behaviours towards COVID-19 in South Korea during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2020 through an anonymous online survey. A total of 1207 people in the age bracket of 20C59 years participated in the survey. Single and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to identify the determinants of preventive behaviours against COVID-19. RESULTS: The following factors were associated with preventive behaviours towards COVID-19: female gender ( = .124, p < 0.001), has a masters degree or above ( = 0.065, p = 0.010), perceived susceptibility ( = .197, p < 0.001), self-efficacy ( = .404, p < 0.001), trust in radio ( = ?.080, p = .006), trust in official government website ( = .057, p = .045), trust in social networks ( = .054, p = .033), and trust in family and friends ( = .068, p = .009), with an explanatory power of 41.5% (R(2) = 0.415). CONCLUSIONS: To flatten the epidemic curve, it is important to understand the publics risk perception and the motivation behind behavioural responses that aim to promote preventive behaviours among the public.

To analyze the immunogenicity of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV, spike DNA vaccine and the immunoregulatory activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2), DNA vaccine plasmids pcDNA-S and pcDNA-IL-2 were constructed and inoculated into BALB/c mice with or without pcDNA-IL-2 by using three different immunization routes (the intramuscular route, electroporation, or the oral route with live attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium). The cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, lymphocyte proliferation assays, enzyme-linked immunospot assays, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses. The results showed that specific humoral and cellular immunities could be induced in mice by inoculating them with SARS-CoV spike DNA vaccine alone or by coinoculation with IL-2-expressing plasmids. In addition, the immune response levels in the coinoculation groups were significantly higher than those in groups receiving the spike DNA vaccine alone. The comparison between the three vaccination routes indicated that oral vaccination evoked a vigorous T-cell response and a weak response predominantly with subclass immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) antibody. However, intramuscular immunization evoked a vigorous antibody response and a weak T-cell response, and vaccination by electroporation evoked a vigorous response with a predominant subclass IgG1 antibody response and a moderate T-cell response. Our findings show that the spike DNA vaccine has good immunogenicity and can induce specific humoral and cellular immunities in BALB/c mice, while IL-2 plays an immunoadjuvant role and enhances the humoral and cellular immune responses.

As the world is moving towards electric vehicle technology, a light 3 wheeled vehicle option will also help in reducing battery weight and thereby help in addressing the range concerns. In addition, slow speed 3-wheelers need not pass extensive safety regulation tests in many western countries including the USA. Three-wheeled vehicles are not new to developing countries like India as three-wheeled auto-rickshaws are quite popular for short distance shared travel. The existing single front wheel design known as delta design may have a stigma attached to it due to historic reasons in India. There is also a perception that the three-wheeled vehicles are highly unstable. Therefore, the current paper studies in detail an alternate design known as the tadpole design having two wheels in the front. The tadpole configuration facilitates decent styling and good aerodynamics. The tadpole configuration is modeled and analyzed using CAE multibody dynamics software, MSC Adams Car. To get confidence in the simulation results, a few benchmarked and tested vehicles are selected from the available literature [1] and the MBD results are compared for correlation. The studies also include a standard four-wheeled vehicle and a delta configuration 3-wheeler for reference purpose. The MBD virtual analyses provide results for vehicle stability and handling characteristics like overturning speed limit, oversteer and understeer behavior during constant radius cornering tests.

First, guaranteed loans were mostly extended to small but comparatively creditworthy firms in sectors severely affected by the pandemic, borrowing from large, liquid and well-capitalized banks. Second, guaranteed loans partially substitute pre-existing non-guaranteed debt. For firms borrowing from multiple banks, the substitution arises from the lending behavior of the bank extending guaranteed loans, whose drop in non-guaranteed lending is about 9 times larger than for other banks that lend to the same firm. Substitution was highest for funding granted to riskier and smaller firms in sectors more affected by the pandemic, and borrowing from larger and stronger banks.

We propose increasing training data for recognizing COVID-19 pneumonia opacities using weakly labeled data augmentation. This follows from a hypothesis that the COVID-19 manifestation would be similar to that caused by other viral pathogens affecting the lungs. We expand the training data distribution for supervised learning through the use of weakly labeled CXR images, automatically pooled from publicly available pneumonia datasets, to classify them into those with bacterial or viral pneumonia opacities. Next, we use these selected images in a stage-wise, strategic approach to train convolutional neural network-based algorithms and compare against those trained with non-augmented data. Weakly labeled data augmentation expands the learned feature space in an attempt to encompass variability in unseen test distributions, enhance inter-class discrimination, and reduce the generalization error. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that simple weakly labeled data augmentation (Acc: 0.5555 and Acc: 0.6536) is better than baseline non-augmented training (Acc: 0.2885 and Acc: 0.5028) in identifying COVID-19 manifestations as viral pneumonia. Interestingly, adding COVID-19 CXRs to simple weakly labeled augmented training data significantly improves the performance (Acc: 0.7095 and Acc: 0.8889), suggesting that COVID-19, though viral in origin, creates a uniquely different presentation in CXRs compared with other viral pneumonia manifestations.","output":"Weakly Labeled Data Augmentation for Deep Learning: A Study on COVID-19 Detection in Chest X-Rays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper discusses Indonesias trade balance during the first quarter of 2020 and examines developments in important sectors The study investigates what policies need to be taken to make Indonesian economy survive Based on quantitative and qualitative data, Indonesias trade balance in April 2020 experienced a deficit of 344 7 million US dollars in the export-import performance of the oil and gas and non-oil and gas sectors, after a surplus of 715 7 million US dollars in the previous month This slump was due to the decline in export performance of manufactured products and mineral fuels, which was influenced by slowing demand, disruption of global supply chains, and low commodity prices in line with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic However, positive performance of exports in gold, iron, and steel and vegetable oils and fats were able to prevent further decline in non-oil and gas Despite experiencing a deficit in April, Indonesias trade balance from January to April 2020 remained surplus of 2 25 billion US dollars To prevent the trade balance decreasing, governments policy need to strive for independence and sovereignty in fulfilling logistics in the context of national resilience by strengthening the industry and domestic production capacity in various vital sectors","output":"Trade balance during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus has already undergone several mutations, the impact of these mutations on its infectivity and virulence remains controversial. In this viewpoint, we present arguments suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 mutants responsible for the second wave have less virulence but much higher infectivity. This suggestion is based on the results of the forecasting and mechanistic models developed by our study group. In particular, in May 2020, the analysis of our mechanistic model predicted that the easing of lockdown measures will lead to a dramatic second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, after the lockdown was lifted in many European countries, the resulting number of reported infected cases and especially the number of deaths remained low for approximately two months. This raised the false hope that a substantial second wave will be avoided and that the COVID-19 epidemic in these European countries was nearing an end. Unfortunately, since the first week of August 2020, the number of reported infected cases increased dramatically. Furthermore, this was accompanied by an increasingly large number of deaths. The rate of reported infected cases in the second wave was much higher than that in the first wave, whereas the rate of deaths was lower. This trend is consistent with higher infectivity and lower virulence. Even if the mutated form of SARS-CoV-2 is less virulent, the very high number of reported infected cases implies that a large number of people will perish.","output":"SARS-CoV-2: The Second Wave in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Law offenders take advantage of face masks to conceal their identities and in the present time of the COVID-19 pandemic wearing face masks is a new norm which makes it a daunting task for the investigation agencies to identify the offenders.

The face masks detection network of the proposed vision system is developed by integrating tiny YOLO v4 with spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) module and additional YOLO detection layer and tested and validated on a self-created face masks detection dataset consisting of more than 50,000 images. The proposed tiny YOLO v4-SPP network achieved a mAP (mean average precision) value of 64.31% on the employed dataset which was 6.6% higher than tiny YOLO v4.

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to gamma-coronaviruses and causes a costly respiratory viral disease in chickens. The role of wild birds in the epidemiology of IBV is poorly understood. In the present study, we examined 1,002 cloacal and faecal samples collected from 26 wild bird species in the Beringia area for the presence of CoVs, and then we performed statistical and phylogenetic analyses. We detected diverse CoVs by RT-PCR in wild birds in the Beringia area. Sequence analysis showed that the detected viruses are gamma-coronaviruses related to IBV. These findings suggest that wild birds are able to carry gamma-coronaviruses asymptomatically. We concluded that CoVs are widespread among wild birds in Beringia, and their geographic spread and frequency is higher than previously realised. Thus, Avian CoV can be efficiently disseminated over large distances and could be a genetic reservoir for future emerging pathogenic CoVs. Considering the great animal health and economic impact of IBV as well as the recent emergence of novel coronaviruses such as SARS-coronavirus, it is important to investigate the role of wildlife reservoirs in CoV infection biology and epidemiology.","output":"Prevalence and Phylogeny of Coronaviruses in Wild Birds from the Bering Strait Area (Beringia)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The presence of lactose-fermenting Salmonella strains in clinical case materials presented to microbiology laboratories presents problems in detection and identification.

METHODS: The OES questionnaire was culturally adapted to Italian patients in accordance with the literature guidelines with a pilot phase including seven patients with elbow problems and seven healthy subjects. The study includes 110 participants from three hospitals, who underwent elbow surgery for acute (70%) or chronic diseases. At least one month after elbow surgery, at the index visit, the physician completed the Mayo Elbow Performance Index and patients completed the following questionnaires: the Italian OES, the shortened version of the Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (QuickDASH) and the Short-Form 36 Health Survey. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha. Reproducibility was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient in ten patients who completed the OES again two-three days after the index visit. Construct validity was assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients. Responsiveness was evaluated in 68 patients who answered the questionnaires four months after the index visit, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the effect size and the standardized response mean calculation. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha was excellent: 0.86 (0.82-0.90) for OES pain, 0.92 (0.90-0.94) for OES function, and 0.90 (0.87-0.93) for OES social/psychological. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.94 (0.78-0.98) for OES pain, 0.91 (0.71-0.97) for OES function, 0.95 (0.83-0.98) for OES social-psychological and 0.93 (0.76-0.98) for OES total. The Spearman  was >0.7 for OES pain and QuickDASH, for OES function and both QuickDASH and Mayo Elbow Performance Index, and for OES social-psychological and QuickDASH. Regarding responsiveness, the mean of the changes between the two visits ranged from 33.9 for OES pain, to 44 points for OES function and OES social/psychological.

Isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes were collected from scarlet fever patients in central Taiwan and were characterized by emm sequencing and a standardized pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method. National weekly report data were collected for investigating epidemiological trends. RESULTS: A total of 23 emm types were identified in 1,218 S. pyogenes isolates. The five most prevalent emm types were emm12 (50.4%), emm4 (23.2%), emm1 (16.4%), emm6 (3.8%) and emm22 (3.0%). PFGE analysis with SmaI suggested that, with a few exceptions, strains with a common emm type belonged to the same clone. There were two large emm12 clones, one with DNA resistant to cleavage by SmaI. Each prevalent emm clone had major PFGE strain(s) and many minor strains. Most of the minor strains emerged in the population and disappeared soon after. Even some major strains remained prevalent for only 2C3 years before declining. The large fluctuation of scarlet fever cases between 2000 and 2006 was associated with the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones. In 2003, the dramatic drop in scarlet fever cases in central Taiwan and throughout the whole country was associated with the occurrence of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that occurred between late-February and mid-June in Taiwan. CONCLUSION: The occurrences of scarlet fever in central Taiwan in 2000C2006 were primarily caused by five emm types, which accounted for 96.8% of the isolates collected. Most of the S. pyogenes strains (as defined by PFGE genotypes) emerged and lasted for only a few years. The fluctuation in the number of scarlet fever cases during the seven years can be primarily attributed to the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones and to the SARS outbreak in 2003.","output":"Association of the shuffling of Streptococcus pyogenes clones and the fluctuation of scarlet fever cases between 2000 and 2006 in central Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Migration has been a part of the livelihood strategy and risk diversification to relieve crises Food insecurity as a consequence as well as a cause of migration demands review during the COVID-19 pandemic This paper is an attempt to explore the dynamics and vulnerabilities that ensue from the nexus of migration, food security, and COVID-19, as the economic crisis of COVID-19 seems more intensive when viewed through a migration lens The vulnerability of the economy based on food imports and remittances is heightened by COVID-19 The whole nexus of migration and food security has shifted;even the positive aspects of migration are predisposed to vulnerabilities","output":"Conceptualizing the nexus of migration and food security during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whole-sediment toxicity assays contribute to elucidating the intricate association between the presence of contaminants in sediments and their toxicopathic effects in benthic fish.

Liver, brain, gills, and gonads were dissected out and processed to determine markers of oxidative stress, neurotoxicity and lysosomal biomarkers, and histopathology. Analyses of sediment granulometry and chemical profiles indicated different degrees of toxicity and suggested a distinct release of pollutants from each sediment in relation with their physicochemical properties. Interestingly, biological responses were in agreement with contaminant levels reported in source sediments. The most distinct toxicopathic effects were detected upon exposure to the harbour's sediment and particularly on day 28. Overall, enhanced hepatic glutathione-S-transferase activity and lysosomal enlargement were detected in all experimental groups, demonstrating a toxic effect from all sediments whilst catalase inhibition, lysosomal membrane destabilisation, changes in lysosomal content and liver histopathology were most pronounced in soles exposed to the harbour's sediment.

Physiotherapy triage clinics are being utilised to improve access for patients with non-urgent or routine musculoskeletal disorders, to be seen in a timely manner in specialised out-patient clinics. Using these clinics, the aim is to ultimately stratify patients into appropriate management pathways. The aim of our study is to review the effectiveness of a physiotherapy triage clinic run by advanced practitioner physiotherapists (APP), who specialise in the review of upper limb referrals from primary care physicians. METHODS: For this study, a prospective, observational design was used. Patients were referred to the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Upper Limb Service at a national elective Orthopaedic Unit. The patients referrals were reviewed and allocated to a physiotherapy triage pathway if deemed routine, non-urgent cases. After assessment in the APP clinic, the physiotherapist made recommendations and highlighted patients who required review or case discussion with an orthopaedic surgeon. The discharge rate and outcome of patients referred on for further interventions or operative procedures was followed over a 3-year period. The outcomes for the patients were reviewed, including whether patients who met an orthopaedic surgeon went on to have surgical intervention. RESULTS: During the study, 646 patients were reviewed in an upper limb APP physiotherapy triage clinic. Of those reviewed, only 201 patients required review by an orthopaedic surgeon. Of those, 56 patients were scheduled for an operative procedure. Within the 3-year period, 50 patients of those scheduled underwent the procedure. The most commonly performed procedure being an arthroscopic subacromial decompression with or without acromioplasty or rotator cuff repair. A total of 145 patients referred by the physiotherapist had a shoulder injection including subacromial and glenohumeral intra-articular injection. The initial discharge rate was 68%. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high initial discharge rate after initial assessment by APP triage clinics for upper limb musculoskeletal pathology. This is beneficial in alleviating waiting list pressures allowing only those patients in need of intervention to be placed on the ever expanding waiting lists to see orthopaedic surgeons. This study shows a high proportion of patients being offered surgical intervention after being referred by the APP. We conclude from this that the agreement between the physiotherapists initial diagnosis and that of the consultant surgeon being similar in identifying patients who would benefit from operative intervention.","output":"A physiotherapy triage service for orthopaedic upper limb service: an effective way to reduce clinic visits and identify patients for operative intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines whether ethnic minorities in general and Asian minorities in particular have perceived an increase in discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic, a phenomenon known as COVID-19Cassociated discrimination (CAD). Drawing on the CILS4COVID data, which were collected among 3,517 individuals in the initial phase of the pandemic (mainly between April and June 2020), we demonstrate that especially Asian minorities (n = 80) report instances of CAD. Furthermore, CAD is reported more by Asian respondents residing in administrative districts that have been particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., that had high seven-day COVID-19 incidence rates. Higher levels of perceived CAD are also reported by respondents originating from the Americas (n = 61) and the former Soviet Union (n = 197), but only in administrative districts with high incidence rates. We conclude that CAD reported by these groups is likely due to these groups being perceived to pose a higher threat of infection transmission. CAD reported by Asian-origin respondents is not entirely due to the actual threat posed by COVID-19, but rather to a mix of perceived threat, overt discrimination and the attribution of various negative experiences suffered since the outbreak of the pandemic to CAD. ? 2021 The Authors","output":"COVID-19Cassociated discrimination in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Machine learning in the medical area has become a very important requirement.

However, we demonstrated previously that human IFITM2 and IFITM3 are essential host factors facilitating the entry of human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43. In a continuing effort to decipher the molecular mechanism underlying IFITM differential modulation of HCoV entry, we investigated the roles of structural motifs important for IFITM protein posttranslational modifications, intracellular trafficking, and oligomerization in modulating the entry of five HCoVs. We found that three distinct mutations in IFITM1 or IFITM3 converted the host restriction factors to enhance entry driven by the spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and/or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). First, replacement of IFITM3 tyrosine 20 with either alanine or aspartic acid to mimic unphosphorylated or phosphorylated IFITM3 reduced its activity to inhibit the entry of HCoV-NL63 and -229E but enhanced the entry of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Second, replacement of IFITM3 tyrosine 99 with either alanine or aspartic acid reduced its activity to inhibit the entry of HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV but promoted the entry of MERS-CoV. Third, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acid residues from IFITM1 enhanced the entry of MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43. These findings suggest that these residues and structural motifs of IFITM proteins are key determinants for modulating the entry of HCoVs, most likely through interaction with viral and/or host cellular components at the site of viral entry to modulate the fusion of viral envelope and cellular membranes.IMPORTANCE The differential effects of IFITM proteins on the entry of HCoVs that utilize divergent entry pathways and membrane fusion mechanisms even when using the same receptor make the HCoVs a valuable system for comparative investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying IFITM restriction or promotion of virus entry into host cells. Identification of three distinct mutations that converted IFITM1 or IFITM3 from inhibitors to enhancers of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV spike protein-mediated entry revealed key structural motifs or residues determining the biological activities of IFITM proteins. These findings have thus paved the way for further identification of viral and host factors that interact with those structural motifs of IFITM proteins to differentially modulate the infectious entry of HCoVs.","output":"Identification of Residues Controlling Restriction versus Enhancing Activities of IFITM Proteins on Entry of Human Coronaviruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Annually, millions of Muslims embark on a religious pilgrimage called the \\"Hajj\\" to Mecca in Saudi Arabia.

We measured levels of total lymphocytes, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD56+ NK cells and the serum concentrations of interleukin- (IL-) 1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), and interferon gamma (IFN-?3) by flow cytometry. We found that in most postrecovery patients, levels of total lymphocytes (66.67%), CD3+ T cells (54.55%), CD4+ T cells (54.55%), CD8+ T cells (81.82%), CD19+ B cells (69.70%), and CD56+ NK cells (51.52%) remained lower than normal, whereas most patients showed normal levels of IL-2 (100%), IL-4 (80.88%), IL-6 (79.41%), IL-10 (98.53%), TNF-&#945; (89.71%), IFN-?3 (100%), and IL-17 (97.06%). Compared to healthy controls, two-week postrecovery patients had significantly lower absolute numbers of total lymphocytes, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD56+ NK cells, along with significantly higher levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, IFN-?3, and IL-17. Among postrecovery patients, T cells, particularly CD4+ T cells, were positively correlated with CD19+ B cell counts. Additionally, CD8+ T cells were positively correlated with CD4+ T cells and IL-2 levels, and IL-6 positively correlated with TNF-&#945; and IFN-?3. These correlations were not observed in healthy controls. By ROC curve analysis, postrecovery decreases in lymphocyte subsets and increases in cytokines were identified as independent predictors of rehabilitation efficacy. These findings indicate that the immune system gradually recovers following COVID-19 infection; however, the sustained hyperinflammatory response for more than 14 days suggests a need to continue medical observation following discharge from the hospital.

IoT-enabled healthcare has revolutionized healthcare delivery by moving toward a more pervasive, patient-centered, and preventive care model. In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it has also shown a great potential for effective remote patient health monitoring and management, which leads to preventing straining the healthcare system. Nevertheless, due to the heterogeneity of data sources and technologies, IoT-enabled healthcare systems often operate in vertical silos, hampering interoperability across different systems. Consequently, such sensory data are rarely shared nor integrated, which can undermine the full potential of IoT-enabled healthcare. Applying semantic technologies to IoT is a promising approach for fulfilling heterogeneity, contextualization, and situation-awareness requirements for real-time healthcare solutions. However, the enrichment of sensor streams has been under-explored in the existing literature. There is also a need for an ontology that enables effective patient health monitoring and management during infectious disease outbreaks. This study, therefore, aims to extend the existing ontology to allow patient health monitoring for the prevention, early detection, and mitigation of patient deterioration.

However, there are still no effective drugs to treat lung injury and fibrosis. In this study, we report the generation of clinical-grade human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived immunity- and matrix-regulatory cells (IMRCs) produced under good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements, that can treat lung injury and fibrosis in vivo. We generate IMRCs by sequentially differentiating hESCs with serum-free reagents. IMRCs possess a unique gene expression profile distinct from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs), such as higher levels of proliferative, immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic genes. Moreover, intravenous delivery of IMRCs inhibits both pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mouse models of lung injury, and significantly improves the survival rate of the recipient mice in a dose-dependent manner, likely through paracrine regulatory mechanisms. IMRCs are superior to both primary UCMSCs and FDA-approved pirfenidone, with an excellent efficacy and safety profile in mice and monkeys. In light of public health crises involving pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), our findings suggest that IMRCs are ready for clinical trials on lung disorders.","output":"Immunity-and-Matrix-Regulatory Cells Derived from Human Embryonic Stem Cells Safely and Effectively Treat Mouse Lung Injury and Fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The average age of the population has grown steadily in recent decades along with the number of people suffering from chronic diseases and asking for treatments. Hospital care is expensive and often unsafe, especially for older individuals. This is particularly true during pandemics as the recent SARS-CoV-2. Hospitalization at home has become a valuable alternative to face efficiently a huge increase in treatment requests while guaranteeing a high quality of service and lower risk to fragile patients. This new model of care requires the redefinition of health services organization and the optimization of scarce resources (e.g., available nurses). In this paper, we study a Nurse Routing Problem that tries to find a good balance between hospital costs reduction and the well-being of patients, also considering realistic operational restrictions like maximum working times for the nurses and possible incompatibilities between services jointly provided to the same patient. We first propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation for the problem and use some valid inequalities to strengthen it. A simple branch-and-cut algorithm is proposed and validated to derive ground benchmarks. In addition, to efficiently solve the problem, we develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search hybridized with a Kernel Search and validate its performance over a large set of different realistic working scenarios. Computational tests show how our matheuristic approach manages to find good solutions in a reasonable amount of time even in the most difficult settings. Finally, some interesting managerial insights are discussed through an economic analysis of the operating context. ? 2022 The Authors.

These social changes require new smart healthcare services for use in daily life, and COVID-19 has also led to a contactless trend necessitating more non-face-to-face health services. Due to the improvements that have been achieved in healthcare technologies, an increasing number of studies have attempted to predict and analyze certain diseases in advance. Research on stroke diseases is actively underway, particularly with the aging population. Stroke, which is fatal to the elderly, is a disease that requires continuous medical observation and monitoring, as its recurrence rate and mortality rate are very high. Most studies examining stroke disease to date have used MRI or CT images for simple classification. This clinical approach (imaging) is expensive and time-consuming while requiring bulky equipment. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using non-invasive measurable EEGs to compensate for these shortcomings. However, the prediction algorithms and processing procedures are both time-consuming because the raw data needs to be separated before the specific attributes can be obtained. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new methodology that allows for the immediate application of deep learning models on raw EEG data without using the frequency properties of EEG. This proposed deep learning-based stroke disease prediction model was developed and trained with data collected from real-time EEG sensors. We implemented and compared different deep-learning models (LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Bidirectional LSTM) that are specialized in time series data classification and prediction. The experimental results confirmed that the raw EEG data, when wielded by the CNN-bidirectional LSTM model, can predict stroke with 94.0% accuracy with low FPR (6.0%) and FNR (5.7%), thus showing high confidence in our system. These experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of non-invasive methods that can easily measure brain waves alone to predict and monitor stroke diseases in real time during daily life. These findings are expected to lead to significant improvements for early stroke detection with reduced cost and discomfort compared to other measuring techniques.","output":"Deep Learning-Based Stroke Disease Prediction System Using Real-Time Bio Signals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: To perform a systematic literature review and analyze the demographic/biochemical parameters and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and combined DKA/HHS (hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome). METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched till August 3, 2020 to identify studies reporting COVID-19 patients with DKA and combined DKA/HHS. A total of 19 articles reporting 110 patients met the eligibility criteria. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients, 91 (83%) patients had isolated DKA while 19 (17%) had DKA/HHS. The majority of the patients were male (63%) and belonged to black ethnicity (36%). The median age at presentation ranged from 45.5 to 59.0 years. Most of the patients (77%) had pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Only 10% of the patients had newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. The median blood glucose at presentation ranged from 486.0 to 568.5 mg/dl, being higher in patients with DKA/HHS compared to isolated DKA. The volume of fluid replaced in the first 24 h was higher in patients with DKA/HHS in contrast to patients with DKA alone. The in-hospital mortality rate was 45%, with higher mortality in the DKA/HHS group than in the isolated DKA group (67% vs. 29%). pH was lower in patients who had died compared to those who were discharged. CONCLUSION: DKA in COVID-19 patients portends a poor prognosis with a mortality rate approaching 50%. Differentiating isolated DKA from combined DKA/HHS is essential as the latter represents around one-fifth of the DKA cases and tends to have higher mortality than DKA alone.","output":"Clinical profile and outcomes in COVID-19 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: A systematic review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION FOXD2-AS1 is known to promote the development of several cancers. However, its role in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is unclear. METHODS Expression of FOXD2-AS1 and miR-30a-3p in PAAD patients was analyzed with RT-qPCR. A follow-up study was performed to analyze the prognostic value of FOXD2-AS1 for PAAD. Overexpression assays were performed to analyze the crosstalk between FOXD2-AS1 and miR-30a-3p. Cell invasion and migration were analyzed by transwell assays. RESULTS Analysis of the TCGA dataset revealed that FOXD2-AS1 was upregulated in PAAD tissues compared to the non-cancer tissues (1.89 vs. 0.2 TPM), indicating potential involvement of FOXD2-AS1 in PAAD. Our own data also showed FOXD2-AS1 was overexpressed in PAAD. Moreover, high FOXD2-AS1 levels predicted poor survival. It is predicted that miR-30a-3p can bind FOXD2-AS1, while their overexpression did not affect each other's expression. Correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between FOXD2-AS1 and COX-2. In addition, FOXD2-AS1 overexpression increased COX-2 level, while miR-30a-3p played an opposite role. FOXD2-AS1 and COX-2 overexpression increased PAAD cell invasion and migration. MiR-30a-3p played an opposite role and inhibited the effects of FOXD2-AS1 and COX-2 overexpression.

Recently (2019), two extensive reports from preeminent federal authorities - the Chief Public Health Officer and the Mental Health Commission of Canada - have been tabled with detailed, core focus on the phenomenon of 'stigma' and its impacts on substance/opioid use and harms. The reports present extensive descriptions of the nature and effects, as well as a multitude of prescriptions for remedial measures and actions to \\"stop the cycle of stigma\\". Closer reading of the documents, however, suggests substantial conceptual and empirical limitations in the characterization of the - multi-faceted and challenging - nature and workings of 'stigma' as a socio-political, structural or individual process or force, specifically as it applies to and negatively affects substance use and related outcomes, primarily the wellbeing of substance users. Concretely, it is unclear how the remedial actions proposed will materially alleviate stigma process and impacts, especially given apparent gaps in the issues examined, including essential strategies - for example, reform of drug user criminalization as a fundamental element and driver of structural stigma - for action that directly relate to the jurisdictions and privileged mandates of the report sources themselves as health and policy leaders. The commentary provides some concrete while subjective notes and observations on the dynamics of stigma as applies to and framed for substance/opioid use, as well as strategies and measures necessary to both tangibly address the material health and wellbeing of substance users, and related forces of stigma, in the distinct context of the opioid crisis in Canada.","output":"Some notes on the use, concept and socio-political framing of 'stigma' focusing on an opioid-related public health crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.5334/gh.823.].","output":"Correction: Management of Cardiovascular Disease Patients With Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19 in Limited Resource Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viral infections threaten human life and inflict an enormous healthcare burden worldwide.

METHODS: An electronic search was carried out in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct, as well as in medRxiv preprint server, to identify eligible studies. Only randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) that compared mortality events and/or adverse events between a tocilizumab + SOC group and a SOC-only control group were included. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes include progression to severe disease, defined as need for mechanical ventilation (MV) or intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and adverse events (AE). RESULTS: A total of nine studies (6,490 participants) could be included in this meta-analysis, with 3,358 participants in the tocilizumab + SOC group and 3,132 participants in the SOC-only group. The overall mortality rate was lower in the tocilizumab group compared to the SOC-only group, though the difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio [OR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73-1.04; I(2), 15%). This finding was unaffected by subgroup analyses based on initial use of steroids or mechanical ventilation at baseline. Patients receiving tocilizumab were 26% less likely to progress to MV, and this difference was statistically significant (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.86; I(2), 0%). Among patients who were not in ICU at randomization, the tocilizumab group had 34 % lower rate of ICU admission compared to the SOC-only group (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.40-2.14; I(2), 29%). The occurrence of serious infections was lower in the tocilizumab group (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.89; I(2), 21%). CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab is generally well-tolerated in COVID-19.

We then conduct the first study on the differences in smartphone usage across the outbreak of Covid-19. We discover that Covid-19 leads to a decrease in users&#x2019;smartphone engagement and network switches, but an increase in WiFi usage. Also, its outbreak causes new typical diurnal patterns of both memory usage and WiFi usage. Additionally, we investigate the correlations between smartphone usage and daily confirmed cases of Covid-19. The results reveal that memory usage, WiFi usage, and network switches of smartphones have significant correlations, whose absolute values of Pearson coefficients are greater than 0.8. Moreover, smartphone usage behavior has the strongest correlation with the Covid-19 cases occurring after it, which exhibits the potential of inferring outbreak status. By conducting extensive experiments, we demonstrate that for the inference of outbreak stages, both Macro-F1 and Micro-F1 can achieve over 0.8.

ACE2 receptor is majorly expressed in brush border of gut enterocytes along with the ciliated cells and alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs. The amino acid transport function of ACE2 has been linked to gut microbial ecology in gastrointestinal (GI) tract, thereby suggesting that COVID-19 may, to some level, be linked to the enteric microbiota.

METHODS Recently diagnosed HIV-infected MSM attending one major HIV specialist clinic in Hong Kong were recruited in the study involving the administration of a self-administered questionnaire on behaviours and partnership patterns using a Likert Scale, the results of which were assessed using social network analysis and in context of the phylogenetic analysis from sequencing the HIV-1 pol gene, as part of the clinical investigation for genotypic resistance. Clusters were defined using social and molecular methods. RESULTS An 'Internet-centred' cluster and 'Sauna-centred' cluster could be delineated using correspondence analysis and network diagrams. The main distinguishing features of MSM in the 'Internet-centred' social cluster were: younger age, higher education level, and multiple partner types. Three genetic clusters could be identified in the phylogenetic tree, two of which associated with Internet use and one with sauna for sex partnership. There were partial overlaps between social and genetic clusters. Characteristically, the virus strains in sauna users were more disperse compared with the closely knit configuration of those using Internet. CONCLUSION The principle of the duality of place and person can be strategically applied in epidemiologic investigation.

In the context of the CANNA-TICS trial, investigating the effect of nabiximols on reducing the total tic score of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS-TTS) in patients with chronic tic disorders and Tourette syndrome, the impact of the two COVID-19 related intercurrent events handled by a treatment policy strategy is investigated using a multiplicative and additive data generating model. The empirical power is examined for the analysis of the YGTSS-TTS as a continuous and dichotomized endpoint using analysis techniques adjusted and unadjusted for the occurrence of the intercurrent event. In the investigated scenarios, the simulation studies showed that substantial power losses are possible, potentially making sample size increases necessary to retain sufficient power. However, we were also able to identify scenarios with only limited loss of power. By adjusting for the occurrence of the intercurrent event, the power loss could be diminished to different degrees in most scenarios. In summary, the presented risk assessment approach may support decisions on trial modifications like sample size increases, while maintaining trial integrity.","output":"Potential impact of COVID-19 on ongoing clinical trials: a simulation study with the neurological Yale Global Tic Severity Scale based on the CANNA-TICS study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The presence of asymptomatic people exacerbates the widespread of COVID-19 transmission the majority of them come from young people.

Palmitate, a lipotoxic saturated fatty acid, activates hepatocellular endoplasmic reticulum stress, which has been demonstrated to be important in NASH pathogenesis, including in the release of EVs. We have previously demonstrated that the release of palmitate-stimulated EVs is dependent on the de novo synthesis of ceramide, which is trafficked by the ceramide transport protein, STARD11. The trafficking of ceramide is a critical step in the release of lipotoxic EVs, as cells deficient in STARD11 do not release palmitate-stimulated EVs. Here, we examined the hypothesis that protein cargoes are trafficked to lipotoxic EVs in a ceramide-dependent manner. We performed quantitative proteomic analysis of palmitate-stimulated EVs in control and STARD11 knockout hepatocyte cell lines. Proteomics was performed on EVs isolated by size exclusion chromatography, ultracentrifugation, and density gradient separation, and EV proteins were measured by mass spectrometry. We also performed human EV proteomics from a control and a NASH plasma sample, for comparative analyses with hepatocyte-derived lipotoxic EVs. Size exclusion chromatography yielded most unique EV proteins. Ceramide-dependent lipotoxic EVs contain damage-associated molecular patterns and adhesion molecules. Haptoglobin, vascular non-inflammatory molecule-1, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein complex acid labile subunit were commonly detected in NASH and hepatocyte-derived ceramide-dependent EVs.

Here we report on a cohort of 63 individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 assessed at 1.3, 6.2 and 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, 41% of whom also received mRNA vaccines(3,4). In the absence of vaccination, antibody reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing activity and the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remain relatively stable between 6 and 12 months after infection. Vaccination increases all components of the humoral response and, as expected, results in serum neutralizing activities against variants of concern similar to or greater than the neutralizing activity against the original Wuhan Hu-1 strain achieved by vaccination of naive individuals(2,5C8). The mechanism underlying these broad-based responses involves ongoing antibody somatic mutation, memory B cell clonal turnover and development of monoclonal antibodies that are exceptionally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations, including those found in the variants of concern(4,9). In addition, B cell clones expressing broad and potent antibodies are selectively retained in the repertoire over time and expand markedly after vaccination.

However, point-of-care (POC) assays are frequently used in emergency departments (EDs) to reduce turnaround time and length of stay. This study aimed to compare the results of POC-cTnI testing with those of the gold standard, automated central laboratory testing of troponin (i.e., hs-cTnI). The primary and secondary outcomes were the diagnostic performance of POC-cTnI in diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) during 30 days, respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this diagnostic accuracy study, 136 patients with suspected ACS who were referred or admitted to the Al Zahra Hospital, Shiraz, Iran, were included between March (2020) and July (2020). For the diagnosis of AMI, central laboratory cTnI levels were assessed at the time of presentation (0 hour) and reassessed at least 3 hours later. The POC-cTnI was measured at 0 hour in all patients and at 3 hours if a patient was diagnosed with AMI but had a 0-hour negative result for the POC-cTnI assay. Additionally, the 30-day follow-up period for these participants began on the day of the initial presentation to assess MACE. RESULTS: Out of 180 patients, 136 patients (median age of 59.5 years; 57.5% male) were left for the qualitative POC-cTnI and hs-cTnI assays. In 86 (63.24%) subjects, hs-cTnI was positive (either initial or serial); however, AMI was diagnosed in 85 patients according to positivity of troponin by hs-cTnI and clinical signs and symptoms, which were diagnosed by a cardiologist. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of 0-hour POC-cTnI were observed to be 91.76% (95% CI: 83.77C96.62%), 98.04% (95% CI: 89.55C99.95%), and 87.72% (95% CI: 77.82C93.56%), respectively. Moreover, considering both the 0-hour and 3-hour POC-cTnI, all AMI cases were correctly identified, yielding a perfect test performance result. None of the 50 patients with negative cTnI results (by 0-hour and 3-hour POC-cTnI and hs-cTnI) experienced at least one MACE.

Patients with severe disease course/intubated had higher levels of Aspartate Transaminase (AST) (109.17 vs 53.97, P=0.018), Alanine Transaminase (ALT) (79.53 vs 40.03, P=0.02) and total bilirubin (0.82 vs 0.60, P=0.03) vs non-intubated patents as well as body temperature (101.38 vs 100.70, p=0.0006), CRP (24.06 v 15.96, P=0.019) and lactate (3.28 vs 2.13, P=0.009). There was no correlation between severity of the disease and GI symptoms, PT, platelets and albumin. However, CRP and lactate were markedly elevated in deceased vs survived patients: (27.09 vs 16.39, P=0.008) and (3.33 vs 2.10 P=0.005) respectively. Conclusions ~ 50% of patients presented with GI symptoms and they had lower levels of inflammatory markers, better liver synthetic function, indicating less overall inflammatory response and direct viral damage. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 virus targets GI tract along with the lung tissue, and the degree of hepatocyte damage correlated well with more severe disease.","output":"Gastrointestinal manifestations in American minority population with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study was to elucidate the kinetics and magnitudes of specific IgA antibody responses in intestines of turkey poults infected with turkey coronavirus (TCV). Turkey poults were orally inoculated with TCV at 10 days of age. Intestinal segment cultures were administered for duodenum, jejunum, and ileum and the IgA antibody responses were analyzed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 9 weeks post-infection (PI) in two different experiments. The kinetics of virus-specific IgA antibody responses in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were similar: gradually increased from 1 week PI, reached the peak at 3 or 4 weeks PI, and declined afterward. The virus-specific IgA antibody responses in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum showed negative correlation with duration of TCV antigen in the corresponding locations of intestine with Spearmans correlation coefficient of ?0.85 (p=0.034), ?0.74 (p=0.096), and ?0.75 (p=0.084), respectively. Moreover, the virus-specific IgA antibody responses in serum were positively correlated with that of duodenum (coefficient=0.829, p=0.042), jejunum (coefficient=0.829, p=0.042), and ileum (coefficient=0.771, p=0.072) segment cultures, suggesting that the induction of specific IgA response in serum was predictive of an IgA response in intestine.

High sensitivity, incredible miniaturization capability, promising extremely low minimum limit of detection (LoD) at the molecular level, integration with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and last but not least label-free operation were amongst the predominant motives for highlighting these sensors in the biosensor community. Although there are various diseases targeted by FET sensors for detection, infectious diseases are still the most demanding sector that needs higher precision in detection and integration for the realization of the diagnosis at the point of care (PoC). The COVID-19 pandemic, nevertheless, was an example of the escalated situation in terms of worldwide desperate need for fast, specific and reliable home test PoC devices for the timely screening of huge numbers of people to restrict the disease from further spread. This need spawned a wave of innovative approaches for early detection of COVID-19 antibodies in human swab or blood amongst which the FET biosensing gained much more attention due to their extraordinary LoD down to femtomolar (fM) with the comparatively faster response time. As the FET sensors are promising novel PoC devices with application in early diagnosis of various diseases and especially infectious diseases, in this research, we have reviewed the recent progress on developing FET sensors for infectious diseases diagnosis accompanied with a thorough discussion on the structure of Chem/BioFET sensors and the readout circuitry for output signal processing.

RESULTS: Of the 81 patients studied [64 (79.01%) men], acute PTE was identified in 22 (27.16%), bilaterally in 13 (59.09%), and 13 (59,09%) showed areas of hypoperfusion. Of the 59 (72.83%) patients without PTE, hypoperfusion was observed in 41 (69.49%) (attributable in one case to pulmonary emphysema). In 18 (22.2%) of the total number of patients, neither PTE nor hypoperfusion were seen. A crazy paving pattern is a risk factor for developing PTE (OR 1.94; 95% CI 0.28-13.57), as are consolidations (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.24-8.48) and septal thickening/bronchiectasis (OR 1.47; 95% CI 0.12-17.81).

At present, the administration of rabies vaccines has been the most effective strategy to control rabies. Herein, we evaluate the effect of colloidal manganese salt (Mn jelly, MnJ) as an adjuvant of rabies vaccine in mice, cats, and dogs. The results showed that MnJ promoted type I interferon (IFN-I) and cytokine production in vitro and the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro and in vivo. Besides, MnJ serving as an adjuvant for rabies vaccines could significantly facilitate the generation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, germinal center (GC) B cells, plasma cells (PCs), and RABV-specific antibody-secreting-cells (ASCs), consequently improved the immunogenicity of rabies vaccines and provide better protection against virulent RABV challenge. Similarly, MnJ enhanced the humoral immune response in cats and dogs as well. Collectively, our results suggest that MnJ can facilitate the maturation of DCs during rabies vaccination, which can be a promising adjuvant candidate for rabies vaccines. IMPORTANCE Extending humoral immune response by using adjuvants is an important strategy for vaccine development. In this study, a novel adjuvant MnJ supplemented in rabies vaccines was evaluated in mice, cats, and dogs. Our results in the mouse model revealed that MnJ increased the numbers of mature DCs, Tfh cells, GC B cells, PCs, and RABV-specific ASCs, resulting in enhanced immunogenicity and protection rate of rabies vaccines.

METHODS: The present study retrospectively collected a dataset of 367 glioma patients, who had pathological reports and underwent MRI scans between October 2013 and March 2019. The radiomic features were extracted from enhanced MRI images, and three frequently-used machine-learning models of LC, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) were built for four predictive tasks: (1) glioma grades, (2) Ki67 expression level, (3) GFAP expression level, and (4) S100 expression level in gliomas. Each sub dataset was split into training and testing sets at a ratio of 4:1. The training sets were used for training and tuning models. The testing sets were used for evaluating models. According to the area under curve (AUC) and accuracy, the best classifier was chosen for each task. RESULTS: The RF algorithm was found to be stable and consistently performed better than Logistic Regression and SVM for all the tasks. The RF classifier on glioma grades achieved a predictive performance (AUC: 0.79, accuracy: 0.81). The RF classifier also achieved a predictive performance on the Ki67 expression (AUC: 0.85, accuracy: 0.80). The AUC and accuracy score for the GFAP classifier were 0.72 and 0.81. The AUC and accuracy score for S100 expression levels are 0.60 and 0.91.

The aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate the efficacy of 2 preprocedural mouthrinses in the reduction of salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load and to compare the results of the mouthwashes to a control group. Materials and Methods. In this randomized-controlled clinical trial, studied group comprised laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive patients through nasopharyngeal swabs. Participants were divided into 3 groups. For 30 seconds, the control group mouthrinsed with distilled water, the Chlorhexidine group mouthrinsed with 0.2% Chlorhexidine and the Povidone-iodine group gargled with 1% Povidone-iodine. Saliva samples were collected before and 5 minutes after mouthwash. SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR was then performed for each sample. Evaluation of the efficacy was based on difference in cycle threshold (Ct) value. The analysis of data was carried out using GraphPad Prism version 5 for Windows. Kristal wullis and Paired t test were used. A probability value of less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results. Sixty-one compliant participants (36 female and 25 male) with a mean age 45.3  16.7 years-old were enrolled. A significant difference was noted between the delta Ct of distilled water wash and each of the 2 solutions Chlorhexidine 0.2% (p = 0.0024) and 1 % Povidone-iodine (p = 0.012). No significant difference was found between the delta Ct of patients using Chlorhexidine 0.2% and 1% Povidone-iodine solutions (p = 0.24).

Pts with <1 year database history, with no tx 0-90 days before index, <18 years old, with implausible death dates, and with index dates outside of 02/2020 - 11/2020 were excluded. C19 positive and negative pts were exact-matched on cancer type, then 1:1 nearest-neighbor matched on propensity scores (variables in table). Missing values were imputed (n = 5), and outcomes were evaluated by multivariable logistic regression, including interaction terms between tx and C19 positivity. Results: We identified 21,060 pts, of whom 1,636 (7.8%) were positive for C19 and 19,424 (92.2%) negative. Among 1,636 matched pairs of positive/negative C19 pts, the odds ratio (OR) of 30-day mortality comparing C19 positive vs negative patients was 2.14 (95% CI: 0.71 C 6.52).

Whole genome sequencing was performed for some samples. The R.1 variant (B.1.1.316) was responsible for most infections in March, replacing the previous variant (B.1.1.214); the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant caused most infections in April and May; and the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was the most prevalent in July and August. There was no significant difference in the copy numbers among the previous variant cases (n = 29, median 3.0  10(4) copies/l), R.1 variant cases (n = 28, 2.1  10(5) copies/l), Alpha variant cases (n = 125, 4.1  10(5) copies/l), and Delta variant cases (n = 106, 2.4  10(5) copies/l).

The present study aims to determine whether miR-129 is involved in the protective effect of Dex against A?1-42-induced hippocampal neuron apoptosis and cognitive impairment in mice. In our study, Y-shaped maze and water maze tests were conducted to evaluate the cognitive function of AD mice, while neuronal apoptosis was measured by Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-Mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) staining. The findings showed that Dex administration resulted in the enhancement of miR-129 expression with declined hippocampal neuron apoptosis and attenuated cognitive impairment in A?1-42-injected mice. miR-129 targeted YAP1 and disrupted its interaction with JAG1, leading to a decline in hippocampal neuron apoptosis and attenuated cognitive impairment in A?1-42-injected mice. In conclusion, the miR-129/YAP1/JAG1 axis could potentially be the mechanism by which Dex protects AD mice from cognitive impairment.","output":"Dexmedetomidine Provides Protection Against Hippocampal Neuron Apoptosis and Cognitive Impairment in Mice with Alzheimer's Disease by Mediating the miR-129/YAP1/JAG1 Axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a lethal virus outbreak by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has severely affected human lives and the global economy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We trained one head in the multi-head self-attention model to attend to the Medical evidence Ddependency (MD) and to pass linguistic and domain knowledge on to later layers (MD informed). This MD-informed attention model was integrated into BioBERT and tested on 2 public machine reading comprehension benchmarks for clinical trial publications: Evidence Inference 2.0 and PubMedQA. We also curated a small set of recently published articles reporting randomized controlled trials on COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) following the Evidence Inference 2.0 guidelines to evaluate the model's robustness to unseen data. RESULTS: The integration of MD-informed attention head improves BioBERT substantially in both benchmark tasks-as large as an increase of +30% in the F1 score-and achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on the Evidence Inference 2.0. It achieves 84% and 82% in overall accuracy and F1 score, respectively, on the unseen COVID-19 data.

Transanal endoscopic surgery (TES) might allow for local treatment of these complications, thereby saving patients from otherwise major surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS All patients undergoing TES in the IJsselland Hospital (NL) since 1996 were recorded in a prospective database, of which twenty patients were treated for complications after previous rectal surgery. Data on prior treatment, surgical techniques, outcomes, and need for additional surgery were collected. RESULTS Twenty patients were identified from the database (rectourinary fistula n = 3, rectovaginal fistula n = 5, anastomotic stricture n = 8, and rectal stenosis n = 4). One of the three (33 %) rectourinary fistulas and two of five (40 %) rectovaginal fistulas were successfully treated with TES. Anastomotic strictures were successfully treated in 5/8 (63 %) patients. Strictures after local excision of rectal tumors were successfully treated in 3/4 (75 %) patients. No minor complication and one major complication occurred (rectovaginal fistula after stenoplasty eventually requiring Hartmann's procedure). CONCLUSIONS Transanal treatment of anastomotic strictures, rectal stenosis, and fistula after prior rectal surgery is safe and effective in a large proportion of patients.

Hence, we sought to determine the existence of any chronic endocrine sequelae in SARS survivors. DESIGN, PATIENTS, MEASUREMENTS Sixty-one survivors of SARS prospectively recruited were analysed for hormonal derangements 3 months following recovery. Patients with pre-existing endocrine disorders were excluded. Any endocrine abnormalities diagnosed were investigated and treated where indicated up to a year. Serial evaluation facilitated characterization of trends and prognostication of any endocrinological aberrations. RESULTS Twenty-four (39.3%) patients had evidence of hypocortisolism. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction of the majority resolved within a year. Two (3.3%) of the hypocortisolic cohort had transient subclinical thyrotoxicosis. Four (6.7%) were biochemically hypothyroid, being comprised of three with central hypothyroidism and one with primary hypothyroidism. Two of the three with central hypothyroidism had concomitant central hypocortisolism. Eight had subnormal DHEAS levels.

The majority of the world's children were out of school, leading to the longest sustained period of school closures in history. We saw educators turning towards responses not aimed at collegial and community-engaged strategies for education in an emergency but at online learning cast as education/business as usual. This study explores the logic driving this global response through analyses of the documents released by three key global education actors: (1) the OECD and its paper A Framework to Guide Education Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020; (2) UNESCO's Global Education Coalition #LearningNeverStops; and (3) the World Bank's Guidance Note on Education Systems' Response to COVID-19; and Guidance Note: Remote Learning and COVID-19. The authors of this article draw on Carol Bacchi's approach to poststructural policy analysis to make visible the key concepts and binaries used within policy texts and to understand the \\"technologies of saving\\" that were invoked in each policy response, locating the education programmes, activities and actors within knowledge practices in educational reform. This article explores the World Bank, OECD and UNESCO responses using an analysis of knowledge harmonisation and difference among these institutions as well as their location as key norm-setters and governing actors in the field of education. The authors argue that all three responses privilege private-sector providers of digital technology. The consequence of these responses is that technologies of saving have centred on privatised, corporate edu-business and edu-tech aimed at online education delivery, bringing significant risks for the erasure of local knowledges. The authors' study suggests that local policymakers, including community-based and national actors, must be invited into the discussion to envision other possibilities and to name the potential destructiveness embedded in the international organisations' actions.","output":"What are we saving?

Vaccinations aim to stimulate these responses against pathogens. Several studies have evaluated the impact of multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapies on immune response to vaccines. Findings from these studies have important implications for people with multiple sclerosis who require vaccination and are using disease-modifying therapies. METHODS: Searches using PubMed and other engines were conducted in May 2020 to collect studies evaluating the impact of various disease-modifying therapies on immune responses to vaccination. RESULTS: Several studies demonstrated preserved immune responses in people treated with beta-interferons to multiple vaccine types. Limited data suggest vaccine responses to be preserved with dimethyl fumarate treatment, as well. Vaccine responses were reduced to varying degrees in those treated with glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, and natalizumab. The timing of vaccination played an important role in those treated with alemtuzumab. Humoral vaccine responses were significantly impaired by B cell depleting anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapies, particularly to a neoantigen. Data are lacking on vaccine responses in patients with multiple sclerosis taking cladribine and high-dose corticosteroids. Notably, the majority of these studies have focused on humoral responses, with few examining cellular immune responses to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Prior investigations into the effects of individual disease-modifying therapies on immune responses to existing vaccines can serve as a guide to expected responses to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Responses to any vaccination depend on the vaccine type, the type of response (recall versus response to a novel antigen), and the impact of the individual disease-modifying therapy on humoral and cellular immunity in response to that vaccine type. When considering a given therapy, clinicians should weigh its efficacy against MS for the individual patient versus potential impact on responses to vaccinations that may be needed in the future.","output":"Effects of MS disease-modifying therapies on responses to vaccinations: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last few months, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide and has provoked an exceptional effort from the scientific community to understand the disease.

We analyzed the effects of various air outlet positions on the removal efficiency of infectious droplets in isolation room and proposed the optimum location of exhaust vent in hospital isolation room to maximize the droplet removal efficiencies. We found that the evaporation rate of droplets is strongly dependent on the relative humidity (RH) and, at low RH, the large-sized droplets with Covid-19 virus can evaporate quickly and become small-sized aerosols to stay in air for a long time and the Covid-19 can propagate more easily through the respiratory organs during breathing.

Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya, is among the largest informal settlements in SSA, and has been part of ambitious programs to improve quality-of-life conditions for residents. This chapter explores one initiative involving a partnership of the Kenyan Government, UN-Habitat, a local NGO called Maji na Ufanisi, and community-based leadership groups. The program was part of a slum upgrading initiative called the Soweto East Project and relied heavily on community engagement to build trust, encourage active participation and define community concerns. Priorities included water supply, sanitation and waste management, but also an access road, a community resource centre and capacity building activities. We describe the mechanisms used to cultivate community engagement, the problems that emerged and the successes that followed. We conclude that environmentally sustainable and socially acceptable enhancements in informal settlements will require both a strong commitment from within the community and sustained support from outside institutions. The innovations that were a part of this program provide evidence of strategies that yield positive outcomes.","output":"Partnerships for Successes in Slum Upgrading: Local Governance and Social Change in Kibera, Nairobi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses rely on their host for reproduction. Here, we made use of genomic and structural information to create a biomass function capturing the amino and nucleic acid requirements of SARS-CoV-2. Incorporating this biomass function into a stoichiometric metabolic model of the human lung cell and applying metabolic flux balance analysis, we identified host-based metabolic perturbations inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 reproduction. Our results highlight reactions in the central metabolism, as well as amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways. By incorporating host cellular maintenance into the model based on available protein expression data from human lung cells, we find that only few of these metabolic perturbations are able to selectively inhibit virus reproduction. Some of the catalysing enzymes of such reactions have demonstrated interactions with existing drugs, which can be used for experimental testing of the presented predictions using gene knockouts and RNA interference techniques. In summary, the developed computational approach offers a platform for rapid, experimentally testable generation of drug predictions against existing and emerging viruses based on their biomass requirements.","output":"Inhibiting the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 through perturbations in human lung cell metabolic network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible relationships between pre-existing medical conditions (including common comorbidities and chronic medications) and risk for suffering COVID-19 disease in middle-aged and older adults. DESIGN: Population-based retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Twelve primary care centres (PCCs) in Tarragona (Spain). PARTICIPANTS: 79 083 people (77 676 community-dwelling and 1407 nursing-home residents), who were all individuals aged >50 years affiliated to the 12 participating PCCs. OUTCOMES: Baseline cohort characteristics (age, sex, vaccinations, comorbidities and chronic medications) were established at study start (1st. March 2020) and primary outcome was time to COVID-19 confirmed by PCR among cohort members throughout the epidemic period (from 1st. March 2020 to 23rd. May 2020). Risk for suffering COVID-19 was evaluated by Cox regression, estimating multivariable HRs adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities and medications use. RESULTS: During the study period, 2324 cohort members were PCR-tested, with 1944 negative and 380 positive results, which means an incidence of 480.5 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100 000 persons-period. Assessing the total study cohort, only age (HR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03; p=0.002), nursing-home residence (HR 21.83; 95% CI 16.66 to 28.61; p<0.001) and receiving diuretics (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.76; p=0.026) appeared independently associated with increased risk. Smoking (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.93; p=0.022), ACE inhibitors (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.99; p=0.046) and antihistamine (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.01; p=0.052) were associated with a lower risk. Among community-dwelling individuals, cancer (HR 1.52; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.24; p=0.035), chronic respiratory disease (HR 1.82; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.07; p=0.025) and cardiac disease (HR 1.53; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.19; p=0.021) emerged to be also associated with an increased risk.

The largest share of the power consumption is required by the hydraulic system during idling operations, and, consequently, the current literature focuses on energy saving strategies for the hydraulic system rather than making the vehicle traction more efficient. This study presents the preliminary realization of an electric-powered hydraulic pump system (e-HPS) that drives the lifting of the dumpster and the garbage compaction in a waste compactor truck, rather than traditional ICE-driven hydraulic pump systems (ICE-HPSs). The different components of the e-HPS are described and the battery pack was modelled using the kinetic battery model. The end-of-life of the battery pack was determined to assess the economic feasibility of the proposed e-HPS for the truck lifespan, using numerical simulations. The aim was twofold: to provide an implementation method to retrofit the e-HPS to a conventional waste compactor truck and to assess its economic feasibility, investigating fuel savings during the use phase and the consequent reduction of CO2 emissions. Results show that the total lifespan cost saving achieved a value of 65,000 . Furthermore, total CO2 emissions for the e-HPS were about 80% lower than those of the ICE-HPS, highlighting that the e-HPS can provide significant environmental benefits in an urban context.","output":"Preliminary Realization of an Electric-Powered Hydraulic Pump System for a Waste Compactor Truck and a Techno-Economic Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal anastomotic complications represent serious events; methods to evaluate anastomotic integrity seem to be suboptimal. Since endoscopic intraoperative anastomotic testing allows direct visualization of anastomosis, complication rates may be theoretically reduced by the use of this technique. METHODS A prospective study involving 118 consecutive oncologic patients undergoing endoscopically tested gastrointestinal stapled anastomoses was carried out. As controls, 148 historical patients without anastomotic testing were used for comparisons. RESULTS In the study group, anastomotic testing revealed 16 defects: 11 (9.3%) air leaks and five (4.3%) bleeding anastomoses. All leaks were oversewn and secured. Bleeding anastomoses were managed under direct visualization, and one non-patent anastomosis was redone. Forty-one (15.4%) postoperative anastomotic complications were observed: eight (3%) bleeding anastomoses, seven (2.6%) stenoses, and 26 (9.8%) clinical leaks. No early dehiscence or bleeding occurred if anastomoses were intraoperatively checked, while these complications were significantly more frequent in non-checked anastomoses (6.1% and 5.4%, respectively). Conversely, late leak and stenosis rates were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION Endoscopic anastomotic testing was a safe and reliable method to assess integrity of gastrointestinal anastomoses, to correct any defect under direct visualization, and to avoid early complications.

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively explore the value of high-fidelity simulators in an exercise that incorporates time and resource limitation as an optimal method of training health care personnel in mass-casualty care. METHODS Mass-casualty injury patterns from an explosive blast event were simulated for 12 victims using high-fidelity computerized simulators (HFCS). Programmed outcomes, based on the nature of injuries and conduct of participants, ranged from successful resuscitation and survival to death. The training exercise was conducted five times with different teams of health care personnel (n = 42). The exercise involved limited time and resources such as blood, ventilators, and imaging capability. Medical team performance was observed and recorded. Following the exercise, participants completed a survey regarding their training satisfaction, quality of the exercise, and their prior experiences with MCI simulations. The Likert scale responses from the survey were evaluated using mean with 95% confidence interval, as well as median and inter-quartile range. For the categorical responses, the frequency, proportions, and associated 95% confidence interval were calculated. RESULTS The mean rating on the quality of experiences related trainee survey questions (n = 42) was between 4.1 and 4.6 on a scale of 5.0. The mean ratings on a scale of 10.0 for quality, usefulness, and pertinence of the program were 9.2, 9.5, and 9.5, respectfully. One hundred percent of respondents believed that this type of exercise should be required for MCI training and would recommend this exercise to colleagues. The five medical team (n = 5) performances resulted in the number of deaths ranging from two (including the expectant victims) to six. Eighty percent of medical teams attempted to resuscitate the \\"expectant\\" infant and exhausted the O- blood supply. Sixty percent of medical teams depleted the supply of ventilators.

Normally, most undifferentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs) face the apical (ventricular) surface of embryonic brain walls. Pathological detachment of NPCs from the apical surface and their invasion of outer neuronal territories, i.e., formation of NPC heterotopias, can disrupt the overall structure of the brain. Although NPC heterotopias have previously been observed in a variety of experimental contexts, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Yes-associated protein 1 (Yap1) and the TEA domain (Tead) proteins, which act downstream of Hippo signaling, enhance the stem-like characteristics of NPCs. Elevated expression of Yap1 or Tead in the neural tube (future spinal cord) induces massive NPC heterotopias, but Yap/Tead-induced expansion of NPCs in the developing brain has not been previously reported to produce NPC heterotopias. To determine whether NPC heterotopias occur in a regionally characteristic manner, we introduced the Yap1-S112A or Tead-VP16 into NPCs of the telencephalon and diencephalon, two neighboring but distinct forebrain regions, of embryonic day 10 mice by in utero electroporation, and compared NPC heterotopia formation. Although NPCs in both regions exhibited enhanced stem-like behaviors, heterotopias were larger and more frequent in the diencephalon than in the telencephalon. This result, the first example of Yap/Tead-induced NPC heterotopia in the forebrain, reveals that Yap/Tead-induced NPC heterotopia is not specific to the neural tube, and also suggests that this phenomenon depends on regional factors such as the three-dimensional geometry and assembly of these cells.","output":"Neural Progenitor Cells Undergoing Yap/Tead-Mediated Enhanced Self-Renewal Form Heterotopias More Easily in the Diencephalon than in the Telencephalon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza A virus may circulate simultaneously with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leading to more serious respiratory diseases during this winter.

Vitamin B12 is a poor predictor of functional vitamin B12 status, since deficiencies might even occur within the reference limits. Therefore, vitamin B12 deficiencies with serum vitamin B12 levels are between 140 and 200 pmol/L remain undetected. Methylmalonic acid (MMA), however, will detect these deficiencies as accumulates due to functional intracellular vitamin B12 deficiencies. MMA is a relative expensive analysis and is therefore not generally available. To lower the costs, we only request MMA when vitamin B12 levels are between these levels. As a result, more biochemical deficiencies are found. However, it was not known whether bariatric patients with vitamin B12 levels between 140 and 200 pmol/L would benefit from supplementation. METHOD Bariatric patients with vitamin B12 levels between 140 and 200 pmol/L with (n = 45) and without (n = 45) intramuscular hydroxocobalamin injections were compared. RESULTS Treated patients showed a significant increase of vitamin B12 levels (P < 0.001) and a significant decrease in MMA levels (P < 0.001). Biochemical improvement occurs in both patients with and without clinical symptoms. The control group showed a significant increase of MMA levels (P < 0.001). To examine whether biochemical benefits of vitamin B12 supplementation are correlated with clinical improvement, patient records were checked for complaints.

OBJECTIVE: To compare in-hospital morbidity, mortality, and inflammatory marker levels between Black and White hospitalized COVID-19 patients. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center retrospective cohort study analyzed data for Black and White patients aged 18 years hospitalized with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test between March 1, 2020, and August 4, 2020. MAIN MEASURES: The exposure was self-identified race documented in the medical record. The primary outcome of was in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit admission, hospital morbidities, and inflammatory marker levels. KEY RESULTS: A total of 1,424 Black and White patients were identified. The mean  SD age was 56.1  17.4 years, and 663 (44.5%) were female. There were 683 (48.0%) Black and 741 (52.0%) White patients. In the univariate analysis, Black patients had longer hospital stays (8.1  10.2 vs. 6.7  8.3 days, p = 0.011) and tended to have higher rates of in-hospital death (11.0% vs. 7.3%), myocardial infarction (6.9% vs. 4.5%), pulmonary embolism (PE; 5.0% vs. 2.3%), and acute kidney injury (AKI; 39.4% vs. 23.1%) than White patients (p <0.05). However, after adjusting for potential confounders, only PE (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.07, 95% CI, 1.13C3.79) and AKI (aOR 2.16, 95% CI, 1.57C2.97) were statistically significantly associated with Black race. In comparison with White patients, Black patients had statistically significantly higher peak plasma D-dimer (standardized  = 0.10), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (standardized  = 0.13), ferritin (standardized  = 0.09), and lactate dehydrogenase (standardized  = 0.11), after adjusting for potential confounders (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Black hospitalized COVID-19 patients had increased risks of developing PE and AKI and higher inflammatory marker levels compared with White patients. This observation may be explained by differences in the prevalence and severity of underlying comorbidities and other unmeasured biologic risk factors between Black and White patients. Future research is needed to investigate the mechanism of these observed differences in outcomes of severe COVID-19 infection in Black versus White patients.

Incorporating video-conferencing applications in the patient handover process between healthcare workers can enhance social distancing while maintaining handover elements. This study describes pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) physicians' experience of using an online video-conferencing application for handover during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: qualitative content analysis Setting: PICU at a university hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Subjects: PICU Physicians Interventions: Due to the pandemic, the hospital's PICU used Zoom as a remote conferencing application, instead of a face-to-face handover. Following institutional review board approval, data were collected over two weeks (July 1, 2020 to July 14, 2020). Measurements: Demographic data and narrative descriptions of the perceived efficacy of remote handover were collected using open-ended questions through a created online link. The analysis process included open coding, creating categories, and abstraction. Main Results: All 37 PICU physicians who participated in the handover completed the survey. The participants comprised six attendings, nine specialists, and 22 residents. They had variable previous teleconferencing experiences. Most physicians (78.4%) were comfortable conducting a remote endorsement. Most found that Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation handover elements were properly achieved through this remote handover process. The perceived advantages of online handover included fewer interruptions, time efficiency, and facilitation of social distancing. The perceived disadvantages were the paucity of nonverbal communication and teaching during virtual meetings.

It consists of Spike structures created from glycoproteins that promote the virus entry into the target cells of host. The RBD of the S1 subunit on Spike proteins binds to the hACE2 receptor, which is mostly found in the lungs, particularly type-2 pneumocytes, causing human ACE2 receptors to be downregulated. Apart from nausea, vomiting, and chest tightness, which are unusual symptoms of COVID-19, the most common causes of death and severity are respiratory failure (69.5%), sepsis or multi-organ failure (28%), cardiac failure (14.6%), and renal failure (14.6%).

Angiotensin II, the primary bioactive peptide of the RAS, is generated from angiotensin I by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). A homologue of ACE, ACE2, is able to convert angiotensin II to a peptide with opposing effects, angiotensin-(1-7). It is proposed that disturbance of the balance of ACE and ACE2 expression and/or function is important in pathologies in which angiotensin II plays a role. These include cardiovascular and renal disease, lung injury and liver fibrosis. The critical roles of ACE and ACE2 in regulating angiotensin II levels have traditionally focussed attention on their activities as angiotensinases.

They are obtained by fractionating plasma collected from immunized horses or, less frequently, sheep. Manufacturing processes usually include pepsin digestion at acid pH, papain digestion, ammonium sulphate precipitation, caprylic acid precipitation, heat coagulation and/or chromatography. Most production processes do not have deliberately introduced viral inactivation or removal treatments, but antivenoms have never been found to transmit viruses to humans. Nevertheless, the recent examples of zoonotic diseases highlight the need to perform a careful assessment of the viral safety of antivenoms. This paper reviews the characteristics of equine viruses of antivenoms and discusses the potential of some manufacturing steps to avoid risks of viral contamination. Analysis of production parameters indicate that acid pH treatments and caprylic acid precipitations, which have been validated for the manufacture of some human IgG products, appear to provide the best potential for viral inactivation of antivenoms. As many manufacturers of antivenoms located in developing countries lack the resources to conduct formal viral validation studies, it is hoped that this review will help in the scientific understanding of the viral safety factors of antivenoms, in the controlled implementation of the manufacturing steps with expected impact on viral safety, and in the overall reinforcement of good manufacturing practices of these essential therapeutic products.","output":"Assessment of the viral safety of antivenoms fractionated from equine plasma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on a longtime voluntary registry, founded by the German Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (GSTCVS) in 1980, well-defined data of all cardiac, thoracic and vascular surgery procedures performed in 78 German heart surgery departments during the year 2020 are analyzed.

Gene therapy strategies involve gene manipulation on broad biological processes responsible for the spreading of diseases. Cancer, monogenic diseases, vascular and infectious diseases are the main targets of gene therapy. In order to obtain valuable experimental and clinical results, sufficient gene transfer methods are required. Therapeutic genes can be administered into target tissues via gene carriers commonly defined as vectors. The retroviral, adenoviral and adeno-associated virus based vectors are most frequently used in the clinic. So far, gene preparations may be administered directly into target organs or by intravenous, intramuscular, intratumor or intranasal injections. It is common knowledge that the number of gene therapy clinical trials has rapidly increased. However, some limitations such as transfection efficiency and stable and long-term gene expression are still not resolved. Consequently, great effort is focused on the evaluation of new strategies of gene delivery. There are many expectations associated with intranasal delivery of gene preparations for the treatment of diseases. Intranasal delivery of therapeutic genes is regarded as one of the most promising forms of pulmonary gene therapy research. Gene therapy based on inhalation of gene preparations offers an alternative way for the treatment of patients suffering from such lung diseases as cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin defect, or cancer.

RESULTS The referrals dropped by 35 per cent in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The time from general practitioner referral to the first ENT appointment improved during the pandemic (8.0 vs 10.0 days; p < 0.001). Of referrals, 92.1 per cent were seen within a 14-day period in 2020, compared with 79.6 per cent in 2019 (p < 0.001).

Technical insufficiency, topical or systemic factors contribute to disrupted healing of the performed bowel anastomosis and result in anastomosis leakage, with detrimental effects on patient postoperative outcomes. Despite the investigation of several factors and the invention of protective materials, the ideal agent to prevent anastomotic leaks is yet to be determined. AIM To study the effect of platelet rich plasma (PRP) on the healing of bowel anastomoses. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases to identify studies investigating the effect of PRP application on bowel anastomosis. RESULTS Eighteen studies were eligible with a total population of 712 animals including rats (14 studies), rabbits (2 studies) and pigs (2 studies). No postoperative complications were reported following PRP application. Fourteen out of 18 studies reported a statistically significant higher anastomosis bursting pressure in PRP groups compared to control either in healthy animals or animal models with underlying condition or intervention, such as intraperitoneal chemotherapy or peritonitis. Similar results were reported by ten studies in terms of tissue hydroxyproline levels. One study reported significant increase in collagen deposition in PRP groups. PRP application resulted in significantly decreased inflammatory cell infiltration in the presence of peritonitis or intraperitoneal chemotherapy (6 studies). CONCLUSION The application of PRP is associated with improved bowel anastomosis outcomes, especially in animal models having an underlying condition affecting the normal healing process. PRP application seems to augment the normal healing process under these circumstances. However, further studies are needed to investigate the potential role of PRP on bowel anastomosis healing, especially in clinical settings.","output":"Platelet rich plasma effectiveness in bowel anastomoses: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several research and development teams around the world are working towards COVID-19 vaccines.

On July 22, 2021, the government of Puerto Rico started imposing a series of strict vaccine mandates. Two months later, over 70% of the population was vaccinated, more than in any US state, and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 had dropped substantially. The decision to impose mandates, as well as current Department of Health recommendations related to boosters, were guided by the data and the effectiveness estimates presented here. METHODS: Between December 15, 2020, when the vaccination process began in Puerto Rico, and October 15, 2021, 2,276,966 individuals were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. During this period 112,726 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported. These data permitted us to quantify the outcomes of the immunization campaign and to compare effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna), BNT162b2 (Pfizer), and Ad26.COV2.S (J&J) vaccines. We obtained vaccination status, SARS-CoV-2 test results, and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, from the Department of Health. We fit statistical models that adjusted for time-varying incidence rates and age group to estimate vaccine effectiveness, since the time of vaccination, against lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 hospitalization and death. RESULTS: Two weeks after final dose, the mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines had an effectiveness of 90% (95% CI: 88C91), 87% (85C88), and, 64% (58C69), respectively. After five months, effectiveness waned to about 70%, 50%, and 40%, respectively. We found no evidence that effectiveness was different after the Delta variant became dominant. For those infected, the vaccines provided further protection against COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths across all age groups, and this conditional effect did not wane in time. INTERPRETATION: The mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines were highly effective across all age groups. They were still effective after five months although the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection waned. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was effective but to a lesser degree compared to the mRNA vaccines. Although, conditional on infection, protection against adverse outcomes did not wane, the waning in effectiveness resulted in a decreased protection against serious COVID-19 outcomes across time.

Previous studies reveal that individuals who experienced child abuse (CA), especially those who suffer from complex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), are at a higher risk of reacting with fear and stress when faced with stressful life-events. OBJECTIVE: To test whether exposure to CA is implicated in a higher risk of COVID-19-related fear and acute stress, and whether CPTSD intervenes in such processes. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS: A convenience sample of 837 adults participated in the study during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel. METHODS: Participants completed self-report questionnaires, assessing child physical, sexual and emotional abuse, CPTSD (ITQ), COVID-19-related acute stress disorder (COVID-19 ASD; ASDS) and fear of COVID-19. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed that participants who experienced CA were higher than participants who did not experience CA in COVID-19 ASD (p = .032), but not in fear of COVID-19 (p = .65). Mediation analyses demonstrated two significant paths: in the first, CA was associated with elevated fear of COVID-19 (effect = .061, .059; p < 0.05) and COVID-19 ASD (effect = .14, .084; p < 0.05) through the mediation of CPTSD; in the second path, when controlling for the mediation of CPTSD, CA was associated with reduced fear of COVID-19 (effect = ?.15; p = 0.001), and COVID-19 ASD (effect = ?.12; p = 0.024).

These infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites, pose no threat to humans. In fact, only a few hundred are able to inflict damage to the human host. In addition, the spectrum of human disease caused by a particular pathogen varies considerably depending on the factors related to the ecological agent, the host, and the infectious agents.

METHODS: We identified patients diagnosed with stage I-III ER-positive ILC from 2004 to 2016 using the National Cancer Database. All patients underwent 70-gene ST testing. We used the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard analyses to determine overall survival based on genomic risk classification. We also determined the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with high-genomic risk ILC based on 70-gene ST testing. RESULTS: We identified 2610 patients with ILC who underwent 70-gene ST testing; 280 (11%) were classified as high genomic risk. Five-year overall survival rates were significantly worse for patients classified as high risk (83%) as compared with those classified as low risk (94%, p < 0.05). In Cox models, high genomic risk was independently associated with a significantly increased hazard of death. In our Cox models of patients who were high genomic risk, adjuvant chemotherapy was not significantly associated with improved overall survival.

The undeniable characteristics of personal signature can be customized and diversified. At present, the system development and technology of web forms are various and mature. In order to increase the employability of college students, the implementation course of online spreadsheet is added to the professional courses of University, which has gradually become a popular option of software engineering for students' graduation design. From the system analysis and system design, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and other technologies are selected. Through the programming framework on the server, through the browser, it is convenient to use the web spreadsheet. The system functions are successfully implemented, and the graduation design of university professional courses is completed, which is a reference for successful cases of course practice. This model is a successful example of system development.

Recent genetic evidence, however, has indicated a correlation between certain natural killer (NK) cell receptors and progression of both HIV and HCV infection(1C3), implying that NK cells are playing a role in these T cell-associated diseases. While direct NK cell-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells may contribute to anti-viral defense during some virus infections, especially murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections in mice and perhaps HIV in humans(4C5), NK cells have also been suspected as having immunoregulatory functions. For instance, NK cells may indirectly regulate T cell responses by lysing MCMV-infected antigen-presenting cells(6C7). In contrast to MCMV, lymphocytic choromeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice seems resistant to any direct anti-viral effects of NK cells(5,8). Here the roles of NK cells in regulating T cell-dependent viral persistence and immunopathology were examined in mice infected with LCMV, an established model for HIV and HCV infections in humans. We describe a three-way interaction, whereby activated NK cells cytolytically eliminate activated CD4 T cells that affect CD8 T-cell function and exhaustion. At high virus dose NK cells prevented fatal pathology while enabling T-cell exhaustion and viral persistence, but at a medium dose NK cells paradoxically facilitated lethal T cell-mediated pathology. Thus, NK cells can act as rheostats, regulating CD4 T cell-mediated support for the anti-viral CD8 T cells that control viral pathogenesis and persistence.","output":"Natural killer cells act as rheostats modulating anti-viral T cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lack of knowledge in highly efficient contraceptive methods led to low rates of adoption and misuse of these methods by young women.

Interprovincial migration triggered a nationwide outbreak that lasted until around 28 January 2020, about 5 days after the Wuhan lockdown. In this phase of transmission, the population inflow from Hubei province was more contagious than the inflow from other provinces.

One challenge has been to promptly recognise non-COVID-19 conditions. Cognitive bias due to the availability heuristic may cause difficulties in reaching the correct diagnosis.

To help mitigate bias, there is no substitute for thoughtful clinical assessment and critical appraisal when evaluating new information and formulating the differential diagnosis.

Consequently, almost all recent IV pandemics have exhibited resistance to commercial antiviral vaccines. To overcome this challenge, an antiviral target is needed that is effective regardless of genetic mutations. MAIN BODY: In particular, hemagglutinin (HA), a highly conserved surface protein across many IV strains, could be an effective antiviral target as it mediates binding of IVs with host cell receptors, which is crucial for membrane fusion. HA has 6 disulfide bonds that can easily bind with the surfaces of gold nanoparticles. Herein, we fabricated porous gold nanoparticles (PoGNPs) via a surfactant-free emulsion method that exhibited strong affinity for disulfide bonds due to goldCthiol interactions, and provided extensive surface area for these interactions. A remarkable decrease in viral infectivity was demonstrated by increased cell viability results after exposing MDCK cells to various IV strains (H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2) treated with PoGNP. Most of all, the viability of MDCK cells infected with all IV strains increased to 96.8% after PoGNP treatment of the viruses compared to 33.9% cell viability with non-treated viruses. Intracellular viral RNA quantification by real-time RT-PCR also confirmed that PoGNP successfully inhibited viral membrane fusion by blocking the viral entry process through conformational deformation of HA. CONCLUSION: We believe that the technique described herein can be further developed for PoGNP-utilized antiviral protection as well as metal nanoparticle-based therapy to treat viral infection. Additionally, facile detection of IAV can be achieved by developing PoGNP as a multiplatform for detection of the virus.","output":"Porous gold nanoparticles for attenuating infectivity of influenza A virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 could impair recognition of the virus by human antibody-mediated immunity.

Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity, the mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at just a few sites in the RBDs receptor-binding motif.

We also conducted a sensitivity analysis, exploring the model's outcomes over a wide range of uncertainty. Results: Events caused an increase in the number of cases among the campus community, ranging from a 25% increase in a scenario where the campus already had an uncontrolled COVID-19 outbreak and visitors had a low prevalence of COVID-19 and mixed lightly with the campus community to an 822% increase where the campus had controlled their COVID-19 outbreak and visitors had both a high prevalence of COVID-19 and mixed heavily with the campus community.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between the peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and the cognitive status in ALS patients. METHODS: Among 81 ALS patients, we compared the demographic, clinical, and peripheral levels of total T lymphocyte, CD4+ T lymphocyte, CD8+ T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, and NK cell between those with cognitive impairment (ALS-ci) and those without (ALS-nci). The cognitive status was evaluated via the Chinese version of the Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral screen (ECAS). Significant predictors of cognitive impairment in univariate logistic regression analysis were further examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 39.5% of all ALS patients had cognitive impairment. The ALS-ci group had shorter education time, older age at both symptom onset and testing, longer disease duration, and lower levels of peripheral total, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte than the ALS-nci group. Frequency of behavioral impairment did not differ between the two groups. While parameters with significant differences identified by group comparison were also significant predictors of cognitive impairment in univariate logistic regression analysis except the level of B lymphocyte, only older age at testing, education time less than 9 years, and lower level of CD4+ T lymphocyte remained significant in multivariate logistic regression analysis.

TMPRSS2 belongs to the type II serine proteases of subfamily TMPRSS, which is characterized by the presence of the serine-protease domain. TMPRSS4 is another TMPRSS member, which has a domain architecture similar to TMPRSS2. TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 have been shown to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their normal physiological roles have not been explored in detail. In this study, we analyzed the amino acid sequences and predicted 3D structures of TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 to understand their functional aspects at the protein domain level. Our results suggest that these proteins are likely to have common functions based on their conserved domain organization. Furthermore, we show that the predicted 3D structure of their serine protease domain has significant similarity to that of plasminogen which dissolves blood clot, and of other blood coagulation related proteins. Additionally, molecular docking analyses of inhibitors of four blood coagulation and anticoagulation factors show the same high specificity to TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 3D structures. Hence, our observations are consistent with the blood coagulopathy observed in COVID-19 patients and their predicted functions based on the sequence and structural analyses offer avenues to understand better and explore therapeutic approaches for this disease.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Entry Protein TMPRSS2 and Its Homologue, TMPRSS4 Adopts Structural Fold Similar to Blood Coagulation and Complement Pathway Related Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa that can be modeled using Controlled Allergen Exposure Facilities (CACF). Recently, we clinically validated the house dust mite (HDM) Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU) facility. In the current study, we aimed to assess biological responses in the blood following HDM exposure in the HDM-EEU. Methods: Fifty-five participants passed a screening visit, where they provided consent and completed a skin prick test (SPT), then attended a modest or higher HDM exposure session. Baseline and post-exposure blood samples were collected. Complete blood counts with differentials were measured, and isolated serum was used to determine Dermatophagoides farinae- and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-specific IgE (sIgE) and cytokine concentrations (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, TNF-). Results: HDM-allergic participants had significantly greater SPT wheal sizes than healthy controls. sIgE concentrations were significantly greater in allergic participants, with a strong correlation between Dermatophagoides farinae and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. Serum eosinophil counts were significantly decreased post-exposure for allergic participants. White blood cell, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts were significantly increased for both allergic and non-allergic participants post-exposure. Serum IL-13 concentrations were significantly reduced post-exposure in allergics while TNF- was significantly reduced in non-allergics. Conclusion: The HDM-EEU is a useful model for investigating biologic mechanisms of HDM-induced AR. Allergic participants produced measurable biological changes compared to healthy controls following allergen exposure, specifically with serum expression of eosinophils and related markers, namely IL-5, which promotes the proliferation and differentiation of eosinophils, and IL-13, a cytokine released by eosinophils.

METHODS We enrolled consecutive patients with MRI-defined lacunar stroke who presented within 12 hours after symptom onset from a prospective stroke database (2015-2019). END was defined as any persisting increase in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 2 points within 24 hours after admission and favorable outcome as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0-2 at 90 days. We assessed the association of END with clinical and imaging variables, acute treatment and outcome using multivariable regression, calculating adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS Sixty-one of 365 (16.7%) patients with acute lacunar stroke (median age 71.8 years, 39.5% female, median NIHSS score on admission 3) had END. Lower NIHSS score on admission (per point, aOR 0.81, p=0.006), capsular warning syndrome (aOR 7.00, p<0.001), ventral pontine infarct (aOR 3.49, p=0.008) and hypoperfusion on imaging (aOR 2.13, p=0.026) were associated with END. Acute dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with reduced risk of END (aOR 0.10, p=0.04). Patients with END had less favorable outcome at 90 days (aOR 0.13 p<0.001), but intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) was associated with favorable outcome at 90 days (aOR 3.95, p=0.002). CONCLUSION One in six patients with lacunar stroke has END and patients at high risk of END can be identified using radiological and clinical variables. Targeted therapeutic trials for this population seem justified.

METHODS: International, multicentre cohort study of cancer patients with COVID-19. All patients were included in the analysis of co-infections at diagnosis, while only patients admitted at least 48 hours were included in the analysis of superinfections. RESULTS: 684 patients were included (384 with solid tumors and 300 with hematological malignancies). Co-infections and superinfections were documented in 7.8% (54/684) and 19.1% (113/590) of patients, respectively. Lower respiratory tract infections were the most frequent infectious complications, most often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only seven patients developed opportunistic infections. Compared to patients without infectious complications, those with infections had worse outcomes, with high rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and case-fatality rates. Neutropenia, ICU admission and high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were independent risk factors for infections. CONCLUSIONS: Infectious complications in cancer patients with COVID-19 were lower than expected, affecting mainly neutropenic patients with high levels of CRP and/or ICU admission. The rate of opportunistic infections was unexpectedly low.

Using molecular techniques and sequence-based characterization, adenovirus was the most frequently detected enteropathogen (53/155 (34.2%)), followed by Salmonella spp. (23/155 (14.8%)), Entamoeba spp. (21/155 (13.5%)), and Campylobacter spp. (17/155 (10.9%)). Mixed infection with Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. was evident, and the same was revealed between various enteric viruses, particularly adenovirus and norovirus. The most frequent co-infection pattern was between adenovirus and Campylobacter spp., in seven cases (7/155 (4.5%)). Whole-genome sequencing-derived typing data for Salmonella isolates (n = 23) revealed that sequence type 49 was the most prevalent in this sample set (15/23 (65.2%)). To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first report on detection and identification of floR, bla(CARB-2), and mphA antimicrobial resistance genes in Salmonella isolated from children in the Middle East region. Logistic regression analysis pointed to few enteropathogen-specific correlations between child age, household water source, and breastfeeding patterns in relation to the outcome of detection of individual enteropathogens. This study presents the first published molecular investigation of multiple enteropathogens among children <5 years of age in Iraq.

However, their effect against cancer cells is not well explored. In this study, to understand the cytotoxic effect and molecular mechanism stimulated by TSL-1 (TS leaf extract fraction) we employed three different nonCsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines: H441 cells (lung adenocarcinoma), H661 cells (lung large cell carcinoma) and H520 cells (lung squamous cell carcinoma). IC50 value was varied between these three cell lines, the least IC50 value was observed in TSL-1Ctreated H661cells. Exposure of NSCLC cells to TSL-1 caused cell-cycle arrest in subG1 phase and caused apoptosis. Moreover, TSL-1 treatment decreased the cell-cycle regulators; cyclin D1 and CDK4 proteins by up regulating p27 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the TSL-1Cinduced apoptosis was further confirmed by cell morphology, subG1 peak accumulation, poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, propidium iodide (PI)-Annexin-V double staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay.

The online databases Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched. Endpoints included targeting accuracy, procedural efficiency, and treatment efficacy outcomes. Meta-analysis including subgroup analyses was performed. Results Thirty-four studies (two randomized controlled trials, three prospective cohort studies, 29 case series) were qualitatively analyzed, and 22 studies were included for meta-analysis. Weighted average lateral targeting error was 3.7 mm (CI 3.2, 4.2), with all four comparative studies showing enhanced targeting accuracy compared to free-hand targeting. Weighted average overall complications, major complications, and mortality were 11.4% (6.7, 16.1), 3.4% (2.1, 5.1), and 0.8% (0.5, 1.3). Pooled estimates of primary technique efficacy were 94% (89, 97) if assessed at 1-6 weeks and 90% (87, 93) if assessed at 6-12 weeks post ablation, with remaining between-study heterogeneity. Primary technique efficacy was significantly enhanced in stereotactic vs. free-hand targeting, with odds ratio (OR) of 1.9 (1.2, 3.2) (n = 6 studies).

This disease is diagnosed using radiological images taken with the help of basic scanning methods besides the test kits for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Automatic analysis of chest Computed Tomography (CT) images that are based on image processing technology plays an important role in combating this infectious disease. Material and methods: In this paper, a new Multiple Kernels-ELM-based Deep Neural Network (MKs-ELM-DNN) method is proposed for the detection of novel coronavirus disease - also known as COVID-19, through chest CT scanning images. In the model proposed, deep features are extracted from CT scan images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For this purpose, pre-trained CNN-based DenseNet201 architecture, which is based on the transfer learning approach is used. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier based on different activation methods is used to calculate the architecture's performance. Lastly, the final class label is determined using the majority voting method for prediction of the results obtained from each architecture based on ReLU-ELM, PReLU-ELM, and TanhReLU-ELM. Results: In experimental works, a public dataset containing COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 classes was used to verify the validity of the MKs-ELM-DNN model proposed. According to the results obtained, the accuracy score was obtained as 98.36% using the MKs-ELM-DNN model.

Here, we fill this gap by leveraging the trajectory data of 197,808 smartphone users (including 17,808 anonymous confirmed cases) in 9 cities in China. We find a universal spreading pattern in all cities: the spatial distribution of confirmed cases follows a power-law-like model and the spreading centroid is time-invariant. Moreover, we reveal that human mobility in a city drives the spatialtemporal spreading process: long average travelling distance results in a high growth rate of spreading radius and wide spatial diffusion of confirmed cases. With such insight, we adopt Kendall model to simulate urban spreading of COVID-19 that can well fit the real spreading process. Our results unveil the underlying mechanism behind the spatial-temporal urban evolution of COVID-19, and can be used to evaluate the performance of mobility restriction policies implemented by many governments and to estimate the evolving spreading situation of COVID-19.","output":"Universal Urban Spreading Pattern of COVID-19 and Its Underlying Mechanism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a multisystem disease complicated by respiratory failure requiring sustanined mechanical ventilation (MV). Prolongued oro-tracheal intubation is associated to an increased risk of dysphagia and bronchial aspiration. Purpose of this study was to investigate swallowing disorders in critically ill COVID-19 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study analysing a consecutive cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of our hospital. Data concerning dysphagia were collected according to the Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS) and related to demographic characteristics, clinical data, ICU Length-Of-Stay (LOS) and MV parameters. RESULTS: From March 2 to April 30, 2020, 31 consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU were evaluated by speech and language therapists (SLT). Twenty-five of them were on MV (61% through endotracheal tube and 19% through tracheostomy); median MV length was 11 days. Seventeen (54.8%) patients presented dysphagia; a correlation was found between first GUSS severity stratification and MV days (p < 0.001), ICU LOS (p < 0.001), age (p = 0.03) and tracheostomy (p = 0.042). No other correlations were found. At 16 days, 90% of patients had fully recovered; a significant improvement was registered especially during the first week (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Compared to non-COVID-19 patiens, a higher rate of dysphagia was reported in COVID-19 patients, with a more rapid and complete recovery. A systematic early SLT evaluation of COVID-19 patients on MV may thus be useful to prevent dysphagia-related complications.","output":"Dysphagic disorder in a cohort of COVID-19 patients: Evaluation and evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since both feline parvovirus (FPV) and feline bocavirus (FBoV) can cause diarrhea in cats, it is difficult to distinguish them clinically. This study aimed to develop a SYBR Green I-based duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for distinguishing FPV and FBoV-1 on the basis of the melting temperature of the PCR product. A total of 132 fecal samples from different domestic and feral cats were collected, and the results of SYBR Green I-based duplex real-time PCR assay were compared with those of the traditional PCR assay for a comprehensive evaluation. The melting temperatures were found to be 86 C and 77.5 C for FBoV-1 and FPV, respectively, and no specific melting peaks for other non-targeted feline viruses were observed. The data obtained from this assay had a good linear relationship; the detection limits of FPV and FBoV-1 were 2.907  10(1) copies/L and 3.836  10(1) copies/L, respectively. In addition, the experiment exhibited high reproducibility. The positive detection rates of the SYBR Green I-based duplex real-time PCR assay for FPV and FBoV-1 were 16.67% (22/132) and 6.82% (9/132), respectively, and the positive detection rate for co-infection with FPV and FBoV-1 was 3.03% (4/132). This result was much more sensitive than that of the traditional PCR method. Thus, the developed SYBR Green I-based assay is a sensitive, rapid, specific, and reliable method for the clinical diagnosis of FPV and FBoV-1 and can provide technical support for the simultaneous detection of co-infection with these viruses in the future.

AIM: This study aimed to investigate the association between neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and risk of cardiovascular events in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Our study included 159 patients with COVID-19 who were measured for NLR value within the first 24 hours of admission. They were followed up for 6 months after discharge and then the relationship between levels of NLR and risk of cardiovascular events was assessed. RESULTS: In all included patients with COVID-19, NLR values in patients with cardiovascular events [16.28 (4.95C45.18)] were significantly higher than patients without cardiovascular events [4.75 (2.60C7.47)]. A multivariate logistic regression model revealed that elevated NLR value [increased per SD, 2.41 (1.43C4.29), P<0.001; increased 1 of NLR, 2.05 (1.33C4.01), P=0.010] was significantly and independently associated with increased risk of CVD history on admission after adjustment of related confounding factors. Then, Cox regression analysis revealed that elevated NLR value had a significant association with increased risk of cardiovascular events [increased per SD, 2.36 (1.42C4.36), P<0.001; Increased 1 of NLR, 2.00 (1.30C3.97), P=0.014] after adjustments of these same confounding factors.

This is the first cross-sectional survey performed to evaluate the proportion of PEDV-positive swine farms in Vietnam from January 2018 to February 2019. Fecal samples from 327 pig farms in northern Vietnam were collected and tested for PEDV infection by reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method. The proportion of PEDV-positive farms was 30.9% and PEDV-positive farms were distributed throughout the study area. The highest proportion of PEDV-positive farms was 70% (7/10) among nucleus production type farms (P < 0.05).

Lysosomal sequestration is in most cases followed by the release of their content from the cell by exocytosis. Lysosomal accumulation of anticancer drugs is caused mainly by ion-trapping, but active transport of certain drugs into lysosomes was also described.

However, adverse events resulting from immunotherapy that are related to the low specificity of tumor cell-targeting represent a limitation of immunotherapys efficacy. The potential of nanotechnologies is represented by the possibilities of immunotherapeutical agents being carried by nanoparticles with various material types, shapes, sizes, coated ligands, associated loading methods, hydrophilicities, elasticities, and biocompatibilities. In this review, the principal types of nanovectors (nanopharmaceutics and bioinspired nanoparticles) are summarized along with the shortcomings in nanoparticle delivery and the main factors that modulate efficacy (the EPR effect, protein coronas, and microbiota). The mechanisms by which nanovectors can target cancer cells, the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), and the peripheral immune system are also presented.

Thus, we did a meta-analysis evaluating the effect of echinacea on the incidence and duration of the common cold. 14 unique studies were included in the meta-analysis. Incidence of the common cold was reported as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI, and duration of the common cold was reported as the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI. Weighted averages and mean differences were calculated by a random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird methodology).

The dearth of targeted therapeutics for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an ongoing global health crisis, underscores the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of the interactions of proteins encoded by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we describe the use of a convenient bacterial cell-based two-hybrid (B2H) system to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We identified 16 distinct intraviral protein-protein interactions (PPIs), involving 16 proteins. We found that many of the identified proteins interact with more than one partner. Further, our system facilitates the genetic dissection of these interactions, enabling the identification of selectively disruptive mutations. We also describe a modified B2H system that permits the detection of disulfide bond-dependent PPIs in the normally reducing Escherichia coli cytoplasm, and we used this system to detect the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) with its cognate cell surface receptor ACE2. We then examined how the RBD-ACE2 interaction is perturbed by several RBD amino acid substitutions found in currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our findings illustrate the utility of a genetically tractable bacterial system for probing the interactions of viral proteins and investigating the effects of emerging mutations. In principle, the system could also facilitate the identification of potential therapeutics that disrupt specific interactions of virally encoded proteins. More generally, our findings establish the feasibility of using a B2H system to detect and dissect disulfide bond-dependent interactions of eukaryotic proteins.","output":"A Bacterial Cell-Based Assay To Study SARS-CoV-2 Protein-Protein Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main aim of the research was to answer the research questions: how the science went - studying Polish university students in the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and what were the main barriers to learning for Polish students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We studied the effect of adding a geriatric medicine consultation service to a geriatric focused rehabilitation setting providing care to dialysis and non-dialysis patients. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS A pre- and post-retrospective observational cohort study from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2019 on all consecutively admitted adults aged 65 and older to general rehabilitation program, and adults aged 60 and older to specialized dialysis rehabilitation program, within a 25 bed general rehabilitation unit in a large urban academic rehabilitation center in Toronto, Ontario. Data were analyzed with quality improvement methodology including Statistical Process Control charts (XmR and U charts). INTERVENTION Addition of a geriatric medicine service providing automatic comprehensive geriatric assessment and co-management consultative services for all admitted patients from admission onwards who met criteria for the intervention. The intervention commenced on August 1, 2013. MEASUREMENTS Outcome measures were length of stay (days), service interruption frequency, and average functional independence measure (FIM) change (discharge FIM minus admission FIM) which uses the validated FIM score, a marker of functional ability. A 22 point change in FIM score is clinically relevant. RESULTS Patient characteristics: general rehabilitation patients (n = 1395, mean age = 79.7, 50.1% female) and dialysis rehabilitation patients (n = 838, mean age = 72.8, 41.8% female). The average FIM change following intervention improved from 20.8 to 29.3 in the general rehabilitation cohort (40.6% improvement, SD = 5.51) and from 22.1 to 30.6 in the dialysis rehabilitation cohort (38.6% improvement, SD = 5.88). Changes in length of stay (24.9%-28.1% reduction) and service interruption frequency (34.3%-49.7% reduction) were also observed. CONCLUSION Introduction of a geriatric medicine service for rehabilitation inpatients was associated with significant FIM score improvements.

Identification of additional components of the RAS and associated vasoactive pathways, as well as new structural and functional insights into established targets, have led to novel therapeutic approaches with the potential to provide improved cardiovascular protection and better blood pressure control and/or reduced adverse side effects. The simultaneous modulation of several neurohumoral mediators in key interconnected blood pressureCregulating pathways has been an attractive approach to improve treatment efficacy, and several novel approaches involve combination therapy or dual-acting agents.

Influenza vaccinations were captured from 8/1/2020. Vaccination rates were calculated based on VHA users during the fiscal year. RESULTS: Surveillance metrics are presented (Table). Vaccinations were decreased and ILI was below average (0.3%-0.7% per week). Activity was highest 2020 Weeks 46-47 but remained low the entire season with no distinct peak seen, matching national influenza activity (Fig. 1). Testing revealed 161 influenza positives from 440,553 tests performed (0.04%). Hospitalizations among laboratory-confirmed cases were similar to the prior season (16% vs 17%). Median length of stay (6 days) and deaths (17, 12%) were increased over prior seasons. Among 15 deaths where results were available, 4 had Influenza A, 10 had Influenza B and 1 had Influenza A+B. Nine were co-infected with COVID-19. Total influenza positives, outpatient visits, hospitalizations and antiviral use were extremely low compared to all prior season where national VHA data has been analyzed (Table, Fig. 2).

Although vaccinations of healthy people and meticulous treatment of infected people are the main global health concerns, some plant species have therapeutic effects against viral infections. Matricaria chamomilla is one of the most famous medicinal plants used to manage flu or flu-like symptoms due to its antiviral bioactivity. M. chamomilla belongs to a large group of medicinal herbs used by Persian scholars such as Avicenna and Rhazes to treat respiratory diseases. It has more than 120 chemical constituents, including terpenoids, flavonoids, and some components with potential medicinal activity. In this study, the inhibitory effect of 2 major flavonoid components of M. chamomilla, apigenin and luteolin, was studies for the main protease protein of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Molecular docking studies were performed using an in-house batch script (DOCKFACE) of Auto Dock 4.2. The 3D structures of the selected flavonoids were retrieved from PubChem, and each ligand was optimized with MM+ then AM1 minimization method using HyperChem 8. The 3D crystal structure of the main protease protein of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6LU7) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org./pdb). Results: Apigenin and luteolin exhibited good docking scores against 6LU7 receptor, -7.86 and -7.24, respectively, with a combination of hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, and other hydrophobic interactions in the docked complexes. Besides, the estimated inhibition constants, Ki, showed that luteolin exhibited a better inhibitory effect than apigenin. Conclusions: Based on these results, the authors proposed that M. chamomilla can be considered as a valuable resource recommended for preventing SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the human body.

However, the impact of anesthesia type on clinical outcomes remains uncertain. METHODS We compared consecutive patients in the Swiss Stroke Registry with anterior circulation stroke receiving endovascular treatment with or without general anesthesia (GA).

Secondary outcomes included dependency or death (modified Rankin Scale score 3), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale after 24 hours, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage with 4 points worsening on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale within 7 days, and mortality. Coarsened exact matching and propensity score matching were performed to adjust for indication bias. RESULTS One thousand two hundred eighty-four patients (GA: n=851, non-GA: n=433) from 8 Stroke Centers were included. Patients treated with GA had higher modified Rankin Scale scores after 3 months than patients treated without GA, in the unmatched (odds ratio [OR], 1.75 [1.42-2.16]; P<0.001), the coarsened exact matching (n=332-524, using multiple imputations of missing values; OR, 1.60 [1.08-2.36]; P=0.020), and the propensity score matching analysis (n=568; OR, 1.61 [1.20-2.15]; P=0.001). In the coarsened exact matching analysis, there were no significant differences in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale after 1 day (estimated coefficient 2.61 [0.59-4.64]), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 1.06 [0.30-3.75]), dependency or death (OR, 1.42 [0.91-2.23]), or mortality (OR, 1.65 [0.94-2.89]).

Capturing these clues relies on accurate base pairing prediction, also known as RNA secondary structure prediction. As COVID-19 is considered a severe global threat, the single-stranded SARS-CoV-2 virus reveals the importance of establishing an efficient RNA analysis toolkit. This work aimed to contribute to that by introducing a novel system committed to predicting RNA secondary structure patterns (i.e., RNAs pseudoknots) that leverage syntactic pattern-recognition strategies. Having focused on the pseudoknot predictions, we formalized the secondary structure prediction of the RNA to be primarily a parsing and, secondly, an optimization problem. The proposed methodology addresses the problem of predicting pseudoknots of the first order (H-type). We introduce a context-free grammar (CFG) that affords enough expression power to recognize potential pseudoknot pattern. In addition, an alternative methodology of detecting possible pseudoknots is also implemented as well, using a brute-force algorithm. Any input sequence may highlight multiple potential folding patterns requiring a strict methodology to determine the single biologically realistic one. We conscripted a novel heuristic over the widely accepted notion of free-energy minimization to tackle such ambiguity in a performant way by utilizing each patterns context to unveil the most prominent pseudoknot pattern. The overall process features polynomial-time complexity, while its parallel implementation enhances the end performance, as proportional to the deployed hardware. The proposed methodology does succeed in predicting the core stems of any RNA pseudoknot of the test dataset by performing a 76.4% recall ratio. The methodology achieved a F1-score equal to 0.774 and MCC equal 0.543 in discovering all the stems of an RNA sequence, outperforming the particular task.

METHODS: A prospective qualitative study was undertaken in our institution during the week 13/05/2020-20/05/2020. 65 patients completed a questionnaire assessing attitudes, awareness, and behavioral changes associated with COVID-19, a Charlson Comorbidity Index, modified-Harris Hip Score, and a Short Form-12 score. RESULTS: 86% of patients felt that they were at little to no risk of COVID-19 infection. The majority of patients were happy to proceed with surgery at the current level of COVID-19 related threat (86%). Patients with higher mHHS were more likely to postpone their operation than those with lower mHHS scores. Our cohort had low patient reported outcome measures in both mHHS and SF-12, indicating the significant burden of hip osteoarthritis on both physical and mental health. CONCLUSION: Patients reported a significant disease-related impairment of physical function and subsequent deterioration in mental health as a result of hip osteoarthritis.

Similar reductions were also detectable in CHB (chronic hepatitis B) patients. Analysis of CHB liver biopsy samples, with high serum HBV DNA load (>log108 IU/ml), revealed a reduced mRNA and protein levels of Drosha, Dicer and Ago2. The low expression levels of key RNAi pathway components in CHB patient samples as well as hepatic cells established a link between HBV replication and RNAi components.

Through a series of deletions and substitution mutants, we found that the full-length HBx protein is required for optimum RSS activity. The in vitro dicing assays revealed that the HBx protein inhibited the human Dicer-mediated processing of dsRNAs into siRNAs.

In recent years, modulating the endocannabinoid system, particularly activation of the cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptor is a promising therapeutic target for modulation of immune-inflammatory responses. JWH133, a selective, full functional agonist of the CB2 receptor, has been extensively studied for its potent anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulatory properties. JWH133 modulates numerous signaling pathways and inhibits inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, prostanoids, and eicosanoids.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this systematic review are to describe, compare, and evaluate the use of AR in endoscopic and microscopic transsphenoidal surgery, incorporating the latest primary research. METHODS: A systematic review was performed to explore and evaluate existing primary evidence for using AR in transsphenoidal surgery. A comprehensive search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was conducted from database inception to 11th August 2021 for primary data on the use of AR in microscopic and endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery. Additional articles were identified through searches on PubMed, Google Scholar, JSTOR, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Engineering Village, IEEE transactions, and HDAS. A synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) analysis was employed quantitatively and qualitatively on the impact of AR on landmark identification, intraoperative navigation, accuracy, time, surgeon experience, and patient outcomes. RESULTS: In this systematic review, 17 studies were included in the final analysis. The main findings were that AR provides a convincing improvement to landmark identification, intraoperative navigation, and surgeon experience in transsphenoidal surgery, with a further positive effect on accuracy and time. It did not demonstrate a convincing positive effect on patient outcomes. No studies reported comparative mortalities, morbidities, or cost-benefit indications.

As an intracellular obligate pathogen, PRRSV exploits host cellular machinery to establish infection. The endocytic sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system has been shown to participate in different life cycle stages of multiple viruses. In the present study, a systematic small interference RNA screening assay identified that certain ESCRT components contributed to PRRSV infection. Among them, tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) was demonstrated to be important for PRRSV infection by knockdown and overexpression assays. TSG101 was further revealed to be involved in virion formation rather than viral attachment, internalization, RNA replication and nucleocapsid (N) protein translation within the first round of PRRSV life cycle. In detail, TSG101 was determined to specially interact with PRRSV N protein and take effect on its subcellular localization along with the early secretory pathway. Taken together, these results provide evidence that TSG101 is a proviral cellular factor for PRRSV assembly, which will be a promising target to interfere with the viral infection. IMPORTANCE PRRSV infection results in a serious swine disease affecting pig farming in the world. However, efficient prevention and control of PRRSV is hindered by its complicated infection process. Until now, our understanding of PRRSV assembly during infection is especially limited. Here, we identified that TSG101, an ESCRT-I subunit, facilitated virion formation of PRRSV via interaction with the viral N protein along with the early secretory pathway. Our work actually expands the knowledge of PRRSV infection and provides a novel therapeutic target for prevention and control of the virus.","output":"Tumor Susceptibility Gene 101 (TSG101) Contributes to Virion Formation of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus via Interaction with the Nucleocapsid (N) Protein along with the Early Secretory Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mortality among patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure is high and there are no known lower airway biomarkers that predict clinical outcome. We investigated whether bacterial respiratory infections and viral load were associated with poor clinical outcome and host immune tone. We obtained bacterial and fungal culture data from 589 critically ill subjects with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. On a subset of the subjects that underwent bronchoscopy, we also quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load, analyzed the microbiome of the lower airways by metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses and profiled the host immune response. We found that isolation of a hospital-acquired respiratory pathogen was not associated with fatal outcome. However, poor clinical outcome was associated with enrichment of the lower airway microbiota with an oral commensal ( Mycoplasma salivarium ), while high SARS-CoV-2 viral burden, poor anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response, together with a unique host transcriptome profile of the lower airways were most predictive of mortality. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that 1) the extent of viral infectivity drives mortality in severe COVID-19, and therefore 2) clinical management strategies targeting viral replication and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 should be prioritized.","output":"Microbial signatures in the lower airways of mechanically ventilated COVID19 patients associated with poor clinical outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the common clinical presentations of the pandemic coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) being well-known, there remain issues on its atypical or rare presentations.

OBJECTIVES: to evaluate whether the psychological state and behaviours of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and their caregivers were different from the non-MS population or not during the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 115 MS patients, 33 MS caregivers and 129 healthy controls. Depression anxiety stress score-21 (DASS-21) was used for evaluation of their psychological state. RESULTS: MS patients had significantly higher DASS-21 scores (51.4829.62) than their caregivers (29.7927.19) and non-MS population (32.9123.39) (p = 0.005). Younger patients (r=-0.252, p<0.0001), those with high EDSS scores (r = 0.023, p = 0.013) and those who believed that MS patients are at high risk for COVID-19 infection (p = 0.009) had the highest anxiety scores. There was no difference between the three groups in the level of commitment to staying at home (p = 0.747), wearing facemask (p = 0.164), wearing gloves (0.225), avoiding crowd (p = 0.225) and frequent hand washing (p = 0.570). Anxious patients had more relapses (p = 0.002) and pseudorelapses (p = 0.008).

METHODS: Key population-level disease projections in deaths, intensive care unit bed days, and non-intensive care unit bed days were taken from the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team report of March 2020, which influenced the decision to introduce suppression policies in the United Kingdom. National income loss estimates were from a study that estimated the impact of a hypothetical pandemic on the UK economy, with sensitivity analyses based on projections that are more recent. Individual quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss and costed resource use inputs were taken from published sources. RESULTS: Imperial model projected suppression polices compared to an unmitigated pandemic, even with the most pessimistic national income loss scenarios under suppression (10%), give incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below 50 000 per QALY. Assuming a maximum reduction in national income of 7.75%, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for Imperial model projected suppression versus mitigation are below 60 000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Results are uncertain and conditional on the accuracy of the Imperial model projections; they are also sensitive to estimates of national income loss. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to claim that the hypothetical Imperial model-projected suppression policies are obviously cost-ineffective relative to the alternatives available.

Zoonotic bacteria, including Staphylococcus, Campylobacter, and Bartonella species, that infect animals and humans cause various illnesses, such as fever, diarrhea, and related complications. Bacterial diseases in animals can be treated with various classes of antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and macrolides. However, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to drug resistance in infectious agents, e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus; this hampers the treatment of infections in livestock, and such problems are increasing worldwide. Dietary phytochemicals and herbal medicines are useful and viable alternatives to pharmaceuticals because they are economical, effective, non-resistance-forming, renewable, and environmentally friendly. They are small molecules with high structural diversity that cause selective stress to or stimulation of resident microbiota, consequently causing an abundance of such microorganisms; thus, they can be used in preventing various diseases, ranging from metabolic and inflammatory diseases to cancer. In addition, the antioxidant effects of phytochemicals prevent substantial losses in the livestock industry by increasing animal fertility and preventing diseases. Potentially effective plant extracts could be used in combination with antibiotics to decrease the required dose of antibiotics and increase their effectiveness. This strategy can help avoid the side effects of chemical antimicrobials and allow the effective use of phytochemicals for treating diseases. Furthermore, phytochemicals are considered as potential alternatives to antibiotics because of their economical, non-resistance-forming and environmentally friendly properties. Flavonoids such as resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate, and phenols such as galangin, puerarin, and ursolic acid are proven to be effective as antimicrobial agents.

Research on sleep patterns has traditionally relied on self-reported data. Not only does this methodology suffer from bias but the population-level data collection is also time-consuming. Advances in smart home technology and the Internet of Things have the potential to overcome these challenges in behavioral monitoring. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to demonstrate the use of smart home thermostat data to evaluate household sleep patterns and the time spent at home and how these behaviors are influenced by different weekdays and seasonal variations. METHODS: From the 2018 ecobee Donate your Data data set, 481 North American households were selected based on having at least 300 days of data available, equipped with 6 sensors, and having a maximum of 4 occupants. Daily sleep cycles were identified based on sensor activation and used to quantify sleep time, wake-up time, sleep duration, and time spent at home. Each households record was divided into different subsets based on seasonal, weekday, and seasonal weekday scales. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that sleep parameters (sleep time, wake-up time, and sleep duration) were significantly influenced by the weekdays. The sleep time on Fridays and Saturdays is greater than that on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays (n=450; P<.001; odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-3). There is significant sleep duration difference between Fridays and Saturdays and the rest of the week (n=450; P<.001; OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2). Consequently, the wake-up time is significantly changing between weekends and weekdays (n=450; P<.001; OR 5.6, 95% CI 4.3-6.3). The results also indicate that households spent more time at home on Sundays than on the other weekdays (n=445; P<.001; OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.64-2.5). Although no significant association is found between sleep parameters and seasonal variation, the time spent at home in the winter is significantly greater than that in summer (n=455; P<.001; OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.3). These results are in accordance with existing literature. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to use smart home thermostat data to monitor sleep parameters and time spent at home and their dependence on weekday, seasonal, and seasonal weekday variations at the population level. These results provide evidence of the potential of using Internet of Things data to help public health officials understand variations in sleep indicators caused by global events (eg, pandemics and climate change).","output":"Usability of Smart Home Thermostat to Evaluate the Impact of Weekdays and Seasons on Sleep Patterns and Indoor Stay: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Editor - social network changes constitute a pivotal influence on both academic success and emotional well-being for medical students throughout the various stages of training.

We isolated a germ line-encoded monoclonal antibody (mAb) from plasmablasts activated upon mRNA vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and determined its structure in complex with the spike glycoprotein by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). We show that the mAb engages a previously uncharacterized neutralizing epitope on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). The high-resolution structure reveals details of the intermolecular interactions and shows that the mAb inserts its heavy complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) loop into a hydrophobic NTD cavity previously shown to bind a heme metabolite, biliverdin. We demonstrate direct competition with biliverdin and that, because of the conserved nature of the epitope, the mAb maintains binding to viral variants B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), B.1.617.2 (delta), and B.1.1.529 (omicron). Our study describes a novel conserved epitope on the NTD that is readily targeted by vaccine-induced antibody responses. IMPORTANCE We report the first structure of a vaccine-induced antibody to SARS-CoV-2 spike isolated from plasmablasts 7 days after vaccination. The genetic sequence of the antibody PVI.V6-14 suggests that it is completely unmutated, meaning that this type of B cell did not undergo somatic hypermutation or affinity maturation; this cell was likely already present in the donor and was activated by the vaccine. This is, to our knowledge, also the first structure of an unmutated antibody in complex with its cognate antigen. PVI.V6-14 binds a novel, conserved epitope on the N-terminal domain (NTD) and neutralizes the original viral strain. PVI.V6-14 also binds the newly emerged variants B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), B.1.617.2 (delta), and B.1.1.529 (omicron). Given that this antibody was likely already present in the donor prior to vaccination, we believe that this antibody class could potentially \\"keep up\\" with the new variants, should they continue to emerge, by undergoing somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation.","output":"Structure of a Vaccine-Induced, Germline-Encoded Human Antibody Defines a Neutralizing Epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike N-Terminal Domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged from China in December 2019.

In this paper, we hypothesized a complex host response to SARS-CoV-2, with the Contact System (CS) playing a pivotal role in innate immune response. CS is linked with different proteolytic defense systems operating in human vasculature: the Kallikrein-Kinin (KKS), the Coagulation/Fibrinolysis and the Renin-Angiotensin (RAS) Systems. We investigated the role of the mediators involved. CS consists of Factor XII (FXII) and plasma prekallikrein (complexed to high-molecular-weight kininogen-HK). Autoactivation of FXII by contact with SARS-CoV-2 could lead to activation of intrinsic coagulation, with fibrin formation (microthrombosis), and fibrinolysis, resulting in increased D-dimer levels. Activation of kallikrein by activated FXII leads to production of bradykinin (BK) from HK. BK binds to B2-receptors, mediating vascular permeability, vasodilation and edema. B1-receptors, binding the metabolite [des-Arg9]-BK (DABK), are up-regulated during infections and mediate lung inflammatory responses. BK could play a relevant role in COVID-19 as already described for other viral models. Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme (ACE) 2 displays lung protective effects: it inactivates DABK and converts Angiotensin II (Ang II) into Angiotensin-(1-7) and Angiotensin I into Angiotensin-(1-9). SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 for cell entry, downregulating it: an impaired DABK inactivation could lead to an enhanced activity of B1-receptors, and the accumulation of Ang II, through a negative feedback loop, may result in decreased ACE activity, with consequent increase of BK.

Impact of HLAC-E and ESBL-E reporting on EAT was also studied. RESULTS: 765 respiratory samples, retrieved from 468 patients, were analyzed. ESBL-E prevalence was 23.8% in rectal swab and 4.4% in respiratory samples. HLAC-E prevalence was 9.0% in rectal swabs and 3.7% in respiratory samples. Overall, the 3GCR-E prevalence was 31.8% in rectal swabs and 7.7% in respiratory samples. NPVs were 98.8%, 98.0% and 96.6% for ESBL-E, HLAC-E and 3GCR-E, respectively. Over the study period, empirical antimicrobial therapy was initiated for 315 episodes of respiratory infections: 228/315 (72.4%) were associated with negative intestinal carriage screening for both HLAC-E and ESBL-E, of whom 28/228 (12.3%) were treated with carbapenems. Of 23/315 (7.3%) cases with screening for positive intestinal carriage with HLAC-E alone, 10/23 (43.5%) were treated with carbapenems. CONCLUSION: Systematic screening and reporting of HLAC-E in addition to ESBL-E in intestinal carriage screening could help to predict the absence of 3GCR-E in respiratory samples of severe surgical ICU patients. This could improve the appropriateness of EAT in ICU patients with HAP and may prevent the overuse of carbapenems.","output":"Impact of systematic screening for AmpC-hyperproducing Enterobacterales intestinal carriage in intensive care unit patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Psychological interventions (PIs) are good practice treatment for both subthreshold and diagnosed mental disorders. Australia has implemented major reforms to expand the provision of subsidised psychological services for individuals with a diagnosed mental disorder. But there are gaps in knowledge about demand for PIs (i.e., use of and perceived need for PIs) across the population. This study uses nationally representative survey data from the 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing to analyse demand for PIs. It also provides a method for analysing survey data to estimate demand for PIs when new survey data becomes available, along with suggestions to inform future survey development. METHODS: Nationally representative community survey respondents (n = 8841, 16C85 years) indicated their perceived need for nine types of help for mental health problems in the past 12 months, including three PIs (cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotherapy, and counselling), and whether these needs were unmet, partially met, or fully met. Types of help were grouped as: PIs only; PIs plus other; and other only. Chi-square analyses were used to examine the association between type of intervention, sociodemographic and clinical factors, and type of professional consulted; multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine predictors of type of intervention(s) received. RESULTS: 7.9% (95%CI: 7.2C8.6) received PIs. Receipt of PIs was positively associated with higher education and consulting a mental health specialist. Twice as many respondents received PIs plus medication as compared to PIs only (4.2% vs. 2.0%). Almost half (45.4, 95%CI 36.5C54.6) incurred out-of-pocket costs for treatment. The most common reason for partially met need for PIs was cost (24.8, 95%CI 17.2C34.3); for unmet need, it was preference for self-management (33.9, 95%CI 21.2C49.5). Perceived unmet need for PIs only (3.1, 95%CI 2.1C4.6) or PIs plus other interventions (5.2, 95%CI 3.9C6.9%) was lower than for other interventions only (22.8, 95%CI 18.7C27.6). CONCLUSIONS: Continued reforms in Australia means that on-going monitoring of demand for PIs, using nationally representative data, is required. This study provides a baseline for comparison of the long-term effects of these reforms; this comparison may be undertaken using data from the third iteration of Australias NSMHWB, due for completion in 2021C22.","output":"Service demand for psychological interventions among Australian adults: a population perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is an opportunistic pathogen, which causes serious infections in humans and animals. To investigate the antimicrobial resistance pattern and virulence profile of K. pneumoniae, a total of 887 samples were collected from both the healthy and mastitis cows and the bedding, feed, feces, air, drinking water, spraying water, washing water, and milk cup swabs from five dairy farms in Hubei, China, during 2019 and 2020. K. pneumoniae was isolated and identified using PCR of the khe and 16S rDNA sequencing. A genotypic characterization was performed for K. pneumoniae isolates using wzi typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Antimicrobial resistances were confirmed using broth microdilution against 17 antimicrobial agents and resistance and virulence genes were determined by PCR. The prevalence of K. pneumoniae was 26.94% (239/887) distributed in 101 wzi allele types (199/239, 83.26%) and 100 sequence types (STs) (209/239, 87.45%), including 5 new wzi allele type and 25 new STs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that K. pneumoniae isolated from milk, nipple swab, feed, and feces is classified in the same clone complex. By comparing with the PubMLST database, at least 67 STs have the risk of spreading in different species and regions. Interestingly, 60 STs have been isolated from humans. The isolates were highly sensitive to meropenem and colistin, but resistant to ampicillin (100%), sulfisoxazole (94.56%), cephalothin (47.28%), streptomycin (30.13%), and so on. Noteworthy, multidrug-resistant (MDR) rate was found to be 43.93% in this study. By PCR, 30 of 68 antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were identified; the prevalence rate of blaTEM, blaSHV, strA, strB, aadA1, and aac(6)-Ib-cr was more than 50%. Eleven CTX-M-producing K. pneumoniae were found. The detection rate of fimH, mrkD, uge, wabG, entB, iutA, iroN, and ureA was over 85%.

These effects are determined by the intrinsic ability of the substance, or its derivatives, to interact with the biological system, and its concentration-time profile at the target site. Physiologically based kinetic (PBK) models can predict organ-level concentration-time profiles - however, the models are time and resource intensive to generate de novo. Read-across is an approach used to reduce or replace animal testing, wherein information from a data-rich chemical is used to make predictions for a data-poor chemical. The recent increase in published PBK models presents the opportunity to use a read-across approach for PBK modelling, that is, to use PBK model information from one chemical to inform the development or evaluation of a PBK model for a similar chemical. Essential to this process, is identifying the chemicals for which a PBK model already exists. Herein, the results of a systematic review of existing PBK models, compliant with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) format, are presented. Model information, including species, sex, life-stage, route of administration, software platform used and the availability of model equations, was captured for 7541 PBK models. Chemical information (identifiers and physico-chemical properties) has also been recorded for 1150 unique chemicals associated with these models.

We have found that the reactivity of nitroxide radicals, determined by the rate of their reduction upon illumination of PS II, depends on the chemical structure of radicals and the capability of their coming close to low-potential redox centers of photoactive PS II complexes. An enhanced capability of nitroxide radicals to accept electrons from PS II correlates with their chemical structure. Nitroxide radicals NTI (2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-nitromethylene-3-imidazolidine-N-oxyl) and Tacet (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-acetate), containing polar groups, appear to be most efficient acceptors of electrons donated by PS II compared to neutral (TEMPOL, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) or positively charged (Tamine, 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-l-oxyl) spin labels. We assume that enhanced reactivities of polar nitroxide radicals, NTI and Tacet, are determined (1) by their relatively high redox potentials, providing the possibility to accept electrons from PS II, and (2) by their affinities to the closest binding sites on the surface of PS II in the vicinity of the primary plastoquinone acceptor PQ(A) (12C14 ?) or/and in the intraprotein cavity for the secondary plastoquinone PQ(B) (~ 22 ?).","output":"The Interaction of Water-Soluble Nitroxide Radicals with Photosystem II"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A variety of trials are in development and underway to examine potential interventions for the treatment and prophylaxis of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

This approach, with proper surgical expertise, is very safe with a low morbidity and mortality rate. However, as with every surgical treatment, complications can occur and may result in serious consequences for the patient. The goal of this article is to focus on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas after transsphenoidal surgery and discuss possible risk factors and treatment options, including less common procedures in persistent CSF fistulas. METHODS Over a period of 24 months, 339 consecutive patients underwent a total of 363 transsphenoidal surgeries for different pathologies in our institution. There were 282 patients with pituitary adenomas and 57 patients with nonadenomateous lesions. RESULTS CSF fistulas occurred in total of six patients (1.77%), most frequently after surgery for nonadenomateous lesions (7%). The rate was only 0.7% after surgery for pituitary adenomas. In three patients, a simple resurgery with repacking of the sella using muscle, fat, and fibrin glue was performed. All three patients received a lumbar drainage for 5 days as well. All three patients had recurrent CSF fistulas despite surgical repair, requiring multiple resurgeries. In two patients, the implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunt with programmable valve for continuous lowering of the CSF pressure was required. In both patients, the vp shunt was explanted 2 to 3 months after the last proven rhinorrhea. Out of the 339, 2 patients developed meningitis due to CSF fistulas (0.59%). CONCLUSIONS CSF fistulas continue to present a problem after transsphenoidal surgery and require sophisticated technical measures to treat this complication. Failure after repair can occur and necessitates more intense treatment modalities. The usage of the transsphenoidal approach in other skull base lesions leads to higher rates of CSF fistulas and subsequently higher frequency of meningitis.","output":"CSF fistulas after transsphenoidal pituitary surgery--a solved problem?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evolution of the internet has increased the development of virtual communities.

Notably, PCR alone cannot differentiate between the presence of whole viruses (which can be transmitted and infect individuals) and small fragments of genetic material that are not infectious. A feature of PCR known as the cycle threshold (Ct) can be used to discriminate between these states, but the relationship between Ct and infectiousness is still poorly understood. This well-known limitation of the test compromises the identification of cases and their trends, and consequently those measures to interrupt transmission (such as isolation) that are undertaken on the basis of reliably identifying infectious individuals. Here, we interrogate the public authorities understanding of PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the UK by accessing Freedom of Information requests submitted in 2020-21.We searched WhatDoTheyKnow and found 300 FOI requests, from over 150 individuals. We grouped their questions into four themes addressing the number of tests in use, the reporting of cycle thresholds ( Ct), the Ct values themselves, and the accuracy of tests. The number of validated tests in use in the UK is currently not clear: In FOI responses, Public Health England (PHE) report it may be \\"80\\" or \\"85\\". However, European regulations suggest there could be over 400 different CE marked tests available on the market and available for use. Laboratories have a statutory duty to report positive cases to PHE, but they do not have to advise which tests they are using nor submit Ct values. Only two FOI responses provided answers on Ct values, indicating that in a set time span, 24-38% of the Ct values were over 30. The most common FOI asked if there was a cycle threshold for positivity. In those that responded, the Ct for a positive result varied from 30 to 45. We found limited information on the technical accuracy of the tests. Several responses stated there is no static, specific or standard cycle threshold. The current system requires significant changes to ensure it offers accurate diagnostic data to enable effective clinical management of SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS Jejunal end-to-end anastomoses (n = 9) were performed for each group (V-Loc?, Biosyn?) with a continuous Lembert pattern with an interruption every 120. Anastomosis construction time, luminal diameter, and number of suture bites were recorded. Anastomosis constructs were distended with fluid at 1 L/min until failure. Location and intraluminal pressure at failure were recorded and all measurements were compared between groups. RESULTS V-Loc? anastomoses were significantly faster to perform (13.1  0.35 minutes) when compared to the Biosyn? group (15.6  0.72 minutes; P = .0004).

METHODS: This was a prospective observational study including all consecutive adults hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection. When the first nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (day 0), additional samples were obtained on days + 3, + 5, + 7 and then once every 7 days until virus detection was negative. PVS was defined as the duration of shedding of at least 21 days after diagnosis. The primary endpoint of this study was the prevalence of PVS. RESULTS: Data were obtained regarding 121 consecutive hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age 66 years, male sex 65.3%). Overall, the prevalence of PVS was 38% (46/121 patients). According to univariate analysis, factors associated with PVS were immunosuppression (6.7% vs 21.7%, p = 0.02), increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels ( 35 ng/ml) at the time of diagnosis (43.4% vs 67.3%, p = 0.02), time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis (median days 7.0 vs 3.5, p = 0.001), intensive care unit admission (22.7% vs 43.5%, p = 0.02), and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (20.0% vs 41.3%, p = 0.01).

However, in engineering disciplines, an arguably more important goal is that of feature extraction, the identification of relevant features associated with the various outcomes. For instance, in microbial communities, the identification of keystone species can often lead to improved prediction of future behavioral shifts. This paper proposes a novel feature extractor based on Deep Learning, which is largely agnostic to underlying assumptions regarding the training data. Starting from a collection of microbial species abundance counts, the Deep Learning model first trains itself to classify the selected distinct habitats. It then identifies indicator species associated with the habitats. The results are then compared and contrasted with those obtained by traditional statistical techniques. The indicator species are similar when compared at top taxonomic levels such as Domain and Phylum, despite visible differences in lower levels such as Class and Order. More importantly, when our estimated indicators are used to predict final habitat labels using simpler models (such as Support Vector Machines and traditional Artificial Neural Networks), the prediction accuracy is improved. Overall, this study serves as a preliminary step that bridges modern, black-box Machine Learning models with traditional, domain expertise-rich techniques.","output":"Identifying indicator species in ecological habitats using Deep Optimal Feature Learning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this article is to investigate trends and variations of fundamentalism in the Orthodox Church of Greece. In order to achieve this, the article analyses discourses and practices of the Orthodox Church of Greece since the restoration of democracy in 1974. The main argument is that the church, as an institution, produces public discourses and adopts practices with regard to modernity, more specifically on social, political, moral and scientific issues, using both modernity and tradition in order to strengthen its place in Greek society. The church, also, tries to establish an official response to the gradual marginalisation of religion both at the political and social levels, through moral dualism and strict behavioural requirements; perceiving sacred texts in an absolute and inerrant way; and creating sharp boundaries between Greek Orthodoxy and other religious communities, non-religious groups and the West, leading this way to the establishment of an elect membership through superiority. The main outcome is that the Orthodox Church of Greece is primarily a traditionalist institution, but it also meets a great number of the fundamentalist characteristics responding this way to the privatisation and marginalisation of religion in Greek society.","output":"Investigating fundamentalist trends in the Orthodox Church of Greece: Balancing between traditionalism and fundamentalism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early studies showed that 28C36% of UK adults were unsure or unwilling to be vaccinated against COVID-19. We wanted to identify which socio-demographic, socio-economic, personal health and psychological factors were associated with COVID-19 vaccine intentions (CVI) in adults living in England who did not want, yet to consider, or not sure whether to vaccinate. In October/November 2020, prior to vaccine availability, we surveyed adults stratified by gender, region, and deprivation, with additional purposive sampling of those aged 50 and over and those from an ethnic minority. Two hundred and ten did not want; 407 had yet to consider; and 1,043 were not sure whether to be vaccinated. Factors positively associated with CVI were: favorable vaccine views, trust in institutions associated with vaccine approval, vaccine subjective norms, anticipated regret of not having a vaccine, perceived vaccine benefits, perceived safety knowledge sufficiency, and a history of having an influenza vaccine. Factors negatively associated were: anti-lockdown views, and being a health or social care worker. Whilst showing significant relationships with CVI when analyzed in isolation, neighborhood deprivation and ethnicity did show an independent relationship to intention when all study measures were controlled for. Our findings suggest vaccine promotion focusing on the anticipated regret of not having a vaccine, the benefits of a mass COVID-19 immunization program, and the safety of a vaccine whilst ensuring or engendering trust in those bodies that brand a campaign may be most supportive of COVID-19 vaccine uptake.","output":"Factors associated with vaccine intention in adults living in England who either did not want or had not yet decided to be vaccinated against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we report a sensitive DocMF system that uses next-generation sequencing chips to profile protein-DNA interactions.

However, its safety profile, including adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), is not well known. The present analysis evaluated the safety profile and AESIs for fruquintinib in the FRESCO trial. METHODS: In FRESCO, eligible Chinese patients were randomized (2:1) to receive fruquintinib (5 mg once daily for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week off in 28-day cycles) or placebo plus best supportive care. Treatment-related AESIs and time to first occurrence of AESIs were summarized. Treatment-related TEAEs by age, sex, and BMI were also summarized. RESULTS: A total of 266 patients (95.7%) in the fruquintinib group and 97 (70.8%) in the placebo group had at least one treatment-related TEAE; the mean relative dose intensity was 92% and 98%, respectively. In the fruquintinib group, the most common (in > 40% of patients) treatment-related AESIs were hypertension (55.4%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome [known as hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR)] (49.3%), and proteinuria (42.1%). The most common treatment-related grade &#8805; 3 AESIs (&#8805; 3% of patients) were hypertension (21.2%), HFSR (10.8%), and proteinuria (3.2%); the median time to onset of these events was 10, 21, and 20 days, respectively. Subgroup analysis by age, sex, and BMI revealed that the frequencies of treatment-related TEAEs were similar across all subgroups, and were consistent with the overall safety profile of fruquintinib. CONCLUSIONS: The most common treatment-related grade &#8805; 3 AEs were hypertension, HFSR, and proteinuria.

Preventing infectious droplets from entering the body is one of the best ways to protect against infection. This paper reviews the transmission patterns of airborne pathogens and air disinfection methods. A particular emphasis is put on studies devoted to the thermal inactivation of viruses. These reviews reveal that air heat treatment has not been seriously considered as a possible air disinfection approach. Simple calculations show that the energy input required for thermal disinfection of humans air daily consumption is almost the same as for daily water consumption (by heat treatment from room temperature to 100 C). Moreover, it is possible to organize a continuous heat recovery from the air already heated during disinfection to the inlet air, thus significantly increasing the energy efficiency. Therefore, I propose a solution for the thermal inactivation of airborne pathogens based on air heating and its subsequent cooling in a heat exchanger with heat recovery. Such a solution could be used to create mobile personal and stationary indoor air disinfectors, as well as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Thermal disinfection of air to breathe might one day be part of peoples daily life like thermal disinfection of drinking water. Aside from limiting infectious disease transmission, thermal inactivation might be the basis for developing inhaled vaccines using thermally inactivated whole pathogens.","output":"Review of air disinfection approaches and proposal for thermal inactivation of airborne viruses as a life-style and an instrument to fight pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic induced lockdown, suspending all on-campus educational activities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), compelling to continue the education online. We explored pharmacy students perspective on its impact on their learning. METHODS: A Twitter chat was organized on three consecutive days, after final examinations, inviting all pharmacy students in KSA to participate. Day 1 chat included 11 questions regarding learning and assessment, Day 2 chat included six questions about online examinations and six questions about technology use, Day 3 chat included six questions related to lessons learnt from the learning experiences during the lockdown. The questions were validated and piloted before the chat. The responses were copied, reviewed to remove any confidential information, and thematically analyzed by two teams of research students independently. RESULTS: During the three-day chat, 790 responses were received in total. Thematic analysis generated 944 codes which were categorized into 43 subthemes. These subthemes were further categorized into six main themes: facilitators for online education, barriers for online education, online versus onsite education, role of technology in online education, suggestions for improving online education and long-term impact of online education during lockdown. Participants highlighted several facilitators and barriers which affected their education during the lockdown, compared online education with onsite education, and provided suggestions for improving online education based on their learning experiences during the lockdown.

Since these models are based on direct term matching, their accuracy can suffer from a mismatch between vocabularies used in queries and entity descriptions. Although successful applications of word embeddings and knowledge graph entity embeddings to address the issues of vocabulary mismatch in ad-hoc document retrieval and knowledge graph noisiness and incompleteness, respectively, have been reported in recent literature, the utility of joint word and entity embeddings for entity search in knowledge graphs has been relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose Knowledge graph Entity and Word Embedding for Retrieval (KEWER), a novel method to embed entities and words into the same low-dimensional vector space, which takes into account a knowledge graphs local structure and structural components, such as entities, attributes, and categories, and is designed specifically for entity search. KEWER is based on random walks over the knowledge graph and can be considered as a hybrid of word and network embedding methods. Similar to word embedding methods, KEWER utilizes contextual co-occurrences as training data, however, it treats words and entities as different objects. Similar to network embedding methods, KEWER takes into account knowledge graphs local structure, however, it also differentiates between structural components. Experiments on publicly available entity search benchmarks and state-of-the-art word and joint word and entity embedding methods indicate that a combination of KEWER and BM25F results in a consistent improvement in retrieval accuracy over BM25F alone.","output":"Joint Word and Entity Embeddings for Entity Retrieval from a Knowledge Graph"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses cause several human diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome.

To date, a comprehensive review of jockeys mental health has yet to be conducted. OBJECTIVES: To examine the existing literature related to jockeys mental health, including the prevalence of symptoms associated with mental health difficulties and help-seeking. DESIGN: A narrative review of the literature was conducted with articles screened from inception until January 2021. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included in the narrative review. Studies covered a range of mental health difficulties which included mood (depression), anxiety, distress, disordered eating and substance misuse. Rates of help-seeking among jockeys were also explored. Results indicated that jockeys reported higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms compared with other elite athletes. Substance misuse, in particular adverse alcohol use, also appears greater among jockeys than other elite athletes. Distress symptoms appear comparable with other elite athletes. Risk factors for mental health difficulties included injury, perceived stress, athlete burnout, career dissatisfaction and the contemplation of retirement. Weight-making negatively impacts jockeys mood and attitudes towards eating, with lower competitive riding weights associated with more disordered eating attitudes. Moreover, help-seeking from mental health professionals appears low. CONCLUSION: The review identifies a high prevalence of symptoms of mental health difficulties among professional jockeys.

The real sector condition is represented by fluctuations in the farmer exchange rate in ten provinces;this rate has direct and indirect effects on farmers' welfare. On the other hand, the condition of the monetary sector is illustrated by shifts in the consumer confidence index due to fluctuations in Islamic and conventional financial system indicators. We used a panel regression model to examine the farmer exchange rate and a binary logistic regression model to examine the consumer confidence index. The results statistically demonstrate that the pandemic conditions have affected both the real sector and the consumer confidence index of the Islamic financial sector. However, the pandemic has not affected the consumer confidence index of the conventional financial sector. This phenomenon exists because of the speculative action from conventional investors in taking risks and opportunities which are forbidden in the Islamic context. The indicator which shifts the conventional consumer confidence index is the composite stock index (IHSG) while the Islamic consumer confidence index is shifted by changes in the Islamic money market rate, the Jakarta Islamic index and the Islamic banking capital ratio. Our empirical findings conclude that in such a critical situation the behavior of conventional and Islamic consumers is totally different thus influencing consumer confidence in each sector.","output":"How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the real and monetary sectors in Indonesia?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contact tracing and lockdown are health policies being used worldwide to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19). The UK National Health Service (NHS) Track and Trace Service has plans for a nationwide app that notifies the need for self-isolation to those in contact with a person testing positive for COVID-19. To be successful, such an app will require high uptake, the determinants and willingness for which are unclear but essential to understand for effective public health benefit. The objective of this study was to measure the determinants of willingness to participate in an NHS app-based contact-tracing programme using a questionnaire within the Care Information Exchange (CIE)the largest patient-facing electronic health record in the NHS. Among 47,708 registered NHS users of the CIE, 27% completed a questionnaire asking about willingness to participate in app-based contact tracing, understanding of government advice, mental and physical wellbeing and their healthcare utilisationrelated or not to COVID-19. Descriptive statistics are reported alongside univariate and multivariable logistic regression models, with positive or negative responses to a question on app-based contact tracing as the dependent variable. 26.1% of all CIE participants were included in the analysis (N = 12,434, 43.0% male, mean age 55.2). 60.3% of respondents were willing to participate in app-based contact tracing. Out of those who responded no, 67.2% stated that this was due to privacy concerns. In univariate analysis, worsening mood, fear and anxiety in relation to changes in government rules around lockdown were associated with lower willingness to participate. Multivariable analysis showed that difficulty understanding government rules was associated with a decreased inclination to download the app, with those scoring 1C2 and 3C4 in their understanding of the new government rules being 45% and 27% less inclined to download the contact-tracing app, respectively; when compared to those who rated their understanding as 5C6/10 (OR for 1C2/10 = 0.57 [CI 0.48C0.67]; OR for 3C4/10 = 0.744 [CI 0.64C0.87]), whereas scores of 7C8 and 9C10 showed a 43% and 31% respective increase.

Now more than ever, it has become paramount to push the limits of online learning in every manner to keep flourishing the education system. One crucial component of online learning is Knowledge Tracing (KT). The aim of KT is to model student's knowledge level based on their answers to a sequence of exercises referred as interactions. Students acquire their skills while solving exercises and each such interaction has a distinct impact on student ability to solve a future exercise. This \\\\textit{impact} is characterized by 1) the relation between exercises involved in the interactions and 2) student forget behavior. Traditional studies on knowledge tracing do not explicitly model both the components jointly to estimate the impact of these interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware self-attention model for Knowledge Tracing (RKT). We introduce a relation-aware self-attention layer that incorporates the contextual information. This contextual information integrates both the exercise relation information through their textual content as well as student performance data and the forget behavior information through modeling an exponentially decaying kernel function. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, among which two new collections are released to the public, show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge tracing methods.

Uptake has been high, and there has been a subsequent reduction in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among vaccinated individuals. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a concern, in particular relating to adverse effects following immunization (AEFIs). Social media analysis has the potential to inform policy makers about AEFIs being discussed by the public as well as public attitudes toward the national immunization campaign. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the frequency and nature of AEFI-related mentions on social media in the United Kingdom and to provide insights on public sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed over 121,406 relevant Twitter and Facebook posts, from December 8, 2020, to April 30, 2021. These were thematically filtered using a 2-step approach, initially using COVID-19Crelated keywords and then using vaccine- and manufacturer-related keywords. We identified AEFI-related keywords and modeled their word frequency to monitor their trends over 2-week periods. We also adapted and utilized our recently developed hybrid ensemble model, which combines state-of-the-art lexicon ruleCbased and deep learningCbased approaches, to analyze sentiment trends relating to the main vaccines available in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Our COVID-19 AEFI search strategy identified 46,762 unique Facebook posts by 14,346 users and 74,644 tweets (excluding retweets) by 36,446 users over the 4-month period. We identified an increasing trend in the number of mentions for each AEFI on social media over the study period. The most frequent AEFI mentions were found to be symptoms related to appetite (n=79,132, 14%), allergy (n=53,924, 9%), injection site (n=56,152, 10%), and clots (n=43,907, 8%). We also found some rarely reported AEFIs such as Bell palsy (n=11,909, 2%) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (n=9576, 2%) being discussed as frequently as more well-known side effects like headache (n=10,641, 2%), fever (n=12,707, 2%), and diarrhea (n=16,559, 3%). Overall, we found public sentiment toward vaccines and their manufacturers to be largely positive (58%), with a near equal split between negative (22%) and neutral (19%) sentiments. The sentiment trend was relatively steady over time and had minor variations, likely based on political and regulatory announcements and debates. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequently discussed COVID-19 AEFIs on social media were found to be broadly consistent with those reported in the literature and by government pharmacovigilance. We also detected potential safety signals from our analysis that have been detected elsewhere and are currently being investigated. As such, we believe our findings support the use of social media analysis to provide a complementary data source to conventional knowledge sources being used for pharmacovigilance purposes.","output":"Artificial IntelligenceCEnabled Social Media Analysis for Pharmacovigilance of COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United Kingdom: Observational Study"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"consultation/39.md","filePath":"consultation/39.md"}'),R={name:"consultation/39.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
