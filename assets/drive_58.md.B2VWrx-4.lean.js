In this regard, there are two completely different approaches governments can take: a restrictive one, in which drastic measures such as self-isolation can seriously damage the economy, and a more liberal one, where more relaxed restrictions may put at risk a high percentage of the population. The optimal approach could be somewhere in between, and, in order to make the right decisions, it is necessary to accurately estimate the future effects of taking one or other measures. In this paper, we use the SEIR epidemiological model (Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Recovered) for infectious diseases to represent the evolution of the virus COVID-19 over time in the population. To optimize the best sequences of actions governments can take, we propose a methodology with two approaches, one based on Deep Q-Learning and another one based on Genetic Algorithms. The sequences of actions (confinement, self-isolation, two-meter distance or not taking restrictions) are evaluated according to a reward system focused on meeting two objectives: firstly, getting few people infected so that hospitals are not overwhelmed with critical patients, and secondly, avoiding taking drastic measures for too long which can potentially cause serious damage to the economy. The conducted experiments prove that our methodology is a valid tool to discover actions governments can take to reduce the negative effects of a pandemic in both senses. We also prove that the approach based on Deep Q-Learning overcomes the one based on Genetic Algorithms for optimizing the sequences of actions.","output":"A Deep Q-learning/genetic Algorithms Based Novel Methodology For Optimizing Covid-19 Pandemic Government Actions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim Introducing possible diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker candidates via the identification of chief dysregulated proteins in COVID-19 patients is the aim of this study. Background Molecular studies, especially proteomics, can be considered as suitable approaches for discovering the hidden aspect of the disease. Methods Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of three patients with demonstrated severe condition (S-COVID-19) were compared to healthy cases by a proteomics study. Cytoscape software and STRING database were used to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The central DEPs were identified through topological analysis of the network. ClueGO+CluePedia were applied to find the biological processes related to the central nodes. MCODE molecular complex detection (MCODE) was used to discover protein complexes. Results A total of 242 DEPs from among 256 query ones were included in the network. Centrality analysis of the network assigned 16 hub-bottlenecks, nine of which were presented in the highest-scored protein complex. Ten protein complexes were determined. APOA1 was identified as the protein complex seed, and APP, EGF, and C3 were the top hub-bottlenecks of the network. The results specify that up-regulation of C3 and down-regulation of APOA1 in urine play a role in the stiffness in respiration and, accordingly, the severity of COVID-19. Moreover, dysregulation of APP and APOA1 could both contribute to the possible adverse effects of COVID-19 on the nervous system. Conclusion The introduced central proteins of the S-COVID-19 interaction network, particularly APOA1, can be considered as diagnostic and therapeutic targets related to the coronavirus disease after being approved with complementary studies.","output":"Introducing APOA1 as a key protein in COVID-19 infection: a bioinformatics approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large gastric lipomas are a rare condition.

Species identification was performed by combined phenotypic characteristics and DNA sequence analysis, and antifungal susceptibility testing was performed by CLSI M38 broth microdilution for amphotericin B, the azoles, and the echinocandins. The entire CYP51A gene and its promoter were also sequenced in isolates that were phenotypically resistant to the azoles. During the study time frame, 2,138 isolates were included, representing 11 different species within Aspergillus section Fumigati, of which A. fumigatus was the most prevalent (96.91%). Overall, amphotericin B and the echinocandins demonstrated consistent in vitro activity with very few isolates demonstrating reduced susceptibility to these agents. Voriconazole, isavuconazole, and posaconazole also demonstrated good in vitro activity, and the overall percentages of isolates classified as resistant or non-wild type ranged from 3.33 to 6.58%.

The outbreak has caused alarm among social and news media as to the virulence and transmission potential of the Aedes mosquito-borne virus. This debate is heightened by the proximity, both in time and distance, to the forthcoming Olympic Games to be held in Rio de Janeiro this August, provoking fears for the safety of athletes and spectators alike. The threat, real or perceived, is exacerbated by the movement between nations in the same or separate continents of persons who act unwittingly as asymptomatic carriers. Pregnant females are considered at greatest risk because microcephaly in newborn infants is linked to, if not yet proven as caused by, Zika infection. In February this year, the World Health Organization declared that further to the then unconfirmed association between the virus and the clinical manifestations of microcephaly and also Guillain-Barr syndrome, the Zika epidemic was a public health emergency of international concern. No anti-Zika therapy, vaccine or drug, is currently available and while the production of the former has now been prioritized by multiple funding agencies, the history of infectious disease vaccine development indicates that this may take several years to reach the market place. The fact that Zika is a close relative of yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses, for both of which there are already effective vaccines, provides a rational basis for the fast-tracked laboratory-based preparation of a candidate vaccine. However, undertaking clinical trials on pregnant females provides ethical and practical hurdles to overcome before licensure is granted for public administration.

The new generation automated hematology analyzers provide parameters like high fluorescence lymphocyte count (HFLC) and leukocyte cell population data (CPD) representing various leukocytes. We tried to analyze the utility of these parameters in the rapid screening of dengue fever. METHODS The HFLC and the leukocytic CPD from the Sysmex XN1000 analyzer were obtained for 299 cases presenting with acute febrile illness, which included 97 dengue-positive and 202 cases dengue-negative controls. Additionally, 100 healthy controls were also included. The Receiver operative curves (ROC) were drawn to obtain a cut-off value for these parameters for discriminating among the dengue-positive and dengue-negative subgroups and healthy controls. RESULTS The dengue-positive cases showed a significantly increased HFLC among the different groups of controls. The median (range) HFLC% was 1.9(0.30-6.55), 0.20(0.10-0.70), and 0.10(0.0-0.30) in the cases that were positive for dengue, negative for dengue, and healthy controls, respectively. The ROC analysis revealed HFLC% at a cut-off value of 1.75 which can discriminate between dengue-positive and dengue-negative patients, with 52% sensitivity, 90% specificity, 72% positive predictive value (PPV), and 80% negative predictive value (NPV). The regression analysis revealed LY-X, LY-Z, Ly-WX, LY-WZ, and MO-X as independent predictors for dengue fever.

Currently, there are no effective therapies to prevent hepatic I/R injury other than ischemic preconditioning and some preventative strategies. Previously, we have revealed the anti-inflammatory activity of a sweat gland-derived peptide, dermcidin (DCD), in macrophage/monocyte cultures. Here, we sought to explore its therapeutic potential and protective mechanisms in a murine model of hepatic I/R. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to hepatic ischemia by clamping the hepatic artery and portal vein for 60 min, which was then removed to initiate reperfusion. At the beginning of reperfusion, 0.2 ml saline control or solution of DCD (0.5 mg/kg BW) or DCD-C34S analog (0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg BW) containing a Cys (C)Ser (S) substitution at residue 34 was injected via the internal jugular vein. For survival experiments, mice were subjected to additional resection to remove non-ischemic liver lobes, and animal survival was monitored for 10 days. For mechanistic studies, blood and tissue samples were collected at 24 h after the onset of reperfusion, and subjected to measurements of various markers of inflammation and tissue injury by real-time RT-PCR, immunoassays, and histological analysis. RESULTS: Recombinant DCD or DCD-C34S analog conferred a significant protection against lethal hepatic I/R when given intravenously at the beginning of reperfusion. This protection was associated with a significant reduction in hepatic injury, neutrophilic CXC chemokine (Mip-2) expression, neutrophil infiltration, and associated inflammation. Furthermore, the administration of DCD also resulted in a significant attenuation of remote lung inflammatory injury. Mechanistically, DCD interacted with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a key regulator of liver inflammation, and significantly inhibited hepatic I/R-induced phosphorylation of EGFR as well as a downstream signaling molecule, protein kinase B (AKT). The suppression of EGFR expression by transducing Egfr-specific shRNA plasmid into macrophages abrogated the DCD-mediated inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production induced by a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), cold-inducible RNA-binding protein, CIRP. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that human DCD and its analog may be developed as novel therapeutics to attenuate hepatic I/R-induced inflammatory injury possibly by impairing EGFR signaling.","output":"Human Dermcidin Protects Mice Against Hepatic Ischemia-ReperfusionCInduced Local and Remote Inflammatory Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Several reports have determined that cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are common complications in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and lead them to poor outcomes.

Methods: Until September 30, 2020, we searched Web of Sciences, Scopus, and MEDLINE/PubMed databases to obtain related papers. The summary points and lines were calculated using bivariate/HSROC model. As outcomes, we considered critical conditions and mortality. Results: A total of 17 659 patients from 33 studies were included. Five biomarkers, namely increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase (CK), D-dimer, and thrombocytopenia, met the inclusion criteria. Our results indicated that LDH and cTnI had good accuracy for the prognosis of critical condition (AUC(HSROC)=0.83 and 0.80, respectively), while LDH, cTnI, and D-dimer had acceptable accuracy (AUC(HSROC)=0.74, 0.71, and 0.72, respectively) for the prognosis of mortality. LDH and D-dimer had high sensitivity, whereas cTnI had high specificity. The other biomarkers did not have acceptable accuracy. Significant publication bias was found for D-dimer (P=0.053).

Compared to nasopharyngeal swab samples, the complexity of the stool matrix poses a challenge in the detection of the virus that has not yet been solved. However, robust and reliable methods are needed to estimate the prevalence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gut and to ensure the safety of microbiome-based procedures such as faecal microbiota transplant (FMT). The aim of this study was to establish a sensitive and reliable method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples. RESULTS: Stool samples from individuals free of SARS-CoV-2 were homogenised in saline buffer and spiked with a known titre of inactivated virus ranging from 50 to 750 viral particles per 100 mg stool. Viral particles were concentrated by ultrafiltration, RNA was extracted, and SARS-CoV-2 was detected via real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using the CDC primers and probes. The RNA extraction procedure we used allowed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 via RT-qPCR in most of the stool samples tested. We could detect as few as 50 viral particles per 100 mg of stool. However, high variability was observed across samples at low viral titres. The primer set targeting the N1 region provided more reliable and precise results and for this primer set our method had a limit of detection of 1 viral particle per mg of stool.

This study aims to explore the influence of the acculturation process and dietary acculturation on the lifestyle and nutritional and health status of CPLP immigrants in Portugal and Spain, focusing on two Iberian contexts: Lisbon Metropolitan Area and the Basque Country. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A mixed methods sequential explanatory design, combining cross-sectional studies and semistructured interviews. Official data will also be analysed. Primary data will be collected through a questionnaire and assessment of nutritional status and body composition. The estimated samples sizes are 1061 adults (18 years old) in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area and 573 in the Basque Country. Time-location sampling will be used for the quantitative component and non-probabilistic sampling for the qualitative component. If safety conditions are not guaranteed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, online studies will be conducted. The semistructured interviews will complement the questionnaire data and extend knowledge about the process of acculturation of CPLP immigrants and their relationship with eating habits and physical activity. Thematic analysis will be used for qualitative data. Triangulation of data derived from different methods will be carried out. An integrative approach will be used to address potential discrepancies in findings and limitations inherent to the study design. As inter-method discrepancies may occur, triangulation protocol will be used, elaborating a convergence coding matrix to display findings emerging from each component of the study.

Two techniques were established, namely, the inside-out approach and the outside-in approach. The former technique take the frontal recess and the first olfactory filament (FOF) as key landmarks while the latter use the FOF as posterior boundary. In some cases, however, these two landmarks are not available. Therefore, we supplement the outside-in approach and named it trans-nasion-complex approach (TNCA) for EMLP that can be performed without locating these two landmarks. Methods: Two dry human skulls were used to observe the bony nasion complex. Then, five colored silicon-injected human head specimens were dissected via TNCA for EMLP. Finally, the outcomes of patients who underwent TNCA were reviewed. Results: The nasion complex is an osseous complex that consists of the nasion and its adjacent structures, including the bilateral root of nasal bones, nasal process of frontal bones, anterior portion of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone that connects with the inferior aspect of the nasal bones, and portions of the bilateral frontal process of the maxillary bones. Surgical landmarks for TNCA include the anterior superior portion of the nasal septum, anterior margin and axilla of the middle turbinate, frontal process of the maxilla bone, nasal process of the frontal bone and upper part of the nasal bone. These structures form a \\"mushroom sign\\" during cadaveric dissection and surgery. Twenty-one patients underwent TNCA, of whom 9 had tumors and 12 had chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). None of them had major complications. Conclusion: TNCA is expected to be a safe, and direct route for EMLP.

This occurs only rarely in children. It is found in two-thirds of patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Diagnosis is not so easy. It is based on a body of clinical evidence. We here report the peculiar case of a 7-year-old girl with a family history of atopic disease initially treated as asthma based on the presence of wheezing and dyspnea and cough without improvement. The patient had worsening of symptoms such as dyspnea at rest complicated by cyanosis in respiratory distress. All of this took place in a context of alteration of general state. Clinical examination showed growth retardation, perioral cyanosis with digital hippocratism. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral crackling sounds. Chest X-ray objectified bilateral interstitial syndrome. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed diffuse ground-glass opacities. Laboratory tests revealed hypereosinophilia with hyper-IgE and excluded tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, immune deficiency. In a second stage interview contact with birds was reported. Serological tests for bird fancier's disease were positive. The patient received inhaled corticosteroids associated with avoidance of exposure to birds. After a follow-up of 2 months, outcome was favorable.

Most of the relevant information so far has come from tertiary cancer centres and less is known of the outcomes of patients in District General Hospitals (DGH). In this audit, we aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of patients with cancer who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted in a DGH. Methods: Electronic records of patients admitted at Tameside General Hospital (TGH) (>500 beds) between March 2020CMarch 2021 were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical outcomes of those who tested positive for COVID-19 and factors relating to death were analysed. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed (SPSS v26.0). Results: Within the 12-month study period, there were 2417 inpatients who tested positive for COVID-19 at TGH. Of 235 individual patients with cancer admitted during this period, 14% (n=33) tested positive. Median age was 75 (68;81) years;majority female (67%). The most prevalent primary site of cancer were lung (21%) and breast (12%). Most were ECOG PS 1 (39%) or PS 2 (36%), and had high Charlson Comorbidity Index (median 5 (3;6), range 0-10). 24% of patients were on curative treatment, 39% palliative treatment, 18% best supportive care and 18% not on treatment. Types of treatment included chemotherapy (37%), hormonal treatment (26%), radiotherapy (21%) and immunotherapy (5%). On average, patients were admitted at least once (range 0-4) prior to positive test for COVID-19. At last follow-up, there were n=664/2417 (27%) and n=22/33 (67%) deaths in the non-cancer and cancer patient subgroups, respectively. The median time from diagnosis of COVID-19 to death/censor date was 44 (4;85) days. In univariate Cox regression analysis, only ECOG PS was significantly correlated with death, HR 1.523 (95% CI 1.064-2.181, p=0.022). Conclusions: The outcomes of our cohort of patients with cancer who tested positive for COVID-19 and hospitalised were poor. The high comorbidity burden and poor ECOG PS could potentially account for this rather than the recent oncological treatment.

Briefly, anatomical models were constructed from 3D rotational angiography images, flow conditions were derived from Doppler ultrasound measurements, stent models were created and virtually deployed, and the results were compared with in vivo digital subtraction angiography and Doppler ultrasound images. The models were capable of reproducing in vivo observations, including velocity waveforms measured in the parent artery, peak velocity values measured in the aneurysm, and flow structures observed with digital subtraction angiography before and after deployment of flow diverters. The results indicate that regions of aneurysm occlusion after flow diversion coincide with slow and smooth flow patterns, whereas regions still permeable at the time of animal sacrifice were observed in parts of the aneurysm exposed to larger flow activity, that is, higher velocities, more swirling, and more complex flow structures.","output":"Strategy for analysis of flow diverting devices based on multi-modality image-based modeling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cerebellar ataxia and parkinsonism are two common overlapping clinical syndromes in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia.

METHOD: We examined the case records of persons with dementia who presented at theDementia Care in SCARF (DEMCARES), an outpatient clinic in Chennai between May 2020 and April 2021 during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. We reviewed their presenting complaints to look for ones specific to the COVID\\\\19 context and identified caregiver challenges. RESULT: COVID\\\\19 infection was reported by caregivers to affect the cognition and functioning of their relatives with dementia. The impact of imposed lockdown was observed through reports of caregivers noticing initial signs of dementia following the increased social isolation experienced by their loved ones during the pandemic. Some of the challenges faced by caregivers included their relative with dementias inability to understand the gravity of the COVID\\\\19 situation, wanting to step out of the house and inability to do so contributing to restlessness, agitation and aggression. CONCLUSION: Caregivers are increasingly facing challenges posed by behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia stemming from the imposed lockdown restrictions. Teleconsultation and virtual delivery of dementia\\\\specific interventions could potentially help caregivers overcome some of these challenges. Older persons at risk for social isolation and those recovering from COVID\\\\19 should be screened for dementia.

This study investigated the association between stigma (discrimination experiences, self-stigma and perceived affiliate stigma) and sleep quality among COVID-19 survivors six months after hospital discharge. METHODS: Participants were recovered adult COVID-19 survivors discharged between February 1 and April 30, 2020. Medical staff of five participating hospitals approached all discharged COVID-19 period during this period. A total of 199 participants completed the telephone interview during July to September, 2020. Structural equation modeling was performed to test the hypothesize that resilience and social support would mediate the associations between stigma and sleep quality. RESULTS: The results showed that 10.1% of the participants reported terrible/poor sleep quality, 26.1% reported worse sleep quality in the past week when comparing their current status versus the time before COVID-19. After adjusting for significant background characteristics, participants who had higher number of discrimination experience, perceived stronger self-stigma and stronger perceived affiliate stigma reported poorer sleep quality. Resilience and social support were positively and significantly associated with sleep quality. The indirect effect of self-stigma on sleep quality through social support and resilience was significant and negative. Perceived affiliate stigma also had a significant and negative indirect effect on sleep quality through social support and resilience. CONCLUSIONS: Various types of stigma after recovery were associated with poor sleep quality among COVID-19 survivors, while social support and resilience were protective factors.

Social media platforms allow virtual journal clubs to connect global participants. We describe the creation and impact of #IDJClub, an Infectious Diseases (ID) Twitter journal club. METHODS: We launched #IDJClub in October 2019. The format presents a recent ID publication for a 1-hour synchronous Twitter chat led by an ID physician from @IDJClub. Sessions started monthly, but increased in frequency due to interest during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-scripted tweets guide participants through the article description and analysis. We used Symplurs Healthcare Hashtag project to track the number of impressions, tweets, participants, and the engagement rate (average tweets/participant) of #IDJClub per 60 minute discussion plus the following 30 minutes to capture ongoing conversations. We also conducted an online anonymous survey using Likert scales and open-ended questions to assess educational impact. RESULTS: As of June 11 2020, @IDJClub garnered 5,338 followers from around the world (Figure 1). In its first 9 months, 12 virtual journal clubs were conducted with a mean of 791,624 impressions, 328 tweets, and 48 participants per session, which steadily increased over time (Figure 2). A total of 134 participants completed the survey, of whom 40% were ID physicians, 19% pharmacists, 13% ID fellows, and 10% medical residents. Most respondents followed 1C2 (38%) or 3C4 (38%) of the discussions, with variable levels of active participation. Majorities agreed that #IDJClub provided clinically useful knowledge, increased personal confidence in review of literature, and compared favorably with in-person journal clubs (Figure 3).

Under these circumstances, ensuring the safety of donor human milk is paramount, as the risk of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood. Here, we investigate the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk by pasteurisation and the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk under cold storage. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 was experimentally inoculated into human milk samples from healthy donors or into a control medium. Triplicates of each sample were layered onto uninfected cells after Holder pasteurisation (63C for 30 min), heating to 56C for 30 min, or after 48 h of storage at 4C or -30C. Infectious titres of virus were determined at 72 h post-infection by endpoint titration. RESULTS: Following heating to 63C or 56C for 30 min, replication competent (i.e. live) SARS-CoV-2 was undetected in both human milk and the control medium. Cold storage of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk (either at 4C or -30C) did not significantly impact infectious viral load over a 48 h period. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is effectively inactivated by Holder pasteurisation, suggesting that existing milk bank processes will effectively mitigate the risk of transmission of SARS-COV-2 to vulnerable infants through pasteurised donor human milk. The demonstrated stability of SARS-CoV-2 in refrigerated or frozen human milk may assist in the development of guidelines around safe expressing and storing of milk from COVID-19 infected mothers.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in human milk is inactivated by Holder pasteurisation but not cold storage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The relation between ambient air temperature and prevalence of viral infection has been under investigation in recent years.

SETTING: Two large integrated healthcare systems (one private and one public) in New York City during the initial roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine. PARTICIPANTS: 1933 healthcare workers, including nurses, physicians, allied health professionals, environmental services staff, researchers and administrative staff. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was COVID-19 vaccine receipt during the initial roll-out of the vaccine among healthcare workers. RESULTS: Among 1933 healthcare workers who had been offered the vaccine, 81% had received the vaccine at the time of the survey. Receipt was lower among black (58%; OR: 0.14, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.2) compared with white (91%) healthcare workers, and higher among non-Hispanic (84%) compared with Hispanic (69%; OR: 2.37, 95% CI 1.8 to 3.1) healthcare workers. Among healthcare workers with concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety, 65% received the vaccine. Among healthcare workers who agreed with the statement that the vaccine is important to protect family members, 86% were vaccinated. Of those who disagreed, 25% received the vaccine (p<0.001). In a multivariable analysis, concern about being experimented on (OR: 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.6), concern about COVID-19 vaccine safety (OR: 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.55), lack of influenza vaccine receipt (OR: 0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.44), disagreeing that COVID-19 vaccination is important to protect others (OR: 0.37, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.52) and black race (OR: 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59) were independently associated with COVID-19 vaccine non-receipt. Over 70% of all healthcare workers responded that they had been approached for vaccine advice multiple times by family, community members and patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated high overall receipt among healthcare workers. Even among healthcare workers with concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety, side effects or being experimented on, over 50% received the vaccine. Attitudes around the importance of COVID-19 vaccination to protect others played a large role in healthcare workers decisions to vaccinate. We observed striking inequities in COVID-19 vaccine receipt, particularly affecting black and Hispanic workers. Further research is urgently needed to address issues related to vaccine equity and uptake in the context of systemic racism and barriers to care. This is particularly important given the influence healthcare workers have in vaccine decision-making conversations in their communities.","output":"Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine receipt at two integrated healthcare systems in New York City: a cross-sectional study of healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus(SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the four structural proteins of the virus and is predicted to be a 46-kDa phosphoprotein. Our in silico analysis predicted N to be heavily phosphorylated at multiple residues. Experimentally, we have shown in this report that the N protein of the SARS-CoV gets serine-phosphorylated by multiple kinases, in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The phosphoprotein is stable and localizes in the cytoplasm and coprecipitates with the membrane fraction. Also, using specific inhibitors of phosphorylation and an in vitro phosphorylation assay, we show that the nucleocapsid protein is a substrate of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), glycogen synthase kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and casein kinase II. Further, we show that the phosphorylated protein is translocated to the cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3 (tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein). 14-3-3 proteins are a family of highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed eukaryotic proteins that function primarily as adapters that modulate interactions between components of various cellular signaling and cell cycle regulatory pathways through phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions. Coincidentally, the N protein was also found to downregulate the expression of the theta isoform of 14-3-3 (14-3-3theta), leading to the accumulation of phosphorylated N protein in the nucleus, in the absence of growth factors. Using short interfering RNA specific to 14-3-3theta we have inhibited its expression to show accumulation of phosphorylated N protein in the nucleus. Thus, the data presented here provide a possible mechanism for phosphorylation-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the N protein. This 14-3-3-mediated transport of the phosphorylated N protein and its possible implications in interfering with the cellular machinery are discussed.","output":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid protein is phosphorylated and localizes in the cytoplasm by 14-3-3-mediated translocation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inpatient suicide is defined as suicide during full or partial hospitalisation that takes place either on the hospital premises (hospital suicide) or during the course of exits and periods of leave, in the hospital grounds or elsewhere.

Patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infection were evaluated during the 2009\\\\2011 and 2013\\\\15 winter seasons. A clinical microarray technique was used for viral detection. Clinical and epidemiological data were correlated with mixed viral detection and the need for hospitalization. In 332 out of 604 (54.4%) evaluated patients (17.6% children) a respiratory virus was identified. Mixed viral infections were diagnosed in 68/332 (20.5%) patients with virus detection (66.2% mixed Influenza\\\\RSV infections). Mixed viral infections were more commonly detected in children (OR 3.7; 95%CI 1.9\\\\5.6, P < 0.01) and patients with comorbidities.

When the epidemic is ongoing, the population can reduce interactions between individuals in order to decrease the rate of transmission of the disease, and thus limit the epidemic. However, this effort comes at a cost for the population. Therefore, the government can put into place incentive policies to encourage the lockdown of the population. In addition, the government may also implement a testing policy in order to know more precisely the spread of the epidemic within the country, and to isolate infected individuals. We provide numerical examples, as well as an extension to a stochastic SEIR compartmental model to account for the relatively long latency period of the COVID-19 disease. The numerical results confirm the relevance of a tax and testing policy to improve the control of an epidemic. More precisely, if a tax policy is put into place, even in the absence of a specific testing policy, the population is encouraged to significantly reduce its interactions, thus limiting the spread of the disease. If the government also adjusts its testing policy, less effort is required on the population side, so individuals can interact almost as usual, and the epidemic is largely contained by the targeted isolation of positively-tested individuals.","output":"Incentives, lockdown, and testing: from Thucydides's analysis to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There exists considerable research which reports that mental health disparities persist among visible minority immigrants and refugees within Canada. Accessing mental health care services becomes a concern which contributes to this, as visible minority migrants are regarded as an at-risk group that are clinically underserved. Thus, the purpose of this review is to explore the following research question: \\"what are the barriers and facilitators for accessing mental health care services among visible immigrants and refugees in Canada?\\". A scoping review following guidelines proposed by Arksey and O'Malley (International Journal of Social Research Methodology 8(1): 19-32, 2005) was conducted. A total of 45 articles published from 2000 to 2020 were selected through the review process, and data from the retrieved articles was thematically analyzed. Wide range of barriers and facilitators were identified at both the systemic and individual levels. Unique differences rooted within landing and legal statuses were also highlighted within the findings to provide nuance amongst immigrants and refugees. With the main layered identity of being a considered a visible minority, this yielded unique challenges patterned by other identities and statuses. The interplay of structural issues rooted in Canadian health policies and immigration laws coupled with individual factors produce complex barriers and facilitators when seeking mental health services. Through employing a combined and multifaceted approach which address the identified factors, the findings also provide suggestions for mental health care providers, resettlement agencies, policy recommendations, and future directions for research are discussed as actionable points of departure.","output":"Systemic and Individual Factors That Shape Mental Health Service Usage Among Visible Minority Immigrants and Refugees in Canada: A Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use are an increasing concern. Deprescribing may improve medication use through planned and supervised dose reduction or stopping of medications. As most medication management occurs in primary health care, which is generally described as the first point of access for day-to-day care, deprescribing in primary health care is the focus on this review. OBJECTIVE This scoping review aimed to identify and characterize strategies for deprescribing in primary health care and map the strategies to the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW). METHODS A scoping review was conducted that involved searches of six databases (2002-2018) and reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and included studies. Studies that described and evaluated deprescribing strategies in primary health care were eligible. Two independent reviewers screened articles and completed data charting with charting verified by a third. Deprescribing strategies were mapped to the intervention functions of the BCW and linked to specific Behaviour Change Techniques (BCT). RESULTS Searches yielded 6871 citations of which 43 were included. Nineteen studies were randomized, 24 were non-randomized. Studies evaluated deprescribing in terms of medication changes, feasibility, and prescriber/patient perspectives. Deprescribing strategies involved various professionals (physicians, pharmacists, nurses), as well as patients and were generally multifaceted. A wide range of intervention functions were identified, with 41 BCTs mapped to Environmental restructuring, 38 BCTs mapped to Enablement, and 34 BCTs mapped to Persuasion. CONCLUSIONS Deprescribing strategies in primary health care have used a variety of BCTs to address individual professionals (e.g. education) as well as strategies that addressed the practice setting, including support from additional team members (e.g. pharmacists, nurses and patients). Further research is warranted to determine comparative effectiveness of different BCTs, which can help facilitate implementation of deprescribing strategies, thereby reducing polypharmacy, in primary health care.","output":"Deprescribing interventions in primary health care mapped to the Behaviour Change Wheel: A scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT In a year unlike any other in recent history, healthcare workers, including advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), faced challenges and triumphs as the frontline in the battle against COVID-19.

Along with vaccination, preventive behaviors are still an important part in controlling in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aimed to investigate health beliefs and sample characteristics associated with COVID-19 preventive health behaviors among an Iranian sample. Preventive behaviors are still an important part in controlling in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study, using a multi-stage randomized sampling method. Participants (N = 250 males and 236 females) were recruited from health centers in Saveh, Iran. Self-administered questionnaires included sociodemographic information, health behaviors, and constructs associated with the Health Beliefs Model (HBM). Data were analyzed using independent t-tests, analysis of variance, and multiple regression with significance level set at   0.05. RESULTS: Perceived disease susceptibility ( = 0.44, P< 0.001), self-efficacy to enact preventative behaviors ( = 0.24, P < 0.01), education ( = 0.20, P < 0.001), non-smoking status ( = 0.14, P < 0.01), marital status ( = 0.10, P < 0.03), and perceived barriers to disease preventative behaviors ( = -0.10, P < 0.04) were important predictors of prevention practices for COVID-19, and accounted for 61.4% (adjusted R(2)) of the variance associated with preventive behavior for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: As there is accepted therapy for COVID-19, it is especially important to control COVID-19 through behavior change. Results indicate that two behavioral constructs that have the most impact on prevention are perceived disease susceptibility and self-efficacy. Therefore, public health initiatives are needed to enhance perceived susceptibility to the disease and improve self-efficacy to perform preventative behaviors in spite of perceived barriers.","output":"Addressing the COVID-19 Pandemic in an Iranian Sample: Health Beliefs and Respondent Characteristics Associated with Preventive Behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The dissemination of new interventions in clinical practice remains challenging. E-learning may provide wide access in various settings and allow tailored learning trajectories and an adapted training pace. This study evaluates an online platform to train professionals to lead the Positive Emotion Program for Schizophrenia (PEPS) for patients with anhedonia. This study aims to test the reception provided by clinicians to the platform and its perceived usefulness and investigate whether e-PEPS training improves knowledge about the facilitation of PEPS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were recruited through advertisements. All participants provided their informed consent on a registration form and completed two pre-test questionnaires, a knowledge test on negative symptoms in schizophrenia, learning strategies and the partnership relationship, and a test on the ability to savor pleasant moments. After the training, they completed the same questionnaire and an evaluation form of the training and its application in personal and professional life. RESULTS: Two-hundred and ten participants were registered to participate into the study, 185 received the access to the platform, and 101 participants completed the training and the post-test assessments. Satisfaction with training was high. The results showed that the participants significantly improved their knowledge about PEPS and increased the skills taught in their personal repertoire after the training. The training allows most clinicians to plan to lead a PEPS group in the year following training.

The MCU is a 7C10 bed unit for children aged 7C15 years based on therapeutic milieu principles. The ward accepts patients via a planned national referral pathway, however, during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients were admitted as emergencies and consequently risk assessments were missed. Risk assessment is important in all admissions and as the MCU is not a locked unit, early risk assessment is particularly important. We aimed to review whether risk assessment occurred within one working day of admission, as suggested by the ward risk assessment policy, and if this was not the case, our aim was to ensure that all risk assessments took place within this period via our audit interventions. METHOD: 1. Posters prompting doctors who were providing on-call liaison input to perform a risk assessment within one working day of admission. 2. New junior doctors were provided with written and verbal information to emphasise the importance of early risk assessment. 3. Guidelines also highlight that assessment of risk may need to be on-going. We therefore added a prompt section in the weekly ward round proforma with the aim of reducing the interval between risk assessments during admission. The first audit cycle was conducted on the 3/8/2020 and the second on the 28/11/21 to allow for a comparative number of inpatients between the first and second audit cycle. RESULT: We found these interventions significantly reduced delays in risk assessments. Prior to the audit's first cycle the average delay between admission to GOSH/MCU and a risk assessment was 2 weeks. After the interventions there were no patients whose risk assessment was delayed outside the next working day parameters. CONCLUSION: This full cycle audit demonstrates the impact that prompts to clinical practice can make on patient care. It is important to recognise the need for flexible risk assessment with regular review, especially at times of clinical change. We hope that this continued trend for early risk assessment leads to improved clinical care and timely discussion of risk for all new CAMHS inpatients at GOSH.","output":"Improving risk assessments for CAMHS admissions at Great Ormond Street Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Bronchitis is a common respiratory tract infection of humans mainly caused by influenza virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus. The aim of this review was to gather fragmented literature on ethnomedicinal plants used against bronchitis in the Himalayan region and their in\\\\vitro validation against bronchitis causing viral pathogens. KEY FINDINGS: Present review contains ethnomedicines of total 55 plants from different countries of the Himalayas. Most of the literature reported was from India followed by Pakistan, China and Nepal. Familiarly used plant families for bronchitis treatment in the Himalayan region were Leguminosae (six plants) and Lamiaceae (five plants). Leaves and roots were the most common parts used in ethnomedicines against bronchitis. Of these 55 plants, only six plants have been studied in vitro against viral pathogens causing bronchitis. Different compounds like monoterpenoids, flavonoids, triterpenoids, iridoid glycosides, sesquiterpenes, benzoic and phenolic compounds were reportedly isolated from these plant extracts having strong antiviral potential.

Existing evidence shows that substance use and related harms differ by gender. Yet, no Canadian study has applied a gendered lens to alcohol and cannabis consumption use during this time. Our objectives were to (1) provide gender-specific prevalence estimates of self-reported increased alcohol and cannabis use; and (2) examine gender-specific associations between sociodemographic and mental health variables and alcohol and cannabis use. METHODS: Using data from the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health, we calculated nationally representative, gender-specific prevalence estimates and disaggregated them by sociodemographic and mental health variables. Four logistic regression models were used to assess the likelihood of self-reported increased alcohol and cannabis use. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported increase in alcohol use (16.2% women; 15.2% men) and cannabis use (4.9% women; 5.8% men) did not differ by gender. For both genders, income, racialized group membership, working in the past week, being a parent/legal guardian of a child aged under 18 and screening positive for depression and anxiety were associated with increased alcohol use. Men and women who were between the ages of 18 to 44, screened positive for depression, or both, were more likely to report increased cannabis use. For women, education was significantly associated with increased alcohol use. For men, being a parent/legal guardian was significantly associated with lower odds of increased cannabis use.

Enteric viruses may originate from human wastewater and can undergo rapid transport through aquatic environments with minimal decay. Surveillance and source apportionment of enteric viruses in environmental waters is therefore essential for accurate risk management. However, individual monitoring of the >100 enteric viral strains that have been identified as aquatic contaminants is unfeasible. Instead, viral indicators are often used for quantitative assessments of wastewater contamination, viral decay and transport in water. An ideal indicator for tracking wastewater contamination should be (i) easy to detect and quantify, (ii) source-specific, (iii) resistant to wastewater treatment processes, and (iv) persistent in the aquatic environment, with similar behaviour to viral pathogens. Here, we conducted a comprehensive review of 127 peer-reviewed publications, to critically evaluate the effectiveness of several viral indicators of wastewater pollution, including common enteric viruses (mastadenoviruses, polyomaviruses, and Aichi viruses), the pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), and gut-associated bacteriophages (Type II/III FRNA phages and phages infecting human Bacteroides species, including crAssphage). Our analysis suggests that overall, human mastadenoviruses have the greatest potential to indicate contamination by domestic wastewater due to their easy detection, culturability, and high prevalence in wastewater and in the polluted environment. Aichi virus, crAssphage and PMMoV are also widely detected in wastewater and in the environment, and may be used as molecular markers for human-derived contamination. We conclude that viral indicators are suitable for the long-term monitoring of viral contamination in freshwater and marine environments and that these should be implemented within monitoring programmes to provide a holistic assessment of microbiological water quality and wastewater-based epidemiology, improve current risk management strategies and protect global human health.","output":"Viral indicators for tracking domestic wastewater contamination in the aquatic environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which leads to severe respiratory infections in humans COVID-19 was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan city, a populated area of the Hubei province in China As of now, Wuhan and other cities nearby have become safe places for locals The rapid control of the spread of COVID-19 infection was made possible due to several interventions and measures that were undertaken in Wuhan This narrative review study was designed to evaluate the emerging literature on the combined measures taken to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan city Science Direct, Springer, Web of Science, and the PubMed data repositories were searched for studies published between December 1, 2019, and June 07, 2020 The referred preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) protocol was used to conduct this narrative review A total of 330 research studies were found as a result of the initial search based on exclusion and inclusion criteria, and 30 articles were chosen on final evaluation It was discovered that the combined measures to control the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan included cordon sanitaire, social distancing, universal symptom surveys, quarantine strategies, and transport restrictions Based on the recommendations presented in this review study, existing policies with regard to combined measures and public health policies can be enforced by other countries to implement a rapid control procedure to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Combined Measures to Control the COVID-19 Pandemic in Wuhan, Hubei, China: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chloroquine (CQ) and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are weak bases with a half-century long use as antimalarial agents. Apart from this antimalarial activity, CQ and HCQ have gained interest in the field of other infectious diseases. One of the most interesting mechanisms of action is that CQ leads to alkalinisation of acid vesicles that inhibit the growth of several intracellular bacteria and fungi. The proof of concept of this effect was first used to restore intracellular pH allowing antibiotic efficacy for Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, and doxycycline plus HCQ is now the reference treatment for chronic Q fever. There is also strong evidence of a similar effect in vitro against Tropheryma whipplei, the agent of Whipple's disease, and a clinical trial is in progress. Other bacteria and fungi multiply in an acidic environment and encouraging in vitro data suggest that this concept may be generalised for all intracellular organisms that multiply in an acidic environment. For viruses, CQ led to inhibition of uncoating and/or alteration of post-translational modifications of newly synthesised proteins, especially inhibition of glycosylation. These effects have been well described in vitro for many viruses, with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) being the most studied. Preliminary in vivo clinical trials suggest that CQ alone or in combination with antiretroviral drugs might represent an interesting way to treat HIV infection.

Over the past few years, the world has seen several outbreaks caused by viral diseases that for a long time seemed to possess no risk. These are diseases that have been forgotten for a long time and, until nowadays, there are no approved drugs or vaccines, leading the pharmaceutical industry and several research groups to run out of time in the search for new pharmacological treatments or prevention methods. In this context, drug repurposing proves to be a fast and economically viable technique, considering the fact that it uses drugs that have a well-established safety profile. Thus, in this review, we present the main advances in drug repurposing and their benefit for searching new treatments against emerging viral diseases. METHODS We conducted a search in the bibliographic databases (Science Direct, Bentham Science, PubMed, Springer, ACS Publisher, Wiley, and NIH's COVID-19 Portfolio) using the keywords 'drug repurposing', 'emerging viral infections' and each of the diseases reported here (CoV; ZIKV; DENV; CHIKV; EBOV and MARV) as an inclusion/exclusion criterion. A subjective analysis was performed regarding the quality of the works for inclusion in this manuscript. Thus, the selected works were those that presented drugs repositioned against the emerging viral diseases presented here by means of computational, high-throughput screening or phenotype-based strategies, with no time limit and of relevant scientific value. RESULTS 291 papers were selected, 24 of which were CHIKV; 52 for ZIKV; 43 for DENV; 35 for EBOV; 10 for MARV; and 56 for CoV and the rest (72 papers) related to the drugs repurposing and emerging viral diseases. Among CoV-related articles, most were published in 2020 (31 papers), updating the current topic. Besides, between the years 2003 - 2005, 10 articles were created, and from 2011 - 2015 there were 7 articles, portraying the outbreaks that occurred at that time. For ZIKV, similar to CoV, most publications were during the period of outbreaks between the years 2016 - 2017 (23 articles). Similarly, most CHIKV (13 papers) and DENV (14 papers) publications occur at the same time interval. For EBOV (13 papers) and MARV (4 papers), they were between the years 2015 - 2016. Through this review, several drugs were highlighted that can be evolved in vivo and clinical trials as possible used against these pathogens showed that remdesivir represent potential treatments against CoV. Furthermore, ribavirin may also be a potential treatment against CHIKV; sofosbuvir against ZIKV; celgosivir against DENV, and favipiravir against EBOV and MARV, representing new hopes against these pathogens. CONCLUSIONS The conclusions of this review manuscript show the potential of the drug repurposing strategy in the discovery of new pharmaceutical products, as from this approach, drugs that could be used against emerging viral diseases. Thus, this strategy deserves more attention among research groups and is a promising approach to the discovery of new drugs against emerging viral diseases and also other diseases.","output":"Drug Repurposing: A Strategy for Discovering Inhibitors against Emerging Viral Infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Endovascular thrombectomy has shown promise for the treatment of acute strokes resulting from large-vessel occlusion. Reperfusion-related injury may contribute to the observed decoupling of angiographic and clinical outcomes. Iatrogenic disruption of the endothelium during thrombectomy is potentially a key mediator of this process that requires further study. METHODS An in vitro live-cell platform was developed to study the effect of various commercially available endovascular devices on the endothelium. In vivo validation was performed using porcine subjects. RESULTS This novel in vitro platform permitted high-resolution quantification and characterization of the pattern and timing of endothelial-cell injury among endovascular thrombectomy devices and vessel diameters. Thrombectomy devices displayed heterogeneous effects on the endothelium; the device performance assessed in vitro was substantiated by in vivo findings. CONCLUSIONS In vitro live-cell artificial vessel modeling enables a detailed study of the endothelium after thrombectomy and may contribute to future device design. Large animal studies confirm the relevance of this in vitro system to investigate endothelial physiology. This artificial vessel model may represent a practical, scalable, and physiologically relevant system to assess new endovascular technologies.","output":"Endothelial trauma from mechanical thrombectomy in acute stroke: in vitro live-cell platform with animal validation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 disease is a systemic infection associated with renal damage leading to acute kidney injury with acute tubular necrosis and several types of podocytopathies.

This study aims to assess the major implications of COVID\\\\19 on our department, focusing on the blood transfusion chain and therapies, in order to support transfusion specialists in seeking efficient ways to face similar future emergencies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study compares our Transfusion Medicine Unit data collected between February and May 2020 with the same period in 2017C2019. Data on red blood cells and platelets donations, transfusions and clinical procedures were collected as aggregates from our internal electronic database. RESULTS: During the lockdown, donor centres were re\\\\organized to reduce the risk of contagion and avoid unnecessary blood collection. Blood donations were re\\\\scheduled to meet the decrease in elective surgery; consequently, plateletapheresis was implemented to supply the reduction of buffycoat\\\\derived platelets. Transfusions significantly decreased together with orthopaedic and vascular surgery, while they were only marginally diminished for both cancer and onco\\\\haematological patients. Reduced procedures for inpatients and outpatients were matched by remote medicine, addressing the need of a constant healthcare support for patients with chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The described measures were adopted to avoid excessive blood collection and expiration, guarantee the safety of our ward (for both patients and staff) and supply the necessary transfusion therapies.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and osteoporosis often co-exist in older adults, and they present a major healthcare challenge. CKD mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) occurs as renal function declines and this syndrome affects most patients in CKD stages 4 and 5. The biochemical abnormalities of CKD-MBD, renal bone disease and risk factors associated with age-related bone loss and osteoporosis lead to a cumulative effect on fracture risk and mortality. There is a need for routine evaluation of fracture risk and fracture prevention in this population. Measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) and the use of the FRAX tool have predictive value for incident fractures in the general population and in CKD. This enables physicians to identify CKD patients most at risk of sustaining a fragility fracture and allows a more targeted approach to fracture prevention. Data analysis from the pivotal trials of therapeutic agents used in osteoporosis show that these drugs can be considered in mild and moderate CKD (stages 1-3 CKD). Off-label drug use in patients with CKD-MBD and more severe renal impairment (CKD stages 4 and 5) could offer significant benefits to sub-groups of patients when carefully tailored to each individual's bone turnover and calcium and phosphate balance. However, this requires a selective approach and treatment decisions based on inference from pathophysiology while we await further trials. Guidelines advocate the correction and/or reduction of the biochemical abnormalities of CKD-MBD before initiation of treatment with osteoporosis drugs and close monitoring during treatment.","output":"A review and perspective on the assessment, management and prevention of fragility fractures in patients with osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The HIV/AIDS pandemic still represents an important global health issue.

In this study, we characterized NK cell phenotype and function during acute and chronic HIV infection and also investigated markers of immunosenescence in these cells. Our results showed that chronic infected patients remained with elevated levels of some plasma inflammatory molecules (IP-10, sCD14) and a concurrent expansion of the non-functional NK cell subset (CD3-CD56-CD16+). NK cells from the chronic infected group displayed an activated profile with higher levels of cytokines and chemokines production (TNF-, IL-12, IFN-2, IFN-, IL-6, RANTES, MCP-1, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-5). The production of these molecules was positively correlated to the time of infection. Moreover, we noted a possible association of higher global DNA methylation frequency of NK cells in two HIV patients in the advanced stage of disease.

DESIGN: Observational study of nurse hand hygiene practices. SETTING: and Participants: Licensed practical/vocational and registered nurses were observed in the homes of patients being served by a large nonprofit HHC agency. METHODS: Two researchers observed 400 home care visits conducted by 50 nurses. The World Health Organization's 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene validated observation tool was used to record opportunities and actual practices of hand hygiene, with 3 additional opportunities specific to the HHC setting. Patient assessment data available in the agency electronic health record and a nurse demographic questionnaire were also collected to describe patients and nurse participants. RESULTS: A total of 2014 opportunities were observed. On arrival in the home was the most frequent opportunity (n = 384), the least frequent was after touching a patient's surroundings (n = 43). The average hand hygiene adherence rate was 45.6% after adjusting for clustering at the nurse level. Adherence was highest after contact with body fluid (65.1%) and lowest after touching a patient (29.5%). The number of hand hygiene opportunities was higher when patients being served were at increased risk of an infection-related emergency department visit or hospitalization and when the home environment was observed to be dirty. No nurse or patient demographic characteristics were associated with the rate of nurse hand hygiene adherence. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Hand hygiene adherence in HHC is suboptimal, with rates mirroring those reported in hospital and outpatient settings.

SA has committed to a COVID?19 vaccine roll-out in three phases, prioritising frontline workers, the elderly, people with comorbidities and essential workers. However, additional actions will be necessary to support efficient allocation and equitable access for vulnerable, access-constrained communities. OBJECTIVES To explore various determinants of disease severity, resurgence risk and accessibility in order to aid an equitable, effective vaccine roll-out for SA that would maximise COVID?19 epidemic control by reducing the number of COVID?19 transmissions and resultant deaths, while at the same time reducing the risk of vaccine wastage. METHODS For the 52 districts of SA, 26 COVID?19 indicators such as hospital admissions, deaths in hospital and mobility were ranked and hierarchically clustered with cases to identify which indicators can be used as indicators for severity or resurgence risk. Districts were then ranked using the estimated COVID?19 severity and resurgence risk to assist with prioritisation of vaccine roll-out. Urban and rural accessibility were also explored as factors that could limit vaccine roll-out in hard-to-reach communities. RESULTS Highly populated urban districts showed the most cases. Districts such as Buffalo City, City of Cape Town and Nelson Mandela Bay experienced very severe first and second waves of the pandemic. Districts with high mobility, population size and density were found to be at highest risk of resurgence. In terms of accessibility, we found that 47.2% of the population are within 5 km of a hospital with 50 beds, and this percentage ranged from 87.0% in City of Cape Town to 0% in Namakwa district. CONCLUSIONS The end goal is to provide equal distribution of vaccines proportional to district populations, which will provide fair protection. Districts with a high risk of resurgence and severity should be prioritised for vaccine roll-out, particularly the major metropolitan areas. We provide recommendations for allocations of different vaccine types for each district that consider levels of access, numbers of doses and cold-chain storage capability.","output":"Guiding equitable prioritisation of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and strategic deployment in South Africa to enhance effectiveness and access to vulnerable communities and prevent waste."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many cancer patients not responding to current immunotherapies fail to produce tumor-specific T cells for various reasons, such as a lack of recognition of cancer cells as foreign.

We found that xenogenized tumor cells were readily recognized and engulfed by dendritic cells; thereby, tumor antigens were efficiently presented to T lymphocytes. Moreover, exosome-VSV-G itself acts as a TLR4 agonist and stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells, leading to CD8+ T cell cross-priming. The administration of these exosomes in multiple tumor mouse models xenogenized tumor cells, resulting in tumor growth inhibition. The combinatorial treatment with anti-PD-L1 exhibited complete tumor regression (30%) and better long-term overall survival.

An online, cross-sectional, and self-administered questionnaire was instrumentalized to survey adult participants from Jordan on the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analysis was used to find the predictors of COVID-19 vaccines acceptability. A total of 3,100 participants completed the survey. The public acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines was fairly low (37.4%) in Jordan. Males (OR = 2.488, 95CI% = 1.834C3.375, p < .001) and those who took the seasonal influenza vaccine (OR = 2.036, 95CI% = 1.306C3.174, p = .002) were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines.

The present study envisaged in silico molecular docking as well as in vitro antimicrobial efficacy screening of identified phytochemical ligands to the dispersin (aap) and outer membrane osmoporin (OmpC) domains of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. (NTS), respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The evaluation of drug-likeness, molecular properties, and bioactivity of the identified phytocompounds (thymol, carvacrol, and cinnamaldehyde) was carried out using Swiss ADME, while Protox-II and StopTox servers were used to identify its toxicity. The in silico molecular docking of the phytochemical ligands with the protein motifs of dispersin (PDB ID: 2jvu) and outer membrane osmoporin (PDB ID: 3uu2) were carried out using AutoDock v.4.20. Further, the antimicrobial efficacy of these compounds against multi-drug resistant EAEC and NTS strains was determined by estimating the minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations. Subsequently, these phytochemicals were subjected to their safety (sheep and human erythrocytic haemolysis) as well as stability (cationic salts, and pH) assays. RESULTS: All the three identified phytochemicals ligands were found to be zero violators of Lipinskis rule of five and exhibited drug-likeness. The compounds tested were categorized as toxicity class-4 by Protox-II and were found to be non- cardiotoxic by StopTox. The docking studies employing 3D model of dispersin and ompC motifs with the identified phytochemical ligands exhibited good binding affinity. The identified phytochemical compounds were observed to be comparatively stable at different conditions (cationic salts, and pH); however, a concentration-dependent increase in the haemolytic assay was observed against sheep as well as human erythrocytes.

Despite its similarity to related coronaviruses, there are currently no specific treatments for COVID-19 infection, and therefore there is an urgent need to develop therapies for this and future coronavirus outbreaks. Formation of the cap at the 5' end of viral RNA has been shown to help coronaviruses evade host defenses. Nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) is responsible for N7-methylation of the cap guanosine in coronaviruses. This enzyme is highly conserved among coronaviruses and is a bifunctional protein with both N7-methyltransferase and 3'-5' exonuclease activities that distinguish nsp14 from its human equivalent. Mutational analysis of SARS-CoV nsp14 highlighted its role in viral replication and translation efficiency of the viral genome. In this paper, we describe the characterization and development of a high-throughput assay for nsp14 utilizing RapidFire technology. The assay has been used to screen a library of 1771 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. From this, we have validated nitazoxanide as a selective inhibitor of the methyltransferase activity of nsp14. Although modestly active, this compound could serve as a starting point for further optimization.","output":"Development of a High-Throughput Screening Assay to Identify Inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 Guanine-N7-Methyltransferase Using RapidFire Mass Spectrometry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is an abruptly transmitting disease which started from Wuhan, China that not only infects humans but also animals. It has affected approximately 82.1 M people worldwide to date, according to statistics. People's day by day lives, their wellbeing and the economy of the nation are influenced by this destructive viral infection. It is a typical irresistible sickness thus far, and not a solitary nation could set up a fruitful antibody for it. Contaminated patients with Coronavirus have demonstrated that these kinds of patients are generally tainted with lung disease upon contact with the illness. The Gold Standard for coronavirus is Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction controls for COVID-19 diagnosis (RT-PCR). Nevertheless, the RT-PCR test facility is sluggish, rendering early detection of the disease difficult. More effective and readily available imaging methods for diagnosing lung-related conditions are chest X-ray (i.e., radiography) and chest CT scan. However, in comparison to chest CT scans, significantly chest X-ray is a lower cost procedure. In addition, we demonstrate in this study how convolutional neural network (CNN) can be useful for using chest X-ray images to detect Covid-19. In addition, we took the pre-analyzed view of CNN models and compared their performance after cleaning the images and applying data augmentation to Covid-19 affected chest X-ray scans of patients along with healthy patients. We trained it on 907 samples to evaluate the output of the model and tested it on 101 samples.

The driving pressure (P) and the mechanical power of ventilation (MP) are associated with patient-centered outcomes like mortality and duration of ventilation. The objective of this study was to assess the predictive validity for mortality of the P and the MP at 24 h after start of invasive ventilation. METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of an observational study in intensive care unit patients, restricted to critically ill patients receiving invasive ventilation for at least 24 h. The two exposures of interest were the modified P and the MP at 24 h after start of invasive ventilation. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality; secondary outcomes were ICU and hospital mortality. The predictive validity was measured as incremental 90-day mortality beyond that predicted by the Acute Physiology, Age and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV score and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II. RESULTS: The analysis included 839 patients with a 90-day mortality of 42%. The median modified P at 24 h was 15 [interquartile range 12 to 19] cm H(2)O; the median MP at 24 h was 206 [interquartile range 145 to 298] 10(?3) J/min/kg predicted body weight (PBW).

However, few studies have analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on adolescent travel behavior. This article analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on adolescent travel behavior using questionnaire survey data. METHODS: This paper first used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to explore the psychological factors related to the adolescents' perceptions about the severity of COVID-19. The study then established a logit model to study the effects of COVID-19 in different phases (before, during, and after the epidemic peak), demographic characteristics, and the role of psychological factors on their travel behavior. RESULTS: The results show that the phase of COVID-19 did not significantly impact the adolescents' choice of short-distance travel. The frequency of outings per week, the number of exercise sessions per week, and willingness to travel by public transportation decreased significantly in the outbreak phase. Meanwhile, the perception of the severity of COVID-19 significantly impacted adolescent travel behavior.

The study aimed to determine the predictive potential of elevated serum inflammatory markers in determining the need for intubation in CoVID-19 Patients. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study of hospitalised SARS-CoV2 positive patients, single and multivariable regression analyses were used to determine covariate effects on intubation odds, and a minimax concave penalty regularised logistic regression was used to build a predictive model. A second prospective independent cohort tested the model. RESULTS: Systemic inflammatory markers obtained at admission were higher in patients that required subsequent intubation, and adjusted odds of intubation increased for every standard deviation above the mean for c-reactive protein (CRP) OR:2.8 (95% CI 1.8-4.5, p<0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase OR:2.1 (95% CI 1.33.3, p=0.002). A predictive model incorporating C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and diabetes status at the time of admission predicted intubation status with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 with corresponding sensitivity of 86%, specificity of 63%. This predictive model achieved an AUC of 0.83, 91% sensitivity, and 41% specificity on the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: In patients hospitalised with CoVID-19, elevated serum inflammatory markers measured within the first twenty-four hours of admission are associated with an increased need for intubation.

METHODS A representative sample of women recruited through a commercial social research sampling organisation completed a detailed online questionnaire about menstruation. Specific detailed questions were asked about perceptions of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and menstrual pain. RESULTS The questionnaire was completed by 1575 women aged 20-39 years. Most perceived their bleeding to be light (11.6%) or moderate (60.5%); 363 (22.5%) perceived it to be heavy and 86 (5.3%) very heavy. Women who experienced severe or very severe menstrual pain were significantly more likely to report periods as heavy or very heavy (p < .001). The prevalence ratios for being confined to bed during menstruation for women experiencing severe or very severe menstrual pain were 12.02 (95% CI: 5.71-25.31) and 15.93 (95% CI: 7.51-33.78), respectively, compared with women experiencing no pain. The prevalence ratios for being confined to bed were 1.58 (95% CI: 1.11-2.24) and 1.53 (95% CI: 1.04-2.25) for women with heavy or very heavy bleeding, respectively. Women who experienced severe or very severe menstrual pain associated with their HMB were >12 times more likely to be confined to bed for 0.5-1 day during menstruation than if they reported HMB without pain.

Previous research has concentrated on the direct effect of physician-patient communication on service outcomes. In the present study, we examined the influence among constructs in the service process and the impact on healthcare outcomes. The present study used behavioral theory to expand the process aspect of the Donabedian healthcare service quality structure-process-outcome model to examine the impact of cognitive changes and communication feedback on patients' adherence behavior. In addition, the moderating effect of hospital facility levels is examined. METHODS A conceptual model was developed and tested using a questionnaire administered to patients in eight hospitals. A total of 397 respondents returned usable surveys, with a response rate of 92.11%. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data in two steps that involved a measurement model and a structural model. The former was applied to estimate the Cronbach's alphas, intercorrelations of factors, and descriptive statistics; the latter was used to test the hypothesized relationships of the constructs. RESULTS The results identified three mediators of the healthcare process within the healthcare services framework: physician-patient communication, cognitive efficacy, and adherence behavior. Physician-patient communication influenced cognitive efficacy ( = 0.16, p < 0.001), and cognitive efficacy influenced physician-patient communication ( = 0.18, p < 0.001). The effect of this bidirectional relationship on adherence behavior was positive ( = 0.38, p < 0.001). The healthcare structure influenced healthcare outcomes via these three healthcare process constructs. The adherence behavior of patients who were treated in the medical center has greater influences by the structure and physician-patient communication than it was treated in the regional hospitals.

Methods: We recruited 114 participants in total who had potential symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Participants were recruited from rheumatology or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) clinics from their records who attended a London Teaching hospital for care. Ethical Approval was in place for the study. Age-and gender-matched control participants without any underlying rheumatological condition/IBD were recruited as a comparator group. Clinical symptoms for COVID-19 infection were assessed using the COVID-19 Rheumatology Global Alliance assessment criteria (https://rheum-covid.org/). Information about Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARD) drug use was also recorded. Participants' serum samples were collected for quantitative serological assessment of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using the Mologic Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA) IgG kit. The optical density values were plotted aganist time using a normalisation as previously described (1). A cut-off above 0 indicated positive serology. Results: A total of 114 subjects were recruited into the study. Subjects were recruited if they had suspected Covid symptoms. Of the population recruited, the total number subsequently testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was n=59 (either on serology or PCR). The number of subjects with autoimmune conditions diagnosed with COVID-19 was 32, with 30 subjects being symptomatic (the asymptomatic 2 subjects were excluded from further analyses). Of the 30 symptomatic subjects, the average age was 56, with a female to male ratio of 19:11. The most prevalent diagnoses were RA (30%), Psoriatic Arthritis (16.7%), SLE (10%), sarcoidosis 10%), Ulcerative Colitis (10%), Crohn's disease (10%), seronegative inflammatory arthritis (6.7%), Sjogren's (3.3%) and Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (3.3%). The majority were on csDMARDs (60%), biologic DMARDs (20%), tacrolimus (3.3%) and the remaining 16.7% were not on DMARDs. Most subjects required treatment in hospital (56.7%), a smaller number required high dependency care (6.7%) and the rest were treated at home (36.6%). The majority required no oxygen (63.3%), with a further 30% requiring oxygen and 6.7% needed more supportive care i.e. CPAP/ventilation. We also had a matched control group (n=29) of subjects who developed SARS-CoV-2 but had no underlying autoimmune conditions. These subjects had a mean age of 55, female: male ratio 18: 11. Of these 31% had home management, 55.2% had ward level treatments and 13.8% had intensive care treatment. Of the controls, 48.3% did not require oxygen, 37.9% needed simple oxygen and 13.8% were on CPAP. A total of 35 subjects from the original study have attended for follow-up visits. Antibody titres for IgG using the Mologic ELISA detection assay were compared at two visits for the control and autoimmune group. Results showed that subjects with autoimmune conditions and those without who developed SARS-CoV-2 showed very similar antibody titres by optical density (OD) (Figure 1) and maintained antibody responses beyond 6 months in most cases.

RESULTS: Intestinal microsporidiosis was prevalent among 14.2% (57/402) of HIV/AIDS patients and was significantly associated with diarrhea (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.7C6.6; P = 0.001). The significant independent predictors of infection were < 200 CD4 cells/l (AOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.5C6.9; P = 0.003), not washing hands after contacting soil (AOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1C5.4; P = 0.026) and before eating (AOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5C6.4; P = 0.003), eating unwashed raw produce (AOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2C5.3; P = 0.017) and absence of indoor latrines (AOR 6.2, 95% CI 1.5C25.9; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of intestinal microsporidiosis among HIV/AIDS patients in Sana'a is high and comparable to that reported from several other countries, being prevalent among approximately 14.0% of patients and significantly associated with diarrhea. It could be predicted among patients who have < 200 CD4 cells/l, have poor hand hygiene after contacting soil and before eating, usually eat unwashed raw produce, or do not possess indoor latrines. Large-scale studies on its epidemiology and predictors among HIV/AIDS patients across the country are warranted.","output":"Intestinal microsporidiosis among HIV/AIDS patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in Sanaa city, Yemen: first report on prevalence and predictors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite a mounting evidentiary base, controversies surrounding critical care nutrition support persist.

This led to a concern that loneliness may increase, facilitating poorer mental and physical health. Twenty qualitative interviews were conducted, with a diverse group of UK-based men, between January and March 2021, during severe restrictions. Our aim was to generate new insights into men's experience of loneliness during the pandemic, and consider the ramifications of these for continued/future restrictions, the easing of restrictions, and the future beyond the pandemic. Thematic analysis, focused on semantic themes, was employed as part of a 'grounded' epistemology whereby the stated perspectives of the interviewees drove the content of the study. Six themes were constructed: i) people to see and things to do (broken, changed, and new); ii) rethought and renewed recognition of what is important; iii) loneliness with a purpose; iv) loneliness as normal; v) anxiety of social contact; and vi) easier for some than others. The restrictions did cause some loneliness, particularly because of lost routines and opportunities, and the reduction in face-to-face interaction. However, a need to reduce transmission of SARS-COV-2, and a fear of catching it, became important features of participants lives that also affected loneliness and its causes. Remote forms of interaction were often utilised, and though they were imperfect, those that were dependable, were smaller than might be desired in person, and ensured a chance to speak, were constructed as more positive. The fear of Covid-19, and a loss of social skills, may mean that reducing restrictions alone will not return everyone to pre-pandemic levels of loneliness. Some believed the building of supportive local communities, and a destigmatisation of loneliness, may allow for the building of a more compassionate and less lonely society.","output":"Men and loneliness in the Covid-19 pandemic: insights from an interview study with UK-based men"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Complete cytoreductive surgery (CCRS) plus Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the best-known treatment for pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP).

This study describes the surgical resections required for CCRS and the consequent approaches that we propose to achieve CCRS. MATERIALS AND METHODS We defined \\"huge PMP\\" by a peritoneal cancer index (PCI)  28. Surgical procedures of patients operated on between 1994 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed from a prospective database in a single institution. RESULTS During this period, 311 patients were operated on and 247 (79%) underwent CCRS + HIPEC. Among them, 100 patients presented \\"huge\\" PMP and 54 patients underwent CCRS + HIPEC. In patients with \\"huge\\" PMP, the rate of CCRS + HIPEC was 25% before 2002 and reached 71% between 2011 and 2014. We identified 3 conditions for CCRS 1) to guaranty a sufficient length of residual small bowel 2) to preserve the left gastric vessels in order to preserve the superior third of the stomach 3) to ensure that the hepatic pedicle can be entirely cleared from its tumor involvement. None of the other peritonectomy procedures were decisional for CCRS. CONCLUSION Our learning curve improved the selection and completion rate of CCRS + HIPEC for \\"huge PMP\\".

The structures and properties of the obtained fibers were characterized with SEM, XRD, DSC, contact angle, and tensile strength analyses. Results indicate that fibers with uniform diameters can be conveniently fabricated by designing a spinneret. The obtained fibers showed no apparent change in crystallization compared to PBAT pellets, while the thermal stability and mechanical properties of PBAT/HBP fibers were dependent on the HBP ratio in fibers. More importantly, the obtained fibers gradually changed from hydrophobic to super-hydrophilic with increasing HBP content in fibers up to 30%.

The gluten-free diet was associated with a reduced anti-tetanus IgG response, and it increased the relative abundance of the anti-inflammatory Bifidobacterium significantly in some of the mice. Antibiotics also led to gut microbiota changes and lower initial vaccine titer. After a second vaccination, neither gluten-free diet nor antibiotics reduced the titers. In the spleen, the gluten-free diet significantly increased regulatory T cell (T(reg)) fractions, CD4(+) T cell activation, and tolerogenic dendritic cell fractions and activation, which extend the downregulating effect of the T(reg). Therefore, the systemic effect of the gluten-free diet seems mainly tolerogenic. Antibiotics reduced the fractions of CD4(+) T and B cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes. These results suggest that vaccine response in mice is under influence of their diet, the gut microbiota and the interplay between them. However, a gluten-free diet seems to work through mechanisms different from those induced by antibiotics. Therefore, diet should be considered when testing vaccines in mice and developing vaccines for humans.","output":"Effect of gluten-free diet and antibiotics on murine gut microbiota and immune response to tetanus vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: COVID-19-associated rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) has reached epidemic proportion during India's second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, with several risk factors being implicated in its pathogenesis. This study aimed to determine the patient demographics, risk factors including comorbidities, and medications used to treat COVID-19, presenting symptoms and signs, and the outcome of management. Methods: This was a retrospective, observational study of patients with COVID-19-associated ROCM managed or co-managed by ophthalmologists in India from January 1, 2020 to May 26, 2021. Results: Of the 2826 patients, the states of Gujarat (22%) and Maharashtra (21%) reported the highest number of ROCM. The mean age of patients was 51.9 years with a male preponderance (71%). While 57% of the patients needed oxygen support for COVID-19 infection, 87% of the patients were treated with corticosteroids, (21% for > 10 days). Diabetes mellitus (DM) was present in 78% of all patients. Most of the cases showed onset of symptoms of ROCM between day 10 and day 15 from the diagnosis of COVID-19, 56% developed within 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, while 44% had delayed onset beyond 14 days. Orbit was involved in 72% of patients, with stage 3c forming the bulk (27%). Overall treatment included intravenous amphotericin B in 73%, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)/paranasal sinus (PNS) debridement in 56%, orbital exenteration in 15%, and both FESS/PNS debridement and orbital exenteration in 17%. Intraorbital injection of amphotericin B was administered in 22%. At final follow-up, mortality was 14%. Disease stage >3b had poorer prognosis. Paranasal sinus debridement and orbital exenteration reduced the mortality rate from 52% to 39% in patients with stage 4 disease with intracranial extension (p < 0.05). Conclusion: : Corticosteroids and DM are the most important predisposing factors in the development of COVID-19-associated ROCM. COVID-19 patients must be followed up beyond recovery. Awareness of red flag symptoms and signs, high index of clinical suspicion, prompt diagnosis, and early initiation of treatment with amphotericin B, aggressive surgical debridement of the PNS, and orbital exenteration, where indicated, are essential for successful outcome.","output":"Epidemiology, clinical profile, management, and outcome of COVID-19-associated rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis in 2826 patients in India - Collaborative OPAI-IJO Study on Mucormycosis in COVID-19 (COSMIC), Report 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Balkan nephropathy is a chronic kidney disease of a completely unknown etiology.

On the one hand, demographic change is increasing patient demand, but on the other hand, it is also reducing physician density. In this context, telemedicine opens up new potentials for care. This study explores the possibilities of digitalization in family care with diverse stakeholders. The most important element of this work is to explore the attitudes towards telemedical supplementary options in primary care. In doing so, the chances and concerns of both general practitioners and citizens will be analyzed. The aim is to find out possibilities which can relieve GPs and support the health care provision in rural regions in the long term. METHODOLOGY AND MATERIAL: A mixed-methods design combines findings from qualitative semi-structured guided interviews with general practitioners (N=8) with a quantitative citizen survey (N=1,276) in a rural region. RESULTS: Concern about future health care provision is high among physicians and citizens. Although physicians see a need for action and opportunities through telemedicine measures, they also raise clear concerns about the doctor-patient relationship. The citizens are principally open to various telemedical options and can imagine using simple services such as e-prescription and e-appointment booking. DISCUSSION: These results can serve as a basis for the further development of digital offerings of family doctors' offices as well as other model projects in rural regions, if they guarantee low-threshold access, are implemented in cooperation with doctors and patients and do not endanger the established doctor-patient relationship. CONCLUSION: There are major concerns about the future of family physician care, especially in rural areas. The COVID-19 pandemic opens up opportunities for digitization across age boundaries. However, telemedicine care can initially only have a supplementary role. Low-threshold offerings in close cooperation with the family doctor are particularly promising here.","output":"[Cross-regional telemedicine services as a supplement to rural primary care: A mixed-methods analysis]./ berregionale telemedizinische Erg?nzungsbehandlung fr die l?ndliche Hausarztversorgung - Eine Mixed-Methods Analyse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>The purpose of this study is to understand the antecedents of omni-channel shopping with reference to the intention to purchase fashion products by millennials and their perspective towards the omni-channel method of shopping.Design/methodology/approach>The research is based on a quantitative research technique comprising of 302 respondents.

Although double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) appear to be a pan-CoV RO element, studies to date describe an assortment of additional CoV-induced membrane structures. Despite much speculation, it remains unclear which RO element(s) accommodate viral RNA synthesis. Here we provide detailed 2D and 3D analyses of CoV ROs and show that diverse CoVs essentially induce the same membrane modifications, including the small open double-membrane spherules (DMSs) previously thought to be restricted to gamma- and delta-CoV infections and proposed as sites of replication. Metabolic labeling of newly synthesized viral RNA followed by quantitative electron microscopy (EM) autoradiography revealed abundant viral RNA synthesis associated with DMVs in cells infected with the beta-CoVs Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV and the gamma-CoV infectious bronchitis virus. RNA synthesis could not be linked to DMSs or any other cellular or virus-induced structure.

Many specialized tertiary hospitals in Kazakhstan including National Research Cardiac Surgery Center (NRCSC) were re-organized to accept coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients during summer months of 2020. Although many studies from worldwide reported their experience in treating patients with COVID-19, there are limited data available from the Central Asia countries. The aim of this study is to identify predictors of mortality associated with COVID-19 in NRCSC tertiary hospital in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to the NRCSC between June 1(st)CAugust 31(st) 2020 with COVID-19. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected from electronic records. In-hospital mortality was assessed as an outcome. Patients were followed-up until in-hospital death or discharge from the hospital. Descriptive statistics and factors associated with mortality were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Two hundred thirtynine admissions were recorded during the follow-up period. Mean age was 57 years and 61% were males. Median duration of stay at the hospital was 8 days and 34 (14%) patients died during the hospitalization. Non-survivors were more likely to be admitted later from the disease onset, with higher fever, lower oxygen saturation and increased respiratory rate compared to survivors. Leukocytosis, lymphopenia, anemia, elevated liver and kidney function tests, hypoproteinemia, elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) and coagulation tests (fibrinogen, D-dimer, international normalized ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)) at admission were associated with mortality. Age (OR 1.2, CI:1.01C1.43), respiratory rate (OR 1.38, CI: 1.07C1.77), and CRP (OR 1.39, CI: 1.04C1.87) were determined to be independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION: This study describes 14% mortality rate from COVID-19 in the tertiary hospital. Many abnormal clinical and laboratory variables at admission were associated with poor outcome. Age, respiratory rate and CRP were found to be independent predictors of mortality. Our finding would help healthcare providers to predict the risk factors associated with high risk of mortality.

To confirm students identities, ExamID uses a form of artificial intelligence - facial recognition technology - to match an image of a student in its database to an image the student takes immediately before an exam. In theory, ExamID then matches the stored image with a second image as a means to confirm that the correct person is taking the exam. Unfortunately, just as has been the case with other efforts to use facial recognition technology, ExamID has been alleged to be error-prone for students of color attempting to use it. ExamSoft contests these claims. Regardless of the accuracy of the public allegations against this software, it still puts academic institutions in a position where responding is important.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in Makkah and Malaysia during the 2013 hajj season. A self-administered proforma on social demographics, previous experience of hajj or umrah, smoking habits, co-morbid illness and practices of preventive measures against respiratory illness were obtained. Results. A total of 468 proforma were analysed. The prevalence of the respiratory illness was 93.4% with a subset of 78.2% fulfilled the criteria for influenza-like illness (ILI). Most of them (77.8%) had a respiratory illness of <2 weeks duration. Approximately 61.8% were administered antibiotics but only 2.1% of them had been hospitalized. Most of them acquired the infection after a brief stay at Arafat (81.2%). Vaccination coverages for influenza virus and pneumococcal disease were quite high, 65.2% and 59.4%, respectively. For other preventive measures practices, only 31.8% of them practiced good hand hygiene, 82.9% of pilgrims used surgical face masks, N95 face masks, dry towels, wet towels or veils as their face masks. Nearly one-half of the respondents (44.4%) took vitamins as their food supplement.

All hospitalized COVID-19 patients who had at least one dose of Coronavac were included in the study. The oldest unvaccinated patients with comorbidities, who were hospitalized during the same period, were chosen as controls. All epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory data of the patients were recorded and compared between the fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. There were 69 and 217 patients who had been either fully vaccinated with Coronavac or not, respectively. All breakthrough infections occurred in the first 3 months of vaccination. Fully vaccinated patients were older and had more comorbidities than unvaccinated patients. There were minor differences between the groups in symptoms, physical and laboratory findings, anti-spike IgG positivity rate and level, the severity of COVID-19, complications, and clinical improvement rate. The mortality rate of fully vaccinated patients was higher than the mortality rate in unvaccinated patients in univariate analysis, which was attributed to the fact that vaccinated patients were older and had more comorbidities. The severity and clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with breakthrough COVID-19 after Coronavac vaccination were similar to those of unvaccinated patients.

News reports on the increasing number of fatalities have exposed individuals to death, which causes negative emotional experiences such as tension, anxiety, and fear. This study aimed to investigate whether creativity could serve as an anxiety-buffer when mortality is salient. Based on previous findings, the present study utilized type of creative task and personal search for meaning as moderators. In Study 1, a 2 (mortality salience: absent, present)  2 (type of creative task: benevolent, malevolent) between-subject design was utilized, and 168 subjects were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions. In Study 2, 221 subjects were recruited. The experimental procedure was similar to Study 1, except that the priming paradigm of mortality was changed and search for meaning was included as an additional moderating variable. State anxiety was measured as the dependent variable in both studies. Results of Study 1 showed that, while the benevolent creative task could buffer anxiety in the mortality salience condition, the malevolent creative task did not have the same effect. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between mortality salience, type of creative task, and search for meaning in life on anxiety.

The absence of effective vector control strategies and limited periods of exposure during forest visits suggest that chemoprophylaxis could be an appropriate strategy to protect forest goers against malaria. METHODS: Alongside a clinical trial of anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis in northern Cambodia, qualitative research was conducted, including in-depth interviews and observation, to explore the acceptability of malaria prophylaxis for forest goers, the implementation opportunities, and challenges of this strategy. RESULTS: Prophylaxis with artemetherClumefantrine for forest goers was found to be acceptable under trial conditions. Three factors played a major role: the communitys awareness and perception of the effectiveness of prophylaxis, their trust in the provider, and malaria as a local health concern. The findings highlight how uptake and adherence to prophylaxis are influenced by the perceived balance between benefits and burden of anti-malarials which are modulated by the seasonality of forest visits and its influence on malaria risk. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of anti-malarial prophylaxis needs to consider how the preventive medication can be incorporated into existing vector-control measures, malaria testing and treatment services. The next step in the roll out of anti-malarial prophylaxis for forest visitors will require support from local health workers.

METHODS: Cats ranged from 3.4C73 months of age (mean 13.6 months); 26 had effusive or dry-to-effusive FIP and five had non-effusive disease. Cats with severe neurological and ocular FIP were not recruited. The group was started on GS-441524 at a dosage of 2.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks and increased when indicated to 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h. RESULTS: Four of the 31 cats that presented with severe disease died or were euthanized within 2C5 days and a fifth cat after 26 days. The 26 remaining cats completed the planned 12 weeks or more of treatment. Eighteen of these 26 cats remain healthy at the time of publication (OnlineFirst, February 2019) after one round of treatment, while eight others suffered disease relapses within 3C84 days. Six of the relapses were non-neurological and two neurological. Three of the eight relapsing cats were treated again at the same dosage, while five cats had the dosage increased from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg q24h. The five cats treated a second time at the higher dosage, including one with neurological disease, responded well and also remain healthy at the time of publication. However, one of the three cats re-treated at the original lower dosage relapsed with neurological disease and was euthanized, while the two remaining cats responded favorably but relapsed a second time. These two cats were successfully treated a third time at the higher dosage, producing 25 long-time survivors. One of the 25 successfully treated cats was subsequently euthanized due to presumably unrelated heart disease, while 24 remain healthy.

However, there is a limited understanding of suicide among individuals with positive/suspected COVID diagnosis specifically. Hence, this study, using online newspaper reports, aimed to determine factors influencing suicide among individuals withCOVID-19 infection status. METHODOLOGY: : Information regarding positive/suspected COVID related suicide was obtained from online newspapers published in 4 languages between 30(th) Jan 2020 to 16(th) August 2020 using google news aggregator. Of 235 online identified, 93 were eligible for analysis after the exclusion and analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: : Median Age of COVID related suicide victims was 45 years (range 15 - 80) wherein 61.3% belonged to 30-59 year age group, and 75.3% were males. 50% of suicides occurred within the first week of COVID diagnosis confirmation, and 50% suicides occurred at COVID centres. Hanging (53.8%) was the commonest method of suicide, followed by jumping (12.9%). CONCLUSION: : Higher risk for suicide was observed among male gender and those with positive/suspected COVID infection within the first week, while receiving treatment in COVID care centres. Hanging and jumping were the two commonest methods.

Furthermore, some inequalities have widened and become more apparent, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. With growing recognition of the uneven distribution of life expectancy and of mental and physical health, the current research was commissioned to identify future research priorities to address UK societal and structural health inequalities. METHODS: An expert opinion consultancy process comprising an anonymous online survey and a consultation workshop were conducted to investigate priority areas for future research into UK inequalities. The seven-question survey asked respondents (n = 170) to indicate their current role, identify and prioritise areas of inequality, approaches and evaluation methods, and comment on future research priorities. The workshop was held to determine areas of research priority and attended by a closed list of delegates (n = 30) representing a range of academic disciplines and end-users of research from policy and practice. Delegates self-selected one of four breakout groups to determine research priority areas in four categories of inequality (health, social, economic, and other) and to allocate hypothetical sums of funding (half, one, five, and ten million pounds) to chosen priorities. Responses were analysed using mixed methods. RESULTS: Survey respondents were mainly academics (33%), voluntary/third sector professionals (17%), and creative/cultural professionals(16%). Survey questions identified the main areas of inequality as health (58%), social care (54%), and living standards (47%). The first research priority was access to creative and cultural opportunities (37%), second, sense of place (23%), and third, community (17%). Approaches seen to benefit from more research in relation to addressing inequalities were health/social care (55%), advice services (34%), and adult education/training (26%). Preferred evaluation methods were community/participatory (76%), action research (62%), and questionnaires/focus groups (53%). Survey respondents (25%) commented on interactions between inequalities and issues such as political and economic decisions, and climate. The key workshop finding from determining research priorities in areas of inequality was that health equity could only be achieved by tackling societal and structural inequalities, environmental conditions and housing, and having an active prevention programme. CONCLUSIONS: Research demonstrates a clear need to assess the impact of cultural and natural assets in reducing inequality. Collaborations between community groups, service providers, local authorities, health commissioners, GPs, and researchers using longitudinal methods are needed within a multi-disciplinary approach to address societal and structural health inequalities.","output":"The role of cultural, community and natural assets in addressing societal and structural health inequalities in the UK: future research priorities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite developments in HIV treatment and care, disparities persist with some not fully benefiting from improvements in the HIV care continuum.

Differently, other authors consider pharyngitis, even streptococcal one, a benign, self-limiting disease. Consequently they wouldn't routinely perform microbiological tests and, pointing to a judicious use of antibiotics, they would reserve antimicrobial treatment to well-selected cases.

To play such diverse roles, the N protein has two structured RNA-binding modules, the N- (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains, which are connected by an intrinsically disordered region. Despite the wealth of structural data available for the isolated NTD and CTD, how these domains are arranged in the full-length protein and how the oligomerization of N influences its RNA-binding activity remains largely unclear. Herein, using experimental data from electron microscopy and biochemical/biophysical techniques combined with molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that, in the absence of RNA, the N protein forms structurally dynamic dimers with the NTD and CTD arranged in extended conformations. In the presence of RNA, however, the N protein assumes a more compact conformation where the NTD and CTD are packed together. We also provide an octameric model for the full-length N bound to RNA that is consistent with electron microscopy images of the N protein in the presence of RNA.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the safety net hospital for San Francisco through April 8, 2020. Each patient had 15 days of follow-up. Among 26 patients, the median age was 54 years (interquartile range, 43 to 62), 65% were men, and 77% were Latinx. Mechanical ventilation was initiated for 11 (42%) patients within 24 hours of ICU admission and 20 patients (77%) overall. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.5 days (interquartile range, 5 to 20). Patients were managed with lung protective ventilation (tidal volume 8 ml/kg of ideal body weight and plateau pressure 30 cmH(2)O on 98% and 78% of ventilator days, respectively). Prone positioning was used for 13 of 20 (65%) ventilated patients for a median of 5 days (interquartile range, 2 to 10). Seventeen (65%) patients were discharged home, 1 (4%) was discharged to nursing home, 3 (12%) were discharged from the ICU, and 2 (8%) remain intubated in the ICU at the time of this report. Three (12%) patients have died.

Major problems related to self-medication are wastage of resources, increased resistance of pathogens, adverse reactions, and prolonged suffering. This study aimed to find the prevalence of self-medication among medical students and staffs of a tertiary care centre during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students and staffs of a tertiary care centre from 1st November to 30th November, 2021. Ethical clearance was taken from the Institutional Review Committee (Reference number: 2710202102). Convenience sampling was done to reach the sample size. Online questionnaires consisting of information on self-medication and socio-demographic characteristics were used. The data was transferred into an Excel spreadsheet and later was exported to Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20 for analysis. Point estimate at 95% confidence interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. RESULTS Among 383 participants, the prevalence of self-medication during the pandemic was 193 (50.4%) (45.39-55.40 at 95% Confidence Interval). About half of the respondents 90 (50.3%) who self-medicated purchased the medicines directly from the pharmacy.

Results: Using group-based trajectory modeling, four trajectories of adherence to physical distancing emerged: a high-adherence trajectory, a slow-declining trajectory, a fluctuating trajectory, and a fast-declining trajectory. The most important psychosocial predictors of poorer adherence trajectories included perceptions of lower self-efficacy and higher barriers to adherence, as well as lower prosocial attitudes towards physical distancing.

The overall scope of this review article was therefore to identify the gaps of output-oriented mechanisms such as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), and to point out how an Input-Oriented Cap and Trade (IOCT) system might overcome those gaps. IOCT refers to limits to the carbon input into the global fossil fuel trading system instead of limiting only the emissions caused by already burned fuel. For this purpose, a global cap on the extraction of coal, gas and oil must firstly be defined. Accordingly, IOCT provides for the allocation of allowances for the extraction, processing and trading of carbon-based products. IOCT is a source-oriented approach that refers to a joint allocation of the resource consumption responsibility to the fossil fuel producer and consumer as well.

We study the bidirectional coupling between the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 and the population social response in the state of New York, between March 1, 2020 (which marks the first confirmed positive diagnosis in the state), until June 20, 2020. This window captures the first state-wide epidemic wave, which peaked to over 11,000 confirmed cases daily in April (making New York one of the US states most severely affected by this first wave), and subsided by the start of June to a count of consistently under 1,500 confirmed cases per day (suggesting temporary state-wide control of the epidemic). In response to the surge in cases, social distancing measures were gradually introduced over two weeks in March, culminating with the PAUSE directive on March 22nd, which mandated statewide shutdown of all nonessential activity. The mandates were then gradually relaxed in stages throughout summer, based on how epidemic benchmarks were met in various New York regions. In our study, we aim to examine on one hand, whether different counties exhibited different responses to the PAUSE centralized measures depending on their epidemic situation immediately preceding PAUSE. On the other hand, we explore whether these different county-wide responses may have contributed in turn to modulating the counties epidemic timelines. We used the public domain to extract county-wise epidemic measures (such as cumulative and daily incidence of COVID-19), and social mobility measures for different modalities (driving, walking, public transit) and to different destinations. Our correlation analyses between the epidemic and the mobility time series found significant correlations between the size of the epidemic and the degree of mobility drop after PAUSE, as well as between the mobility comeback patterns and the epidemic recovery timeline. In line with existing literature on the role of the population behavioral response during an epidemic outbreak, our results support the potential importance of the PAUSE measures to the control of the first epidemic wave in New York State.","output":"Dynamic coupling between the COVID-19 epidemic timeline and the behavioral response to PAUSE in New York State counties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Induction of a proinflammatory response is the hallmark of host innate defense against invading pathogens. Host recognition of influenza A virus (IAV) infection relies on pattern-recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-I) for the activation of innate-immune responses. Here, we show that following a physiological low dose of IAV infection, viral sensing by either TLR7 or RIG-I induces a proinflammatory program that promotes viral replication. Transfer of bronchoalveolar lavage from infected wild-type mice into the airway of mice deficient in TLR7 and RIG-I pathways was sufficient to restore viral replication efficiency. Comparison of IAV-infected cells revealed that inflammatory mediators elicited by TLR7 and RIG-I signaling recruit viral target cells to the airway, thereby enhancing viral load within the respiratory tract. Our data suggest that IAV uses physiological levels of inflammatory responses for its replicative advantage and highlight the complex interplay between viruses and the host innate-immune responses.","output":"Efficient influenza A virus replication in the respiratory tract requires signals from TLR7 and RIG-I."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children has been challenging to establish, owing to the high prevalence of asymptomatic infection in this population.

METHODS: An online questionnaire-based analysis was performed among members of the All India Ophthalmological Society (AIOS) and results were analyzed using SPSS software version 20. RESULTS: A total of 2253 responses were received. The majority of the participants (72.6%) were between 30 and 60 years of age and were into private practice (64.7%). During the lockdown, over one-third of participant ophthalmologists reported not attending any OPD patients, whereas a majority (64%) provided only emergency ophthalmic services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, <15% surgeries were performed compared to the pre-COVID-19 era by 81% of participants, whereas elective surgeries were performed by only 4.3%. The proportion of participants utilizing telemedicine in ophthalmology showed a two-fold rise from the pre-COVID-19 era (21.9%) to the COVID-19 pandemic (46%). Over half of the participants reported following the AIOS guidelines, reducing clinic hours, use of screening questionnaires, minimizing staff, and use of breath shield on a slit lamp as precautionary measures to reduce the exposure.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate engagement in a theory-based (informationCmotivationCbehavioral skills model) mobile phone app developed to support HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence among Thai young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women (YTGW) in Bangkok, Thailand. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted among HIV-negative YMSM and YTGW aged 15-19 years initiating daily oral PrEP. Participants were randomized to receive either youth-friendly PrEP services (YFS) for 6 months, including monthly contact with site staff (clinic visits or telephone follow-up) and staff consultation access, or YFS plus use of a PrEP adherence support app (YFS+APP). The target population focus group discussion findings and the informationCmotivationCbehavioral skills model informed app development. App features were based on the 3Rsrisk assessment of self-HIV acquisition risk, reminders to take PrEP, and rewards as redeemable points. Dried blood spots quantifying of tenofovir diphosphate were collected at months 3 and 6 to assess PrEP adherence. Tenofovir diphosphate 350-699 fmol/punch was classified as fair adherence and 700 fmol/punch as good adherence. Data analysis on app use paradata and exit interviews were conducted on the YFS+APP arm after 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Between March 2018 and June 2019, 200 participants with a median age of 18 (IQR 17-19) years were enrolled. Overall, 74% (148/200) were YMSM; 87% (87/100) of participants who received YFS+APP logged in to the app and performed weekly HIV acquisition risk assessments (log-in and risk assessment [LRA]). The median duration between the first and last log-in was 3.5 (IQR 1.6-5.6) months, with a median frequency of 6 LRAs (IQR 2-10). Moreover, 22% (22/100) of the participants in the YFS+APP arm were frequent users (LRA10) during the 6-month follow-up period. YMSM were 9.3 (95% CI 1.2-74.3) times more likely to be frequent app users than YTGW (P=.04). Frequent app users had higher proportions (12%-16%) of PrEP adherence at both months 3 and 6 compared with infrequent users (LRA<10) and the YFS arm, although this did not reach statistical significance. Of the 100 participants in the YFS+APP arm, 23 (23%) were interviewed. The risk assessment function is perceived as the most useful app feature. Further aesthetic adaptations and a more comprehensive rewards system were suggested by the interviewees. CONCLUSIONS: Higher rates of PrEP adherence among frequent app users were observed; however, this was not statistically significant. A short app use duration of 3 months suggests that they may be useful in establishing habits in taking daily PrEP, but not long-term adherence. Further studies on the specific mechanisms of mobile phone apps that influence health behaviors are needed.

Thus, this articles objective was to describe the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in indigenous communities in Brazil. METHODS: This descriptive observational study was carried out in indigenous communities in the municipality of Amatur (Amazonas, Brazil). Individuals from the Alto Rio Solim?es Special Indigenous Sanitary District (DSEI) who met the Sars-Cov-2 infection case definitions during the period between January and August 2020 were included. For case notification, the definitions adopted by the Ministry of Health of Brazil and by the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health were considered. RESULTS: Out of the entire population served by the Alto Rio Solim?es DSEI (n = 2890), 109 indigenous people were suspected of having been infected with Sars-Cov-R during the study period; a total of 89 cases were actually confirmed (rate: 3.08 cases/100,000 inhabitants). Most patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were female (56.2%), with a mean age of 32.4 ( 23.6) years. Predominant symptoms were fever (76.4%), dry cough (64%), and headache (60.7%). Complications occurred in 7.9% of the patients; no deaths were reported.

Electronic notifications of AKI have been utilized in patients who are hospitalized, but their efficacy in the outpatient setting is unclear. Methods We evaluated the effect of two outpatient interventions: an automated comment on increasing creatinine results (intervention I; 6 months; n=159) along with an email to the provider (intervention II; 3 months; n=105), compared with a control (baseline; 6 months; n=176). A comment was generated if a patient's creatinine increased by >0.5 mg/dl (previous creatinine 2.0 mg/dl) or by 50% (previous creatinine >2.0 mg/dl) within 180 days. Process measures included documentation of AKI and clinical actions. Clinical outcomes were defined as recovery from AKI within 7 days, prolonged AKI from 8 to 89 days, and progression to CKD with in 120 days. Results Providers were more likely to document AKI in interventions I (P=0.004; OR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.38 to 5.67) and II (P=0.01; OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.21 to 5.81).

The median time to follow-up creatinine trended shorter among patients with AKI documented (21 versus 42 days; P=0.11). There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes. Conclusions An automated comment was associated with improved documented recognition of AKI and the additive intervention of an email alert was associated with increased discontinuation of nephrotoxins, but neither improved clinical outcomes.

Acute lung injury (ALI) is driven by pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the innate immune system, which involves the nod-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and nuclear factor-B (NF-B) pathways. These two pathways are interconnected and share a common inducer the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), an epigenetic regulator of (Ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene transcription, to regulate inflammation by the direct inhibition of NF-B phosphorylation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Herein, we report that hederasaponin C (HSC) exerted a therapeutic effect against ALI through the regulation of the PIP2/NF-B/NLRP3 signaling pathway. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/lipopolysaccharide + adenosine triphosphate (LPS+ATP)-stimulated macrophages, our results showed that HSC remarkably inhibited the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-). Moreover, HSC inhibited NF-B/p65 nuclear translocation and the binding of PIP2 to transforming growth factor- activated kinase 1 (TAK1). The intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) level was decreased by HSC via the PIP2 signaling pathway, which subsequently inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. HSC markedly alleviated LPS-induced ALI, restored lung function of mice, and rescued ALI-induced mice death. In addition, HSC significantly reduced the level of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, and lymphocytes, as well as pro-inflammatory mediators like IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining results suggested HSC has a significant therapeutic effect on lung injury of mice. Interestingly, the PIP2/NF-B/NLRP3 signaling pathway was further confirmed by the treatment of HSC with ALI, which is consistent with the treatment of HSC with LPS/LPS+ATP-stimulated macrophages. Overall, our findings revealed that HSC demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory activity through modulating the PIP2/NF-B/NLRP3 axis in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that HSC is a potential therapeutic agent for the clinical treatment of ALI.","output":"Hederasaponin C Alleviates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Acute Lung Injury In Vivo and In Vitro Through the PIP2/NF-B/NLRP3 Signaling Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges in the care of patients with cancer, including how to manage outpatients who are COVID-positive but do not require hospitalization.

Collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) by healthcare workers (HCW) is currently used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2, which increases the risk of transmission to HCWs. Self-administered saliva and buccal swabs are convenient, painless and safe alternative sample collection methods. Methods: A cross-sectional single centre study was conducted on 42 participants who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via NPS within the past 7 days. A self-collected saliva and buccal swab and a HCW-collected NPS were obtained. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed and cycle threshold (CT) values were obtained. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA) and overall agreement (OA) were calculated for saliva and buccal swabs, as compared with NPS. Results: Among the 42 participants, 73.8% (31/42) tested positive via any one of the 3 tests. With reference to NPS, the saliva test had PPA 66.7%, NPA 91.7% and OA 69.0%. The buccal swab had PPA 56.7%, NPA 100% and OA 73.8%. Presence of symptoms improved diagnostic accuracy. There was no statistically significant association between CT values and duration of symptom onset within the first 12 days of symptoms for all three modalities. Conclusion: Self-collected saliva tests and buccal swabs have only moderate agreement with HCW-collected NPS swabs. Primary screening for SARS-CoV-2 may be performed with a saliva test or buccal swab, with a negative test warranting a confirmatory NPS to avoid false negatives.

We analyzed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data from 15 primary AML samples with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations, which identified ~4000 focal regions that were uniquely hypermethylated in IDHmut samples vs. normal CD34+ cells and other AMLs. These regions had modest hypermethylation in AMLs with biallelic TET2 mutations, and levels of 5-hydroxymethylation that were diminished in IDH and TET-mutant samples, indicating that this hypermethylation results from inhibition of TET-mediated demethylation. Focal hypermethylation in IDHmut AMLs occurred at regions with low methylation in CD34+ cells, implying that DNA methylation and demethylation are active at these loci. AML samples containing IDH and DNMT3AR882 mutations were significantly less hypermethylated, suggesting that IDHmut-associated hypermethylation is mediated by DNMT3A.

Achieving this requires learning from successful approaches and scaling up the implementation of effective strategies that promote equity by actively addressing determinants and barriers across systems that impede overall health. As a country, the U.S. has shown significant success in innovation but has failed at taking successful programs and initiatives to scale. Having endured over a year of loss in education, social connection, and routines, the COVID-19 pandemic illuminated America's deeply rooted structural inequities that have worsened population mental health and well-being. Integrating mental health into institutions and systems, while recovering and rebuilding, must be at the forefront to provide a path for transformation. Three recommendations are derived from the strategies and initiatives described throughout this article that offer tangible steps for achieving wellbeing as a human right: 1. Embed mental health within and across all systems, and expand its definition across the continuum; 2. Prioritize prevention and health promotion through person-centered and community-driven strategies; and 3. Expand the diversification and training of the mental health workforce across sectors. The inequities addressed in this article are not the products of a global pandemic. Instead, they result from historical oppression, injustice, and inaction, exacerbated by the current context.

In the present study, we assessed the effect of the pandemic on the subjective and objective fitness of high-level nonelite runners. METHODS: The MASTERS Athletic Study is an ongoing survey of training and health habits of high-level nonelite runners, the majority of whom compete in marathons and other extreme endurance events. We invited participants to a web-based questionnaire regarding training and fitness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparisons were made between subjective and objective fitness as well as well as the relationship of prepandemic training volume and history of COVID-19 on change in fitness during the pandemic, using MannCWhitney rank-sum tests and chi-square tests for nonparametric and categorical variables, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 189 runners completed the survey, of whom 26 (13.8%) reported prior diagnosis with COVID-19. In terms of the subjective sense of fitness compared to before the pandemic, 49 (25.9%) reported they were less fit, 55 (29.1%) reported they were more fit, and 85 (45.0%) reported their fitness was unchanged. These assessments correlated well with objective measurement of training volume in MET-min/week. Runners with improved fitness at present had a lower calculated training volume before the pandemic versus those who reported unchanged or worsened fitness. There was no relationship between the report of prior COVID-19 and either subjective or objective measures of fitness. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a variable effect on the fitness of high-level nonelite runners. We found an inverse relationship between baseline training volume and the likelihood of runners reporting improved fitness and no relationship between a history of COVID-19 and change in fitness through the pandemic. Understanding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on athletic fitness will help guide strategies to maintain physical health and wellness through future public health crises.","output":"Training for Marathons during a Marathon Pandemic: Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Fitness among High-Level Nonelite Runners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the immune responses to primary smallpox vaccination in a combined cohort of 1,653 subjects.

Examination of these SNPs led to the functional testing of rs1131769, a non-synonymous SNP in TMEM173 causing an Arg-to-His change at position 232 in the STING proteina major regulator of innate immune responses to viral infections. Our findings demonstrate differences in the ability of the two STING variants to phosphorylate the downstream intermediates TBK1 and IRF3 in response to multiple STING ligands. Further downstream in the STING pathway, we observed significantly reduced expression of type I IFNs (including IFN) and IFN-response genes in cells carrying the H232 variant. Subsequent molecular modeling of both alleles predicted altered ligand binding characteristics between the two variants, providing a potential mechanism underlying differences in inter-individual responses to poxvirus infection. Our data indicate that possession of the H232 variant may impair STING-mediated innate immunity to poxviruses.

The training is based on the method of video analysis, involving simulated patients, making online implementation extremely challenging. AIM: The study aims to present our experiences with the online training and to analyse the students' evaluations. METHOD: We used the free version of Zoom for small groups of five students, a trainer and a simulated patient. All students participated in a situation that we recorded. The viewing of the recordings was followed by group discussion. Then, the students evaluated the course using an online questionnaire. We used descriptive statistics and content analysis. RESULTS: 74.4% of the students (n = 64) completed the questionnaire. 78.1-100% of them gave a good (4) or excellent (5) evaluation for the questions. The highest average score (4.95  0.21) was given to the professionalism of the trainers, the lowest was given to the choice of topic of the theoretical part (4.06  1.02). The majority of the students were satisfied with the course, they would be happy to attend it again; however, in-person learning still seems to be the preferred option. CONCLUSION: The online practice was a success. In many ways, it proved to be an adequate replacement for the traditional form. The students evaluated the training similarly to those of previous years. The lack of personal contact is a limiting factor, thus, online practice should not be seen as an alternative to personal communication trainings; however, as an independent form of training, it can make a significant contribution to effective, modern education.

In September 2021, the government already allowed a pilot run of limited in-person classes in low-risk areas around the country, in the face of the continuing threat of the virus. Objective: We aim to assess which regions in the Philippines can already reopen their schools. Methods: In this study, we simulate school reopening scenarios with our modified COVID-19 agent-based model for the seventeen regions of the country. We tested different vaccination coverages and calculated the coverage at which deaths and infections would begin to show a downtick. The School Reopening Viability (SRV) of a region is then determined by getting the difference between the current vaccination coverage (as of 13 February 2022) and the downtick in infection or death. Results: The recent data on the COVID-19 Omicron variant transmission shows that all regions except Regions 7, 9, and BARMM can reopen. Comparing the SRV of a region to its vaccination progress, we see that those with high vaccination rates are the ones most viable for school reopening, as in the case of regions in Luzon. On the other hand, those with low vaccination rates are the ones that would need to ramp up their vaccination efforts before reopening their schools. Conclusions: We recommend that with the current vaccination coverages for the regions, all regions except Regions 7, 9, and BARMM may undergo school reopening. Alongside efforts to reopen schools, vaccination efforts should still be continued and ramped up, especially in the regions of interest.

We examined inflammatory gene mRNA abundances found in S protein-treated PBMC using gene arrays. We identified differential mRNA abundances of genes with functional properties associated with antiviral (CXCL10) and inflammatory (IL-6, IL-8) responses. We confirmed cytokine mRNA increases by real time quantitative(q) RT-PCR or ELISA. We further analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of the prominent IL-8 response. By real time qRT-PCR, S protein was shown to stimulate IL-8 mRNA accumulation in a dose dependent manner while treatment with E protein did not. Also, titration of S protein-specific production and secretion of IL-8 by ELISA showed that the dose of 5.6nM of S produced a significant increase in IL-8 (p=0.003) compared to mock-treated controls. The increase in IL-8 stimulated by a concentration of 5.6 nM of S was comparable to concentrations seen for S protein binding to ACE2 or to neutralizing monoclonal antibody suggesting a physiological relevance. An NF-B inhibitor, TPCK (N-Tosyl-L-Phenylalanine Chloromethyl Ketone) could suppress IL-8 production and secretion in response to S protein in PBMC and THP-1 cells and in HCoV-229E virus-infected PBMC. Activation and translocation of NF-B was shown to occur rapidly following exposure of PBMC or THP-1 cells to S protein using a highly sensitive assay for active nuclear NF-B p65 transcription factor.

The mortality rate of patients who suffer OHCA remains high despite extensive utilization of resources. OBJECTIVES: We aim to describe the current landscape of OHCA during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide an overview of the logistical challenges and resuscitation protocols amongst emergency medical service (EMS) personnel. DISCUSSION: Recent studies in Italy, New York City, and France characterized a significant increase in OHCA incidence in conjunction with the arrival of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The presence of the pandemic challenged existing protocols for field resuscitation of cardiac arrest patients as the pandemic necessitated prioritization of EMS personnel and other healthcare providers' safety through stringent personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements. Studies also characterized difficulties encountered by the first responder system during COVID-19, such as dispatcher overload, increased response times, and adherence to PPE requirements, superimposed on PPE shortages. The lack of guidance by governmental agencies and specialty organizations to provide unified safety protocols for resuscitation led to the development of different resuscitative protocols globally. CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic modified the approach of first responders to OHCA. With the rise in OCHA during the pandemic in several geographic regions and the risks of disease transmission with superimposed equipment shortages, novel noninvasive, adjunct tools, such as point of care ultrasound, warrant consideration.

Putative periodontal pathogens are enriched as the resident oral microbiota becomes dysbiotic and inflammatory responses evoke tissue destruction, thus inducing an unremitting positive feedback loop of proteolysis, inflammation, and enrichment for periodontal pathogens. Keystone microbial pathogens and sustained gingival inflammation are critical to periodontal disease progression. However, recent studies have revealed the importance of previously unidentified microbes involved in disease progression, including various viruses, phages and bacterial species. Moreover, newly identified immunological and genetic mechanisms, as well as environmental host factors, including diet and lifestyle, have been discerned in recent years as further contributory factors in periodontitis. These factors have collectively expanded the established narrative of periodontal disease progression. In line with this, new ideologies related to maintaining periodontal health and treating existing disease have been explored, such as the application of oral probiotics, to limit and attenuate disease progression. The role of systemic host pathologies, such as autoimmune disorders and diabetes, in periodontal disease pathogenesis has been well noted. Recent studies have additionally identified the reciprocated importance of periodontal disease in potentiating systemic disease states at distal sites, such as in Alzheimers disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, and oral cancer, further highlighting the importance of the oral cavity in systemic health.

There are concerns that these measures reduced the use of health services. Using a quasi-experimental approach, we investigated the impact that the enactment of lockdown measures had on mental healthcare utilization in Germany. Methods: Using data from a German health insurance covering the first 6 months of years 2019 and 2020, we identified hospitalizations with a mental health condition as the main diagnosis. Difference-in-differences Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the impact of lockdown measures on the number of weekly hospitalizations due to a mental health condition. All models controlled for age, gender, year, and week of the year. Analyses were further stratified by gender, age group (<18, 18-25, 26-49, >50), and diagnosis group (anxiety, behavioral disorders, disturb of personality, mood disorders, and schizophrenia). Results: During the first six months of 2020, the total number of mental-health related hospitalizations (14,127) was significantly lower compared to the first six months of 2019 (16,678, p<0.001). Compared to 2019, mental-health hospitalizations in 2020 showed similar trends until week 12 (start of first lockdown) and then showed a relative decrease.

The presence of an autologous renin-angiotensin system has been demonstrated in almost all tissues of the body. It is now known that angiotensin II acts both independently and in synergy with TGF-beta to induce fibrosis via the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT(1)) in a multitude of tissues outside of the cardiovascular and renal systems, including pulmonary fibrosis, intra-abdominal fibrosis, and systemic sclerosis. Interestingly, recent studies have described a paradoxically regenerative effect of the angiotensin system via stimulation of the angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT(2)). Activation of AT(2) has been shown to ameliorate fibrosis in animal models of skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal, and neurologic diseases.

This article critically evaluates the existing research on e-learning in plastic surgery. METHODS A systematic review of e-learning in plastic surgery was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase databases. Studies were limited to those written in English and published after 1995 and excluded short communications, letters to the editor, and articles focused on in-person simulation. RESULTS A total of 23 articles were identified. Represented subspecialties include breast, burns, craniofacial/pediatrics, hand, and microsurgery. Most e-learning resources target surgeons and trainees, but a small number are for patients, parents, and referring physicians. Users reported high levels of satisfaction with e-learning and significant gains in knowledge after completion, although there may be more variable satisfaction with teaching technical skills. Two studies showed no differences in knowledge gains from e-learning compared with traditional learning methods. Subgroup analysis showed greater benefit of e-learning for novice learners when evaluated. Surveys of plastic surgeons and trainees showed high interest in and growing utilization of e-learning. CONCLUSIONS Research in plastic surgery e-learning shows high user satisfaction and overall improvements in learning outcomes with knowledge gains equivalent to traditional teaching methods and greater benefit in novice learners. Thus, e-learning can serve an important role in plastic surgery education, especially in the current state of social distancing. Future work should aim to define learner preferences and educational needs and better establish how e-learning can augment plastic surgical education, particularly among other teaching methods.","output":"Does E-learning Improve Plastic Surgery Education?: A Systematic Review of Asynchronous Resources."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a self-synchronizing and robust method for comparing the progression of the Covid-19 epidemics among multiple countries.

There are also concerns that the pandemic has affected supply and demand of acute cardiovascular care. We estimated excess mortality in specific CVDs, both 'direct', through infection, and 'indirect', through changes in healthcare. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used (i) national mortality data for England and Wales to investigate trends in non-COVID-19 and CVD excess deaths; (ii) routine data from hospitals in England (n = 2), Italy (n = 1), and China (n = 5) to assess indirect pandemic effects on referral, diagnosis, and treatment services for CVD; and (iii) population-based electronic health records from 3 862 012 individuals in England to investigate pre- and post-COVID-19 mortality for people with incident and prevalent CVD. We incorporated pre-COVID-19 risk (by age, sex, and comorbidities), estimated population COVID-19 prevalence, and estimated relative risk (RR) of mortality in those with CVD and COVID-19 compared with CVD and non-infected (RR: 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0).Mortality data suggest indirect effects on CVD will be delayed rather than contemporaneous (peak RR 1.14). CVD service activity decreased by 60-100% compared with pre-pandemic levels in eight hospitals across China, Italy, and England. In China, activity remained below pre-COVID-19 levels for 2-3 months even after easing lockdown and is still reduced in Italy and England. For total CVD (incident and prevalent), at 10% COVID-19 prevalence, we estimated direct impact of 31 205 and 62 410 excess deaths in England (RR 1.5 and 2.0, respectively), and indirect effect of 49 932 to 99 865 deaths.

Harsh parenting behaviors with a low prevalence before COVID-19 increased most strongly: shaking, calling names, and calling the child stupid. These results suggest that parental tolerance for childrens disobedience is lower under the adverse circumstances of COVID-19 and, as a result, abusive parenting responses are more difficult to inhibit.

METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was carried out, supplemented by phenomenologically approached in-depth interviews. Systematic random sampling was used to select study participants. A structured questionnaire and an in-depth interview guide were used to collect data. Data were entered by EPI-info and analyzed through SPSS version 23 to conduct logistic regressions. Thematic analysis was used to conduct qualitative interpretation. RESULTS: Almost one-fifth (78; 19.2%) of the study participants used emergency contraceptives to prevent their index pregnancy.

Transport occurs either internally via the vertebrate digestive tract (endozoochory), or externally be adhering to skin, feathers or fur (ectozoochory), and its success is due to both physiological and ecological factors associated with the disseminating 'hosting' animal. Helminth eggs and larvae are generally non-mobile stages that are largely dependent on the movement of another animal, typically a host, for geographical dissemination. Studies on the zoochory of helminths by vertebrates are extensive and particularly long-standing, stretching back to the 19th century, although this literature is often overlooked when considering the biogeography of parasites. This review assesses the potential of helminths to be dispersed passively by zoochory examining evidence from both laboratory and field studies. The physiological dynamics of the vertebrate intestines and skin surface as hostile environments, as well as the characteristics of eggs and larvae which may facilitate successful transport are evaluated. The various mechanisms of helminth endo- and ectozoochory are presented and the likelihood of long-distance dispersal determined.

This study was designed to determine event-free survival (EFS) for adolescents with GCTs and compared them with children and young adults. METHODS An individual patient database of 11 GCT trials was assembled: 8 conducted by pediatric cooperative groups and 3 conducted by an adult group. Male patients aged 0 to 30 years with metastatic, nonseminomatous, malignant GCTs of the testis, retroperitoneum, or mediastinum who were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy were included. The age groups were categorized as children (0 to <11 years), adolescents (11 to <18 years), and young adults (18 to 30 years). The study compared EFS and adjusted for risk group by using Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS From a total of 2024 individual records, 593 patients met the inclusion criteria: 90 were children, 109 were adolescents, and 394 were young adults. The 5-year EFS rate was lower for adolescents (72%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 62%-79%) than children (90%; 95% CI, 81%-95%; P = .003) or young adults (88%; 95% CI, 84%-91%; P = .0002). The International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group risk group was associated with EFS in the adolescent age group (P = .0020). After adjustments for risk group, the difference in EFS between adolescents and children remained significant (hazard ratio, 0.30; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS EFS for adolescent patients with metastatic GCTs was similar to that for young adults but significantly worse than for that children. This finding highlights the importance of coordinating initiatives across clinical trial organizations to improve outcomes for adolescents and young adults. LAY SUMMARY Adolescent males with metastatic germ cell tumors (GCTs) are frequently treated with regimens developed for children. In this study, a large data set of male patients with metastatic GCTs across different age groups has been built to understand the outcomes of adolescent patients in comparison with children and young adults. The results suggest that adolescent males with metastatic GCTs have worse results than children and are more similar to young adults with GCTs.

Frontline pediatric hospital staff are in a good position to identify mental health problems and facilitate appropriate support for patients. To date, no evaluation of mental health literacy training has taken place with this professional group to enable early identification of difficulties. It is also not known whether face-to-face or digital training is more effective or preferable in this setting. To improve the skills of frontline hospital staff, a face-to-face and digital mental health literacy training course was delivered using MindEd content and evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Method: Two-hundred and three frontline staff across different professions from a tertiary pediatric hospital were randomized to a face-to-face (n = 64), digital (n = 71), or waitlist control group (n = 68). Face-to-face training was two and a half hours and digital training took ~1 h. The effects of training were evaluated pre- and post-training and at two-week follow-up. Questionnaires assessed mental health knowledge, stigma, confidence in recognizing concerns and knowing what to do, actual helping behavior, as well as training delivery preference, completion rate, and satisfaction. Results: Both face-to-face and digital training increased mental health knowledge, confidence in recognizing mental health problems and knowing what to do compared to waitlist controls. Digital training increased actual helping behavior relative to the waitlist controls and stigma decreased across all groups. Staff were satisfied with both delivery methods but preferred face-to-face training. Conclusions: The results provide promising findings that digital content is an effective way of improving mental health literacy in frontline pediatric hospital staff.

They have typically been advised to practice particularly restrictive social distancing (cocooning), which has sparked much debate on mental and social health consequences in older individuals. We aim to provide evidence. Methods: A computer-assisted standardized telephone interview was conducted in a randomly selected and representative sample of the German old age population (n = 1,005;age 65 years) during lockdown in April 2020. Assessments included sociodemographic factors, aspects of the personal life situation during lockdown, attitudes towards COVID-19, and standardized screening measures on depression, anxiety, somatization, posttraumatic stress, perceived stress, loneliness and social support. Sampling-weighted descriptive statistics and multiple multivariable regression analyses were conducted. Results: Participants were M = 75.5 (SD = 7.1) years old;56.3% were women. At data collection, COVID-19 lockdown had been in force for M = 28.0 (SD = 4.8) days. Overall, older individuals were worried about COVID-19, but supportive of the lockdown. Mean scores and prevalence estimates of measured mental and social health variables were comparable to figures reported before the pandemic, except slightly higher perceived stress and higher perceived social support. There were only few significant associations of aspects of the personal life situation during lockdown and attitudes towards COVID-19 with mental and social health variables, while resilience explained a large amount of variance. Conclusions: In the short-term, the mental and social health of the German old age population was largely unaltered during COVID-19 lockdown, suggesting resilience against the challenging pandemic situation. Our results refute common ageist stereotypes of the weak and vulnerable elderly that were present during the pandemic.

IFNAR2 and IL10RB are targeted by several interferons-related drugs. Together, our results uncover 21q22.11 as a novel susceptibility locus for COVID-19, in which individuals with G alleles of rs9976829 have a higher probability of COVID-19 susceptibility than those with non-G alleles.","output":"Integrative Genomics Analysis Reveals a 21q22.11 Locus Contributing Risk to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report two cases of rescue strategies for nonopening of Pipeline flow-diverter device for the treatment of intracranial aneurysm. The first patient, a 65-year-old female, presented with complaints of headache for 3 months and was found to have giant supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) (ophthalmic segment) aneurysm. We planned endovascular partial coiling and flow-diverter placement for the treatment of ICA aneurysm. During the progressive deployment of PED, there was nonopening of Pipeline embolization device (PED) at its proximal end. We tried multiple attempts to navigate Marksman microcatheter over the PED delivery microwire and Echelon microcatheter over the Traxcess microwire across the pinched site, but we were not able to achieve success. After that, we tried opposite transcranial approach across prominent anterior communicating artery with the Synchro and Transcend microguidewire which finally resulted in the opening of the device; however, there was acute extravasation of dye on check angiogram. Thus, our technical success turned into disaster. The second patient, a 55-year-old female, presented with complaint of seizures for 3 months due to mass effect of cavernous sinus aneurysm. Pipeline Flex flow-diverter placement was done across the aneurysm neck. During the progressive deployment of device, there was nonopening of the mid and proximal segment of Pipeline Flex which was successfully managed by intra-Navien deployment of device followed by simultaneous push of Marksman microcatheter and pull of Navien catheter. In our case series, two rescue strategies were applied to successfully open the proximal constricted portion of Pipeline Flex; however, technical success in one case resulted in unmanageable disasters. Thus, transcranial rescue strategy for opening the constricted Pipeline Flex device should be cautiously used in our endovascular practice.","output":"Endovascular Rescue Strategies for Nonopening of Pipeline Device: Report of Two Cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several studies have pointed to retinal involvement in COVID-19, yet many questions remain regarding the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and replicate in retinal cells and its effects on the retina. Here, we have used human pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal organoids to study retinal infection by SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in retinal organoids, as it is shown to infect different retinal lineages, such as retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptors. SARS-CoV-2 infection of retinal organoids also induces the expression of several inflammatory genes, such as interleukin 33, a gene associated with acute COVID-19 and retinal degeneration. Finally, we show that the use of antibodies to block ACE2 significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection of retinal organoids, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infects retinal cells in an ACE2-dependent manner. These results suggest a retinal involvement in COVID-19 and emphasize the need to monitor retinal pathologies as potential sequelae of long COVID.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in photoreceptor and retinal ganglion cells of human retinal organoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the large amounts of research currently being conducted and the high number of editorials warning about the potential mental health impacts, there is a stunning lack of longitudinal mental health data on the effects of the pandemic. Yet, the pandemic may have sizable long-term impacts on psychological distress and health behaviors-these effects may be long-lasting and may disproportionately affect some demographic groups more than others. Data came from a longitudinal international study of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults' psychological distress and wellbeing (N = 1567). We found high rates of depression (55% were diagnosable with probable depression at baseline), anxiety (65%), and risk for PTSD (51%). More than one-third of participants who reported that they drank alcohol indicated that their drinking had increased since the start of the pandemic. Over time, depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts and behaviors increased significantly, but acute stress symptoms decreased. Specific demographic groups (people of color and sexual and gender minorities) appeared to be at high risk of distress across analyses. Our findings suggest high rates of depression, anxiety, acute stress, and other signs of distress like isolation, hopelessness, and use of substances to cope-even at five-month follow-up.

METHODS: Searches of Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Central, CINAHL plus and Scopus were undertaken from inception to May 2021. English language studies involving Black men aged 18 and reporting experiences of, or suggestions for, psychosocial support after CaP treatment were included. Low or moderate quality studies were excluded. Searches identified 4,453 articles and following deduplication, 2,325 were screened for eligibility. Two independent reviewers carried out screening, quality appraisal and data extraction. Data were analysed using thematic synthesis. RESULTS: Ten qualitative studies involving 139 Black men were included. Data analysis identified four analytical constructs: experience of psychosocial support for dealing with treatment side effects (including impact on self-esteem and fear of recurrence); barriers to use of psychosocial support (such as perceptions of masculinity and stigma around sexual dysfunction); facilitators to use of psychosocial support (including the influence of others and self-motivation); and practical solutions for designing and delivering post-treatment psychosocial support (the need for trusted healthcare and cultural channels). CONCLUSIONS: Few intervention studies have focused on behaviours among Black CaP survivors, with existing research predominantly involving Caucasian men. There is a need for a collaborative approach to CaP care that recognises not only medical expertise but also the autonomy of Black men as experts of their illness experience, and the influence of cultural and social networks.","output":"Barriers and facilitators to accessing and utilising post-treatment psychosocial support by Black men treated for prostate cancera systematic review and qualitative synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND New surgical procedures can expose patients to harm and should be carefully evaluated before widespread use. The InSpace balloon (Stryker, USA) is an innovative surgical device used to treat people with rotator cuff tears that cannot be repaired. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of the InSpace balloon for people with irreparable rotator cuff tears. METHODS We conducted a double-blind, group-sequential, adaptive randomised controlled trial in 24 hospitals in the UK, comparing arthroscopic debridement of the subacromial space with biceps tenotomy (debridement only group) with the same procedure but including insertion of the InSpace balloon (debridement with device group). Participants had an irreparable rotator cuff tear, which had not resolved with conservative treatment, and they had symptoms warranting surgery. Eligibility was confirmed intraoperatively before randomly assigning (1:1) participants to a treatment group using a remote computer system. Participants and assessors were masked to group assignment. Masking was achieved by using identical incisions for both procedures, blinding the operation note, and a consistent rehabilitation programme was offered regardless of group allocation. The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score at 12 months. Pre-trial simulations using data from early and late timepoints informed stopping boundaries for two interim analyses. The primary analysis was on a modified intention-to-treat basis, adjusted for the planned interim analysis. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN17825590. FINDINGS Between June 1, 2018, and July 30, 2020, we assessed 385 people for eligibility, of which 317 were eligible. 249 (79%) people consented for inclusion in the study. 117 participants were randomly allocated to a treatment group, 61 participants to the debridement only group and 56 to the debridement with device group. A predefined stopping boundary was met at the first interim analysis and recruitment stopped with 117 participants randomised. 43% of participants were female, 57% were male. We obtained primary outcome data for 114 (97%) participants. The mean Oxford Shoulder Score at 12 months was 343 (SD 111) in the debridement only group and 303 (109) in the debridement with device group (mean difference adjusted for adaptive design -42 [95% CI -82 to -026];p=0037) favouring control. There was no difference in adverse events between the two groups. INTERPRETATION In an efficient, adaptive trial design, our results favoured the debridement only group.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the therapeutic effects of Tranilast in combination with antiviral drugs in non-ICU-admitted hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This study was an open-label clinical trial that included 72 hospitals admitted patients with severe COVID-19 at Razi Hospital, Ahvaz, Iran, from July 2020CAugust 2020. These patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to control (30) and intervention groups (30). Patients in the control group received antiviral therapy, while patients in the intervention group received Tranilast (300 mg daily) in addition to the antiviral drugs for Seven days. The collected data, including the expression of inflammatory cytokine, laboratory tests, and clinical findings, was used for intragroup comparisons. RESULTS: The intervention group showed significantly lower levels of NLR (p = 0.001), q-CRP (p = 0.002), IL-1 (p = 0.001), TNF (p = 0.001), and LDH (p = 0.046) in comparison with the control group. The effect of intervention was significant in increasing the o2 saturation (F = 7.72, p = 0.007).

HIV patients was investigated. METHODS One hundred and sixty-five eyes of ninety HIV positive patients were enrolled and evaluated for CMVR with binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy. Then, a single central field of the fundus image was recorded from each eye. All images were then interpreted by both machine learning models, generated by using the Keras application, and by a third-year ophthalmology resident. Diagnostic performance of CMVR screening using a machine learning model and the third-year ophthalmology resident were analyzed and compared. RESULTS Machine learning model, Keras application (VGG16) provided 68.8% (95%CI=50-83.9%) sensitivity and 100% (95%CI= 97.2-100%) specificity. The program provided accuracy of 93.94%. While the sensitivity and specificity for the third-year ophthalmology grading were 67.7% (95%CI=48.6-83.3%) and 98.4% (95%CI=94.5-99.8%). The accuracy for CMVR classification was 89.70%. When considering for sight threatening retinitis in zone 1 and excluded zone 2 and 3, the machine learning model provided high sensitivity of 88.2% (95%CI=63.6-98.5%) and high specificity of 100% (95%CI= 97.2-100%). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated the benefit of the machine learning model VGG16 which provided high sensitivity and specificity for detecting sight threatening CMVR in HIV positive patients.

However, the rapid accumulation of genomic data from around the world -- with over two million genomes currently available in the GISAID database -- is testing the limits of standard phylogenetic methods. Here, we describe a new approach to rapidly analyze and visualize large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Using Python, genomes are filtered for problematic sites, incomplete coverage, and excessive divergence from a strict molecular clock. All differences from the reference genome, including indels, are extracted using minimap2, and compactly stored as a set of features for each genome. For each Pango lineage (https://cov-lineages.org), we collapse genomes with identical features into variants, generate 100 bootstrap samples of the feature set union to generate weights, and compute the symmetric differences between the weighted feature sets for every pair of variants. The resulting distance matrices are used to generate neigihbor-joining trees in RapidNJ and converted into a majority-rule consensus tree for the lineage. Branches with support values below 50% or mean lengths below 0.5 differences are collapsed, and tip labels on affected branches are mapped to internal nodes as directly-sampled ancestral variants. Currently, we process about million genomes in approximately nine hours on 34 cores. The resulting trees are visualized using the JavaScript framework D3.js as beadplots, in which variants are represented by horizontal line segments, annotated with beads representing samples by collection date. Variants are linked by vertical edges to represent branches in the consensus tree. These visualizations are published at https://filogeneti.ca/CoVizu.

The aims of our study were: i) to evaluate whether the addition of a nutraceutical (Leucodif?), could improve the efficacy of montelukast or inhaled steroids (ICS) compared to the single treatment; ii) to verify whether a treatment is more effective than another. Our study was biased by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a lockdown of almost two months in Italy. Methods The multicenter, open-label study enrolled 84 children aged 2-6 years diagnosed with recurrent wheezing and randomized them into four treatment arms for three months: ICS treatment; ii) montelukast; iii) montelukast + Leucodif; iv) ICS + Leucodif. Children were assessed at baseline and after one, two, and three months of treatment using the TRACK score for both the caregiver and the physician. Results Out of the 84 patients, 18 patients received ICS therapy, 22 patients ICS + Leucodif, 24 patients montelukast, and 20 patients montelukast + Leucodif. All four treatments resulted in a significant reduction in symptoms with no differences among the various groups. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that montelukast therapy appears to be equally effective as ICS therapy and that the addition of the nutraceutical Leucodif does not appear to improve the treatment outcome. However, in our opinion our study was strongly influenced and biased by the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which inherently resulted in reduced exposure to the viruses that commonly cause respiratory infections in children.","output":"Addition of a nutraceutical to montelukast or inhaled steroid in the treatment of wheezing during COVID-19 pandemic: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most deadly cancer in the USA. Early detection can improve CRC outcomes, but recent national screening rates (62%) remain below the 80% goal set by the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. Multiple options are endorsed for average-risk CRC screening, including the multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA) test. We evaluated cross-sectional mt-sDNA test completion in a population of commercially and Medicare-insured patients. METHODS: Participants included individuals ages 50 years and older with commercial insurance or Medicare, with a valid mt-sDNA test shipped by Exact Sciences Laboratories LLC between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2018 (n = 1,420,460). In 2020, we analyzed cross-sectional adherence, as the percent of successfully completed tests within 365 days of shipment date. RESULTS: Overall cross-sectional adherence was 66.8%. Adherence was 72.1% in participants with Traditional Medicare, 69.1% in participants with Medicare Advantage, and 61.9% in participants with commercial insurance. Adherence increased with age: 60.8% for ages 50C64, 71.3% for ages 65C75, and 74.7% for ages 76 + years.

METHODS Treatment failure was defined as the need for additional systemic corticosteroids (SCS) and/or antibiotics, hospital readmissison or death within 30 days of initial emergency department visit. We performed univariate analysis comparing characteristics of patients either given or not given SCS at exacerbation and of patients who succeeded versus failed treatment. Patient demographics, medications and exacerbation symptoms, physiology and biology were available. We developed multivariate random forest models to identify predictors of SCS prescription and for predicting treatment failure. RESULTS Data were available for 81 patients, 43 (53%) of whom failed treatment. 64 (79%) of patients were given SCS. A random forest model using presence of wheeze at exacerbation and blood eosinophil percentage predicted SCS prescription with area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.69. An 11 variable random forest model (which included medication, previous exacerbations, symptoms and quality of life scores) could predict treatment failure with AUC 0.81. A random forest model using just the two best predictors of treatment failure, namely, visual analogue scale for breathlessness and sputum purulence, predicted treatment failure with AUC 0.68.

In this short communication, we use data from official UK air-quality sensors (DEFRA AURN) and the UK Met Office stations to show how lockdown measures affected air quality in the UK. We compare the 100 days post-lockdown (23 March to 30 June 2020) with the same period from the previous 7 years. We find, as shown in numerous studies of other countries, the nitrogen oxides levels across the country dropped substantially (a 50%). However, we also find the ozone levels increased (a 10%), and the levels of sulphur dioxide more than doubled across the country. These changes, driven by a complex balance in the air chemistry near the surface, may reflect the influence of low humidity as suggested by Met Office data, and potentially, the reduction of nitrogen oxides and their interactions with multiple pollutants.","output":"UK COVID-19 lockdown: 100 days of air pollution reduction?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis could leave significant numbers of women and couples without access to essential sexual and reproductive health care. This research note analyses differences in contraceptive method mix across Sustainable Development Goal regions and applies assumed method-specific declines in use to produce an illustrative scenario of the potential impact of COVID-19 on contraceptive use and on the proportion of the need for family planning satisfied by modern methods. Globally, it had been estimated that 77 per cent of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) would have their need for family planning satisfied with modern contraceptive methods in 2020. However, taking into account the potential impact of COVID-19 on method-specific use, this could fall to 71 per cent, resulting in around 60 million fewer users of modern contraception worldwide in 2020. Overall declines in contraceptive use will depend on the methods used by women and their partners and on the types of disruptions experienced. The analysis concludes with the recommendation that countries should include family planning and reproductive health services in the package of essential services and develop strategies to ensure that women and couples are able to exercise their reproductive rights during the COVID-19 crisis.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on meeting needs for family planning: a global scenario by contraceptive methods used."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected in Japan in January 2020 and has spread throughout the country. Previous studies have reported that viral interference among influenza virus, rhinovirus, and other respiratory viruses can affect viral infections at the host and population level. METHODS: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 on influenza and other respiratory virus infections, we analyzed clinical specimens collected from 2244 patients in Japan with respiratory diseases between January 2018 and September 2020. RESULTS: The frequency of influenza and other respiratory viruses (coxsackievirus A and B; echovirus; enterovirus; human coronavirus 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43; human metapneumovirus; human parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4; human parechovirus; human respiratory syncytial virus; human adenovirus; human bocavirus; human parvovirus B19; herpes simplex virus type 1; and varicella-zoster virus) was appreciably reduced among all patients during the COVID-19 pandemic except for that of rhinovirus in children younger than 10 years, which was appreciably increased.

This study examined the experience of a similar group of physicians during the second pandemic wave. We reported the associations between burnout and physician age, gender, having children at home and training route. METHODS: This study utilized a national survey of Canadian emergency physicians. We collected data on demographics and measured burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Multiple logistic regression models identified associations between the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization domains of the MBI and EM physician demographics (age, gender, children living at home, and training route). RESULTS: Between November 25, 2020, and February 4, 2021, 416 emergency physicians completed the survey, representing all Provinces or Territories in Canada (except Nunavut). The mean participant age was 44, 53% were male, 64% had children living at home and 41% were FRCPC and 41% CCFP-EM trained. Sixty percent reported high burnout (either high emotional exhaustion and/or high depersonalization). Increasing age was associated with lower emotional exhaustion and depersonalization; female or nonbinary gender was associated with an increase in emotional exhaustion; and having children living at home was associated with lower depersonalization. CONCLUSIONS: Most Canadian emergency physicians participating in our study during the COVID-19 pandemic reported high burnout levels. Younger physicians and female physicians were more likely than their coworkers to report high burnout levels. Hospitals should address emergency physician burnout during the pandemic because it is a threat to quality of patient care and retention of the workforce for the future.

Using next-generation sequencing technologies, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes are being sequenced at an unprecedented rate and being deposited in public repositories. For the de novo assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, a myriad of assemblers is being used, although their impact on the assembly quality has not been characterized for this virus. In this study, we aim to understand the variabilities on assembly qualities due to the choice of the assemblers. Results We performed 6,648 de novo assemblies of 416 SARS-CoV-2 samples using 8 different assemblers with different k-mers. We used Illumina paired-end sequencing reads and compared the genome assembly quality to that of different assemblers. We showed the choice of assemblers plays a significant role in reconstructing the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Two metagenomic assemblers e.g. MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes performed better compared to others in most of the assembly quality metrics including, recovery of a larger fraction of the genome, constructing larger contigs and higher N50, NA50 values etc. We showed that at least 09% (259/2,873) of the variants present in the assemblies between MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes are unique to the assembly methods. Conclusion Our analyses indicate the critical role of assembly methods for assembling SARS-CoV-2 genome using short reads and their impact on variant characterization. This study could help guide future studies to determine which assembler is best suited for the de novo assembly of virus genomes.","output":"Choice of assemblers has a critical impact on de novo assembly of SARS-CoV-2 genome and characterizing variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The occurrence of postoperative neurocognitive deficits(POND)after major cardiac surgery is associated with an increase in perioperative mortality and morbidity. Oxidative stress caused by oxygen can affect neuronal damage, which can lead to POND. Whether the intraoperative rSO2 value reflects oxidative stress and the associated incidence of POND is unknown. METHODS Among 3482 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 976 patients were allocated for this retrospective study. Of these, 230 patients (32.5%) were observed to have postoperative neurologic symptoms. After propensity score 1:2 ratio matching, a total of 690 patients were included in the analysis. Recorded data on the occurrence of POND from the postoperative period to predischarge were collected from the electronic records. RESULTS The mean baseline rSO2 value was higher in the POND (-) group than in the POND (+) group. The mean overall minimum rSO2 value was lower in the POND (+) group (52.2  8.3 vs 48.3  10.5, P < 0.001). The mean overall maximum rSO2 values were not significantly different between the two groups (72.7  8.3 vs 73.2  9.2, P = 0.526). However, there was a greater increase in the overall maximum rSO2 values as compared with baseline in the POND (+) group (10.9  8.2 vs 17.9  10.2, P < 0.001). The degree of increase in the maximum rSO2 value was a risk factor affecting the occurrence of POND (adjusted odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.11; P < 0.001). The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for delta values of minimal and maximal compared with baseline values were 0.60 and 0.71, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Increased cerebral oximeter levels during cardiac surgery may also be a risk factor for POND.

Social distancing is known to weaken incidences and deaths due to COVID-19, however, there are detrimental economic and psychological effects. This motivates us to analyze incidences (and deaths) of COVID-19 along with a measure of the health of the US economy (i.e., the adjusted closing price of the Dow Jones Industrial), and a measure of the public interest in COVID-19 through Google Trends data. The model we implement is developed to be easily adapted to a data scientist's preferred method for continuous data, which is done to aid future analyses of this important dataset. This dataset consists of multiple response types (e.g., continuous-valued, count-valued, binomial counts). Thus, we introduce a reasonable easy-to-implement all-purpose method that \\"converts\\" a statistical model for continuous responses (the preferred model) into a Bayesian model for multi-response data sets. To do this, we transform the data such that the continuous-valued transformed data can be reasonably modeled using the preferred model and the transformation itself is treated as unknown. The implementation of our approach involves two steps. The first step produces posterior replicates of the transformed data using a latent conjugate multivariate (LCM) model. The second step involves generating values from the posterior distribution implied by the preferred model. We refer to our model as the hierarchical generalized transformation (HGT) model. In a simulation, we demonstrate the flexibility of the HGT model by incorporating two different preferred models: Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) and the spatial mixed effects (spatio-temporal mixed effects) models.","output":"Joint spatio-temporal analysis of multiple response types using the hierarchical generalized transformation model with application to coronavirus disease 2019 and social distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, can present respiratory complications that often lead patients to depend on mechanical ventilation (MV) for several days. It is known that Pneumonia Associated with Mechanical Ventilation (PAMV) is frequent in patients who use this equipment for a long time. As a consequence of COVID-19, its prolonged use can lead to a worse prognosis for the patients. For this reason, in addition to the insufficiency of devices for mechanical ventilation to meet the current demand, it is necessary to adopt measures aimed at preventing complications that may aggravate the patient's clinical condition and, consequently, increase the average hospital stay and the respective hospital care costs. Therefore, the objective of this study was to discuss, in a concise and practical way, and based on the available literature, the importance of adopting adequate oral hygiene protocols for patients on mechanical ventilation. Based on the data obtained, it was identified that the adoption of effective oral hygiene measures, especially under the supervision of dental professionals, can contribute to the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with MV, resulting in greater availability of mechanical ventilation equipment. Since such equipment is in great demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, the knowledge and implementation of effective oral hygiene measures will undoubtedly have an impact on improving the quality of care offered to patients, therefore benefiting all those in critical health conditions and assisted in ICUs.","output":"Impact of oral hygiene in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conduct a phylogeographic and population genetic study of the Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans) to understand its evolutionary history, and the influence of geology and climate.

To date, however, no known study has examined the prevalence, risk and protective factors of psychiatric conditions among US military veterans who survived COVID-19. METHODS: Data were analysed from the 2019 to 2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 3078 US veterans. Prepandemic and 1-year peripandemic risk and protective factors associated with positive screens for peripandemic internalising (major depressive, generalised anxiety and/or posttraumatic stress disorders) and externalising psychiatric disorders (alcohol and/or drug use disorders) and suicidal ideation were examined using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 233 veterans (8.6%) reported having been infected with COVID-19. Relative to veterans who were not infected, veterans who were infected were more likely to screen positive for internalising disorders (20.5% vs 13.9%, p=0.005), externalising disorders (23.2% vs 14.8%, p=0.001) and current suicidal ideation (12.0% vs 7.6%, p=0.015) at peripandemic. Multivariable analyses revealed that greater prepandemic psychiatric symptom severity and COVID-related stressors were the strongest independent predictors of peripandemic internalising disorders, while prepandemic trauma burden was protective. Prepandemic suicidal ideation, greater loneliness and lower household income were the strongest independent predictors of peripandemic suicidal ideation, whereas prepandemic community integration was protective. CONCLUSION: Psychiatric symptoms and suicidal ideation are prevalent in veterans who have survived COVID-19.

There is a lack of guidance on triaging patients with COVID-19 in the clinical literature. To address this need, our study evaluated factors that predicted hospitalization of patients due to COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and medical evaluation at the VALB HCS between August 1 and December 31, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 positive patients admitted to the hospital for a non-COVID-19 related diagnosis were excluded. At the time of initial evaluation, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, and PCR cycle threshold were collected and compared between patients admitted to the hospital and those managed in the community. A multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate predictors for hospitalization due to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 748 patients, 94 were admitted to the hospital and 654 were community-managed. The outcomes from the logistic regression analysis indicated that the model explained 58.8% of variance and was a significant predictor of hospitalization (X2 [8, 737] = 277.5, p< 0.0001). Patients with self-reported shortness of breath (OR=12.14, 95% CI=6.43-22.92) or diarrhea (OR=2.78, 95% CI=1.33-5.84) were more likely to be hospitalized, whereas patients with sore throat (OR=0.095, 95% CI=0.017-0.53) or body ache (OR=0.42, 95% CI=0.20-0.89) were less likely to be hospitalized than patients not having such symptoms. Every unit increase in patients age and temperature increased the likelihood of hospitalization by 7.6% and 62.7%, respectively. Every unit increase in patients diastolic pressure and SpO(2)% decreased the likelihood of hospitalization by 6.1% and 3.6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that patients with shortness of breath, diarrhea, temperature, and old age were more likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19. The results may help providers in clinical decision making regarding whether to admit the patient or not. These findings may be especially helpful when hospital bed availability is limited.

PROGRAM: We describe logistics of establishing and operating isolation and noncongregate hotels for COVID-19 mitigation and use the isolation hotel as an opportunity to understand COVID-19 symptom evolution among people experiencing homelessness (PEH). IMPLEMENTATION: Multiple agencies in Atlanta, Georgia, established an isolation hotel for PEH with COVID-19 and noncongregate hotel for PEH without COVID-19 but at risk of severe illness. PEH were referred to the isolation hotel through proactive, community-based testing and hospital-based testing. Daily symptoms were recorded prospectively. Disposition location was recorded for all clients. EVALUATION: During April 10 to September 1, 2020, 181 isolation hotel clients (77 community referrals; 104 hospital referrals) were admitted a median 3 days after testing. Overall, 32% of community referrals and 7% of hospital referrals became symptomatic after testing positive; 83% of isolation hotel clients reported symptoms at some point; 93% completed isolation. Among 302 noncongregate hotel clients, median stay was 18 weeks; 61% were discharged to permanent housing or had a permanent housing discharge plan. DISCUSSION: Overall, a high proportion of PEH completed isolation at the hotel, suggesting a high level of acceptability. Many PEH with COVID-19 diagnosed in the community developed symptoms after testing, indicating that proactive, community-based testing can facilitate early isolation. Noncongregate hotels can be a useful COVID-19 community mitigation strategy by bridging PEH at risk of severe illness to permanent housing.","output":"Establishment of Isolation and Noncongregate Hotels During COVID-19 and Symptom Evolution Among People Experiencing Homelessness-Atlanta, Georgia, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of implementing research-tested physical activity (PA) behavior change counseling (BCC) sessions in an existing cancer-exercise program, and the preliminary effects on cancer survivors self-efficacy and PA. Methods: Participants were cancer survivors undergoing or within six-months of completing cancer treatment(s), and exercise program staff. Cancer survivors were randomized to receive the exercise program plus PABCC, or the standard exercise program. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed by recruitment, adherence, satisfaction, and a focus group with program staff. Qualitative data were analyzed using descriptive thematic analysis.

Unfortunately, the mechanism of coagulopathy is not clearly addressed. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of COVID-19 thrombosis and improving the coagulopathy through efficient treatment may help to stop disease progression, reduce mortality and sequelae. In severe COVID-19 patients, inflammation, cytokine storm, and coagulation are closely related, which together cause blood congestion and thrombosis. Many cytokines activate blood cells, expressing activating factors or releasing activated microparticles, and then accelerating thrombosis. However, the role of blood cells is not well understood in COVID-19 patients. In addition, cytokines stimulate endothelial cells, transforming them into a procoagulant phenotype. Therefore, determine their role and propose new strategies for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis in severe COVID-19 patients.

This has been the focus of intense study for many decades without providing consistent supporting data to link CNS findings to epidemiological risk factors or to the usual clinicopathological findings. Despite this, and the apparent oversight of the link between prone sleep position and respiratory infection, papers citing CNS, cardiac and sleep arousal findings continue to be published. Discovery of the prone sleep position risk factor provided tangential support for the cardiorespiratory control hypothesis which defines the mainstream approach. Despite many decades of research and huge expenditure, no aetiological answer has been forthcoming. In asking why?, this paper exposes some of the shortcomings regarding this apparent oversight by mainstream SIDS researchers and examines the role of respiratory infection and puts the case for the Infection Hypothesis. In addition, the paper provides encouragement to neuropathologists to examine the potential link between CNS findings and cardiac function (as opposed to respiratory function) in relation to infection and to examine possible correlates between CNS findings and established risk factors such as recent infection, contaminated sleeping surfaces, maternal/obstetric/higher birth, ethnicity, non-breast-feeding, male gender, etc. or with the usual gross pathological findings of SIDS (intrathoracic petechial hemorrhages, liquid blood, congested lungs).

METHODOLOGY/METHODS This was a mixed design, including descriptive and qualitative research methods with two stages, and was carried out between March and April 2021. The study adhered to the STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies and the COREQ guidelines for qualitative studies. SETTING Nurses in the COVID-19 intensive care unit of a university hospital constituted the sample. 58 nurses participated in the quantitative data phase, and 18 nurses in the qualitative interviews. RESULTS More than half of the nurses worked in the COVID-19 intensive care unit for more than 5 months and overtime, and 87.9 had day and night shifts. The monthly income level of 65.5% was between the hunger and poverty lines, and 12.1 % received psychiatric support in the last 6 months. A positive and significant relationship was found between the mean score obtained from the alarm fatigue questionnaire and the level of discomfort felt due to the alarms (1-10 points) (p = 0.001). Five themes and thirty sub-themes were emerged in the focus group interviews. CONCLUSION The number of alarms of the medical devices in the COVID-19 intensive care units was more than the other intensive care units, resulting in fatigue in nurses. Since alarm fatigue is directly related to patient safety, the effective management of medical device alarms can reduce alarm fatigue and prevent potentially dangerous outcomes. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Nurses care for patients with severe clinical conditions in COVID-19 intensive care units. This situation caused them to be exposed to more alarms.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been widely used to treat COVID-19 in China, and the most used one is Lianhuaqingwen (LH). This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of LH combined with usual treatment vs usual treatment alone in treating mild or moderate COVID-19 by a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: : We systematically searched the Medline (OVID), Embase, the Cochrane Library, and 4 Chinese databases from inception to July 2020 to include the RCTs that evaluated the efficacy and safety of LH in combination with usual treatment vs usual treatment for mild or moderate COVID-19. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: : A total of 5 RCTs with 824 individuals with mild or moderate COVID 19 were included. Compared with the usual treatment alone, LH in combination with usual treatment significantly improved the overall clinical efficacy (RRa=a2.39, 95% CI 1.61-3.55), increased the rate of recovery of chest computed tomographic manifestations (RRa=a1.80, 95% CI 1.08-3.01), reduced the rate of conversion to severe cases (RRa=a0.47, 95% CI 0.29-0.74), shorten the duration of fever (MDa=a-1.00, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.84). Moreover, LH in combination with usual treatment did not increase the occurrence of the adverse event compared to usual treatment alone. CONCLUSION: : Our meta-analysis of RCTs indicated that LH in combination with usual treatment may improve the clinical efficacy in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 without increasing adverse events. However, given the limitations and poor quality of included trials in this study, further large-sample RCTs or high-quality real-world studies are needed to confirm our conclusions.","output":"Efficacy and safety of Lianhuaqingwen for mild or moderate coronavirus disease 2019: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Postpneumonectomy patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) There is a paucity of data regarding the optimal management of mechanical ventilation for postpneumonectomy patients Esophageal balloon pressure monitoring has been used in traditional ARDS patients to set positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and minimize transpulmonary driving pressure (PL), but its clinical use has not been previously described nor validated in postpneumonectomy patients The primary objective of this report was to describe the potential clinical application of esophageal pressure monitoring to manage the postpneumonectomy patient with ARDS Design Case report Setting Surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university-affiliated teaching hospital Patient A 28-year-old patient was involved in a motor vehicle collision, with a right main bronchus injury, that required a right-sided pneumonectomy to stabilize his condition In the perioperative phase, they subsequently developed ventilator-associated pneumonia, significant cumulative positive fluid balance, and ARDS Interventions Prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade were initiated An esophageal balloon was inserted to direct ventilator management Measurements and Main Results VT was kept around 3 6 mL/kg PBW, PL at 14 cm H2O, and plateau pressure at 30 cm H2O Lung compliance was measured to be 37 mL/cm H2O PEEP was optimized to maintain end-inspiratory transpulmonary pressure PL&lt;15 cm H2O, and end-expiratory PL between 0 and 5 cm H2O The maximal PL was measured to be 11 cm H2O during the care of this patient The patient improved with esophageal balloon-directed ventilator management and was eventually liberated from mechanical ventilation Conclusions The optimal targets for VT remain unknown in the postpneumonectomy patient However, postpneumonectomy patients with ARDS may potentially benefit from very low VT and optimization of PEEP We demonstrate the application of esophageal balloon pressure monitoring that clinicians could potentially use to limit injurious ventilation and improve outcomes in postpneumonectomy patients with ARDS However, esophageal balloon pressure monitoring has not been extensively validated in this patient population","output":"Esophageal Balloon-Directed Ventilator Management for Postpneumonectomy Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Satellite viruses, most commonly found in plants, rely on helper viruses to complete their replication cycle. The only known example of a human satellite virus is the hepatitis D virus (HDV), and it is generally thought to require hepatitis B virus (HBV) to form infectious particles. Until 2018, HDV was the sole representative of the genus Deltavirus and was thought to have evolved in humans, the only known HDV host. The subsequent identification of HDV-like agents in birds, snakes, fish, amphibians, and invertebrates indicated that the evolutionary history of deltaviruses is likely much longer than previously hypothesized. Interestingly, none of the HDV-like agents were found in coinfection with an HBV-like agent, suggesting that these viruses use different helper virus(es). Here we show, using snake deltavirus (SDeV), that HBV and hepadnaviruses represent only one example of helper viruses for deltaviruses. We cloned the SDeV genome into a mammalian expression plasmid, and by transfection could initiate SDeV replication in cultured snake and mammalian cell lines. By superinfecting persistently SDeV-infected cells with reptarenaviruses and hartmaniviruses, or by transfecting their surface proteins, we could induce production of infectious SDeV particles. Our findings indicate that deltaviruses can likely use a multitude of helper viruses or even viral glycoproteins to form infectious particles. This suggests that persistent infections, such as those caused by arenaviruses and orthohantaviruses used in this study, and recurrent infections would be beneficial for the spread of deltaviruses. It seems plausible that further human or animal disease associations with deltavirus infections will be identified in the future.","output":"Snake Deltavirus Utilizes Envelope Proteins of Different Viruses To Generate Infectious Particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The speed and volume of clinical research to discover effective drug against novel corona virus has been remarkable.

The exposure to experimental drugs with limited evidence of risk - benefit makes it more crucial to adapt robust safety monitoring, accuracy in adverse event reporting, and timely assessment. With the current restriction on physical contact, travel and free movements, isolation, quarantine, and huge clinical workload during pandemic, causality assessment will be more challenging. It may not be possible to capture details of all adverse events, thereby affecting completeness and quality of safety reports. A substantial number of COVID 19 patients will receive investigational drugs along with multiple other medications for clinical manifestations and drug therapy for lifestyle diseases.

Moral injury is associated with negative emotions such as guilt, shame and anger, and a sense of betrayal and is identified among veterans following exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIE). Objective We experimentally investigate how PMIE characteristics affect the intensity of MI and related negative moral emotions in participants with varied military experience. Method We conducted three controlled, randomized experiments. Each exposed male respondents with active combat experience (Study 1) and varied military experience (Study 2) to four textual vignettes describing PMIE (child/adult and innocent/non-innocent suspect) that transpire at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank. In study 3, we exposed participants to two scenarios, where descriptions of police officers enforcing COVID 19 restrictions confronted lockdown violators. Results Participants assigned to vignettes describing killing an innocent civilian exhibited more intense levels of shame and guilt than those assigned to vignettes describing killing a person carrying a bomb. Religiosity and political ideology were strong predictors of guilt and shame in response to descriptions of checkpoint shootings. These effects disappeared in Study 3, suggesting that political ideology drives MI in intergroup conflict. Conclusions Background and PMIE-related characteristics affect the development of moral injury. Additionally, lab experiments demonstrate the potential and limitations of controlled studies of moral injury and facilitate an understanding of the aetiology of moral injury in a way unavailable to clinicians. Finally, experimental findings and methodologies offer further insights into the genesis of moral injury and avenues for therapy and prophylaxis.

Instead of the uniform mixing hypothesis, we adopt networked metapopulation to build the model of the epidemic spreading and the individuals migration. In these populations, individuals are connected by contact network and populations are coupled by individuals migration. With the network mean-field and the gravity law of migration, we establish the N-seat intertwined SIR model and obtain its basic reproduction number [Formula: see text]. Meanwhile, we devise a non-markov Node-Search algorithm for model statistical simulations. Through the static network migration ansatz and [Formula: see text] formula, we discover that migration will not directly increase the epidemic replication capacity. But when [Formula: see text] , the migration will make the susceptive population evolve from metastable state (disease-free equilibrium) to stable state (endemic equilibrium), and then increase the infections number. Re-evoluting the epidemic outbreak in Wuhan, top 94 cities empirical data verify the above mechanism. In addition, we estimate that the positive anti-epidemic measures taken by the Chinese government may have reduced 4 million cases at least during the first wave of COVID-19, which means those measures, such as the epidemiological investigation, nucleic acid detection in medium-high risk areas and isolation of confirmed cases, also play a significant role in preventing epidemic spreading after travel restriction between cities.","output":"Epidemic spreading with migration in networked metapopulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ebola is a deadly infectious virus that spreads very quickly through human-to-human transmission and sometimes death.

METHODS: Two months before the first case of the COVID-19 in Serbia, we obtained the Serbian Version of Quality of Life Inventory for Epilepsy 31 (SVQOLIE-31) and Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy scores (SVNDDI-E) for another study. We retested the same patients one year after in COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to SVQOLIE-31, and SVNDDI-E we used a generic questionnaire compiled from items related to the COVID-19. RESULTS: We retested 97 out of 118 patients (82.2%) for the follow-up analysis. The average age was 36.1a?a?12.2 (range: 18-69), and 49 were women (50.5%). The median duration of epilepsy was 13a?years (range: 1.5-48). The structural etiology of epilepsy was noted in 41 (42.3%), unknown etiology in 41 (42.3%), and genetic etiology in 15 (15.4%) patients. Fewer patients (27.8%) experienced at least one seizure three months before follow-up testing when compared to patients who experienced at least one seizure three months in initial testing (36.0%) (pa?=a?0.15). All patients reported full compliance with anti-seizure medication in the follow-up. The SVQOLIE-31 score during the COVID-19 pandemic visit (64.5a?a?14.6) was significantly lower than the SVQOLIE-31 score before the pandemic (pa?<a?0.001). The SVNDDI-E score during the COVID-19 pandemic (10.5a?a?3.5) was significantly higher than the SVNDDI-E score before it (pa?<a?0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses revealed fear of seizures, and fear of a reduction in household income, significantly associated with SVQOLIE-31 and SVNDDI-E overall score. These variables accounted for 66% and 27% of the variance of SVQOLIE-31 and SVNDDI-E overall score.

In this study, we propose a simple Multiple Linear Regression model, optimised to use phone call data to forecast the number of daily confirmed cases. Moreover, we produce a probabilistic forecast that allows decision makers to better deal with risk. Our proposed approach outperforms ARIMA, ETS, Seasonal Naive, Prophet and a regression model without call data, evaluated by three point forecast error metrics, one prediction interval and two probabilistic forecast accuracy measures. The simplicity, interpretability and reliability of the model, obtained in a careful forecasting exercise, is a meaningful contribution to decision makers at local level who acutely need to organise resources in already strained health services. We hope that this model would serve as a building block of other forecasting efforts that on the one hand would help front-line personal and decision makers at local level, and on the other would facilitate the communication with other modelling efforts being made at the national level to improve the way we tackle this pandemic and other similar future challenges.","output":"Forecasting COVID-19 daily cases using phone call data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as a predominant health concern affecting approximately a quarter of the worlds population.

Despite its prevalence and severity, no targeted pharmacological intervention is approved to date. Thus, it is imperative to identify suitable drug targets critical to the development and progression of NAFLD. In this quest, a ray of hope is nestled within a group of proteins, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), as targets to contain or even reverse NAFLD. RTKs control numerous vital biological processes and their selective expression and activity in specific diseases have rendered them useful as drug targets. In this review, we discuss the recent advancements in characterizing the role of RTKs in NAFLD progression and qualify their suitability as pharmacological targets. Available data suggests inhibition of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, AXL, Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor, and activation of cellular mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 could pave the way for novel NAFLD therapeutics.

METHOD: We conducted a qualitative analysis of written, unstructured comments provided by respondents to a survey of IAHPC members between May and June 2020. Free text was exported to MAX QDA, and a thematic analysis was performed by reading the comments and developing a coding frame. RESULTS: Seventy-seven palliative care workers from 41 countries submitted at least one written comment, resulting in a data corpus of 10,694 words and a total of 374 coded comments. Eight main themes are emerged from the analysis: palliative care development, workforce impact, work reorganization, palliative care reconceptualization, economic and financial impacts, increased risk, emotional impact, and coping strategies. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The pandemic has had a huge impact on palliative care workers including their ability to work and their financial status. It has generated increased workloads and placed them in vulnerable positions that affect their emotional well-being, resulting in distress and burnout. Counseling and support networks provide important resilience-building buffers. Coping strategies such as team and family support are important factors in workers' capacity to adapt and respond.

The first clinical trials demonstrated that GLP-1 receptor SPECT/CT using [Lys(40)(Ahx [6-aminohexanoic acid]-DOTA-(111)In)NH(2)]-exendin-4 can localize hardly detectable insulinomas. However, [Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA-(111)In)NH(2)]-exendin-4 imaging has drawbacks related to the use of (111)In in that it is costly and carries a relatively high radiation burden for the patient. The aim of this study was the preclinical evaluation of [Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA-(68)Ga)NH(2)]-exendin-4 for PET/CT and [Lys(40)(Ahx-hydrazinonicotinamide [HYNIC]-(99m)Tc)NH(2)]-exendin-4 for SPECT/CT. METHODS Internalization, biodistribution, dosimetry, and imaging studies were performed in the Rip1Tag2 mouse model of pancreatic beta-cell carcinogenesis and compared with our gold standard [Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA-(111)In)NH(2)]-exendin-4. Poly-glutamic acid and Gelofusine, a gelatin-based plasma expander, were used for renal uptake reduction studies. RESULTS The tumor uptake of [Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA-(68)Ga)NH(2)]-exendin-4 was 205 +/- 59 percentage injected activity per gram of tissue at 4 h. Other GLP-1 receptor-positive organs showed more than 4.8 times lower radioactivity uptake. [Lys(40)(Ahx-HYNIC-(99m)Tc/ethylenediaminediacetic acid [EDDA])NH(2)]-exendin-4, compared with its (111)In- and (68)Ga-labeled sister compounds, showed significantly less tumor and organ uptake. The significantly lower tumor and organ uptake of [Lys(40)(Ahx-HYNIC-(99m)Tc/EDDA)NH(2)]-exendin-4 did not result in inferior tumor-to-organ ratios or reduced image quality. All radiopeptides tested showed a high tumor-to-background ratio, resulting in the visualization of small tumors (maximum diameter between 1.0 and 3.2 mm) by SPECT and PET. The only exception was the kidneys, which also showed high uptake. This uptake could be reduced by 49%-78% using poly-glutamic acid, Gelofusine, or a combination of the 2. The estimated effective radiation dose was 3.7 muSv/MBq for [Lys(40)(Ahx-HYNIC-(99m)Tc/EDDA)NH(2)]-exendin-4, which was 8 times less than that for [Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA-(68)Ga)NH(2)]-exendin-4 and 43 times less than that for [Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA-(111)In)NH(2)]-exendin-4.

The LncOb rs10487505 variant has been associated with body mass index (BMI), and the C allele was reported as leptin-lowering. We evaluated the association of rs10487505 with leptin levels, liver histology, and surgery-induced weight loss in youths with NAFLD. METHODS: One-hundred five obese youths with NAFLD, of whom 19 undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), were analyzed for rs10487505 and leptin circulating levels. RESULTS: The G allele frequency was lower in youths with NAFLD than in controls (p = 0.049). No difference was found in anthropometrics, biochemistry and histology between G allele carriers and CC homozygotes, except for leptin levels (p = 0.016). Leptin correlated with body weight, BMI, BMI-z score, waist circumference, insulin resistance/sensitivity, and triglycerides (p  0.01). A multivariable regression model including body weight and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance was a good predictor of plasma leptin (R2 = 0.45), and the addition of genotype to the model increased the R2 to 0.50. Following LSG, leptin levels and body weight were more reduced in G allele carriers (p < 0.05).

Some of these glycans on zoonotic viruses of mammalian reservoirs are recognized by human natural antibodies that may protect against such viruses. These antibodies are produced mostly against carbohydrate antigens on gastrointestinal bacteria and fortuitously, they bind to carbohydrate antigens synthesized in other mammals, neutralize and destroy viruses presenting these antigens. Two such antibodies are: anti-Gal binding to -gal epitopes synthesized in non-primate mammals, lemurs, and New World monkeys, and anti-N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (anti-Neu5Gc) binding to N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) synthesized in apes, Old World monkeys, and many non-primate mammals. Anti-Gal appeared in Old World primates following accidental inactivation of the 1,3galactosyltransferase gene 20C30 million years ago. Anti-Neu5Gc appeared in hominins following the inactivation of the cytidine-monophosphate-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid hydroxylase gene, which led to the loss of Neu5Gc <6 million-years-ago. It is suggested that an epidemic of a lethal virus eliminated ancestral Old World-primates synthesizing -gal epitopes, whereas few mutated offspring lacking -gal epitopes and producing anti-Gal survived because anti-Gal destroyed viruses presenting -gal epitopes, following replication in parental populations. Similarly, anti-Neu5Gc protected few mutated hominins lacking Neu5Gc in lethal virus epidemics that eliminated parental hominins synthesizing Neu5Gc. Since -gal epitopes are presented on many zoonotic viruses it is suggested that vaccines elevating anti-Gal titers may be of protective significance in areas endemic for such zoonotic viruses.

The demand of macronutrients is satisfied by means of nine different groups of food, used to provide some level of variability in the consumption patterns of the beneficiaries. The results provide insight on cost-cutting opportunities related to centralizing the decision-making process, indicating a 10% reduction both in provisioning costs and food quantities.

Standard vaccine response is generally lower among these patients. The adequate antibody titer response and the outcome of COVID-19 vaccine responders versus non-responders are unknown. METHODS Hemodialysis patients on maintenance hemodialysis who have received two doses of Pfizer BNT162B2 vaccine were studied. Antibody response was tested after 14 days of the second dose. LIAISON SARS-CoV2 S1/S2 IgG test by DiaSorin (Italy) was used to assess antibody response. Patients were followed between 3 and 7 months after vaccination for COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and death related to COVID-19. FINDINGS A total of 138 patients received two doses of Pfizer BNT162B2 vaccine. One hundred and twenty-seven patients had adequate response to the vaccine with IgG level  15 AU/ml versus 11 patients had poor response with IgG level  15 AU/ml. The response was 92% (127/138). Patient with history of prior COVID-19 infection had higher antibody titer mean of 339  113 versus 157  140 for patient with no prior history of COVID-19. Seven patients in both groups had COVID-19 infection post vaccine. Among the responders, five patients had COIVD-19 infection and two were hospitalized. These two patients had lower antibody titer of 23.9 and 75.2 AU/ml. In comparison, three patients who were not hospitalized had higher antibody titer 96.3, 118, and 319 AU/ml, respectively. In the non-responders one patient was hospitalized and one death occurred with rate of infection of 18%. DISCUSSION Seropositive patients with low antibody titer might be associated with worse outcome among responders. The ideal antibody titer level among dialysis patient is not known. Also, prior COVID-19 infection is associated with higher response to vaccine with higher antibody titer. All non-responders did not have prior COVID-19 infection.

Hygienic precautions are a key aspect of dialysis care for infection prevention, but they are not sufficient to completely avoid the occurrence of CVC related infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, hygienic precautions for preventing viral transmission have been markedly reinforced. We evaluated their effects on CVC-related infection rates. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was conducted in two hemodialysis units of the same institution treating 215 chronic hemodialysis patients, 71 of whom are currently (33%) using a CVC. In the CVC cohort, we compared data on catheter-related infection rates during the maximum spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy (February to May 2020) with data from the same period of the previous year and with the whole of 2019. RESULTS: In 2019, we recorded a catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) rate of 1.19 (95% CI 0.81C1.68)/1000 days [2.07 (95% CI 1.12C3.52)/1000 days in the Feb-May 2019 period] and a tunnel and exit-site infection rate of 0.82 (95% CI 0.51C1.24)/1000 days [1.04 (95% CI 0.41C2.15)/1000 days in the FebCMay 2019 period]. Infection rates drastically decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with just one catheter-related bloodstream infection being recorded. Catheter-related bloodstream infection rates showed a significant reduction to 0.20 (95% CI 0.01C0.9)/1000 days (p < 0.05 and p < 0.005 compared to 2019 and to Feb-May 2019, respectively) and a non-significant reduction in tunnel and exit-site infections to 0.6 (95% CI 0.15C1.6)/1000 days. CONCLUSIONS: The observed 91% reduction in catheter-related bloodstream infections compared to the same period in 2019 [IRR 0.09 (95% CI 0.002C0.64)] and the 83% reduction compared to the whole of 2019 [IRR 0.17 (95% CI 0.004C1.009)] suggest that a stricter implementation of hygienic precautions in the dialysis setting can markedly improve the problem of CVC-related infections.

During viral replication mTOR, downstream target genes such as ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta 1 (S6K1) and Eukaryotic translational initiation factor 4E-binding protein1 (4-E-BP1) are activated result in ribosome biosynthesis and efficient protein synthesis. In plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), mTOR plays a key role in the association of adapter protein myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF-7) leading to the transcriptional activation of type-I interferon (IFN) genes. Viruses also inactivate the interferon  (IFN-) pathway by impairing the IRF-7 mediated activation of IFN- gene transcription. Thus, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors can help in suppressing the early stages of viral infection and replication. Interestingly, the key tumor-suppressor p53 protein will undergo degradation by virus-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase Ring-finger and CHY zinc-finger domain-containing 1 (RCHY1) leading to an increased viral survival in host cells. Thus, the mTOR inhibitors and p53 activators or microRNAs that functions as p53 and can target 3-UTR of mTOR and RPS6KB1 might effectively inhibit viral replication in the human respiratory tract and lung cells.","output":"mTOR inhibition and p53 activation, microRNAs: The possible therapy against pandemic COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteins interact with other proteins DNA and other molecules forming large-scale protein interaction networks and for easy analysis clustering methods are needed.

INTRODUCTION: A cross\\\\sectional study linking psychosocial work environment indicators to infection control adherence. METHODS: The study was conducted among 333 nurses in four Ecuadorian hospitals. Self\\\\administered questionnaires assessed demographic variables, perceived infection risk, effort\\\\reward imbalance, burnout and infection control adherence. RESULTS: Increased effort\\\\reward imbalance was found to be a unique incremental predictor of exposure to burnout, and burnout was a negative unique incremental predictor of nurses' self\\\\reported adherence with infection control measures. DISCUSSION: Results suggest an effort\\\\reward imbalance\\\\burnout continuum, which, at higher levels, contributes to reduce adherence to infection control.

This descriptive qualitative study enrolled 33 purposively selected participants who included expert clients, linkage facilitators, heads of families with people living with HIV, and health workers. Data were collected using in-depth interviews that were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated. The data were manually analyzed to generate themes. The following four themes were generated: 1) availability of services that include counseling, testing, treatment, follow-up, referral, outreach activities, and support systems. 2) Barriers to linkage to care were at the individual, health facility, and community levels. Individual-level barriers were socioeconomic status, high transport costs, fear of adverse drug effects, fear of broken relationships, and denial of positive results or treatment, while health facility barriers were reported to be long waiting time, negative staff attitude, and drug stock outs. Community barriers were mostly due to stigma experienced by HIV clients, resulting in discrimination by community members. 3) Facilitators to linkage to care were positive staff attitudes, access to information, fear of death, and support from others. 4) Suggestions for improving service delivery were shortening waiting time, integrating HIV services, increasing staff numbers, and intensifying outreaches. Our findings highlight the importance of stakeholder involvement in linkage to care.

METHODS: Multiplex real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assays were developed to detect SNPs associated with cephalosporin (ponA, porB, mtrR -35delA, penA A311V, penA A501, N513Y, G545S), ciprofloxacin (gyrA S91, parC D86/S87/S88) and azithromycin [23S (A2059G, C2611T), mtrR meningitidis-like promoter] resistance. The assays were validated on 127 gonococcal isolates, 51 non-gonococcal isolates and 50 NAATs with matched culture isolates. SNPs determined from the assay were compared with SNPs determined from in silico analysis of WGS data. MICs were determined for culture isolates using the agar dilution method. RESULTS: SNP analysis of the 50 NAAT specimens had 96% agreement with the matched culture RT-PCR analysis. When compared with MICs, presence of penA A311V or penA A501 and two or more other SNPs correlated with decreased susceptibility and presence of three or more other SNPs correlated with intermediate susceptibility to cephalosporins; presence of any associated SNP correlated with ciprofloxacin or azithromycin resistance.

METHODS: A total of 445,961 participants from UK biobank, who were free of dementia at baseline and completed data on supplement use and genetic information were analyzed in this study. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) comparing incident dementia rates in participants who did and did not use fish oil. RESULTS: During a median of 12.2 years of follow-up, a total of 5795 incident cases of dementia were documented, including 1266 cases of vascular dementia and 2382 cases of AD. After adjustment for covariates, use of fish oil supplements was significantly associated with lower risks of all-cause dementia (Hazard ratios, HR, 95% CI, 0.90, 0.85-0.96) and vascular dementia (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.97), but not AD (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.91-1.09). For all-cause dementia and vascular dementia, we found that the protective associations appeared to be attenuated by the increasing APOE ?4 dosage (P-interaction = 0.002 and 0.002, respectively). Notably, the use of fish oil supplements was significantly associated with an 86.0% higher risk of vascular dementia in participants with two APOE-?4 alleles (HR, 1.86, 95%CI, 1.23-2.80).

METHODS: Data from 13,500 consultant physicians collected by the Royal College of Physicians were analysed to determine those at an increased risk of death from COVID-19, assuming no comorbidities. RESULTS: The data reveal a picture in which a third of consultant physicians have a hazard ratio (HR) >1 for dying from COVID-19; one in five have HR >2; one in 11, HR >3; and one in 40, HR >4. Of concern are the risks to male physicians aged &#8805;60 with HR >3.8. Sub-specialties including cardiology, endocrine and diabetes, gastroenterology, haematology, neurology and rheumatology have a greater risk profile due to high proportion of men, physicians of older age, and proportion of BAME individuals. CONCLUSION: A third of consultant physicians have an increased risk of a COVID-19-related death, and one in five have a higher relative risk (HR >2).

Recombinant protein-based vaccines are usually formulated with aluminum (alum)-based adjuvants to ensure an adequate immune response. However, use of alum triggers a Th2-biased immune induction, and hence is not optimal. Although the adjuvanticity of RNA has been reported, a systematic and overall investigation on its efficacy is lacking. We found that single strand RNA (termed RNA adjuvant) derived from cricket paralysis virus intergenic region internal ribosome entry site induced the expression of various adjuvant-function-related genes, such as type 1 and 2 interferon (IFN) and toll-like receptor (TLR), T cell activation, and leukocyte chemotaxis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells; furthermore, its innate and IFN transcriptome profile patterns were similar to those of a live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine. This suggests that protein-based vaccines formulated using RNA adjuvant function as live-attenuated vaccines. Application of the RNA adjuvant in mouse enhanced the efficacy of Middle East respiratory syndrome spike protein, a protein-subunit vaccine and human papillomavirus L1 protein, a virus-like particle vaccine, by activating innate immune response through TLR7 and enhancing pAPC chemotaxis, leading to a balanced Th1/Th2 responses. Moreover, the combination of alum and the RNA adjuvant synergistically induced humoral and cellular immune responses and endowed long-term immunity. Therefore, RNA adjuvants have broad applicability and can be used with all conventional vaccines to improve vaccine efficacy qualitatively and quantitively.","output":"Cricket paralysis virus internal ribosome entry site-derived RNA promotes conventional vaccine efficacy by enhancing a balanced Th1/Th2 response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of air-borne nanoparticles (NPs) on human health is an active area of research, with clinical relevance evidenced by the current COVID-19 pandemic. As in vitro models for such studies, lung-on-a-chip (LOAC) devices can represent key physical and physiological aspects of alveolar tissues. However, widespread adoption of the LOAC device for NP testing has been hampered by low intra-laboratory and inter-laboratory reproducibility. To complement ongoing experimental work, we carried out finite-element simulations of the deposition of NPs on the epithelial layer of a well-established LOAC design. We solved the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid flow in a three-dimensional domain and studied the particle transport using Eulerian advection-diffusion for fine NPs and Lagrangian particle tracking for coarse NPs. Using Langmuir and Frumkin kinetics for surface adsorption and desorption, we investigated NP adsorption under different exercise and breath-holding patterns. Conditions mimicking physical exercise, through changes in air-flow volume and breathing frequency, enhance particle deposition. Puff profiles typical of smoking, with breath-holding between inhalation and exhalation, also increase particle deposition per breathing cycle. Lagrangian particle tracking shows Brownian motion and gravitational settling to be two key factors, which may cooperate or compete with each other for different particle sizes. Comparisons are made with experimental data where possible and they show qualitative and semi-quantitative agreement. These results suggest that computer simulations can potentially inform and accelerate the design and application of LOAC devices for analyzing particulate- and microbe-alveolar interactions.","output":"Simulation of nanoparticle transport and adsorption in a microfluidic lung-on-a-chip device."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a global pandemic spread across more than 200 countries and several measures are being taken to control it.

Research linking medical spending to variation in neighborhood resources is critical to building the case for increased funding for social conditions. However, few studies link neighborhood factors to medical spending. This study assesses the relationship between neighborhood social and environmental resources and medical spending across the spending distribution. METHODS: Individual-level health outcomes were drawn from a sample of Medicaid enrollees living in Baltimore, Maryland during 2016. A multidimensional index of neighborhood social and environmental resources was created and stratified by tertile (high, medium, and low). Differences were examined in individual-level medical spending associated with living in high-, medium-, or low-resource neighborhoods in unadjusted and adjusted 2-part models and quantile regression models. Analyses were conducted in 2019. RESULTS: Enrollees who live in neighborhoods with low social and environmental resources incur significantly higher spending at the mean and across the distribution of medical spending even after controlling for age, race, sex, and morbidity than those who live in neighborhoods with high social and environmental resources. On average, this spending difference between individuals in low- and those in high-resource neighborhoods is estimated to be $523.60 per person per year. CONCLUSIONS: Living in neighborhoods with low (versus those with high) resources is associated with higher individual-level medical spending across the distribution of medical spending. Findings suggest potential benefits from efforts to address the social and environmental context of neighborhoods in addition to the traditional orientation to addressing individual behavior and risk.","output":"Impact of Neighborhood Social and Environmental Resources on Medicaid Spending"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sports medicine is a medical specialty that supports the performance of professional and amateur athletes while maintaining their health.

In order to harmonise these national variations in the content and application of the PPE, the EFSMA Scientific and Educational Commission proposes a gold standard for elite athletes across Europe. Important objectives of PPE are early detection and prevention of severe complications during sports activities both in leisure time and competitive sports. The PPE should entail the following diagnostic components: health status, anthropometry, functional and exercise capacity. It is of utmost importance to develop and implement preventive strategies such as the PPE. Besides monitoring the health status of athletes, the PPE plays an important role in the selection process, bringing valuable information for coaches and supporting a personalised treatment approach. Screening of athletes through a standardised digital PPE could be beneficial for a better understanding of the impact of long-term physical activity.

We developed a reporting system of clusters defined as at least three COVID-19 cases, within seven days and belonging to the same community or having participated in the same gathering, whether they know each other or not. The aim of this study was to describe the typology and criticality of clusters reported between the two lockdowns in France to guide future action prioritisation. METHODS: In this study we describe the typology and criticality of COVID-19 clusters between the two lockdowns implemented in France (between May and end of October 2020). Clusters were registered in a national database named MONIC (MONItoring des Clusters), established in May 2020. This surveillance system identified the most affected communities in a timely manner. A level of criticality was defined for each cluster to take into consideration the risk of spreading within and outside the community of occurrence, and the health impact within the community. We compared the level of criticality according to the type of community in which the cluster occurred using Pearsons chi-square tests. RESULTS: A total of 7236 clusters were reported over the study period, particularly in occupational environment (25.1%, n = 1813), elderly care structures (21.9%, n = 1586), and educational establishments (15.9%, n = 1154). We show a shift over time of the most affected communities in terms of number of clusters. Clusters reported in occupational environment and the personal sphere had increased during summer while clusters reported in educational environment increased after the start of the school year. This trend mirrors change of transmission pattern overtime according to social contacts. Among all reported clusters, 43.1% had a high level of criticality with significant differences between communities (p < 0.0001). A majority of clusters had a high level of criticality in elderly care structures (82.2%), in disability care centres (56.6%), and health care facilities (51.7%).

We sought to determine how inter-region transfers could alleviate bed shortfalls during a pandemic. METHODS: We used estimates of past and projected inpatient and ICU cases of COVID-19 from February 4, 2020 to October 1, 2020. For regions with bed shortfalls (where the number of patients exceeded bed capacity), transfers to the nearest region with unused beds were simulated using an algorithm that minimized total inter-region transfer distances across the U.S. Model scenarios used a range of predicted COVID-19 volumes (lower, mean, and upper bounds) and non-COVID-19 volumes (20%, 50%, or 80% of baseline hospital volumes). Scenarios were created for each day of data, and worst-case scenarios were created treating all regions peak volumes as simultaneous. Mean per-patient transfer distances were calculated by scenario. RESULTS: For the worst-case scenarios, national bed shortfalls ranged from 669 to 58,562 inpatient beds and 3,208 to 31,190 ICU beds, depending on model volume parameters. Mean transfer distances to alleviate daily bed shortfalls ranged from 23 to 352 miles for inpatient and 28 to 423 miles for ICU patients, depending on volume. Under all worst-case scenarios except the highest-volume ICU scenario, inter-regional transfers could fully resolve bed shortfalls. To do so, mean transfer distances would be 24 to 405 miles for inpatients and 73 to 476 miles for ICU patients.

The desire for fast access to vaccines triggered discussion of unrestricted access to research findings with the hope of facilitating the drug discovery process to combat COVID-19. Increasingly, abolition of the patent system is being discussed in connection with the fight against the pandemic. This may accelerate discovery of and increase access to medicines. However, society's desire for immediate disclosure of research findings conflicts with the inventor's legitimate interest to protect his or her invention as well as the need to recover investments made to develop the drug. The call for immediate disclosure of research results contradicts the interest of the inventor, whose primary goal is to secure his intellectual property rights, usually by applying for patent protection. In Europe, where patent law is based on the principle of absolute novelty, disclosure of the results reduces novelty and prevents subsequent patenting. Consequently, patenting remains the top priority for pharmaceutical companies in Europe, while disclosure of the results is secondary. The following article looks critically at the idea of using the grace period in European patent law to reconcile the conflicting interests of society and inventors in times of pandemic. In this paper, we investigate whether the implementation of a grace period in European patent law like that known in the USA, Japan, or Korea benefits the disclosure of results and increases the flow of information, ultimately leading to the promotion of innovation and rapid drug discovery.

Understanding their emergency competencies for handling COVID-19, and the potential disadvantages will help governments to develop targeted training policies and improve nurses' capacities in relation to pandemics and emergency preparedness. INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a disastrous infectious disease, but the competencies of nurses in China to handle COVID-19 have not been well documented. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey on nurses from 22 provinces of China in February 2020. The scores of self-report questionnaires were used to analyse their competencies for core emergency care, and linear regression analysis was used to explore influential factors. RESULTS: A total of 2570 nurses participated. The study revealed that nurses had a good grasp of COVID-19 knowledge, but the majority of nurses lacked experience in isolation ward work and emergency training. We found that age, professional title, work department, major work content, total work time, disaster rescue history, emergency training and infectious disease training were associated with core emergency competencies. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese nurses were qualified for handling COVID-19 but still need to strengthen the accumulation of practical experience. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses should actively participate in emergencies to strengthen their operational capacity, whether in training or actual practice.

Did 'better governed countries' with greater public trust and those with superior health care fare better than others? Did countries that have experienced previous outbreaks such as SARS fare better than those who have not? The study provides mixed messages on the effectiveness of lockdowns in controlling COVID-19. While several countries, especially in the East Asia and Pacific region, have used it quite effectively recording low infection rates going into lockdown and staying low after the lockdown, the two spectacular failures are Brazil and India. In contrast to lockdown, the evidence on the effectiveness of stimulus programs in avoiding recession and promoting growth is unequivocal. The effectiveness is much greater in the case of emerging/developing economies than in the advanced economies.

Meanwhile, it can be found that the EC layer electrodes possess larger charge densities than those of TiO2 nanowire electrodes during the electrochemical redox process of these ECDs. However, the intrinsic injection and extraction charge densities of each single electrode are similar, which appears that the intrinsic charge balance of EC layer and TiO2 nanowires electrodes play more important role in the cycling stability of the ECDs. ECD with an optimum thickness of the TiO2 nanowires layer exhibits good electrochromic properties in term of high optical contrast (~45%), fast switching speed (3.23 s) and good cycling stability (which has nearly no decay after 5000 cycles).

Globally, the population of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to expand rapidly, necessitating the need for a more thorough understanding of the array of potential sequelae of COVID-19. The multisystemic aspects of acute COVID-19 have been the subject of intense investigation, but the longCterm complications remain poorly understood. Emerging data from lay press, social media, commentaries, and emerging scientific reports suggest that some COVID-19 survivors experience organ impairment and/or debilitating chronic symptoms, at times protean in nature, which impact their quality of life. METHODS/RESULTS: In this review, by addressing separately each body system, we describe the pleiotropic manifestations reported post COVID-19, their putative pathophysiology and risk factors, and attempt to offer guidance regarding work-up, follow-up and management strategies. Long term sequelae involve all systems with a negative impact on mental health, well-being and quality of life, while a subset of patients, report debilitating chronic fatigue, with or without other fluctuating or persistent symptoms, such as pain or cognitive dysfunction. Although the pathogenesis is unclear, residual damage from acute infection, persistent immune activation, mental factors, or unmasking of underlying co-morbidities are considered as drivers. Comparing long COVID with other post viral chronic syndromes may help to contextualize the complex somatic and emotional sequalae of acute COVID-19. The pace of recovery of different aspects of the syndrome remains unclear as the pandemic began only a year ago. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition of long-term effects and thorough follow-up through dedicated multidisciplinary outpatient clinics with a carefully integrated research agenda are essential for treating COVID-19 survivors holistically.","output":"Epidemiology and organ specific sequelae of post-acute COVID19: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Entry rates into self-employment increase during recessions and decrease during economic upswings. I show that this is mostly explained by the higher unemployment rate during a recession, together with the fact that at all times, unemployed persons have a relatively high propensity to become self-employed out of necessity. I use econometric decomposition techniques to quantify these effects based on the monthly matched US Current Population Survey before, during, and after the Great Recession. I also document that the entry rate into self-employment with unincorporated businesses strongly increased during the recession, but not into self-employment with incorporated businesses. This highlights the association of unincorporated and incorporated self-employment with necessity and opportunity entrepreneurship, respectively. The results are useful for policymakers and practitioners to understand, forecast and act on the different types of self-employment that can be expected over the business cycle. There are also important implications for theories of the cyclicality of unemployment and entrepreneurship. Plain English Summary Self-employment will increase during recessions when unemployment is high, but it may not boost innovation. During recessions, increased unemployment underlies the higher entry rate into self-employment. Our evidence is from representative survey data from the USA covering the Great Recession. The upside is that self-employment enables workers who lose their jobs to continue to work, which can speed up the subsequent economic recovery. Thus, public policy should enable people to start businesses. However, as during recessions the unemployed mostly start unincorporated businesses, one cannot expect them to boost innovation as much as start-ups during better economic times. These insights also speak to the 2020 recession triggered by COVID-19. If unemployment remains high after the relaxation of the lockdowns, a rise can be expected especially in non-innovative self-employment. Thus, the principal policy implication of this study is that policymakers should ensure that their expectations for new businesses started during deep recessions are realistic for the circumstances.

Frailty is being used in clinical decision making for patients with COVID-19, yet the prevalence and effect of frailty in people with COVID-19 is not known. In the COVID-19 in Older PEople (COPE) study we aimed to establish the prevalence of frailty in patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital and investigate its association with mortality and duration of hospital stay. METHODS: This was an observational cohort study conducted at ten hospitals in the UK and one in Italy. All adults (18 years) admitted to participating hospitals with COVID-19 were included. Patients with incomplete hospital records were excluded. The study analysed routinely generated hospital data for patients with COVID-19. Frailty was assessed by specialist COVID-19 teams using the clinical frailty scale (CFS) and patients were grouped according to their score (1C2=fit; 3C4=vulnerable, but not frail; 5C6=initial signs of frailty but with some degree of independence; and 7C9=severe or very severe frailty). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality (time from hospital admission to mortality and day-7 mortality). FINDINGS: Between Feb 27, and April 28, 2020, we enrolled 1564 patients with COVID-19. The median age was 74 years (IQR 61C83); 903 (577%) were men and 661 (423%) were women; 425 (272%) had died at data cutoff (April 28, 2020). 772 (494%) were classed as frail (CFS 5C8) and 27 (17%) were classed as terminally ill (CFS 9). Compared with CFS 1C2, the adjusted hazard ratios for time from hospital admission to death were 155 (95% CI 100C241) for CFS 3C4, 183 (115C291) for CFS 5C6, and 239 (150C381) for CFS 7C9, and adjusted odds ratios for day-7 mortality were 122 (95% CI 063C238) for CFS 3C4, 162 (081C326) for CFS 5C6, and 312 (156C624) for CFS 7C9. INTERPRETATION: In a large population of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, disease outcomes were better predicted by frailty than either age or comorbidity. Our results support the use of CFS to inform decision making about medical care in adult patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

Therefore, we aimed to determine lymphocyte subgroups and activation status of them with flow cytometry at the time of diagnosis in COVID-19 patients and examine the relation of them with disease stage and length of hospital stay. Methods: Fourty patients included in the study were compared with the age and sex matched 40 healthy controls. COVID-19 patients were divided into 2 groups as mild and severe stage disease. Flow cytometry assay was performed to examine the numbers of lymphocyte subsets and activation status of them. Total lymphocyte count was calculated and CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD27, CD38, CD56, CD57, IgD were studied on lymphocyte gate. T helper / T cytotoxic rates and length of hospital stay were recorded. Results: The patients CD3(+)CD4(+) ( T helper) count and CD27 expression on T cells counts were significantly lower, and CD57 expression on CD3(+)CD8(+) T cytotoxic cells were significantly higher (p<0.05) than control gruop.

Several types of procedures with different surgical approaches have been described to correct these defects, but the optimal management is still debated. OBJECTIVE To describe our surgical technique of robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy (RASC) for POP and to assess its safety and long-term outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective review of the medical records of 95 consecutive patients who underwent RASC for POP at our centre from April 2006 to December 2011 was performed. SURGICAL PROCEDURE RASC with use of polypropylene meshes was performed in all cases using a standardised technique with the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in a four-arm configuration. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Clinical data were collected in a dedicated database. Intraoperative variables, postoperative complications, and outcomes of RASC were assessed. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Median operative time was 101 min. No conversion to open surgery was needed. One vaginal and two bladder injuries occurred and were repaired intraoperatively. Only one Clavien grade 3 postoperative complication was observed (bowel obstruction treated laparoscopically). At a median follow-up of 34 mo, persistent POP was observed in four cases (4.2%). One mesh erosion occurred and required robot-assisted removal of the mesh. Ten (10.5%) patients complained de novo urgency after RASC, which resolved in the first few weeks after surgery. No significant de novo bowel or sexual symptoms were reported. CONCLUSIONS Our technique of RASC for correction of POP is safe and effective, with limited risk of complications and good long-term results in the treatment of all types of POP. The robotic surgical system facilitates precise and accurate placement of the meshes with short operative time, thereby favouring wider diffusion of minimally invasive treatment of POP.

This technique was found to be safe and effective, with limited risk of complications and good long-term results.","output":"Robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy for pelvic organ prolapse: surgical technique and outcomes at a single high-volume institution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives This paper aims to share our experience in reorganising our general radiography service during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic from the viewpoint of a large tertiary referral medical centre. Key findings Re-organization of radiographic manpower, patient segregation, and modification of routine radiographic practices are key measures to help radiographic services deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, emphasis on deploying more mobile radiographic units, segregating equipment, developing consistent image acquisition workflows, and strict adherence to infection control protocols are paramount to minimize the possibility of in-hospital transmission and ensure a safe environment for both patients and staff. Streamlining communication channels between leadership and ground staff allows quick dissemination of information to ultimately facilitate safe provision of services. Conclusion COVID-19 has drastically altered the way general radiography teams provide services. The institution of several key measures will allow hospitals to safely and sustainably provide radiographic services. To date, there have been zero incidences of radiographer healthcare worker transmission within our institution during the course of work. Implication for practice Radiographers are facing the challenge of providing high-quality services while simultaneously minimizing pathogen exposure to staff and patients.

The main cause of maternal deaths in Mexico during 2020 was COVID-19 with 191 (21.2%) deaths registered until December 2020. The age group most affected was 30 to 34 years. Women during their third trimester and during puerperium were the most affected. Information regarding pregnant and postpartum women with autoimmune rheumatic diseases remains scarce. Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe a COVID-19 case series from a clinic of pregnancy and rheumatic diseases. Methods: We conducted a descriptive, retrospective study in patients from the clinic of pregnancy and rheumatic diseases of the University Hospital Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez in Monterrey, Mexico. Pregnant patients with RD and documented COVID-19 between March and November 2020 were included. Demographic and clinical features were obtained. Results are shown in descriptive statistics. Results: From the 18 women with autoimmune rheumatic disease in follow-up during this period, 2 (11.1%) pregnant women, 2 (11.1%) postpartum women, and 1(5.5%) post-miscarriage woman developed COVID-19. The mean age was 28  6.3 years, 3 (60%) had systemic lupus erythematosus, 1 (20%) had rheumatoid arthritis, and 1 (20%) had the antiphospholipid syndrome. Clinical features and treatments are shown in Graphic 1 and Table 1. The most frequent symptoms were fever (80%), cough (60%) and anosmia (60%). Four (80%) had mild symptoms, and 1 (20%) had severe symptoms requiring intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation. Three (60%) referred history of contact with a person who had COVID-19. All the patients were using hydroxychloroquine and prednisone. No patient in our study died.

METHOD: Men and women living with HIV (N = 162) aged 20-37 years participating in a longitudinal study of HIV treatment and care completed routine study measures and an assessment of COVID-19-related experiences. RESULTS: At baseline, most participants demonstrated HIV viremia, markers indicative of renal disorders, and biologically confirmed substance use. At follow-up, in the first month of responding to COVID-19, engaging in more social distancing behaviors was related to difficulty accessing food and medications and increased cancelation of health care appointments, both by self and providers. We observed antiretroviral therapy adherence had improved during the initial month of COVID-19 response. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that may pose added risk for COVID-19 severity were prevalent among people living with HIV, and those with greater risk factors did not practice more COVID-19 protective behaviors. Social distancing and other practices intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 interfered with HIV care, and impeded access to food and medications, although an immediate adverse impact on medication adherence was not evident.

However, not much is known about virtual patient-provider interactions or device sharing behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize how participants with or at risk of AF are engaging with their providers in the context of telemedicine and using commercially wearable devices to manage their health. METHODS: We developed a survey to describe participant behaviors around telemedicine encounters and commercial wearable device use. The survey was distributed to participants diagnosed with AF or those at risk of AF (as determined by being at least 65 years old and having a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc stroke risk score of >2) in the University of Massachusetts Memorial Health Care system. RESULTS: The survey was distributed to 23,530 patients, and there were 1222 (5.19%) participant responses. Among the participants, 327 (26.8%) had AF and 895 (73.2%) were at risk of AF. Neither device ownership nor device type use differed by AF status. After adjusting for covariates that may influence surveyed participant communication patterns, we found that participants with AF were more likely to share their wearable device-derived data with providers (adjusted odds ratio 1.87; 95% confidence interval 1.02C3.41). Rates of sharing physical activity or sleep data were low for both groups and did not differ by AF status. CONCLUSION: Compared with participants at risk of developing AF, those with AF were more likely to share heart rate and rhythm data from their commercial wearable devices with providers. However, both groups had similar rates of sharing physical activity and sleep data, telemedicine engagement, and technology use and ownership.","output":"NExUS-Heart: Novel examinations using smart technologies for heart healthData sharing from commercial wearable devices and telehealth engagement in participants with or at risk of atrial fibrillation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has impacted daily life and medical practices around the world.

Decontamination methods listed as promising by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP), wet heat, ultraviolet irradiation (UVI)) and several methods considered for low resource environments (bleach, isopropyl alcohol and detergent/soap) were studied for two commonly used surgical N95 respirators (3M? 1860 and 1870+ Aura?). Although N95 filtration performance depends on the electrostatically charged electret filtration layer, the impact of decontamination on this layer is largely unexplored. As such, respirator performance following decontamination was assessed based on the fit, filtration efficiency, and pressure drop, along with the relationship between (1) surface charge of the electret layer, and (2) elastic properties of the straps. Decontamination with VHP, wet heat, UVI, and bleach did not degrade fit and filtration performance or electret charge. Isopropyl alcohol and soap significantly degraded fit, filtration performance, and electret charge. Pressure drop across the respirators was unchanged. Modest degradation of N95 strap elasticity was observed in mechanical fatigue testing, a model for repeated donnings and doffings. CDC recommended decontamination methods including VHP, wet heat, and UV light did not degrade N95 respirator fit or filtration performance in these tests. Extended use of N95 respirators may degrade strap elasticity, but a loss of face seal integrity should be apparent during user seal checks. NIOSH recommends performing user seal checks after every donning to detect loss of appropriate fit. Decontamination methods which degrade electret charge such as alcohols or detergents should not be used on N95 respirators.

Pre-printed articles were also reviewed at medRxiv.org. DATA ANALYSIS: Corticosteroids were not recommended early in the COVID-19 pandemic outside of the use for concomitant indications (i.e. ARDS, septic shock) as they have been associated with delayed time to viral clearance in other viral pneumonias. A randomized trial showed a mortality benefit with dexamethasone in COVID-19. Guidelines have been updated to include a strong recommendation for their use in COVID-19 in those hospitalized requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation.

METHOD: A patient-centered electronic survey was used, randomly sampling rheumatic patients in Saudi Arabia during March and April 2020. Questions included patients' socio-demographics, diseases, medications, COVID-19 knowledge, source of information, fear level, disease activity perception, health care utilization, medication accessibility, and therapeutic compliance (measured using a modified version of Medication Adherence Reporting Scale). Correlation and regression coefficients were used to evaluate associations among the aforementioned variables. RESULTS: A total of 637 respondents were included. The majority were rheumatoid arthritis patients (42.7%). Patients' knowledge about COVID-19 was correlated with social media use (P = .012). Fear of COVID-19 infection correlated with healthcare facility for follow-up visits (P = .024) and fear of disease deterioration if contracting the infection correlated with patients' levels of knowledge (P = .035). Both types of fear did not correlate with patients' perceptions of disease activity. However, patients' perceptions of worsened disease activity were correlated with unplanned healthcare visits (P < .001), medication non-adherence, and difficulty accessing medication (P = .010 and .006, respectively).

This study analyzes the distribution of the virus-laden droplets expelled by coughing inside a conference room, the effect of ventilation rates, and their positioning. The efficacy of masks is studied to get quantitative information regarding the residence time of the droplets. The effects of evaporation, turbulent dispersion, and external forces have been considered for calculating the droplets' trajectories. We have analyzed six cases, of which two are with masks. Change in the ventilation rate from four air changes per hour (ACH) to eight resulted in a 9 % increment in the number of droplets entrained in the outlet vent, while their average residence time was reduced by  8 s . The shift in the vents' location has significantly altered droplets' distribution inside a conference room. It results in  1.5 % of the injected droplets reaching persons sitting across the table, and a similar indoor environment is not recommended. Wearing a mask in the case of eight ACH has presented the best scenario out of the six cases, with a 6.5 % improvement in the number of droplets entrained in the outlet vent and a 9 s decrease in their average residence time compared to the case without a mask.

Volumetric DDoS attacks are the most common form of DDoS attack and are carried out by an army of infected IoT devices or by reflector servers, which increase attacks at massive scales. In this work, we propose a voting-based multimode framework to combat volumetric DDoS (VMFCVD) attacks. VMFCVD is based on a triad of fast detection mode (FDM), defensive fast detection mode (DFDM), and high accuracy mode (HAM) methods. FDM is designed to classify network traffic when the server is under attack. The highly dimensionally reduced dataset helps FDM accelerate detection speed. During our experiment, the dimension reduction for FDM was more than 97% while maintaining an accuracy of 99.9% in most cases. DFDM is an extended version of FDM that enhances malicious network traffic detection accuracy by tightening the detection technique. HAM focuses on detection accuracy, showing substantial improvement over FDM and DFDM. HAM activates when the server is stable. VMFCVD is extensively experimented on the latest benchmark DDoS and botnet datasets, namely the CICIDS2017 (BoT & DDoS), CSE-CIC-IDS2018 (BoT & DDoS), CICDDoS2019 (DNS, LDAP, SSDP & SYN), DoHBrw2020, NBaIoT2018 (Mirai), UNSW2018 BoTIoT, and UNSW NB15 datasets.

We also analyzed data from an electronic survey administered by the CA STD Control Branch to local health jurisdictions (LHJs) in April, June, and September of 2020 assessing the impact of COVID-19 on STD programs. RESULTS There were sharp declines in cases of all reportable bacterial STDs occurring in conjunction with the March 19, 2020 CA stay-at-home order, most of which did not return to baseline by July. Comparing January-June 2020 to January-June of 2019, there were decreases in reported cases of CT (31%), late latent syphilis (19%), primary/secondary syphilis (15%), early non-primary non-secondary syphilis (14%), and GC (13%).

Deep learning methods are promising in automatically detecting COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images. Most of these works first train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an existing large-scale chest x-ray image dataset and then fine-tune the model on the newly collected COVID-19 chest x-ray dataset, often at a much smaller scale. However, simple fine-tuning may lead to poor performance due to two issues, firstly the large domain shift present in chest x-ray datasets and secondly the relatively small scale of the COVID-19 chest x-ray dataset. In an attempt to address these issues, we formulate the problem of COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification in a semi-supervised open set domain adaptation setting and propose a novel domain adaptation method, Semi-supervised Open set Domain Adversarial network (SODA). SODA is designed to align the data distributions across different domains in the general domain space and also in the common subspace of source and target data. In our experiments, SODA achieves a leading classification performance compared with recent state-of-the-art models in separating COVID-19 with common pneumonia.

In some patients, patterns of multiorgan failure have been observed similarly to patients with bacterial sepsis. This review aimed to analyze the currently available data on the treatment of COVID-19, specifically the most studied antiviral agents and therapies targeting the immune system including those that have been investigated in sepsis. RECENT FINDINGS In the last months, several trials have been conducted worldwide to try to identify optimal antiviral treatments against COVID-19. Antiviral agents such as lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine have been investigated as well as specific and non-specific immunomodulators in order to determine their potential efficacy against SARS-Cov2. SUMMARY To date, the vast majority of the studied antiviral and immunomodulatory agents have failed to improve outcomes of patients with COVID-19 except for dexamethasone. Many other trials are currently underway with new antiviral agents and various immunomodulatory agents with potential clinical benefit for COVID-19 patients.

Traditional video- and presentation-based road safety training has average output results as it lacks physical practice and the involvement of children during training, without any practical testing examination to check the learned abilities of a child before their exposure to real-world environments. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a 3D realistic open-ended VR and Kinect sensor-based training setup using the Unity game engine, wherein children are educated and involved in road safety exercises. The proposed system applies the concepts of VR in a game-like setting to let the children learn about traffic rules and practice them in their homes without any risk of being exposed to the outside environment. Thus, with our interactive and immersive training environment, we aim to minimize road accidents involving children and contribute to the generic domain of healthcare. Furthermore, the proposed framework evaluates the overall performance of the students in a virtual environment (VE) to develop their road-awareness skills. To ensure safety, the proposed system has an extra examination layer for childrens abilities evaluation, whereby a child is considered fit for real-world practice in cases where they fulfil certain criteria by achieving set scores.

According to virus spreading, countries under study in this paper are categorized into three main categories. First category in which Coronavirus first wave takes about two year seasons (about 180 days) to make a complete virus cycle. Second category is countries with higher transmission rates with one year season (about 90 days) to make the first complete virus cycle. These countries take offline periods with low spreading rates. The third category is countries with the highest transmission rates and make complete virus cycles without offline periods. All categories are modelled with different mathematical fitting models.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) AND RESULTS: The average efficiency score for Pakistan's DHQHs is 0.52, and not a single hospital is fully efficient. Moreover, the relationship between technical efficiency and patients' satisfaction is found to be negative and statistically significant indicating that an increase in hospital efficiency tends to decrease patients' satisfaction. The disaggregated analysis reveals that patients' satisfaction associated with the healthcare provider attitude and communication is more affected by technical efficiency. CONCLUSION: Patients' satisfaction level is more sensitive to physician's attitude and communication.

Molecular docking analysis showed that these complexes bind to c-myc G-quadruplex DNA through either groove binding or - stacking, and the relative difluorinated site in the main ligand plays a role in regulating the binding mode. The binding behavior of these complexes with c-myc G-quadruplex DNA was evaluated using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence intercalator displacement assay, fluorescence resonance energy transfer melting assay, and polymerase chain reaction. The comprehensive analysis indicated that complex 1 exhibited a better affinity and stability in relation to c-myc G-quadruplex DNA with a DC50 of 6.6 M and Tm values of 13.09 C, than other molecules. Further activity evaluation results displayed that this class of complexes can also inhibit the growth of various tumor cells, especially complexes 3 and 6, which exhibited a better inhibitory effect against human U87 glioblastoma cells (51.61 and 23.75 M) than other complexes, even superior to cisplatin (32.59 M). Owing to a befitting lipophilicity associated with the high intake of drugs by tumor cells, complexes 3 and 6 had favorable lipid-water partition coefficients of -0.6615 and -0.8077, respectively. Moreover, it was found that complex 6 suppressed the proliferation of U87 cells mainly through an induced obvious S phase arrest and slight apoptosis, which may have resulted from the stabilization of c-myc G-quadruplex DNA to block the transcription and expression of c-myc. In brief, these types of arene Ru(II) complexes with difluorinated ligands can be developed as potential inducers of S-phase arrest and apoptosis through the binding and stabilization of c-myc G-quadruplex DNA, and could be used in clinical applications in the future.","output":"Arene Ru(II) Complexes with Difluorinated Ligands Act as Potential Inducers of S-Phase Arrest via the Stabilization of c-myc G-Quadruplex DNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of novel technologies for the discovery of human monoclonal antibodies has proven invaluable in the fight against infectious diseases.

OBJECTIVE: This review aims to shed light on SM use worldwide and to discuss how it has been used as an essential tool in the health care industry from the perspective of HCPs. METHODS: A literature review was conducted between March and April 2020 using MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for all English-language medical studies that were published since 2007 and discussed SM use in any form for health care. Studies that were not in English, whose full text was not accessible, or that investigated patients' perspectives were excluded from this part, as were reviews pertaining to ethical and legal considerations in SM use. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 83 studies. More studies were included from article references, and a total of 158 studies were reviewed.

Current treatments are insufficiently efficacious and associated with side effects. Myotonia can be triggered by voluntary movement (electrically-induced myotonia) or percussion (mechanically-induced myotonia). Whether distinct molecular mechanisms underlie these triggers is unknown. Our goal was to identify ion channels involved in mechanically-induced myotonia and to evaluate block of the channels involved as a novel approach to therapy. METHODS: We developed a novel system to enable study of mechanically-induced myotonia using both genetic and pharmacologic mouse models of myotonia congenita. We extended ex vivo studies of excitability to in vivo studies of muscle stiffness. RESULTS: As previous work suggests activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels by mechanical stimuli in muscle, we examined the role of this cation channel. Mechanically-induced myotonia was markedly suppressed in TRPV4-null muscles and in muscles treated with TRPV4 small molecule antagonists. The suppression of mechanically-induced myotonia occurred without altering intrinsic muscle excitability such that myotonia triggered by firing of action potentials (electrically-induced myotonia) was unaffected. When injected intraperitoneally, TRPV4 antagonists lessened the severity of myotonia in vivo by approximately 80%. INTERPRETATION: These data demonstrate for the first time that there are distinct molecular mechanisms triggering electrically- and mechanically-induced myotonia. Our data indicates that activation of TRPV4 during muscle contraction plays an important role in triggering myotonia in vivo.

Eight publications were selected for this review. The primary endpoint was the incidence of VAP. Different oral care methods for preventing VAP were the subject of this review. Two studies that were reviewed in this article showed significant statistical difference between the intervention group and the control group regarding different oral care for lowering the incidence of VAP. The rest of the studies showed no significant statistical difference between the intervention group and the control group, but showed the importance of meticulous oral hygiene in those patients. Mechanically ventilated patients who suffer from poor oral hygiene are exposed to the harmful accumulation of oral plaque and the initiation of VAP. Proper oral care by qualified care givers can reduce the incidence of VAP. Proper oral care needs to be considered part of the medical treatment plan when a patient is admitted to the ICU to lower the incidence rates of VAP. Oral care treatment of ventilated patients in the intensive care units, for prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia, is with high clinical relevance, decreasing morbidity and mortality in the ICU. We recommend that ICU medical teams will plan a protocol of oral care treatment, based on our article results, and implement it as part of the daily routine.","output":"Preventing Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia in Intensive Care Unit by improved Oral Care: a Review of Randomized Control Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A descriptive, cross-sectional study, was conducted in the Department of Internal Medicine and Ophthalmology, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan, from May to November 2018.

Current occupational health (OH) management of WRSAD is based on clinical and managerial guidelines and individual risk assessment. AIMS: The study sought to identify patterns of OH advice in WRSAD and the relationships between the OH advice, available evidence, experience and expertise of the OH doctors (OHDs). METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 101 first-time OH consultations for WRSAD by nine OHDs. RESULTS: The three most common OH interventions included follow-up OH consultations, adjusted duties and referrals for counselling. All OHDs preferred a light-touch approach but the less experienced and qualified OHDs were more proactive and prescriptive. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of a specific occupational medical guideline for the management of WRSAD, the OH interventions may be guided by clinical guidelines, individual risk assessment, the client's circumstances or the experience, expertise and preferences of the OHDs. In the study group, OH interventions were under-utilized and not consistently applied. Our findings support the argument for OH guideline for WRSAD to improve the consistency and effectiveness of OH interventions.

Here, we evaluated the role of climate (temperature and precipitation), region-specific susceptibility (BCG vaccination, malaria infection, and elderly population) and international traveller population (human mobility) in shaping the geographical patterns of COVID-19 cases across 1,055 countries/regions, and examined the sequential shift of multiple drivers of the accumulated cases from December, 2019 to April 12, 2020. The accumulated numbers of COVID-19 cases (per 1 million population) were well explained by a simple regression model. The explanatory power (R2) of the model increased up to > 70% in April 2020 as the COVID-19 spread progressed. Climate, host mobility, and host susceptibility largely explained the variance of the COVID-19 cases (per 1 million population), and their explanatory power improved as the pandemic progressed; the relative importance of host mobility and host susceptibility have been greater than that of climate. The number of days from outbreak onset showed greater explanatory power in the earlier stages of COVID-19 spread but rapidly lost its influence. Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic is deterministically driven by climate suitability, cross-border human mobility, and region-specific susceptibility. The present distribution of COVID-19 cases has not reached an equilibrium and is changing daily, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. Nevertheless, the present results, based on mapping the spread of COVID-19 and identifying multiple drivers of this outbreak trajectory, may contribute to a better understanding of the COVID-19 disease transmission risk and the measures against long-term epidemic.","output":"Multiple drivers of the COVID-19 spread: role of climate, international mobility, and region-specific conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury is an important complication following thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Recently, Transcutaneous laryngeal ultrasound (TLUSG) has emerged as a non-invasive alternative to laryngoscopic examination for vocal cord (VC) assessment. The aim of the systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine its diagnostic accuracy in reference to laryngoscopy. It was conducted in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane library and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant articles. Sixteen studies were included in the review. Pooled diagnostic accuracy was calculated based on weighted arithmetic mean and plotting forest plot. The pooled visualization rate was 86.28% and 94.13% preoperatively and postoperatively, respectively. The respective pooled sensitivity and specificity was 78.48% and 98.28%, and 83.96% (CI 95%: 77.24C88.50%) and 96.15% (CI 95%: 95.24C96.88%). The diagnostic accuracy improved if transverse and lateral approaches, and valsalva maneuver were utilized. Male gender and older age were the most crucial risk factors for VC non-visualization. TLUSG is an efficacious screening tool for vocal cord palsy due to its high sensitivity.

METHODS A Google form survey was distributed to students through the heads of the department of P&O program across Japan. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. RESULTS One hundred sixty-six students (107 males and 59 females) responded to the survey. The respondents' grades were as follows: freshman, 22.3% (n = 37); sophomore, 33.7% (n = 56); junior, 27.1% (n = 45); and senior, 16.9% (n = 28). Forty-seven percent (n = 78) reported that their clinical placements have been cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 15.1% (n = 25) have performed their clinical placements during the pandemic. Regarding career preparation, 16.3% (n = 27) had face-to-face interviews and 10.2% (n = 17) have reported being interviewed online.

The survey collected demographic and anthropometric data, information about the sport practice, the training sessions, the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain gymnastics-related, and lifestyle habits. Musculoskeletal pain had a high prevalence, involving 65 of 79 athletes (82.3%). A significant correlation was found between musculoskeletal pain and the duration of sports practice, both for general pain (p = 0.041) and for specific districts: right wrist pain (p = 0.031), left wrist pain (p = 0.028), right shoulder (p = 0.039), left hip (p = 0.031), right thigh (p = 0.031), and left knee (p = 0.005). Another statistical association was found between right wrist pain and BMI (p = 0.001), and hip pain and BMI (p = 0.030).

This study focused on the mask use of airline passengers when they fly during COVID-19, using the theory of planned behavior (TPB) model to examine the relationship between nine predicting factors and the mask-wearing intention in the aircraft cabin. A survey instrument was developed to collect data from 1124 air travelers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and the data was statistically analyzed using structural equation modeling and logistic regression. Results showed that attitude, descriptive norms, risk avoidance, and information seeking significantly influenced the travelers' intention to wear a mask during flight in COVID-19. Group analysis further indicated that the four factors influenced mask-wearing intentions differently on young, middle-aged, and senior travelers. It was also found that demographic and travel characteristics including age, education, income, and travel frequency can be used to predict if the airline passenger was willing to pay a large amount to switch to airlines that adopted different mask policies during COVID-19.

In addition, we define action or intervention as massive testing and quarantine, stay-at-home orders, or lockdowns.An analysis of top 36 countries and 50 states of the US affected by the epidemic as of end-March yield the following results. Any moderation or slowdown has so far been due only to aggressive intervention. Countries take an average of about three weeks to act. However, even aggressive intervention does not show immediate results. Countries take an average of about three weeks to moderate, four weeks to control, and over 6 weeks to contain the spread of the disease, after aggressive intervention. Substantial differences exist between large and small and Asian and European countries in time to act. Using these findings, we predict the likely dates of moderation and control for specific countries and States of the US.In the absence of a vaccine, cure, or massive testing and quarantine, lockdowns and stay-at-home orders will need to last for months. However, the US faces a unique challenge because only half the states have adopted aggressive intervention, and done so at varying times.

Methods: The study population included a random list of 3000 individuals with T2D derived from 30,748 individuals who had visited a large tertiary diabetes center during the past year. The survey was carried out through a telephonic interview. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on changes in lifestyle, access and challenges to diabetes care and use of technologies such as telemedicine facilities and use of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), etc. Results: Of the 2510 individuals successfully interviewed (83.7% response rate), 382 (15.2%) reported having attempted to consult their health care providers during the lockdown, of whom only 30.6% utilized the telemedicine facility. However, 96 (82%) of those who utilized the telemedicine facility (n = 117) were happy with their experience and 68 (58.1%) were willing to continue to use the facility in the future. Only 11.4% of participants utilized online support for management of diabetes. Use of SMBG increased significantly from 15.5% to 51.3% during the lockdown.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the link between autophagy and extracellular cytokines remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that IL-6 activates autophagy through the IL-6/JAK2/BECN1 pathway and promotes chemotherapy resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC). Mechanistically, IL-6 triggers the interaction between JAK2 and BECN1, where JAK2 phosphorylates BECN1 at Y333. We demonstrate that BECN1 Y333 phosphorylation is crucial for BECN1 activation and IL-6-induced autophagy by regulating PI3KC3 complex formation. Furthermore, we investigate BECN1 Y333 phosphorylation as a predictive marker for poor CRC prognosis and chemotherapy resistance. Combination treatment with autophagy inhibitors or pharmacological agents targeting the IL-6/JAK2/BECN1 signaling pathway may represent a potential strategy for CRC cancer therapy.","output":"IL-6 regulates autophagy and chemotherapy resistance by promoting BECN1 phosphorylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the foregoing study was to assess whether physical activity during pregnancy affects the occurrence of anxiety and depression during pregnancy, postpartum and 6 months following childbirth. This study tried to answer the following questions: How was the incidence of depression and anxiety different in the pre- and postpartum periods? What intensity level of physical activity protects against the symptoms of anxiety and depression? Does the time spent engaged in sedentary activities and MVPA affect the occurrence of depression and anxiety before and after childbirth? The study group under analysis consisted of 187 women aged 19C41 years. The research was conducted between April 2016 and November 2020. The study was divided into four stages: T0qualification to participate in the study; T1medical history acquisition, consisting of a short questionnaire and two long questionnaires (the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)), as well as an assessment of 7-day physical activity using Actigraph accelerometers during the pregnancy; T2the completion of the EPDS and GAD-7 questionnaires after the birth; T3the completion of the EPDS and GAD-7 questionnaire 6 months after giving birth. The obtained results were statistically processed in the Statistica 13.3 software package. A significance level of p < 0.05 was assumed. The highest percentage of depression occurred immediately after the delivery, followed by 6 months after delivery, and the smallest number of women suffered from depression before the birth (p < 0.001). The analysis of correlations of physical activity with anxiety symptoms did not show significant correlations. However, the situation is different in the case of depression symptoms. Women taking fewer steps before delivery showed a greater tendency to develop depressive symptoms before, immediately after and 6 months after the delivery (p < 0.001). Women who were less active (took fewer steps per day, spent less time in moderate-to-vigorous physical (MVPA) activities or spent more time being sedentary) showed symptoms of depression on the EPDS scale. It appeared that those with severe anxiety symptoms had the highest sedentary time scores before the delivery (p = 0.020). Reduced physical activity promotes the onset of postnatal depression, while being active reduces this risk. Interestingly, even light physical activity protects against the occurrence of depression and is better than sedentary activities. Such clear conclusions cannot be drawn in relation to anxiety symptoms. Sedentary behaviour may promote anxiety symptoms immediately after childbirth, but this study should be continued in order to confirm it during other time periods.","output":"Does Prenatal Physical Activity Affect the Occurrence of Postnatal Anxiety and Depression?

The impact of COVID-19 for gastrointestinal emergencies is addressed together with the implications for the conduct of endoscopic and other interventional and diagnostic procedures. The importance of fully understanding the pharmacology and therapeutic implications of drugs commonly used by the gastroenterologist and their relationship with COVID-19 are also highlighted. The risk for drug-drug interactions is considerable in patients seriously ill with COVID-19 who are often requiring mechanical ventilation and life-support. Some re-purposed drugs used against SARS-CoV-2 can cause or aggravate some of the COVID-19 GI symptoms and also can induce iatrogenic liver injury.

The health belief model (HBM) in conjunction with the international prenatal physical activity questionnaire was used. The HBL in pregnant parous women (PPW) (3.42) was significantly higher than that in nonpregnant nulliparous women (NNW) (3.06). The PPA level in pregnant nulliparous women (PNW) (5.67 metabolic equivalent-hours per week (MET-h/week)) was lower than in the PPW (6.01 MET-h/week).

Previously, we developed a liver-regeneration therapy using autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which is under clinical investigation. Cell-cell interactions between BMSCs and macrophages (M&#966;s) participate in the improvement of liver function and alleviation of liver fibrosis, although the associated mechanisms have not been elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we investigated phenotypic changes in M&#966;s caused by interactions with BMSCs, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Co-culturing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine bone marrow-derived M&#966;s (BMDMs) with BMSCs substantially upregulated matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), MMP12, and MMP13 expression, and downregulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF&#945;) expression. To identify humoral factors involved in phenotypic changes occurring in M&#966;s, microarray analysis was performed with microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from extracellular vesicles in the supernatant of co-cultured BMSCs and LPS-stimulated BMDMs. We found that miR-6769b-5p was highly expressed and that transfecting miR-6769b-5p mimic upregulated MMP9 in LPS-stimulated BMDMs and downregulated TNF&#945; and interleukin-1beta (IL-1?). MiR-6769b-5p expression in BMDMs was decreased by LPS stimulation but was increased by co-culture with BMSCs. Microarray and pathway analyses of gene expression in LPS-stimulated, miR-6769b-5p-transfected BMDMs revealed changes in the eukaryotic initiation factor 2-signaling pathway and decreased the expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). LPS-stimulated BMDMs exhibited increased MMP9 expression and decreased the expression of TNF&#945; and IL-1? by ATF4 knockdown. These findings indicate that upregulating miR-6769b-5p in BMDMs induced a fibrolytic phenotype, where MMP9 was highly expressed and inflammatory cytokine expression was decreased by the suppression of ATF4 expression.

However, the worldwide experience with COVID-19 patients undergoing lung transplant (LTx) with pre-LTx VV ECMO support is limited. Therefore, we sought to report our institution's early experience with COVID-19 patients who underwent LTx after VV ECMO. Methods We retrospectively identified 5 COVID-19 patients who underwent LTx after VV ECMO support. Patients were required to have a negative nasopharyngeal swab and a negative bronchoalveolar lavage for COVID-19 prior to LTx listing. We analyzed preoperative and operative characteristics, details of VV ECMO support and early post-transplant outcomes. Results The mean age of our cohort was 50 years (range 39-57 years) and all patients were male. Mean recipient BMI was 30 (range 22-37). Mean duration of VV ECMO pre-Ltx was 60 days (range 44-72 days). At the time of the LTx operation, 60% (3/5) of patients were on VV ECMO, 20% (1/5) were on mechanical ventilation (MV), and 20% (1/5) were on supplemental oxygen only. Preoperatively, 80% (4/5) had acute kidney injury and 20% (2/5) were on dialysis. LTx was performed via clamshell approach with intraoperative venoaterial ECMO support in all cases. For 60% (3/5) patients, VV ECMO support was continued after LTx and discontinued on postoperative days 0, 1 and 6, respectively. All-cause mortality was 40% (2/5), related to sepsis and multi-organ failure, and both deaths occurred an average of 115 days post-LTx. Mean length of stay for surviving patients was 59 days (range 22-117). In the first 3 months postop-LTx, grade A2 acute cellular rejection was noted in 2 patients, A1 in 2 patients, and antibody-mediated rejection in 1 patient. Conclusion Our early experience with LTx for COVID-19 patients supported with VV ECMO support is notable for 1) prolonged VV-ECMO duration and significant morbidity pre-LTx, and 2) early mortalities related to sepsis and multiple organ failure. These data highlight a uniquely complex patient population that carries high risk of multi-organ failure and other comorbidities dictating careful selection for transplant.","output":"Lung Transplant for Patients with COVID-19 Bridged with VV ECMO: Initial Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In April 2020, as cases of the novel COVID-19 spread across the globe, MTV Staying Alive Foundation created the educational entertainment miniseries MTV Shuga: Alone Together. In 70 short episodes released daily on YouTube, Alone Together aimed to disseminate timely and accurate information to increase young peoples knowledge, motivation, and actions to prevent COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify Alone Together viewers perspectives on the global COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdowns by examining the words, conversations, experiences, and emotions expressed on social media in response to the Alone Together episodes. We also assessed how viewers used the series and its online community as a source of support during the global pandemic. METHODS: A total of 3982 comments and 70 live chat conversations were extracted from YouTube between April and October 2020 and analyzed through a data-led inductive thematic approach. Aggregated demographic and geographical data were collected using YouTube Analytics. RESULTS: The miniseries had a global reach across 5 continents, with a total of 7.7 million views across MTV Shuga platforms. The series had over 1 million views over 70 episodes on YouTube and an average of 5683 unique viewers per episode on YouTube. The dominant audience was adults under the age of 35 years and women. Across diverse countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, the United States, and the UK, viewers believed that COVID-19 was serious and expressed that it was socially responsible to follow public health measures. Storylines of the series about the impact of self-isolation on mental health, exposure to violence in lockdowns, and restricted employment opportunities due to the pandemic resonated with young viewers. Tuning in to the miniseries provided viewers with reliable information, entertainment, and an online community during an isolating, confusing, and worrying time. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of COVID-19, viewers from at least 53 countries connected on social media via the MTV miniseries. The analysis showed how digitally connected people under the age of 35 years, predominantly women, felt compelled to follow COVID-19 safety measures despite the pandemics impact on their social, educational, and financial needs. Viewers used social media to reach out to fellow viewers for advice, solace, support, and resources. Organizations, governments, and individuals have been forced to innovate during the pandemic to ensure people can access services safely and remotely. This analysis showed that women under 35 years of age were especially receptive to receiving support from online communities and media services. Peer influence and support online can be a powerful public health tool as people have a great capacity to influence each other and shape norms around public health. However, online services are not accessible to everyone, and COVID-19 has increased disparities between digitally connected and unconnected younger adults.","output":"Young Adults Responses to an African and US-Based COVID-19 Edutainment Miniseries: Real-Time Qualitative Analysis of Online Social Media Engagement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three months into the COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the world is still in search of an effective therapeutic drug Exp","output":"Running ahead of Pandemics: Achieving In-Advance Antiviral Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a low-cost, noninvasive and radiation free medical imaging modality for monitoring ventilation distribution in the lung.

One source of this difficulty is the frequent use of simple shapes which do not correspond to the anatomy to reconstruct EIT images. The mismatch between the true body shape and the one used for reconstruction is known to introduce errors, which to date have not been properly characterized. In the present study we, therefore, seek to 1) characterize and quantify the errors resulting from a reconstruction shape mismatch for a number of popular EIT reconstruction algorithms and 2) develop recommendations on the tolerated amount of mismatch for each algorithm. Using real and simulated data, we analyze the performance of four EIT reconstruction algorithms under different degrees of shape mismatch.

Wildlife disease risk experts recommended halting great ape translocations during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimize risk of disease transmission to wild populations. We collected data on orangutan releases and associated disease risk management in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic, and developed a problem description for orangutan disease and conservation risks. We identified that at least 15 rehabilitated ex-captive and 27 wild captured orangutans were released during the study period. Identified disease risks included several wild-to-wild translocated orangutans in direct contact or proximity to humans without protective equipment, and formerly captive rehabilitated orangutans that have had long periods of contact and potential exposure to human diseases. While translocation practitioners typically employ mitigation measures to decrease disease transmission likelihood, these measures cannot eliminate all risk, and are not consistently applied. COVID-19 and other diseases of human origin can be transmitted to orangutans, which could have catastrophic impacts on wild orangutans, other susceptible fauna, and humans should disease transmission occur. We recommend stakeholders conduct a Disease Risk Analysis for orangutan translocation, and improve pathogen surveillance and mitigation measures to decrease the likelihood of potential outbreaks.

This study is aimed to explore the 1-year temporal change in prevalence, variety and potential risk factors of long COVID symptoms. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, electronic databases, including the Cochrane Library, PubMed, the EMBASE, and the WOS were searched for related studies published from January 2020 to December 2021. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD 42022300274. Findings: 137 studies were included, covering 134,093 subjects. The prevalence of long COVID symptoms was as high as 50% since 1-month after acute phase and did not show a downward trend during 1-year temporal change. Six months or more after the acute phase, the odds ratio (OR) of population characteristic factors increased, such as female gender (from <6 months OR=1.62 to  6 months OR=1.82), while the OR value of acute phase-related factors (severe/critical and hospitalization) partially decreased. As for specific symptoms, only about one-third of symptoms were significantly reduced trends. However, neuropsychiatric-symptoms shows a stable trend, and sleep disorders and impaired concentration even showed an increased trend. Neuropsychiatric related symptoms showed a higher long-term prevalence (approximately 25%) and longer persistence trend than physical symptoms. Interpretation: During 1-year follow-up, recovered patients with COVID-19 exhibit persistent long-term, multisystem symptoms, and the neuropsychiatric related symptoms were the most extensive and persistent. Varied etiologies and influencing factors may impact in long COVID, and confounding effects increased over time. This is valuable for tailoring rehabilitation programs to the needs of COVID-19 patients and for informing future health care planning and resource allocation.","output":"One-Year Temporal Change in Prevalence and Characteristic of Long COVID: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM A complete and non-splice porcine small-intestine submucosa (SIS) patch was used for total pelvic anatomical repair of organ prolapse. METHODS This study included a total of 17 patients with severe total pelvic organ prolapse, including five patients with combined stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Panhysterectomy was performed, and then a porcine SIS patch was placed on the anterior (posterior) vaginal wall. The top of the vaginal wall was moved to the corresponding side of the vaginal wall, and the patch was sutured to bilateral uterosacral ligaments, the sacrospinous ligament, and arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis. SUI was addressed at the same time. 'Failure' was defined as anterior or posterior wall prolapse beyond the hymen. RESULTS The mean follow-up duration was 11.6  7.45 months (2-24 months). No symptom recurrence was observed in the five patients with combined SUI. One patient who underwent porcine SIS patch placement on the posterior wall experienced stage II anterior vaginal wall prolapse after surgery. The vaginal wall and fornix of the remaining patients with patches were restored to stable anatomical positions (92.85%). No organ damage, infection, erosion, or rejection was observed, and no blood transfusion was necessary. CONCLUSION This study is the first to implement total pelvic anatomical repair using a complete and non-splice SIS. Our results suggest that this new surgical method is safe and can achieve satisfactory therapeutic effects, especially for patients with combined SUI.","output":"Treatment of total pelvic organ prolapse using a whole biological patch: A pilot study of 17 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The clinicopathological description of dermatological manifestations of COVID-19 leaves much to be desired. There is a need to determine their association with disease severity, outcome, and other clinical variables. Objectives The objectives of this study are to record and histopathologically examine the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 and correlate these to age, disease severity, and mortality. Methods All confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a single tertiary healthcare hospital in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, were included. Their diseases were classified as mild, moderate, severe, and critical. The recent onset skin eruptions in these patients were recorded via photographs along with relevant clinical data. The photographs were independently reviewed by a group of three dermatologists without knowledge of the clinical information. The skin manifestations were divided into disease-specific and nonspecific categories using an already defined algorithm. Histopathological examination of skin manifestations was conducted. Results A total of 23% (n=47) had new skin manifestations. Specific skin findings were seen in 21.6% (n=44), which consisted of ecchymosis/purpura in 50% (n=22), maculopapular exanthem in 18% (n=8), livedo reticularis in 16.2% (n=7), ischemia/gangrene in 16.2% (n=7), perniosis in 15.9 % (n=7), vesiculo-bullous rash in 9% (n=4) and urticaria in 4% (n=1). Non-specific findings were seen in 6% (n=13) and included bedsores, dermatitis passivata, dryness, herpes labialis, oral ulcerations, and nasogastric tube-induced ulcerations. There was a significant association (p=0.03) between disease severity and specific skin lesions. Ischemia/gangrene was significantly associated with COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. Vesiculobullous lesions were associated with higher mortality, though not with disease severity. Livedo reticularis had a higher-than-expected count in critical disease, albeit statistically insignificant. The association of maculopapular exanthem and ecchymosis/purpura with severe/critical disease was statistically insignificant. Urticaria was significantly associated with low disease severity. Mean age with specific manifestations was 56.86  15.81 and with nonspecific/without any manifestations was 42.58  16.96, a highly significant difference, with p-value < 0.001. Old age (>60 years) was significantly associated with ecchymosis (p=0.038), maculopapular exanthem (p=0.021), and vesiculo-bullous rash (p=0.029). Histopathology varied according to the type of skin lesion. Conclusions Dermatological manifestations coexist in many patients and tend to appear more in severe cases of COVID-19 among the older age group and only minimally in mild/moderate cases. Their presence could help set prognostic criteria of COVID-19 disease in the future.","output":"Dermatological Manifestations of COVID-19 in Patients Reporting to a Tertiary Care Hospital in Rawalpindi, Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Asian and Latinx individuals have a high burden of untreated depression. Under-recognition of depressive symptoms may contribute to existing disparities in depression treatment. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether physicians recognize and treat depressive symptoms for Chinese and Latinx patients during routine primary care visits. Methods: We analyzed data from 1171 Chinese and Latinx patients who were interviewed within 1 week after a primary care visit in a large academic practice, which had not yet implemented universal depression screening. We included participants with depressive symptoms (defined as a Patient Health Questionaire-2 score 3) and no prior history of depression (N=118). We investigated whether patients perceived having a mental health need in the prior year and conducted chart reviews to assess provider recognition of depressive symptoms, defined as documentation of symptoms, antidepressant initiation, or mental health referral within 30 days of the visit. We further examined differences by race/ethnicity and language preference. Results: Among the 118 patients with depressive symptoms and no prior depression diagnosis (mean age 68), 71 (61%) reported a mental health need in the prior 12 months; however, providers recognized depressive symptoms in only 8/118 patients (7%). The number of patients with recognized symptoms was small across race/ethnicity and language preference groups and we found no significant differences. Conclusion: Physicians recognized and documented depressive symptoms for 1 in 10 Chinese and Latinx patients during routine primary care visits.

The combination of natural ventilation and window can also facilitate the removal or dilution of gaseous pollutants from indoor sources in newly decorated buildings. However, the windows on the same facade may cause gaseous pollutant cross-transmission during single-sided natural ventilation between households on different floors close to the source. Although some research has focused on the pollutant cross-transmission in buildings, the simplification of windows into rectangular openings often affects accurate knowledge of pollutant transmission characteristics. Therefore, this investigation explored gaseous pollutant cross-transmission through real windows during single-sided, buoyancy-driven ventilation in a multistory building. Six types of windows were modeled for the indoor pollutant of gaseous formaldehyde (HCHO). Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was utilized to solve characteristics of pollutant transmission inside and outside the multistory building. The results indicated that the ventilation rates, thermal profiles and pollutant transmission inside and outside the building varied for each window type, although the open window areas were identical. The re-entry ratio of exhausted air entering upper floors and the infection risk of epidemic viruses caused by airborne cross-transmission was sensitive to ventilation rates and window configurations, while the sensitivities for window configurations varied case by case. The comparisons also revealed that the specification of ambient temperature and pollutant release rate ultimately did not affect the evaluation of pollutant cross-transmission using CFD.","output":"Gaseous pollutant transmission through windows between vertical floors in a multistory building with natural ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using the daily data covering both the first and second wave of COVID-19 pandemic over the period from March 3, 2020, to February 12, 2021, this study documents a strong positive comovement between implied volatility indices and two proxies of the COVID-19 fear.

One of the reasons might be that the way psycho-oncological care is organized, does not fit patients preferences. This study aimed to obtain detailed insight into cancer patients preferences regarding the organization of psycho-oncological care. METHODS: 18 semi-structured interviews were conducted among cancer patients. Patients completed psycho-oncological treatment between 2015 and 2020 at the psychology department in a general hospital or a center specialized in psychological cancer care in the Netherlands. The interview comprised questions related to preferences regarding the institute where to receive treatment, the psychologist who provides treatment, and the type of treatment, as well as questions related to experienced barriers and facilitators to receive psycho-oncological care. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed individually by two coders into key issues and themes. RESULTS: Regarding the institute, easy accessibility and prompt availability of psychol-oncological care were considered important. Regarding the psychologist, most participants had a strong preference to be treated by a psychologist specialized in cancer or other somatic diseases. Individual face-to-face therapy was preferred above other types of treatment. Several barriers were mentioned to receive psycho-oncological treatment, among which poor accessibility to psycho-oncological care, lack of knowledge on the possibilities for psycho-oncological treatment, and stigma. Most frequently mentioned facilitators were being assertive to ask for help, having a good relationship with the healthcare professional, and the integration of psycho-oncological support within medical cancer care. CONCLUSION: From the patients perspective, the organization of psycho-oncological care for cancer patients should focus on easy accessibility and availability, delivered by specialized psychologists, and integration in medical cancer care. Online and group therapy are acceptable, but individual face-to-face therapy is preferred. It is warranted to increase awareness on psycho-oncological care targeting both patients and healthcare providers.","output":"Organizing Psycho-Oncological Care for Cancer Patients: The Patients Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) and was met with lockdown policies to curb the spread of the disease.

In addition, some patients have recognised autoimmune neurological disorders, including both central (limbic and brainstem encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [ADEM], and myelitis) and peripheral diseases (GuillainCBarr and Miller Fisher syndrome). We systematically describe data from 133 reported series on the Neurology and Neuropsychiatry of COVID-19 blog (https://blogs.bmj.com/jnnp/2020/05/01/the-neurology-and-neuropsychiatry-of-covid-19/) providing a comprehensive overview concerning the diagnosis, and treatment of patients with neurological immune-mediated complications of SARS-CoV-2. In most cases the latency to neurological disorder was highly variable and the immunological or other mechanisms involved were unclear. Despite specific neuronal or ganglioside antibodies only being identified in 10, many had apparent responses to immunotherapies. Although the proportion of patients experiencing immune-mediated neurological disorders is small, the total number is likely to be underestimated.

In addition, we demonstrate that both systemic and intranasal application protects hACE-2-transgenic mice from SARS-CoV-2 induced lethal disease progression. To boost potency of the lead, we used structure-guided molecular modeling combined with rapid yeast-based Fc-fusion prototyping, resulting in the affinity-matured VHH72_S56A-Fc, with subnanomolar SARS-CoV-1 and ?2 neutralizing potency. Upon humanization, VHH72_S56A was fused to a human IgG1 Fc with optimized manufacturing homogeneity and silenced effector functions for enhanced safety, and its stability as well as lack of off-target binding was extensively characterized. Therapeutic systemic administration of a low dose of VHH72_S56A-Fc antibodies strongly restricted replication of both original and D614G mutant variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus in hamsters, and minimized the development of lung damage.

Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable to suffering psychological effects as result of such measures. In Spain, children were enforced to a strict home lockdown for 42 days during the first wave. Here, we studied the effects of lockdown in children and adolescents through an online questionnaire. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Spain using an open online survey from July (after the lockdown resulting from the first pandemic wave) to November 2020 (second wave). We included families with children under 16 years-old living in Spain. Parents answered a survey regarding the lockdown effects on their children and were instructed to invite their children from 7 to 16 years-old (mandatory scholar age in Spain) to respond a specific set of questions. Answers were collected through an application programming interface system, and data analysis was performed using R. Results: We included 1,957 families who completed the questionnaires, covering a total of 3,347 children. The specific children's questionnaire was completed by 167 kids (7C11 years-old), and 100 adolescents (12C16 years-old). Children, in general, showed high resilience and capability to adapt to new situations. Sleeping problems were reported in more than half of the children (54%) and adolescents (59%), and these were strongly associated with less time doing sports and spending more than 5 h per day using electronic devices. Parents perceived their children to gain weight (41%), be more irritable and anxious (63%) and sadder (46%). Parents and children differed significantly when evaluating children's sleeping disturbances. Conclusions: Enforced lockdown measures and isolation can have a negative impact on children and adolescent's mental health and well-being.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Ada, an app-based diagnostic tool and the impact on patient outcome. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The eRadaR trial is a prospective, double-blinded study with patients presenting to the emergency room (ER) with abdominal pain. At initial contact in the ER, a structured interview will be performed using the Ada-App and both, patients and attending physicians, will be blinded to the proposed diagnosis lists until trial completion. Throughout the study, clinical data relating to diagnostic findings and types of therapy will be obtained and the follow-up until day 90 will comprise occurrence of complications and overall survival of patients. The primary efficacy of the trial is defined by the percentage of correct diagnoses suggested by Ada compared with the final discharge diagnosis. Further, accuracy and timing of diagnosis will be compared with decision making of classical doctor-patient interaction.

One of the greatest barriers to the development of effective therapeutic agents to treat influenza, coronaviruses, and many other infections of the respiratory tract is the absence of a robust preclinical model. Preclinical studies currently rely on high-throughput, low-fidelity in vitro screening with cell lines and/or low-throughput animal models that often provide a poor correlation to human clinical responses. Here, we introduce a human primary airway epithelial cell-based model integrated into a high-throughput platform where tissues are cultured at an air-liquid interface (PREDICT96-ALI). We present results on the application of this platform to influenza and coronavirus infections, providing multiple readouts capable of evaluating viral infection kinetics and potentially the efficacy of therapeutic agents in an in vitro system. Several strains of influenza A virus are shown to successfully infect the human primary cell-based airway tissue cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI), and as a proof-of-concept, the effect of the antiviral oseltamivir on one strain of Influenza A is evaluated. Human coronaviruses NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and SARS-CoV-2 enter host cells via ACE2 and utilize the protease TMPRSS2 for protein priming, and we confirm expression of both in our ALI model. We also demonstrate coronavirus infection in this system with HCoV-NL63, observing sufficient viral propagation over 96 hours post-infection to indicate successful infection of the primary cell-based model. This new capability has the potential to address a gap in the rapid assessment of therapeutic efficacy of various small molecules and antiviral agents against influenza and other respiratory viruses including coronaviruses.","output":"High-Throughput Human Primary Cell-Based Airway Model for Evaluating Influenza, Coronavirus, or other Respiratory Viruses in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The balance of payments (BoP) is a critical macroeconomic indicator that helps understand the overall picture of a country's economic transactions with foreign ones.

In addition, despite receiving large remittances, the amount of money that Vietnam had to pay to foreign investors was always much more excess than that Vietnam earns from investing abroad, causing the balance of income to run in deficit. Vietnam's financial account was also in surplus because she has received an enormous amount of foreign direct investments. The surplus in Vietnam's BoP has enhanced Vietnam's external position, but it has put pressure on the domestic currency to appreciate and warn of future macroeconomic uncertainties.

However, comparing cases and fatality rates across regions is challenging due to heterogeneity in testing and health systems. We show two complementary ways of benchmarking across territories and in time. First, we used multivariate regressions to estimate the test-elasticity of Covid-19 case incidence. Cases grow less than proportionally with testing when assessing weekly changes or looking across states in the USA. They tend to be proportional or even more than proportional when comparing the month-to-month evolution of an average country in the pandemic. Our results were robust to various model specifications.

Our objective was to assess demographic, clinical, and outcome variables of patients requiring hospitalization for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection comparing fully vaccinated and boosted (FV&B), fully vaccinated (FV), and unvaccinated (UV) patients. METHODS: This multicenter observational cohort analysis compared demographic, clinical, and outcome variables in FV&B, FV, and UV adults hospitalized for COVID-19. Partially vaccinated (PV) and individuals still hospitalized beyond the designated follow-up date of February 1, 2022 were excluded. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints included characteristics and outcomes in subpopulations of intensive care and geriatric (age >65) patients. FINDINGS: Between August 12th, 2021 and January 20th, 2022, 8232 patient encounters had a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 and required inpatient treatment. Of the 8232 encounters requiring hospitalization, 448 (5.8%) were FV&B, 2257 (29.2%) were FV, and 5023 (65.0%) were UV; 357 PV and 147 still hospitalized were excluded. The median age of FV&B cohort was 73 (IQR 62, 82) compared to 70 (IQR 59, 80) for FV and 59 (IQR 45, 71) for UV (0.001). Most patients were female in both the FB&V and UV groups with 51.1% and 51.8%, respectively, while the FV group had a majority of males (51.3%). The median Elixhauser weighted score was 12 (IQR 3, 22) for FV&B, 10 (IQR 2, 20) for FV, and 9 (IQR 0, 17) for UV groups (p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was 7.1% in the FV&B, 10.3% in the FV group, and 12.8% in the UV group (p < 0.001). The FV&B group had lower in-hospital mortality than both FV and UV groups (p = 0.045 and p = 0.001, respectively). The FV group had lower in-hospital mortality than the UV group (p = 0.004). INTERPRETATION: Fully vaccinated and boosted patients requiring hospital-level care for breakthrough COVID-19 have lower in-hospital mortality than fully vaccinated and unvaccinated patients despite being older and higher risk at baseline. Boosters offer added protection beyond full vaccination in preventing death. As COVID-19 continues to spread, larger expansive trials are needed to further identify risk factors for severe outcomes among the FV&B population.

Computer-assisted learning became the earliest form of simulation applied to pharmacology teaching, arising from increasing pressure to deviate from animal and tissue experiments in undergraduate education in the 1990s. In the last decade, high fidelity patient simulation, using manikin technology, has demonstrated benefit in building connectivity between knowledge and clinical application within patient care. Serious games, or computer-based educational games, provide an alternative method for creating context, with potential realized for newer technologies like augmented reality. These tools, while beneficial, are not applied in a uniform manner across programs. We advocate for routine incorporation of these tools as they offer significant opportunities to address the challenges faced in todays healthcare education, particularly with the need for continued social distancing and limitations on in-person educational engagement during coronavirus.

In addition, we sought medical indications that have yielded the most promising results in the limited studies to date. We conclude that promising, yet still speculative, results have been reported for the treatment of psoriasis and enhancement of skeletal muscle activity. However, further trials are required to determine the optimal method of raising NAD levels, identifying the target conditions, and comparisons to the present standard of care for these conditions.

There are limited data on the frequency and risk factors for coexistent SVD and the effect of SVD on stroke recurrence in patients receiving medical treatment for ICAS. OBJECTIVE To investigate the frequency and risk factors for SVD and the effect of SVD on stroke recurrence in patients with ICAS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A post hoc analysis of the Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) study, a prospective, multicenter clinical trial. Among 451 participants, 313 (69.4%) had baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging scans read centrally for SVD that was defined by any of the following: old lacunar infarction, grade 2 to 3 on the Fazekas scale (for high-grade white matter hyperintensities), or microbleeds. Patient enrollment in SAMMPRIS began November 25, 2008, and follow-up ended on April 30, 2013. Data analysis for the present study was performed from May 13, 2014, to July 29, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk factors in patients with vs without SVD and the association between SVD and other baseline risk factors with any ischemic stroke and ischemic stroke in the territory of the stenotic artery determined using proportional hazards regression. RESULTS Of 313 patients, 155 individuals (49.5%) had SVD noted on baseline magnetic resonance imaging. Variables that were significantly higher in patients with SVD, reported as mean (SD), included age, 63.5 (10.5) years (P < .001), systolic blood pressure, 149 (22) mm Hg (P < .001), glucose level, 130 (50) mg/dL (P = .03), and lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (median, 24 [interquartile range, 20-26]; P = .02).Other significant variables were the number of patients with diabetes mellitus (88 of 155 [56.8%]; P = .003), coronary artery disease (46 [29.7%]; P = .004), stroke before the qualifying event (59 [38.1%]; P < .001), old infarct in the territory of the stenotic intracranial artery (88 [56.8%]; P < .001), and receiving antithrombotic therapy at the time of the qualifying event (109 [70.3%]; P = .005). The association between SVD and any ischemic stroke was nearly significant in the direction of a higher risk (18 [23.7%]); P = .07) for patients with SVD. On bivariate analysis, SVD was not associated with an increased risk on multivariable analyses (hazard ratio, 1.7 [95% CI, 0.8-3.8]; P = .20). In addition, SVD was not associated with an increased risk of stroke in the territory on either bivariate or multivariable analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although SVD is common in patients with ICAS, the presence of SVD on baseline magnetic resonance imaging is not independently associated with an increased risk of stroke in patients with ICAS.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with severe and critical COVID-19 from four hospitals in Wuhan, China, by evaluating the clinical characteristics and laboratory results, and using Cox proportional hazards model to assess the risk factors involved in disease progression. RESULTS: In total, 446 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The study indicated a high mortality rate (20.2%) in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. At the time of admission, all patients required oxygen therapy, and 52 (12%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 50 (96%) died. The univariate Cox proportional hazards model showed a white blood cell count of more than 10  109/L (HR 3.993,95%CI 2.469 to 6.459) that correlated with an increased mortality rate. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that older age (HR 1.066, 95% CI 1.043 to 1.089) and higher white blood cell count (HR 1.135, 95% CI 1.080 to 1.192) were independent risk factors for determining COVID-19 associated mortality. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with a significant risk of morbidity and mortality in the population.

In this case, intravenous insulin infusion with continuous glucose monitoring should be the choice. No evidence suggests stopping angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-renin-blockers or statins, even it has been suggested that they may increase the expression of Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, which is used by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to penetrate into the cells.

This study investigated the suitability of a handheld scanner in contrast to a portable scanner for quantifying EVLW in hospitalized patients requiring HD. METHODS In this prospective study, 54 hospitalized HD patients were enrolled. Bedside lung ultrasound was performed within 30 min before and after dialysis using handheld (phased array transducer, 1.7-3.8 MHz) and portable (curved probe, 5-2 MHz) ultrasound devices. Eight lung zones were scanned for total B-lines number (TBLN). The maximum diameter of inferior vena cava (IVC) was measured. We performed Passing-Bablok regression, Deming regression, Bland-Altman, and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The 2 devices did not differ in measuring TBLN and IVC (p > 0.05), showing a high correlation (r = 0.92 and r = 0.51, respectively). Passing-Bablok regression had a slope of 1.11 and an intercept of 0 for TBLN, and the slope of Deming regression was 1.02 within the CI bands of 0.94 and 1.11 in the full cohort. TBLN was logarithmically transformed for Bland-Altman analysis, showing a bias of 0.06 (TBLN = 1.2) between devices. The slope and intercept of the Deming regression in IVC measurements were 0.77 and 0.46, respectively; Bland-Altman plot showed a bias of -0.07. Compared with predialysis, TBLN significantly (p < 0.001) decreased after dialysis, while IVC was unchanged (p = 0.16). Univariate analysis showed that cardiovascular disease (odds ratio [OR] 8.94 [2.13-61.96], p = 0.002), smoking history (OR 5.75 [1.8-20.46], p = 0.003), and right pleural effusion (OR 5.0 [1.2-25.99], p = 0.03) were strong predictors of EVLW indicated by TBLN  4. CONCLUSION The lung and IVC findings obtained from handheld and portable ultrasound scanners are comparable and concordant. Cardiovascular disease and smoking history were strong predictors of EVLW. The use of TBLN to assess EVLW in hospitalized HD patients is feasible.

The demand for on-demand ride services, such as taxis and ridehailing has been specifically impacted, given both restrictions in service operations and user's concerns about virus transmission in shared vehicles. During the pandemic, demand for these modes have decreased by as much as 80%. This study examines intentions to use on-demand ride services in a period of drastic changes in lifestyles and daily routines coupled with unprecedented mobility reductions. Specifically, we examine the determinants for the shift of intentions to use these on-demand modes of travel in the early stages of the pandemic. Using data from a survey disseminated in June 2020 to 700 respondents from contiguous United States, ordinal regression modeling is applied to analyze the shift in consideration. The results indicate that political orientation and health-related experiences during the pandemic are significant sources of variation for individual changes in intentions to use ridehailing. Additionally, characteristics such as age and income result in consideration shifts that contradict the typical ridership profiles found in the ridehailing literature. Specifically, on-demand ride consideration decreases as a function of age and income. Moreover, transit-users are more willing to consider on-demand rides than private vehicle users, suggesting that shared vehicle modes have a similar risk-profile. We discuss the role of on-demand ride services in the pandemic era, and the need to investigate political orientation and evolving pandemic experiences to pinpoint their role in future mobility systems.","output":"Shifting Mobility Behaviors in Unprecedented Times: Intentions to Use On-demand Ride Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in infants have incompletely characterized factors associated with severe illness or focused on infants born to mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

However, the role of genomic heterogeneity of the virions of a virus in virus infection has not been extensively explored. To address this issue, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), a DNA virus infecting crustaceans, was characterized in the current study. In WSSV, differences in two nucleotides of the viral genome generated two types of WSSV, forming a virus population that consisted of Type A WSSV (encoding WSSV lncRNA-24) and Type B WSSV (encoding the wsv195 gene) at a ratio of 1:3. The virus populations in all virus-infected cells and tissues of different hosts exhibited a stable 1:3 structure. WSSV lncRNA-24 in Type A WSSV promoted virus infection by binding to shrimp and WSSV miRNAs, while the wsv195 gene in Type B WSSV played an essential role in virus infection. Loss of Type A WSSV or Type B WSSV in the WSSV population led to a 100-fold decrease in viral copy number in shrimp. Simultaneous loss of both types of WSSV prevented virus infection.

The public also requires protection from pet-related injuries and animal-to-human diseases. Most legislation concerning exotic pet trading and keeping involves restricting or banning problematic species, a practice known as negative listing. However, an alternative approach adopted by some governments permits only those species that meet certain scientifically proven criteria to be sold and kept as pets. Thus, governments may positively list only those species that are suitable to keep in domestic settings and that do not present a disproportionate risk to people or the environment. We reviewed international, national, and regional legislation in Europe, the United States, and Canada and found that largely unpublished and often inconsistent criteria are used for the development of negative and positive lists. We also conducted online surveys of governments, which received limited responses, although telephone interviews with governments either considering or developing positive lists revealed insights regarding their interest and motivation towards positive lists. We discuss key issues raised by civil servants including the perceived advantages of positive lists and challenges they anticipate in drawing up suitable lists of species. We compare functions of negative and positive lists and offer recommendations to governments concerning the development and implementation of positive lists. ABSTRACT: The trading and keeping of exotic pets are associated with animal welfare, conservation, environmental protection, agricultural animal health, and public health concerns and present serious regulatory challenges to legislators and enforcers. Most legislation concerning exotic pet trading and keeping involves restricting or banning problematic species, a practice known as negative listing. However, an alternative approach adopted by some governments permits only the keeping of animals that meet certain scientifically proven criteria as suitable in respect of species, environmental, and public health and safety protections. We conducted an evaluation of positive lists for the regulation of pet trading and keeping within the context of the more prevalent system of restricting or prohibiting species via negative lists. Our examination of international, national, and regional regulations in Europe, the United States, and Canada found that criteria used for the development of both negative and positive lists were inconsistent or non-specific. Our online surveys of governments received limited responses, although telephone interviews with officials from governments either considering or developing positive lists provided useful insights into their attitudes and motivations towards adopting positive lists. We discuss key issues raised by civil servants including perceived advantages of positive lists and anticipated challenges when developing lists of suitable species. In addition, we compare functions of negative and positive lists, and recommend key principles that we hope will be helpful to governments concerning development and implementation of regulations based on positive lists.","output":"Turning Negatives into Positives for Pet Trading and Keeping: A Review of Positive Lists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Despite research on the molecular bases of Alzheimers disease (AD), effective therapies against its progression are still needed.

The crucial anti-HCC targets of Pachyman, including ALB, VEGFA, TNF, CASP3, SRC, EGF, CXCR4, STAT3, HRAS, HSP90AA1, MMP9, BCL2L1, FGF2, and PTPRC, were identified. In addition, the correlative networks of all crucial biotargets of Pachyman in treating HCC were created accordingly. Functionally, these crucial genes were correlated using angiogenesis and neoplastic metastasis of HCC. Interestingly, the molecular docking findings indicated that ALB and VEGFA in HCC might be potent pharmacological targets of Pachyman. In experimental validation, the clinical samples of HCC showed reduced ALB protein expression and increased VEGFA protein level. Following Pachyman treatments in vitro, the intracellular level of ALB protein was elevated, whereas the cellular content of VEGFA protein was downregulated. Taken together, current bioinformatics findings based on pharmacology network and molecular docking analyses elucidate the detailed molecular targets and signaling mechanisms of Pachyman in treating HCC.

Hence, the present review attempts to delineate the influence of antibiotics abuse on the human, animal and environmental health under the realm of one health. It was based on the literature search using public databases to highlight the rapid surge in the burden of AMR in India affecting various sectors and/or ecosystems in India. It was found that the irrational and overuse of antibiotics in different sectors have led to the emergence of extended antimicrobial resistance wherein the environment acts as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs); completing the cycle of contamination and recontamination. There are efforts by government policy makers to reduce the burden of AMR in the country to reduce the health risks, through the One Health approach. Parallel efforts in educating healthcare professionals, strict legislation for pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies should be prioritize.

Results: Analysis of the coded interviews produced 6 primary themes (uncertainty, physical therapists role, ethical dilemmas and moral distress, emotions, providing care and working conditions, and management and leadership influence) and associated subthemes. Conclusions: Physical therapists reported numerous professional and ethical issues across the individual, organizational, and societal realms during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study highlights the need for education and resources to prepare physical therapists for professional and ethical issues encountered during pandemics. Specifically, there is a need to define the physical therapists role in pandemics and prepare the physical therapy personnel for dealing with ethical issues, stress, uncertainty, and organizational changes associated with pandemics. Ethical guidelines would support organizations in delineating fair processes for triage and allocation of scarce resources for acute care physical therapy during healthcare emergencies.

Patients with gynecologic small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas diagnosed between 1973 and 2015 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Univariate and multivariate Cox risk regression analyses were performed to determine the independent predictors of overall survival. Overall survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used for comparison. We included 5,15,393 eligible carcinomas in the present study; the prevalence of gynecologic small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas was 0.121% (N = 622). Multivariate analysis indicated that advanced age, stage III and IV cancer, and no chemotherapy treatment may be predictors of poor small-cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma prognosis. Stage III and IV cancer and lack of surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy were identified as potential predictors of poor prognosis in patients with ovarian small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that the median survival was 19, 11, and 12 months for cervical, ovarian, and endometrial small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, respectively.

Results from this study suggest that hackathons are an effective format for teaching topics that are not core to the engineering discipline in a short period of time. Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the essential role that computer scientists and engineers have in controlling disease outbreaks. However, engineering programs generally do not provide training on public health issues. Thus, there is a critical need to develop innovative and engaging ways to educate engineering students about public health without interfering with required discipline-specific content. Intended Outcomes: Hackathons, short-term events, held outside of the classroom, can provide an engaging and effective method for increasing the interest and knowledge of engineering students in disease outbreaks. In this article, the effectiveness of a hack day in increasing the interest and knowledge of engineering students in disease outbreaks is assessed. Application Design: One-hundred-six undergraduate students, 30 of whom were engineering majors, participated in a multidisciplinary disease focused hackathon. Student learning and engagement during the hackathon was assessed for the 30 engineering students that participated through pre- and post-event surveys. Findings: The results indicated that the hackathon increased both content knowledge and engagement of engineering students in public health issues. Additionally, students gained an increased understanding of public health professions and how they can contribute to disease tracking, prevention, and treatment.

The morbidity and mortality outcome in these patients have been variably reported in the published literature. Comparative analyses of ventilated COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients during the same time period have been lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective data for each mechanically ventilated patient was collected from both COVID-19 and non-COVID ICU for a period of 8 months. Their demographic details and disease severity scores were included. Risk-adjusted outcomes across two groups were analyzed using multivariable regression methods. RESULTS: Crude ICU and hospital mortality were similar in COVID-19- and non-COVID-19 ventilated groups (43.8 vs 40% and 43.8 vs 41.1%, respectively; p >0.05). After risk adjustment for the severity of illness by APACHE IV, no significant differences were observed in ICU mortality (OR 1.498; 95% CI 0.669C3.327; p =0.328) and hospital mortality (OR 1.574; 95% CI 0.707C3.504; p =0.267).

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was distributed to all consultant glaucoma specialists who are on the UK and Eire Glaucoma Society contact list. Participants were asked specific questions regarding preferences in glaucoma surgical practices and whether these had changed subsequent to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Trabeculectomy was the procedure of choice for 61 (87%) glaucoma specialists. A total of 51 (73%) respondents reported performing minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures before the COVID-19 pandemic. The most commonly performed MIGS procedure was the iStent inject (51%), followed by XEN 45 (36%) and Preserflo (17%). Forty-three (61%) respondents reported modifying their glaucoma surgery practice subsequent to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the glaucoma specialists who modified their surgical practices, 21 (43%) specifically reduced the number of trabeculectomies performed. In combination, diode laser (both micropulse and conventional trans-scleral cyclodiode) was the most common alternative procedure. Glaucoma drainage devices, deep sclerectomy and Preserflo were also commonly chosen alternatives. CONCLUSION: Although trabeculectomy remains the most commonly performed established glaucoma surgery, it is being performed with reduced frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the number of postoperative visits and procedures required.

Their etiopathogenesis, including the role of SARS-CoV-2, remains elusive. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of chilblain-like lesions with SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective case series enrolled 17 adolescents who presented with chilblain-like lesions from April 1 to June 30, 2020, at a tertiary referral academic hospital in Italy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Macroscopic (clinical and dermoscopic) and microscopic (histopathologic) analysis contributed to a thorough understanding of the lesions. Nasopharyngeal swab, serologic testing, and in situ hybridization of the skin biopsy specimens were performed to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory tests explored signs of systemic inflammation or thrombophilia. Structural changes in peripheral microcirculation were investigated by capillaroscopy. RESULTS: Of the 17 adolescents (9 [52.9%] male; median [interquartile range] age, 13.2 [12.5-14.3] years) enrolled during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, 16 (94.1%) had bilaterally localized distal erythematous or cyanotic lesions. A triad of red dots (16 [100%]), white rosettes (11 [68.8%]), and white streaks (10 [62.5%]) characterized the dermoscopic picture.

Methods: A test-negative design compared vaccination among SARS-CoV-2 test-positive and weekly-matched (10:1), randomly-sampled, test-negative HCWs using linked surveillance and immunization databases. Vaccine status was defined by one dose []14 days or two doses []7 days before illness onset or specimen collection. Adjusted VE was estimated by conditional logistic regression. Results: Primary analysis included 5,316 cases and 53,160 controls. Single-dose VE was 70% (95%CI: 68-73) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 73% (95%CI: 71-75) against COVID-19 illness and 97% (95%CI: 92-99) against associated hospitalization. Two-dose VE was 86% (95%CI: 81-90) and 93% (95%CI: 89-95), respectively, with no associated hospitalizations. VE was higher for non-VOC than VOC (73% Alpha) among single-dose (77%, 95%CI: 73-81 versus 63%, 95%CI: 57-67) but not two-dose recipients (87%, 95%CI: 57-96 versus 94%, 95%CI: 89-96).

Several US states have made strong commitments to this effort through legislation and dedicated funds. However, it is not known if these efforts have resulted in population-level increments in HPV awareness overtime. Using the Health Information National Trends Survey data, we examined the awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine in the US, between 2008 and 2018. Prevalence estimates and confidence intervals were calculated for HPV and HPV vaccine awareness. Further, we assessed awareness after stratifying by key sociodemographic characteristics. Overall, the awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine declined over time. The lowest awareness was among racial minorities, rural residents, male respondents, those aged 65 years and older, as well as those with the lowest educational and socioeconomic standing. Between 2013 and 2018, the awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine declined by almost 10% among males, those with a high school level of education or lower, and those who earned less than USD 35,000 per annum. In 2018, the awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine was highest among non-Hispanic whites (65.8% and 66.5%) and female adults (70.5% and 71.4%); however, these figures represented declines of about 5% from rates observed in 2008. Amidst a background of sub-optimal HPV vaccination uptake and a growing incidence of HPV-associated cancers in the US, HPV-related awareness within the general US population has declined over time. This calls for stricter enforcement of legislation aimed at boosting HPV awareness, as well as frequent evaluation of government-funded HPV awareness programs.","output":"Declining awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine within the general US population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Succinimide (Asu) is the intermediate for asparagine deamidation in therapeutic proteins, and it can be readily hydrolyzed to form aspartate and iso-aspartate residues. Moreover, Asu plays an important role in the protein degradation pathways, asparagine deamidation, and aspartic acid isomerization. Here, Asu modification with a high abundance in the framework region (FR) of golimumab was first reported, the effect of denaturing buffer pH on the Asu modification homeostasis was studied, and the results revealed that it was relatively stable over a pH range of 6.0C7.0 whereas a rapid decrease at pH 8.0.

Psychiatric symptoms in people living with HIV, and their relationship to physical symptomatology and prior psychopathology, are not yet reported. SETTING: An HIV cohort sheltering-in-place in New York City. METHODS: Forty-nine participants in a longitudinal study were contacted by telephone in April 2020. A structured interview queried COVID-19-associated physical symptoms, and mental health screens were performed with the generalized anxiety disorder-2 (GAD-2) and patient health questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). Prior medical and neuropsychiatric data were obtained from preceding study visits. Post-hoc analyses were performed. RESULTS: The mean age of respondents was 62.1 years, 39% were women, and 35% African American, 37% Latinx, and 28% Caucasian. COVID-19-indicator symptoms were present in 69%; 41% had respiratory and 61% extra-pulmonary symptoms. Mental health symptoms were endorsed in 45% with PHQ-2 and 43% with GAD-2, although threshold for major depression was met in only 4% and for GAD in 14%. Higher PHQ scores were associated with respiratory symptoms, but not prior mood or anxiety disorders. GAD-2 scores were higher with past mood disorders, but not with prior anxiety disorders or respiratory symptoms.

Exacerbations bear clinical and prognostic relevance, and may result in marked functional and clinical deterioration. The varying presentations of COPD mean that exacerbations, although more frequent in patients with severe or very severe disease, may occur regardless of the degree of functional impairment. The new Spanish COPD Guideline (GesEPOC) has provided new insights into the management of the disease. The GesEPOC defines various disease phenotypes with different clinical, prognostic and therapeutic implications. One of these phenotypes is the so-called 'exacerbator', characterized by the incidence of an increased number of exacerbations (two or more moderate-severe exacerbations in the last year). An exacerbation must be defined by: an increase in symptom intensity occurring after a certain period of time since the last exacerbation (so that treatment failure can be excluded as the cause of the event); and the contribution of social criteria or reasons concerning the choice of therapy. The availability of certain tools to detect exacerbations would enable establishment of a homogeneous definition of exacerbation, and improved diagnosis, a suitable treatment choice and a more appropriate patient selection for clinical studies. Validated clinical questionnaires and biomarkers are the most helpful instruments to reach the above objectives. Following the clinical diagnosis of a COPD exacerbation, associated comorbidities must be evaluated and an etiologic diagnosis must be made, all of which will partially drive the choice of treatment. Once a diagnosis has been made, the severity of the exacerbation should be established in order to define where and how the patient should be treated. Based on the patient's clinical history, clinical examination and diagnostic tests, the severity will be classified in one of these four degrees: very severe, severe, moderate and mild.","output":"How should we define and classify exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, oil degrading bacteria discovered from fish living near the oil ports at Karachi in Pakistan were characterized.

Rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) has pleiotropic properties and functions in viral morphogenesis as well as pathogenesis. Recent reports show that the inhibition of NSP4 expression by small interfering RNAs leads to alteration of the production and distribution of other viral proteins and mRNA synthesis, suggesting that NSP4 also affects virus replication by unknown mechanisms. This report describes studies aimed at correlating the localization of intracellular NSP4 in cells with its functions. To be able to follow the localization of NSP4, we fused the C terminus of full-length NSP4 with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and expressed this fusion protein inducibly in a HEK 293-based cell line to avoid possible cytotoxicity. NSP4-EGFP was initially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as documented by Endo H-sensitive glycosylation and colocalization with ER marker proteins. Only a small fraction of NSP4-EGFP colocalized with the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) marker ERGIC-53. NSP4-EGFP did not enter the Golgi apparatus, in agreement with the Endo H sensitivity and a previous report that secretion of an NSP4 cleavage product generated in rotavirus-infected cells is not inhibited by brefeldin A. A significant population of expressed NSP4-EGFP was distributed in novel vesicular structures throughout the cytoplasm, not colocalizing with ER, ERGIC, Golgi, endosomal, or lysosomal markers, thus diverging from known biosynthetic pathways. The appearance of vesicular NSP4-EGFP was dependent on intracellular calcium levels, and vesicular NSP4-EGFP colocalized with the autophagosomal marker LC3. In rotavirus-infected cells, NSP4 colocalized with LC3 in cap-like structures associated with viroplasms, the site of nascent viral RNA replication, suggesting a possible new mechanism for the involvement of NSP4 in virus replication.","output":"Rotavirus NSP4 induces a novel vesicular compartment regulated by calcium and associated with viroplasms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study evaluated cardiac involvement in patients recovered from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Background: Myocardial injury caused by COVID-19 was previously reported in hospitalized patients. It is unknown if there is sustained cardiac involvement after patients' recovery from COVID-19. Methods: Twenty-six patients recovered from COVID-19 who reported cardiac symptoms and underwent CMR examinations were retrospectively included. CMR protocols consisted of conventional sequences (cine, T2-weighted imaging, and late gadolinium enhancement [LGE]) and quantitative mapping sequences (T1, T2, and extracellular volume [ECV] mapping). Edema ratio and LGE were assessed in post-COVID-19 patients. Cardiac function, native T1/T2, and ECV were quantitatively evaluated and compared with controls. Results: Fifteen patients (58%) had abnormal CMR findings on conventional CMR sequences: myocardial edema was found in 14 (54%) patients and LGE was found in 8 (31%) patients. Decreased right ventricle functional parameters including ejection fraction, cardiac index, and stroke volume/body surface area were found in patients with positive conventional CMR findings.

As the pandemic has progressed, evidence has emerged reconfirming the value of human milk and the importance of protecting and supporting breastfeeding, especially the initiation of lactation. However, it is clear that COVID-19 has changed the clinical care paradigm around breastfeeding and lactation support and, as such, it is imperative that practices adapt and evolve to maintain the emphasis on lactation support. We participated in a round table conference aiming to rescue and develop protocols and practices that support breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic. One key area to target will be to maximize the use of the antenatal period. The early identification of lactation risk factors together with the development of person-centered methods to deliver breastfeeding information and education to parents-to-be will be critical. In addition, the establishment of a hospital culture that values breastfeeding and prioritizes the use of human milk will be integral for the motivation of health care professionals. That culture will also support active management of the initiation of lactation and the development of a 'back-up plan' toolkit to support the mother experiencing lactation difficulties. Post-discharge support will also be crucial with the development of both in-person and virtual lactation support programs, in particular for the immediate post-discharge period to benefit mothers who experience an early discharge process. These measures will allow for a new, adapted framework of practice that acknowledges the current COVID-19 paradigm and maintains the emphasis on the need to protect and support breastfeeding and the use of human milk.","output":"Updating Clinical Practices to Promote and Protect Human Milk and Breastfeeding in a COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A live attenuated duck Tembusu virus (TMUV) vaccine FX2010-180P (180P) was successfully utilized to prevent TMUV infections in ducks in China. Compared with wild-type TMUV, 180P was highly attenuated and lost transmissibility in ducks. However, the mechanism of the attenuation of 180P remains poorly understood. To explore the key molecular basis of attenuation, chimeric and site mutant viruses in the background of the wild-type TMUV-FX2010 (FX) strain were rescued, and the replication, tissue tropism, and transmissibility were characterized in ducks. The results show that the envelope (E) protein was responsible for attenuation and loss of transmission in ducks. Further studies showed that a D120N amino acid mutation located in domain II of the E protein was responsible for the attenuation and transmissibility loss of 180P in ducks. The D120N substitution resulted in an extra high-mannose type N-linked glycosylation (NLG) in the E protein of 180P compared with the wild-type TMUV, which might restrict the tissue tropism and transmissibility of TMUV in ducks. Our findings elucidate that N120 in the E protein is a key molecular basis of TMUV attenuation in ducks and provide new insight into the role of NLG in TMUV tissue tropism and transmissibility.","output":"A Single Mutation at Position 120 in the Envelope Protein Attenuates Tembusu Virus in Ducks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the temporal trend of tuberculosis cases according to sex and age group and evidence the level of disease before the Covid-19 pandemic in a TB high endemic city. METHODS: This was a time series study carried out in a city in northeast Brazil. The population was composed of cases of tuberculosis, excluding those with HIV-positive status, reported between the years 2002 and 2018. An exploratory analysis of the monthly rates of tuberculosis detection, smoothed according to sex and age group, was performed. Subsequently, the progression of the trend and prediction of the disease were also characterized according to these aspects. For the trends forecast, the seasonal autoregressive linear integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the usual Box-Jenkins method were used to choose the most appropriate models. RESULTS: A total of 1620 cases of tuberculosis were reported, with an incidence of 49.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in men and 34.0 per 100,000 in women. Regarding the incidence for both sexes, there was a decreasing trend, which was similar for age. Evidence resulting from the application of the time series shows a decreasing trend in the years 2002C2018, with a trend of stability. CONCLUSIONS: The study evidenced a decreasing trend in tuberculosis, even before the Covid-19 pandemic, for both sex and age; however, in a step really slow from that recommended by the World Health Organization. According to the results, the disease would have achieved a level of stability in the city next years, however it might have been aggravated by the pandemic.

Significant association between myocarditis and a suspected drug is assessed using disproportionality analyses, which use Bayesian information component estimates. Overall, we identify 62 drugs associated with myocarditis, 41 of which are categorized into 5 main pharmacological classes: antipsychotics (n = 3108 reports), salicylates (n = 340), antineoplastic-cytotoxics (n = 190), antineoplastic-immunotherapies (n = 538), and vaccines (n = 790). Thirty-eight (61.3%) drugs were not previously reported associated with myocarditis. Antipsychotic was the first (1979) and most reported class (n = 3018). In 2019, the two most reported classes were antipsychotics (54.7%) and immunotherapies (29.5%). Time-to-onset between treatment start and myocarditis is 15 [interquartile range: 10; 23] days. Subsequent mortality is 10.3% and differs between drug classes with immunotherapies the highest, 32.5% and salicylates the lowest, 2.6%.

In light of COVID-19, it is predicted that as many as 75,000 more people will die from alcohol and other substance use and suicide as a result of isolation, new mental health concerns, and various other stressors related to the pandemic. Public awareness campaigns that aim to destigmatize substance use and help individuals have meaningful conversations with friends, coworkers, or family members to address substance use concerns are a timely and cost-effective means of augmenting existing behavioral health efforts related to substance use. These types of interventions can supplement the work being done by existing public health initiatives. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study examines the impact of the One Degree: Shift the Influence role play simulation, designed to teach family, friends, and coworkers to effectively manage problem-solving conversations with individuals that they are concerned about regarding substance use. METHODS: Participants recruited for this mixed methods study completed a presurvey, the simulation, and a postsurvey, and were sent a 6-week follow-up survey. The simulation involves practicing a role play conversation with a virtual human coded with emotions, a memory, and a personality. A virtual coach provides feedback in using evidence-based communication strategies such as motivational interviewing. RESULTS: A matched sample analysis of variance revealed significant increases at follow-up in composite attitudinal constructs of preparedness (P<.001) and self-efficacy (P=.01), including starting a conversation with someone regarding substance use, avoiding upsetting someone while bringing up concerns, focusing on observable facts, and problem solving. Qualitative data provided further evidence of the simulation's positive impact on the ability to have meaningful conversations about substance use. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that conversation-based simulations like One Degree: Shift the Influence that use role play practice can teach individuals to use evidence-based communication strategies and can cost-effectively reach geographically dispersed populations to support public health initiatives for primary prevention.","output":"Innovative Virtual Role Play Simulations for Managing Substance Use Conversations: Pilot Study Results and Relevance During and After COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In social insects, collective choices between food sources are based on self-organized mechanisms where information about resources are locally processed by the foragers. Such a collective decision emerges from the competition between pheromone trails leading to different resources but also between the recruiting stimuli emitted by successful foragers at nest entrances. In this study, we investigated how an additional nest entrance influences the ability of Myrmica rubra ant colonies to exploit two food sources of different quality (1M and 0.1M sucrose solution) and to select the most rewarding one. We found that the mobilisation of workers doubled in two-entrance nests compared to one-entrance nests but that ants were less likely to reach a food source once they exited the nest. Moreover, the collective selection of the most rewarding food source was less marked in two-entrance nests, with foragers distributing themselves evenly between the two feeders. Ultimately, multiple nest entrances reduced the foraging efficiency of ant colonies that consumed significantly less sugar out of the two available resources. Our results highlight that the nest structure, more specifically the number of nest entrances, can impede the ant's ability to process information about environmental opportunities and to select the most rewarding resource. This study opens new insights on how the physical interface between the nest interior and the outside environment can act upon collective decision-making and foraging efficiency in self-organized insect societies.","output":"Foraging through multiple nest holes: An impediment to collective decision-making in ants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has forced nurses to wear more personal protective equipment (PPE) than ever before in their professional lives.","output":"Staying cool and comfortable at work: the challenges of PPE: How design input from nursing staff is making the combination of uniforms and COVID-19 care requirements a bit more bearable"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the potential and feasibility of back-support exoskeletons to help the caregivers in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the University Hospital of Nancy (France) executing Prone Positioning (PP) maneuvers on patients suffering from severe COVID-19-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

It aims to identify individuals who closely contacted an infected person during the incubation period of the virus and notify them to quarantine. However, the existing systems suffer from privacy, security, and efficiency issues. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving Blockchain-based infection control system. Instead of depending on a single authority to run the system, a group of health authorities, that form a consortium Blockchain, run our system. Using Blockchain technology not only secures our system against single point of failure and denial of service attacks, but also brings transparency because all transactions can be validated by different parties. Although contact tracing is important, it is not enough to effectively control an infection. Thus, unlike most of the existing systems that focus only on contact tracing, our system consists of three integrated subsystems, including contact tracing, public places access control, and safe-places recommendation. The access control subsystem prevents infected people from visiting public places to prevent spreading the virus, and the recommendation subsystem categorizes zones based on the infection level so that people can avoid visiting contaminated zones. Our analysis demonstrates that our system is secure and preserves the privacy of the users against identification, social graph disclosure, and tracking attacks, while thwarting false reporting (or panic) attacks. Moreover, our extensive performance evaluations demonstrate the scalability of our system (which is desirable in pandemics) due to its low communication, computation, and storage overheads.","output":"Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Infection Control System for Covid-19-Like Pandemics using Blockchain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices (K-A-P) about food safety and nutrition in Chinese adults who were recruited to the online survey during the epidemic of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

MethodData were from 29,148 adults participating in the Covid-19 Social Study in September-October 2020. Linear regression analyses examined associations between smoking status (current/former/never) and four types of general negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial logistic regression examined associations between smoking status and uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for Covid-19. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics and diagnosed health conditions. ResultsRelative to never and former smokers, current smokers reported significantly greater mistrust of vaccine benefit, were more worried about unforeseen future effects, had greater concerns about commercial profiteering, and had a stronger preference for natural immunity (Badjs 0.16-0.36, p<0.001). Current smokers were more likely to be uncertain (27.6% vs. 22.7% of never smokers: RRadj 1.43 [95%CI 1.31-1.56]; vs. 19.3% of former smokers: RRadj 1.55 [1.41-1.73]) or unwilling (21.5% vs. 11.6% of never smokers: RRadj 2.12 [1.91-2.34]; vs. 14.7% of former smokers: RRadj 1.53 [1.37-1.71]) to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. ConclusionsCurrent smokers hold more negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and are more likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate against Covid-19, compared with never and former smokers. With a disproportionately high number of smokers belonging to socially clustered and disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, lower vaccine uptake in this group could also exacerbate health inequalities. ImplicationsThese results suggest that without intervention, smokers will be less likely than non-smokers to take up the offer of a Covid-19 vaccine when offered. Targeted policy action may be required to ensure low uptake of Covid-19 vaccination programmes does not compound health inequalities between smokers and non-smokers.","output":"Negative vaccine attitudes and intentions to vaccinate against Covid-19 in relation to smoking status: a population survey of UK adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ACL injuries are among the most severe knee injuries in elite sport, with a high injury burden and re-injury risk.

Currently, the global community is facing emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 belonging to Betacoronavirus, which appears to be more transmissible but less deadly than SARS-CoV. The current study aimed to track the evolutionary ancestors and different evolutionary strategies that were genetically adapted by SARS-CoV-2. Our whole-genome analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was the descendant of Bat SARS/SARS-like CoVs and bats served as a natural reservoir. SARS-CoV-2 used mutations and recombination as crucial strategies in different genomic regions including the envelop, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike glycoproteins to become a novel infectious agent. We confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have specific influence on virus reproductive adaptability, allowing for genotype adjustment and adaptations in rapidly changing environments. Moreover, for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in SARS-CoV-2, which encompass spike glycoprotein, RdRp, helicase and ORF3a. Six recombination regions were spotted in the S gene and are undoubtedly important for evolutionary survival, meanwhile this permitted the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to find a way from immune reconnaissance in animals and adapt to a human host. With these combined natural selected strategies, SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a novel virus in human society.","output":"Evolutionary trajectory for the emergence of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary collaboration has generally been shown to have positive effects on healthcare but can be difficult to facilitate. This study assessed the effects of a multidisciplinary fibroid clinic on practice patterns and clinician perceptions to better understand drivers of interspecialty collaboration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Annual rates of hysterectomies, myomectomies, and uterine fibroid embolizations (UFEs) performed in an urban healthcare system were collected from 2012-2019. Rates of each procedure were compared over time before and after launching a multidisciplinary fibroid clinic at the academic medical center. Referral rates were also compared. The gynecologists and interventional radiologists (IRs) involved in the clinic were interviewed 2 years prior to and after the clinic launch about their approaches to fibroids and perceptions of others who treat this condition. A phenomenological approach was used to identify and compare themes within the interviews by two researchers with excellent inter-rater agreement ( = 0.80). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Annual rates of fibroid procedures increased over time (p<0.01) but the relative number of UFEs decreased (p = 0.01). UFE referrals by the clinic gynecologists significantly increased as did the number of combined fibroid procedures (p<0.01). However, the rates of one fibroid procedure relative to others were not different between the clinic and rest of the healthcare system (p = 0.55). Specialty-specific perceptions of fibroid treatments and inter-specialty dynamics did not change. Despite this, clinicians unanimously perceived the clinic and post-clinic practice patterns as positive and distinct from their previous work and relationships between gynecology and IR elsewhere. Limitations of this study included its single clinic design and potential confounder of differences in advertising pre- versus post-clinic. CONCLUSION: Creating the right practice environment may be more important for fostering inter-specialty collaboration and work satisfaction than shared mental models or procedural volumes in certain practice settings.","output":"The power of proximity: Effects of a multidisciplinary fibroid clinic on inter-specialty perceptions and practice patterns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bradykinin and kallidin are endogenous kinin peptide hormones that belong to the kallikrein-kinin system and are essential to the regulation of blood pressure, inflammation, coagulation, and pain control.

Outbreaks of EV-A71 and EV-D68 have been recently reported worldwide, sometimes related to severe clinical outcomes. Objective To describe EV genetic diversity and the clinical outcomes from paediatric patients attended at a tertiary university hospital in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) from 2014 to 2017. Study design Specimens were collected from paediatric (<17 years old) cases with suspicion of respiratory tract infection or EV infection. EV laboratory-confirmation was performed by specific real-time multiplex RT-PCR assay. Partial viral VP1 protein was sequenced for genetic characterisation by phylogenetic analyses. Results A total of 376 (7%) from 5703 cases were EV laboratory-confirmed. Phylogenetic analyses of VP1 (210; 81%) sequences distinguished up to 27 different EV types distributed within EV-A (82; 40%), EV-B (90; 42%), EV-C (5; 2%), and EV-D (33; 15%), in addition to 50 (19%) rhinoviruses. The most predominant were EV-A71 (37; 45%) and EV-D68 (32; 99%). EV-A71 was highly related to neurological complications (25/39, 63%), of which 20/39 were rhombencephalitis, and most EV-D68 (28/32, 88%) were associated with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), and exceptionally one (3%) with acute flaccid paralysis. Conclusions EV-A71 and EV-D68 were the most detected EV in respiratory specimens. EV-A71 was highly related to neurological disease and EV-D68 was often associated with LRTI.

Knockout experiments of the sets of leading hubs from the network leads to transition from hierarchical (HN) to scale free (SF) topology affecting network integration and organization. This transition, HNa?aa?SF, due to removal of significant number of the highest degree hubs, leads to relatively decrease in information processing efficiency, cost effectiveness of signal propagation, compactness, clustering of nodes and energy distributions. A systematic transition from a diassortative PCa PPI network to assortative networks after the removal of top 50 hubs then again reverting to disassortativity nature on further removal of the hubs was also observed indicating the dominance of the largest hubs in PCa network intergration. Further, functional classification of the hubs done by using within module degrees and participation coefficients for PCa network, and leading hubs knockout experiments indicated that kinless hubs serve as the basis of establishing links among constituting modules and heterogeneous nodes to maintain network stabilization. We, then, checked the essentiality of the hubs in the knockout experiment by performing Fisher's exact test on the hubs, and showed that removal of kinless hubs corresponded to maximum lethality in the network.

Materials and Methods: A total of 37 articles related to the publication of this review manuscript were mentioned. Several scientific databases such as Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (ISI), and Google Scholar have checked the key phrases of COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), photodynamic therapy, and antiviral photodynamic therapy. All 50 main studies were found, and 37 related studies were deemed suitable for this study after review. Results: Studies have shown that aPDT with different photosensitizers can be used to treat viral lung complications caused by infectious pathogens such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), SARS-CoV-2, and influenza. Recent studies have shown that aPDT-mediated Methylene Blue (MB) can help control and eradicate coronavirus. In general, more research is needed to use antiviral photodynamic therapy to control COVID-19.

The explosive growth of medical waste during the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant environmental problems. To alleviate this, environment-friendly epidemic prevention measures should be developed, used, and promoted. However, contradictions exist between governments, production enterprises, and medical institutions regarding the green transformation of anti-epidemic supplies. Consequently, this study aimed to investigate how to effectively guide the green transformation. Concerning masks, a tripartite evolutionary game model, consisting of governments, mask enterprises, and medical institutions, was established for the supervision of mask production and use, boundary conditions of evolutionary stabilization strategies and government regulations were analyzed, and a dynamic system model was used for the simulation analysis. This analysis revealed that the only tripartite evolutionary stability strategy is for governments to deregulate mask production, enterprises to increase eco-friendly mask production, and medical institutions to use these masks. From the comprehensive analysis, a few important findings are obtained. First, government regulation can promote the green transformation process of anti-epidemic supplies. Government should realize the green transformation of anti-epidemic supplies immediately in order to avoid severe reputation damage. Second, external parameter changes can significantly impact the strategy selection process of all players. Interestingly, it is further found that the cost benefit for using environmentally friendly masks has a great influence on whether green transformation can be achieved. Consequently, the government should establish a favorable marketplace for, and promote the development of, inexpensive, high-quality, and effective environmentally friendly masks in order to achieve the ultimate goal of green transformation of anti-epidemic supplies in the post-pandemic era.","output":"Green Transformation of Anti-Epidemic Supplies in the Post-Pandemic Era: An Evolutionary Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is an uncommon etiology of secondary headaches in children.

This retrospective comparative study aimed to characterize its impact on arthroplasty services in Hong Kong. METHODS: From January 1 to June 30, 2020, the patients of COVID-19 cohort underwent elective total hip or knee replacement in Hong Kong public hospitals. The cohort was compared to the control cohort during the same period in 2019. Data analysis was performed to compare the two cohorts numbers of operations, hospital admission, orthopaedic clinic attendances, and waiting time. RESULTS: A total of 33,111 patient episodes were analyzed. During the study period, the elective arthroplasty operations and hospitalizations decreased by 53 and 54%, respectively (P < 0.05). Reductions were most drastic from February to April, with surgical volume declining by 86% (P < 0.05). The primary arthroplasty operations decreased by 91% (P < 0.05), while the revision operations remained similar. Nevertheless, 14 public hospitals continued performing elective arthroplasty for patients with semi-urgent indications, including infection, progressive bone loss, prosthesis loosening, dislocation or mechanical failure of arthroplasty, and tumor. At the institution with the highest arthroplasty surgical volume, infection (28%) was the primary reason for surgery, followed by prosthesis loosening (22%) and progressive bone loss (17%). The orthopaedic clinic attendances also decreased by 20% (P < 0.05). Increases were observed in waiting time and the total number of patients on the waiting list for elective arthroplasty.

In this context, we offered telephone and video-telephonic counseling in addition to traditional face-to-face counseling in the office. Methods: Patients (n = 100) of the Cancer Counseling Center, Tbingen, were asked to complete a questionnaire to assess the acceptance of the counseling format following each counseling session (office, telephone, and video) in the period between July 2020 and February 2021. The questionnaire included the subject areas of patient characterization, assessment of therapeutic contact, therapeutic relationship, and hurdles and was used in this exploratory care study. Results: The satisfaction and acceptance of the three counseling formats (office, telephone, and video) were rated as good to very good in the three subgroups (range 1C6, office M = 1.2, telephone M = 1.3, video M = 1.4). Likewise, the therapeutic relationship achieved high ratings in terms of establishment of a therapeutic relationship in all three subgroups (office M = 5.7, telephone M = 5.0, video M = 5.0). The type of contact (office and video counseling) achieved a significant main effect on the therapeutic relationship for items such as I believe that counseling is helping me (F(2,97) = 4.80, p = 0.01) and I feel that I can rely on the counselor/therapist (F(2,97) = 3.29, p = 0.04). The hurdles were rated as minor and tolerable (office M = 1.3, telephone M = 1.3, video M = 1.4). Predictor analyses showed that there was no effect of age and gender on the acceptance of digital counseling formats in the present sample. Discussion and Conclusion: On the basis of this survey, it can be concluded that digital counseling formats were perceived by patients as a promising addition to the classic face-to-face setting. In addition, it can be stated that the digital formats (telephone and video) were not generally preferred to face-to-face counseling, but that the innovative telecounseling was accepted and perceived with great satisfaction and acceptance. Accordingly, the additional use of digital counseling formats could be an opportunity to enrich and expand the existing presence structures also after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Acceptance of Psycho-Oncological Counseling Formats in a Cancer Counseling Center during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Exploratory Care Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, a new Susceptible-Exposed-Symptomatic Infectious-Asymptomatic Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalized-Recovered-Dead (SEIDIUQHRD) deterministic compartmental model has been proposed and calibrated for describing the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Yet the real form is too complex to be mechanistically modeled due to the unknown dynamics of many influential factors. We tackle this problem by using a hypothesis-free machine-learning algorithm to estimate the transmission rate from data on non-pharmaceutical policies, and in turn forecast the confirmed cases using a mechanistic disease model. More specifically, we build a hybrid model consisting of a mechanistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) model and a gradient boosting model (GBM). To calibrate the parameters, we develop an inverse method that obtains the transmission rate inversely from the other variables in the ODE model and then feed it into the GBM to connect with the policy data. The resulting model forecasted the number of daily confirmed cases up to 35 days in the future in the USA with an averaged mean absolute percentage error of 27%.

Here, we aim to estimate the absolute and relative mortality impact of COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. METHODS: We obtained weekly mortality time series due to all causes for Mexico, and by gender, and geographic region from 2015 to 2020. We also compiled surveillance data on COVID-19 cases and deaths to assess the timing and intensity of the pandemic and assembled weekly series of the proportion of tweets about death from Mexico to assess the correlation between peoples media interaction about death and the rise in pandemic deaths. We estimated all-cause excess mortality rates and mortality rate ratio increase over baseline by fitting Serfling regression models and forecasted the total excess deaths for Mexico for the first 4 weeks of 2021 using the generalized logistic growth model. RESULTS: We estimated the all-cause excess mortality rate associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico in 2020 at 26.10 per 10,000 population, which corresponds to 333,538 excess deaths. Males had about 2-fold higher excess mortality rate (33.99) compared to females (18.53). Mexico City reported the highest excess death rate (63.54) and RR (2.09) compared to rest of the country (excess rate = 23.25, RR = 1.62). While COVID-19 deaths accounted for only 38.64% of total excess deaths in Mexico, our forecast estimate that Mexico has accumulated a total of ~ 61,610 [95% PI: 60,003, 63,216] excess deaths in the first 4 weeks of 2021. Proportion of tweets was significantly correlated with the excess mortality ( = 0.508 [95% CI: 0.245, 0.701], p-value = 0.0004). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily affected Mexico. The lab-confirmed COVID-19 deaths accounted for only 38.64% of total all cause excess deaths (333,538) in Mexico in 2020. This reflects either the effect of low testing rates in Mexico, or the surge in number of deaths due to other causes during the pandemic. A model-based forecast indicates that an average of 61,610 excess deaths have occurred in January 2021.","output":"Characterizing all-cause excess mortality patterns during COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has affected nearly every area of daily life, including romantic relationships.

Museums, like other educational institutions, have been offering distance learning programs to their audiences for more than 30 years. This scoping study examined the published literature related to distance learning programs in museums to inform future research in this field. Searches were conducted in three academic databases in addition to journal hand searches. This resulted in 954 unique citations associated with distance learning in museums. Of these, 17 articles met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Forwards and backwards searches resulted in the addition of two books. A search of the research hosted by the Center for Advancement of Informal Science Education resulted in one additional study for a total of 20 manuscripts. Upon analysis, four major themes were identified. These included benefits and barriers related to distance learning programs in museums, partnerships, and educators changing roles as they relate to distance learning programs. Each of these themes is described and areas for future research are identified. Future work should move beyond the predominately evaluative case studies and pursue larger questions about how future research might support museums as they continue to design and implement online programming. This may include exploring best practices in museum-based distance learning and how to develop effective professional development opportunities for the educators engaged in these programs.

This study seeks to describe the use of syndromic surveillance systems in Ontario and users' perceptions of the value of these systems within the context of other surveillance systems. METHODS: Ontario's 36 public health units, the provincial ministry of health and federal public health agency completed a web survey to identify traditional and syndromic surveillance systems used routinely and during the pandemic and to describe system attributes and utility in monitoring pandemic activity and informing decision-making. RESULTS: Syndromic surveillance systems are used by 20/38 (53%) organizations. For routine surveillance, laboratory, integrated Public Health Information System and school absenteeism data are the most frequently used sources. Laboratory data received the highest ratings for reliability, timeliness and accuracy (very acceptable by 92, 51 and 89%). Hospital/clinic screening data were rated as the most reliable and timely syndromic data source (50 and 43%) and ED visit data the most accurate (48%).

METHODS Sixty-seven patients underwent SILC. Of a cohort of 163 LC operated in the same time period, 67 patients were chosen for a matched pair analysis. Pairs were matched for age, gender, ASA, BMI, acuity, and previous abdominal surgery. In the SILC group, patient characteristics (gender, age, BMI, comorbidities, ASA, previous abdominal surgery, symptomatic cholecystolithiasis, cholecystitis) and perioperative data (surgeon, operation time, conversion rate and cause, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, reoperation rate, VAS at 24 h, VAS at 48 h, use of analgesics according to WHO class, and length of stay) were collected prospectively. RESULTS Follow-up in the SILC and LC group was completed with a minimum of 17 and a maximum of 26 months; data acquired were recovery time the patients needed until they were able to get back into the working process, long-term incidence of postoperative hernias, and satisfaction with cosmetic outcome. Operating time was longer for SILC (median 75 min, range 39-168 vs. 63, range 23-164, p = 0.039). There were no significant differences for SILC and LC with regard to postoperative pain measured by VAS at 24 h (median 3, range 0-8 vs. 2, range 0-8, p = 0.224), at 48 h (median 2, range 0-6 vs. 2, range 0-8, p = 0.571), use of analgesics, and length of stay (median 2 days, range 1-9 vs. 2, range 1-11, p = 0.098). There was no major complication in either group. The completion rate of SILC was 85.1% (57 of 67). Although there was a trend towards an earlier return to the working process in patients of the SILC group, this was not significant. The rate of incisional hernias was 1.9% (1/53) in the SILC and 2.1% (1/48) in the LC group indicating no significant difference. Self-assessment of satisfaction with the cosmetic outcome was not judged different by patients in both groups. CONCLUSION SILC is associated with longer operating time, but equals LC with respect to safety, postoperative pain, use of analgesics, length of stay, return to work, rate of incisional hernia, and cosmetic outcome.","output":"Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC)-a matched pair analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Highlights Fasting blood glucose < 10 mmol/L was proposed as a target of glycemic control during the first week of hospitalization in patients with preexisting diabetes.

Due to the medical importance of D. marginatus, control measures are needed for this tick species. Currently tick control approaches rely mostly on acaricide application, whereas wrong and irrational acaricide use may result in drug resistance and residue problems. Vaccination as an alternative approach for tick control has been proven to be effective towards some tick species. However, immunization against D. marginatus has not yet reached satisfactory protection. The effort of in silico based analysis could predict antigenicity and identify candidates for anti-tick vaccine development. We carried out an in silico analysis of D. marginatus glutathione S-transferases (DmGSTs) in order to identify blood-feeding induced GSTs as antigens that can be used in anti-tick vaccine development. Phylogenetic analysis, linear B-cell epitope prediction, homology modeling, and conformational B-cell epitope mapping on the GST models were performed to identify highly antigenic DmGSTs. Relative gene expressions of the seven GSTs were profiled through real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to outline GSTs up-regulated during blood feeding. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the seven GSTs belonged to four classes of GST, including one in epsilon-class, one in zeta-class, one in omega-class, and four in mu-class. Linear B-cell epitope prediction revealed mu-class GSTs share similar conserved antigenic regions. The conformational B-cell epitope mapped on the homology model of the GSTs displayed that GSTs of mu-class showed stronger antigenicity than that of other classes. RT-qPCR revealed DmGSTM1 and DmGSTM2 were positively related to blood feeding. In sum, the data suggest that DmGSTM1 and DmGSTM2 could be tested for potential anti-tick vaccine trials.

This processing step was significantly less efficient in insect cells than the analogous step in mammalian cells, even though the cleavage sites of authentic and recombinant gl were shown to be identical. The oligosaccharide linkages were mostly endoglycosidase-H-sensitive, in contrast to those of authentic gl, which has mostly endoglycosidase-H-resistant linkages and an apparent molecular weight of 130/74/55 kDa. Despite the reduced cleavage and altered glycosylation, the recombinant glycoprotein was transported and expressed on the surface of infected insect cells. These surface molecules were biologically active as demonstrated by their ability to induce cell-cell fusion. Fusion was inhibited bythree monoclonal antibodies specific for antigenic domains I and IV on gl. Domain I maps to the extracellular region of the carboxy terminal fragment glc and domain IV to the very amino terminus of the glb fragment, indicating that domains mapping in two distinct regions of gl function in cell fusion.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This test negative design consisted of adult patients who were tested or diagnosed for COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine in 2021. Variables extracted from Electronic Health Records included vaccination status, age, gender, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, body mass index, residential-level socioeconomic characteristics, past COVID-19 infection, being immunosuppressed, and health care worker status. Exposure: The primary exposure was vaccination status and was categorized into fully vaccinated with and without booster, partially vaccinated, or unvaccinated. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were infection with COVID-19 (positive test or diagnosis) and having severe COVID-19, i.e., either being hospitalized or deceased. Based on these, VE was calculated by quarter, vaccine, and patient characteristics. Results: Of 170,487 COVID-19 positive adult patients, 78,002 (45.8%) were unvaccinated, and 92,485 (54.2%) were vaccinated, among which 74,060 (80.1%) were fully vaccinated. COVID-19 positivity and severity rates were substantially higher among unvaccinated (12.1% and 1.4%, respectively) compared to fully vaccinated individuals (4.7% and 0.4%, respectively). Among 7,187 individuals with a booster, only 18 (0.3%) had a severe outcome. The covariate-adjusted VE against an infection was 62.1% (95%CI 60.3-63.8%), being highest in the Q2 of 2021 (90.9% [89.5-92.1%]), lowest in Q3 (60.1% [55.9-64.0%]), and rebounding in Q4 to 68.8% [66.3-71.1%]). Similarly, VE against severe COVID-19 overall was 73.7% (69.6-77.3%) and remained high throughout 2021: 87.4% (58.1-96.3%), 92.2% (88.3-94.8%), 74.4% (64.8-81.5%) and 83.0% (78.8-86.4%), respectively. Data on fully vaccinated individuals from Q4 indicated additional protection against infection with an additional booster dose (VE-Susceptibility: 64.0% [61.1-66.7%] vs. 87.3% [85.0-89.2%]) and severe outcomes (VE-Severity: 78.8% [73.5-83.0%] vs. 94.0% [89.5-96.6%]).

Among this group are a minority who simply do not care about the consequences of their actions. But many others fail to accurately perceive the harms that they might be causing.

In this paper, I describe seven different aspects of moral distance in the context of COVID-19, explore how they affect (lack of) motivation to obey restrictions, and suggest several ways in which such moral distance can be reduced - primarily through enhanced-contact tracing that makes it clear to individuals and the public precisely who they could be harming and how.","output":"COVID-19 conscience tracing: mapping the moral distances of coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Corona crisis measures were taken to avoid the spread of the virus, and one of the most important was to 'keep sufficient distance'. In this period cyclists were facilitated in distancing by the widening of cycle paths, or the use of car lanes. The Corona measures also affected intersection control, since one of the principles of signalizing is based on clustering of traffic. The settings of the control take into account the way cyclists tend to cluster close together at the stop line, so for optimal control, if the clustering changes, the control should be adapted as well. This paper presents measures for 'Corona-safe' intersection control for cyclists, and discusses the effect of the measures and their (dis)advantages. Further it was investigated how some municipalities used these measures and conveyed about it in the media and how these measures were received by the public. The measures can be divided in two groups: detection and timing. For the municipalities considered, the least popular measures concerned the detection methods, such as adaptations in use, or type, of push button, since the negative aspects can be large (effect on throughput and costs). More popular were changes in the timing of the control, the most conveyed measures being more frequent and longer green for cyclists. The acceptance of the measures by the public (determined via reactions on social media) is mixed, some are positive about the improved control, others negative (effect on car traffic or costs). The most common reactions are general complaints about intersection control, and about cyclists behaviour. For future use the measure 'more frequent green' is most suitable, permitted cyclists are detected to support the acceptance of the control. Also bicycle apps can be applied, since these results in more comfort and have limited negative effects.","output":"'Corona-safe' Measures for Cyclists at Intersections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health data have demonstrated disproportionate COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among racialized populations.

METHODS: We obtained and analyzed anonymized data on psychiatric admissions (n = 4550) from 12 general hospital psychiatric wards (GHPWs) in different Italian regions (catchment area = 3.71 millions of inhabitants). Using a mixed-effects Poisson regression model, we compared admission characteristics across three periods: (a) March 1-June 30, 2018 and 2019; (b) March 1-April 30, 2020 (i.e., lockdown); and (c) May 1-June 30, 2020 (i.e., post-lockdown). RESULTS: During the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a 41% reduction (IRR = 0.59; p < 0.001, CI: 0.45-0.79) in psychiatric admissions in the enrolled GHPWs with respect to the 2018 and 2019 control period. Conversely, admission rates in the post-lockdown period were similar to those observed in the control period. Notably, a consistent and significant reduction in psychiatric hospitalizations of older patients (aged >65 years) was observed in the lockdown (40%; IRR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.44-0.82) and post-lockdown (28%; IRR = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.54-0.96) periods. Long-stay admissions (>14 days) increased (63%; IRR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.32-2.02) during the lockdown and decreased by 39% thereafter (IRR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49-0.75). A significant 35% increase in patients reporting suicidal ideation was observed in the post-lockdown period, compared to the rate observed in the 2018 and 2019 control period (IRR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.01-1.79). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with changes in the number of psychiatric admissions, particularly for older patients and long-stay hospitalizations. Increased admission of patients reporting suicidal ideation in the post-lockdown period merits special attention. Further studies are required to gain insight into the observed phenomena.","output":"Consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on admissions to general hospital psychiatric wards in Italy: Reduced psychiatric hospitalizations and increased suicidality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. In December 2019, multiple cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology surged in China. In January 2020, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was the identified cause. The World Health Organization (WHO) defined the condition as \\"Coronavirus 2019 Disease\\" (COVID-19). In February, its presence was confirmed in South America and Ecuador. On March 11th, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. This condition mainly afflicts the respiratory system. However, reports of neurological manifestations in confirmed COVID-19 p atients have recently emerged. Methods. Multiple databases were reviewed, the information was extracte d and analyzed independently by 3 authors. Results. Neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 were identified. Including: myalgia, headache, altered mental status, cerebrovascular events, dizziness, hypogeusia, hyposmia, neuropathic pain, visual impairment, ataxia, seizures, Central Hypoventilation Syndrome, encephalopathy, rhabdomyolysis, Acute Hemorrhagic Necrotizing Encephalopathy, Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS), meningitis and encephalitis.Conclusion. COVID-19 is associated with neurological involvement. It is most frequently observed in cases that are severe, atypical, and with comorbidities. Health care providers and neurologists alike, must remain alert and keep high suspicion of severity when these manifestations are present.

The model is based on separate accounting for the contribution to the epidemic from two types of immune response to a viral infection - innate and adaptive immunity. Any infected person becomes asymptomatic with probability (1-p) or symptomatic with probability p. In the first case, innate immunity is sufficient to protect a person. In the second case, innate immunity is insufficient, and adaptive immunity comes into play. In the asymptomatic state, the person remains outwardly healthy, mobile and can spread the infection. In the symptomatic state, the person becomes ill, isolated and cannot spread the infection. We assume that the contribution to the epidemic process from asymptomatic carriers is dominant in comparison with the contribution from the usual incubation period in the symptomatic state. The key parameters of the model are the virus lifetime T in the asymptomatic state and the spread rate ss. At moderate ssT values, the model describes a long, slowly decreasing morbidity plateau, which transforms into wave-like solution at ssT. In the case of ssT, which corresponds to a stable non-pathogenic strain, the model solution is limited to single wave only. We believe that the spread of such a non-pathogenic strain and its subsequent dominance is responsible for ending the epidemic after the single wave of incidence in China. A way to stop the epidemic in the rest of the world may consist in displacing the circulating pathogenic virus with its stable non-pathogenic strain.","output":"Why did the COVID-19 epidemic stop in China and does not stop in the rest of the world?

Here, we showed TBL1X expression was significantly higher in metastatic NPC tissues compared to non-metastatic tissues and significantly correlated with TNM stage and metastasis of NPC patients. In addition, NPC patients with high TBL1X expression had a poor prognosis. TBL1X interacted with TCF4 to trans-activate Flot2 expression.

They urgently needed tools to help them to explore what will work best in their specific circumstances of epidemic size and spread, and feasible intervention scenarios. OBJECTIVE: We sought to rapidly develop a flexible, freely available simulation model for use by modelers and researchers to allow investigation of how various public health interventions implemented at various time points might change the shape of the COVID-19 epidemic curve. METHODS: COVOID (COVID-19 Open-Source Infection Dynamics) is a stochastic individual contact model (ICM), which extends the ICMs provided by the open-source EpiModel package for the R statistical computing environment. To demonstrate its use and inform urgent decisions on March 30, 2020, we modeled similar intervention scenarios to those reported by other investigators using various model types, as well as novel scenarios. The scenarios involved isolation of cases, moderate social distancing, and stricter population lockdowns enacted over varying time periods in a hypothetical population of 100,000 people. On April 30, 2020, we simulated the epidemic curve for the three contiguous local areas (population 287,344) in eastern Sydney, Australia that recorded 5.3% of Australian cases of COVID-19 through to April 30, 2020, under five different intervention scenarios and compared the modeled predictions with the observed epidemic curve for these areas. RESULTS: COVOID allocates each member of a population to one of seven compartments. The number of times individuals in the various compartments interact with each other and their probability of transmitting infection at each interaction can be varied to simulate the effects of interventions. Using COVOID on March 30, 2020, we were able to replicate the epidemic response patterns to specific social distancing intervention scenarios reported by others. The simulated curve for three local areas of Sydney from March 1 to April 30, 2020, was similar to the observed epidemic curve in terms of peak numbers of cases, total numbers of cases, and duration under a scenario representing the public health measures that were actually enacted, including case isolation and ramp-up of testing and social distancing measures. CONCLUSIONS: COVOID allows rapid modeling of many potential intervention scenarios, can be tailored to diverse settings, and requires only standard computing infrastructure. It replicates the epidemic curves produced by other models that require highly detailed population-level data, and its predicted epidemic curve, using parameters simulating the public health measures that were enacted, was similar in form to that actually observed in Sydney, Australia.

The compounds were efficiently synthesized in one-pot employing a cascade of GroebkeCBlackburnCBienaym and aza-Michael addition reactions. Phenotypic screening of the pilot library against various bacterial species including methicillin-sensitive and MRSA strains, has identified potent chemotypes with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 3.125C6.25 g/ml.

They were also able to kill MRSA persister cells which are tolerant to most available medications. Microscopic analysis using fluorescence microscope and atomic force microscope indicate that these compounds lead to disruption of bacterial cell envelopes. Most notably, bacterial resistance toward these compounds was not observed after 20 serial passages in stark contrast to the significant resistance developed rapidly upon exposure to a clinically relevant antibiotic. Furthermore, the compounds did not induce significant hemolysis to human red blood cells. In vivo safety studies revealed a high safety profile of these motifs.

METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of pregnancy-related records from a tertiary center over a period of ten years. Data on age, gravidity, parity, EP risk, amenorrhea duration, abdominal pain presence and location, -human chorionic gonadotropin (-HCG) level, ultrasound findings, therapeutic intervention, exact EP implantation site and length of hospital stay (LOS) were obtained from the database. The LOS was used as a proxy for morbidity and was tested for an association with all variables. All statistical analyses were conducted with Stata? (ver. 16.1, Texas, USA). RESULTS: The incidence of EP in a cohort of 30,247 pregnancies over a ten-year period was 1.05%. Patients presented with lower abdominal pain in 87.9% of cases, and the likelihood of experiencing pain was tenfold higher if fluid was detectable in the pouch of Douglas. Only 5.1% of patients had a detectable embryonic heartbeat, and 18.15% had one or more risk factors for EP. While most EPs were tubal, 2% were ovarian. The LOS was 1.9 days, and laparoscopic intervention was the main management procedure.

Although the injury is relatively small, it is still a traumatic operation and also increases the recovery speed of patients. This paper mainly explores the intervention effect of rapid rehabilitation after gynecological laparoscopic surgery by means of WeChat group guidance based on the information adoption model and UTAUT model. Gynecological patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery and met the inclusion and exclusion conditions in a provincial maternal and child health hospital were selected as the research objects. The WeChat intervention group was compared with the nonintervention group, and the oral description score (VRS), comfort score (BCS), and 40-item recovery quality rating scale (QoR-40) were used as the scoring criteria. The results showed that the postoperative VRS and BCS scores in the WeChat intervention group were significantly lower than those in the nonintervention group. The total score of QoR-40 in both groups decreased compared with that before operation, reached the lowest on the first day after operation, and began to rise from the second day. This result is consistent with the patient's postoperative recovery process.

To improve the knowledge regarding relevant, efficient and effective COVID-19 measures in health policy, this paper applies a multi-criteria evaluation approach with population, health care, and economic datasets from 19 countries within the OECD. The comparative investigation was based on a Data Envelopment Analysis approach as an efficiency measurement method. Results indicate that on the one hand, factors like population size, population density, and country development stage, did not play a major role in successful pandemic management. On the other hand, pre-pandemic healthcare system policies were decisive. Healthcare systems with a primary care orientation and a high proportion of primary care doctors compared to specialists were found to be more efficient than systems with a medium level of resources that were partly financed through public funding and characterized by a high level of access regulation. Roughly two weeks after the introduction of ad hoc measures, e.g., lockdowns and quarantine policies, we did not observe a direct impact on country-level healthcare efficiency, while delayed lockdowns led to significantly lower efficiency levels during the first COVID-19 wave in 2020. From an economic perspective, strategies without general lockdowns were identified as a more efficient strategy than the full lockdown strategy. Additionally, governmental support of short-term work is promising.

Although the resulting right heart failure symptoms are well-known, the associated thrombogenic potential is under-recognized. CASE SUMMARY : A 44-year-old woman with bioprosthetic tricuspid valve (TV) replacement in 2001 was referred for urgent consultation due to acute worsening of dyspnoea and severe swelling and pain in her left arm and neck. She was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation 6 months before the presentation and was found to have right atrial (RA) thrombus with pulmonary embolism and extensive retrograde venous extension 1 month prior. Review of studies done at her local institution revealed 10 mmHg mean gradient (MG) across the bioprosthetic TV that was only reported as mildCmoderate TS. Echocardiography done at our instruction confirmed suspicion of severe TS with calcified immobile leaflets. Computed tomography showed persistent RA thrombus and therefore surgical replacement of the TV was undertaken. Subsequently, patients dyspnoea rapidly improved. DISCUSSION : Progressive dyspnoea and symptoms of right heart failure in a patient with a history of bioprosthetic TV replacement should be investigated for prosthetic valve dysfunction. Due to its rarity, TS diagnosis can be overlooked on routine echocardiography. In our patient, despite a measured MG of 10 mmHg, the presence of critical TS was not initially recognized. As TS is associated with increased thrombogenic potential and given the rare occurrence of in situ RA thrombosis, physicians must have a high index of suspicion for TS in the appropriate clinical context.","output":"Severe tricuspid bioprosthetic valve stenosis as an unusual cause of pulmonary embolism: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identifying the animal reservoirs from which zoonotic viruses will likely emerge is central to understanding the determinants of disease emergence.

We document a marked change in the composition of virus data sets, with the increased sampling and metagenomic sequencing of seemingly healthy wildlife reducing the proportion of viruses that are likely zoonotic as well as those associated with overt disease. We also show that the available data are incomplete, with significantly more viruses described in the literature than ratified by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Finally, we document unequal study effort toward those viruses perceived as important for human and animal health, inflating the proportion of seemingly zoonotic viruses. Together, these shortcomings suggest that attempts to assess zoonotic risk using available virological data are likely to be inaccurate and largely identify those host taxa that have been studied most extensively.

Consequences in Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programmes and mortality of congenital heart patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) is still to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To study the COVID-19 pandemic implications in Brazilian Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programmes. METHODS: We conducted a national online survey covering all states that perform Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery from 10 November to 22 November, 2020, using a Google forms questionnaire. We formulated questions related to impact on surgical volume, case-mix, and mortality. Then we asked about short-term post-operative COVID-19 infection and outcomes. RESULTS: We received responses from 46 centres representing all states where there were a Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programme and all high-volume centres across the country. All but one centre experienced a significant decrease in surgical volume, and 23.9% of the responders revealed less than one-quarter of volume decrement. On the other hand, in over 70% of the centres, there was a significant surgical volume reduction. In addition to this, there was a shift in case-mix in 41 centres (89.1%) towards more complex cases. More than one-third of the responders revealed increased mortality in 2020 compared to previous years, and 43.5% of the programmes (20 centres) had at least one patient contaminated by SARS-Cov-2, accounting for 48 patients. Mortality in post-operative infected patients was 45.8% (22 patients).

METHODS This was a prospective clinical evaluation to determine the tolerability and effectiveness of the CarbonCool cooling system - a half-body cooling vest - in participants undergoing a HAZMAT decontamination recertification. Physiological measurements (heart rate [HR], weight, temperature, and blood pressure) and participant feedback were obtained. The main outcome of interest was participants' tolerability of the cooling vest.

Observational studies so far have lacked rigorous ascertainment adjustment and international generalisability. We aimed to determine whether use of ACEIs or ARBs is associated with an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. METHODS: In this international, open science, cohort analysis, we used electronic health records from Spain (Information Systems for Research in Primary Care [SIDIAP]) and the USA (Columbia University Irving Medical Center data warehouse [CUIMC] and Department of Veterans Affairs Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership [VA-OMOP]) to identify patients aged 18 years or older with at least one prescription for ACEIs and ARBs (target cohort) or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics (THZs; comparator cohort) between Nov 1, 2019, and Jan 31, 2020. Users were defined separately as receiving either monotherapy with these four drug classes, or monotherapy or combination therapy (combination use) with other antihypertensive medications. We assessed four outcomes: COVID-19 diagnosis; hospital admission with COVID-19; hospital admission with pneumonia; and hospital admission with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, or sepsis. We built large-scale propensity score methods derived through a data-driven approach and negative control experiments across ten pairwise comparisons, with results meta-analysed to generate 1280 study effects. For each study effect, we did negative control outcome experiments using a possible 123 controls identified through a data-rich algorithm. This process used a set of predefined baseline patient characteristics to provide the most accurate prediction of treatment and balance among patient cohorts across characteristics. The study is registered with the EU Post-Authorisation Studies register, EUPAS35296. FINDINGS: Among 1 355 349 antihypertensive users (363 785 ACEI or ARB monotherapy users, 248 915 CCB or THZ monotherapy users, 711 799 ACEI or ARB combination users, and 473 076 CCB or THZ combination users) included in analyses, no association was observed between COVID-19 diagnosis and exposure to ACEI or ARB monotherapy versus CCB or THZ monotherapy (calibrated hazard ratio [HR] 098, 95% CI 084C114) or combination use exposure (101, 090C115). ACEIs alone similarly showed no relative risk difference when compared with CCB or THZ monotherapy (HR 091, 95% CI 068C121; with heterogeneity of >40%) or combination use (095, 083C107). Directly comparing ACEIs with ARBs demonstrated a moderately lower risk with ACEIs, which was significant with combination use (HR 088, 95% CI 079C099) and non-significant for monotherapy (085, 069C105). We observed no significant difference between drug classes for risk of hospital admission with COVID-19, hospital admission with pneumonia, or hospital admission with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, or sepsis across all comparisons. INTERPRETATION: No clinically significant increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or hospital admission-related outcomes associated with ACEI or ARB use was observed, suggesting users should not discontinue or change their treatment to decrease their risk of COVID-19.

We use newly collected data on BLM protests and anonymized cell phone data from SafeGraph, Inc. to estimate the impacts of BLM protests on (i) stay-at-home behavior, and (ii) foot-traffic to restaurants/bars, retail establishments, and business service locations. Event-study analyses provide strong evidence that net stay-at-home behavior increased following protest onset, consistent with the hypothesis that non-protesters shifted their activity in response to the perceived heightened risk of contagion and protest-related violence. Moreover, we find that the types of activities that were averted by BLM protests were potentially riskier for disease spread than outdoor civil rights protests: restaurant and bar-going and retail shopping. These risk-avoiding responses to protests, coupled with mask-wearing by protesters, explain why BLM protests did not reignite community-level COVID-19 growth. Together, our findings highlight the pitfalls of ignoring general equilibrium effects in assessing the net economic impacts of civil rights protests.","output":"Black Lives Matter Protests and Risk Avoidance: The Case of Civil Unrest During a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Although hysterectomy is one of the most frequently performed gynaecological surgeries, there is a dearth of evidence on perioperative care. The aim of the current study was to identify sociodemographic, surgical-related and work-related predictors of recovery following different approaches of hysterectomy. METHODS Eligible patients for this retrospective cohort study were women who underwent vaginal, abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomy for both benign and malignant gynaecological disease in 2014 in Mxima Medical Centre in the Netherlands. The main outcome measure was full return to work (RTW). Data were collected using a patient survey. Potential prognostic factors for time to RTW were examined in univariate Cox regression analyses. The strongest prognostic factors were combined in a multivariable model. RESULTS In total 83 women were included. Median time to full return to work was 8 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 6-12). The multivariable analysis showed that higher age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.053, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.012-1.095) and same day removal of indwelling catheter (HR 0.122, 95% CI 0.028-0.539) were predictors of shorter duration until full RTW after hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS This study provided insight in the predictors of recovery after hysterectomy. By identifying patient specific factors, pre-operative counselling can be individualized, changes can be made in perioperative care and effective interventions can be designed to target those factors.","output":"Predictive factors of return to work after hysterectomy: a retrospective study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective.

Random surveillance testing demonstrated a prevalence among asymptomatic students of 0.4% throughout the term. There were two surges in cases that were contained by enhanced mitigation and communication combined with targeted testing. Cumulative cases totaled 445 for the term, most resulting from unsafe undergraduate student behavior and among students living off-campus.

DESIGN: the study introduces a SEIR compartmental model, taking into account the region-specific fraction of undetected cases, the effects of mobility restrictions, and the personal protective measures adopted, such as wearing a mask and washing hands frequently. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the model is experimentally validated with data of all the Italian regions, some European countries, and the US. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the accuracy of the model results is measured through the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Lewis criteria; fitting parameters are in good agreement with previous literature. RESULTS: the epidemic curves for different countries and the amount of undetected and asymptomatic cases are estimated, which are likely to represent the main source of infections in the near future.

Understanding the substantial differences observed in the trajectory of the disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is of critical importance at the moment. Numerous factors have been considered to explain the fact that symptoms vary highly among different people and the infection transmission rate varies among local populations. Virus replication within the host cell and the development of an immune response to virus antigens in the body are two interdependent processes, which have aftereffects and depend on the preexisting states of the cell and virus populations. Different scenarios with the same input parameters are necessary to consider for modeling the properties of the states. The efficiency of the immune response is the most important factor, including the time it takes to develop defense responses from three levels of the immune system, which is a complex system of the body. A computational description of infection scenarios was proposed on the basis of a delay differential equation with two values of the time lag. In the new model, transitions between phases of infectious disease depend on the initial virus dose and the delayed immune response to infection. A variation in the dose of the virus and response time can lead to a transition from an acute phase of the disease with overt symptoms to a chronic phase or fatal outcome. Asymptomatic transmission of viral infection was calculated and described in the model as a situation where the virus is rapidly and efficiently suppressed after a short replication phase, while still persisting in the body in minor amounts. An analysis of the model behavior is consistent with the theory that the initial number of virions can affect the quality of the immune response. The reasons that high individual differences are observed in the trajectory of COVID-19 disease and the formation of types of the immune response to coronavirus are still poorly understood.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to explore parents' experiences with adolescents' participation in mental health treatment and how parents perceive being involved in decision-making processes. DESIGN This was a qualitative study with a phenomenological, inductive design. Content analysis of data from qualitative interviews was performed. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS This study took place in a Norwegian public healthcare setting. Twelve parents of adolescents who received treatment for severe mental illness participated. RESULTS Four themes were identified: (1) self-determined treatment, but within limits; (2) the essential roles of parents; (3) the need for information and support; and (4) the fight for individualized treatment and service coordination. CONCLUSION User participation is vital in adolescent mental healthcare and parents play essential roles regarding the shared decision-making process. However, user participation and shared decision-making pose several dilemmas. Parental involvement in treatment decisions may be necessary when adolescents are mentally ill, but could simultaneously hinder those adolescents' empowerment and recovery. Cooperation among parents, adolescents and healthcare professionals can improve treatment engagement and adherence, but may be challenged by divergent interests.

Containment assumptions of the infection forecasting models depend on assumed effects of policies and self-regulating behavior. In the commons dilemma of the pandemic, the perceived low risksof unregulated marginal choices do not reflect the full social cost, implying non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to reduce mortality can enhance social welfare. As more economic activity renews with liftings of restrictive NPI (RNPI), a critical question concerns the ability of milder NPI (MNPI) and voluntary precautions to mitigate the risk of greater infections and deaths while also limiting the pandemics economic damage and its social costs. Ineffective NPI could lead to continued COVID-19 waves and new types of crises, worsened expectations and delayed economic recoveries. From the central range of surveyed estimates of transmission and alternative herd-immunity-threshold estimates, a worst-casevirus guidepost suggests eventual deaths of around 25 to 41 million worldwide and 1.1 to 1.7 million in the U.S. needed to reach herd immunity with no vaccine or treatment. The most optimistic study surveyed (theoretical model from a non-reviewed preprint study) combined with the low end of the range of the estimated mortality rate suggests 6 to 9 million deaths worldwide and 250 to 370 thousand in the U.S. to reach herd immunity. Successes in the mix of NPI, treatments, and vaccine can limit the eventual global death toll of the virus. Improved estimation models for forecasting and decision making may assist in better targeting the local timings and mix of NPI. Diagnostic tests for the virus have been largely limited to symptomatic cases, causing possible sample selection bias.

DESIGN: Observational study of annual survey data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) All Employee Survey (AES) for 2013C2017. AES response rate ranged from 56 to 60% during the study period. Independent and dependent variables were measured from separate random samples. In total, 8,456 individual-level responses among PCPs at 110 VHA practice sites were aggregated at the facility level by reporting year. We used the semi-automated LASSO procedure to identify workplace climate measures that were more influential in predicting burnout and assessed relative importance using the Shapely value decomposition. PARTICIPANTS: VHA employees that self-identify as PCPs. MAIN MEASURES: Dependent variables included two dichotomous measures of burnout: emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Independent measures included 30 survey measures related to dimensions of workplace climate (e.g., workload, leadership, satisfaction). RESULTS: We identified seven influential workplace climate predictors of emotional exhaustion and nine predictors of depersonalization. With few exceptions, higher agreement/satisfaction scores for predictors were associated with a lower likelihood of burnout. The majority of explained variation in emotional exhaustion was attributable to perceptions of workload (32.6%), organization satisfaction (28.2%), and organization support (19.4%). The majority of explained variation in depersonalization was attributable to workload (25.3%), organization satisfaction (22.9%), and connection to VHA mission (20.7%). CONCLUSION: Identifying the relative importance of workplace climate is important for the allocation of health organization resources to mitigate and prevent burnout within the PCP workplace. In a context of limited resources, efforts to reduce perceived workload and improve organization satisfaction may represent the biggest leverage points for health organizations to address physician burnout.

In 2019 and 2020, COVID-19 mitigation was the only issue the world raised questions about; for example, the KSA and the rest of the world are working diligently to meet COVID-19 mitigation targets. To assess policy supervision in terms of the ability to achieve COVID-19 targets, this survey examines the operators necessary to achieve the SDGs in regard to improving COVID-19 mitigation and increasing economic growth. In particular, we examine COVID-19 mitigation under the setting of an N-shaped environmental Kuznets curve (N-shaped EKC) in the KSA. To identify the COVID-19 shock in the KSA, the effects of oil price and oil rent on CO2 emissions are examined. The results of the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and non-autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) bound testing approach indicate that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the inverted N-shaped EKC hypothesis is validated in the long term. Empirically, we find that oil price strengthens the relationship of level, quadratic and cubic of economic growth and environmental quality while oil rent weakens this relationship. Additionally, the long-term incidences of positive shocks on oil price in the presence of COVID-19 outbreak are not similar to the negative shock to CO2 emissions, implying the existence of asymmetric impacts on carbon dioxide emissions in long-term forms. Our research implies that an oil price shock could be judicious for macro guidance of the economy in the KSA. Our findings are helpful for policymakers and investors in terms of their settlement planning because they can be used to evaluate prospective courses of economic profitability under the COVID-19 shock.","output":"Investigation of the N-shaped environmental Kuznets curve for COVID-19 mitigation in the KSA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Since the onset of a dengue vaccine controversy in late 2017, vaccine confidence has plummeted in the Philippines, leading to measles and polio outbreaks in early 2019. This protocol outlines a human-centered design (HCD) approach to co-create and test an intervention that addresses vaccine hesitancy (VH) via narrative and empathy with and among families and healthcare workers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Salubong is a Filipino term that means to welcome someone back into ones life, reinforcing notions of family ties and friendships. We apply this sentiment to vaccines. Following the phases of HCD, guided by a theoretical framework, and drawing from locally held understandings of faith and acceptance, we will conduct in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) in rural and urban Filipino communities that witnessed dramatic increases in measles cases in recent years. During qualitative engagements with caretakers, providers, and policymakers, we will collect narratives about family and community perceptions of childhood vaccinations, public health systems and opportunities to restore faith. IDIs and FGDs will continuously inform the development of (and delivery mechanisms for) story-based interventions. Once developed, we will test our co-created interventions among 800 caretakers and administer a VH questionnaire prior to and immediately following the intervention encounter. We will use the feedback gained through the survey and Kano-style questionnaires to further refine the intervention. Considering the data collection challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have developed workarounds to conduct data collection primarily online. We will use systematic online debriefings to facilitate comprehensive participation of the full research team.

METHODS: From January 23 to April 30, 2020, we performed ATAAD repair for 33 patients, including three with pregnancy-related TAADs. Confirmation of COVID-19 depended on the results of two nucleic acid tests and pulmonary computed tomography scan. Based on testing results and hemodynamic stability, patients were triaged to an isolated intensive care unit or negative pressure operating room for emergency surgery. RESULTS: Mean age 50.2  13.3 years and 20 were male (60.1%) and 8 patients were febrile (>37.3C; 24.2%) and 17 were lymphopenic (51.5%). No patient was excluded from COVID-19 infection preoperatively. Extensive aortic repair with total arch replacement (TAR) was performed in 24 (72.7%), and limited proximal repair in 9 patients (27.3%). Cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times averaged 177  34 and 88  20 min for TAR, and 150  30 and 83  18 min for hemiarch, respectively. The mean operation time was 410  68.3 min. Operative mortality was 6.1% (2/33). Complications included reintubation in four (12.1%), acute kidney failure in two (6.1%), and cerebral infarction in one (3.0%). No paraplegia nor re-exploration for bleeding occurred. COVID-19 was excluded in 100% eventually. No nosocomial infection occurred. Nor did any patient/surgical staff develop fever or test positive during the study period.

Plasma samples were collected at enrollment before any FVIII infusion (T0) and at inhibitor development (INB +/T1) or up to 35 exposure days without inhibitors (INB -/T1). Anti-FVIII antibodies (immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin G [IgG] 1, IgG3, and IgG4), chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10), and cytokines (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, interferon-?3, tumor necrosis factor, and IL-17) were assessed. A total of 71 children with severe HA were included, of whom 28 (39.4%) developed inhibitors. Plasma levels of anti-FVIII IgG4, IL-6, and CXCL8 were higher at INB +/T1 when compared with INB -/T1. This group presented a mixed cytokine profile and higher plasma levels of CXCL9 and CXL10 when compared with INB +/T1.

Compounds previously characterized from Melissa officinalis were queried against main protease of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using computational approach. RESULTS: Melitric acid A and salvanolic acid A had higher affinity than lopinavir and ivermectin using both AutodockVina and XP docking algorithms. The computational approach was employed in the generation of QSAR model using automated QSAR, and in the docking of ligands from Melissa officinalis with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. The best model obtained was KPLS_Radial_28 (R2 = 0.8548 and Q2=0.6474, and was used in predicting the bioactivity of the lead compounds. Molecular mechanics based MM-GBSA confirmed salvanolic acid A as the compound with the highest free energy and predicted bioactivity of 4.777; it interacted with His-41 of the catalytic dyad (Cys145-His41) of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), as this may hinder the cutting of inactive viral protein into active ones capable of replication.

There is no consensus regarding the optimum duration of antibiotics for culture-proven neonatal sepsis. Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing shorter versus longer courses of antibiotics provide low-quality evidence with serious risk of bias. We hypothesized that among neonates with uncomplicated culture-proven sepsis, antibiotic duration of 7 days is not inferior to 14 days. METHODS: This is a multi-centric, parallel-group, stratified, block-randomized, active-controlled, non-inferiority trial with outcome assessment blinded. Stratification is by center and birth weight. Neonates weighing 1000 g at birth, with blood-culture-proven sepsis (barring Staphylococcus aureus and fungi), without conditions warranting > 14 days antibiotics, and who clinically remit, are enrolled in the RCT on day 7 of administration of sensitive antibiotics. They are randomly allocated to no further antibiotics (intervention arm: total 7 days) or 7 more days of the same antibiotics (control arm: total 14 days). Allocation is concealed by opaque, sealed envelopes. The primary outcome is definite or probable relapse within 21 days after antibiotic completion. Secondary outcomes include definite and probable relapses at various timepoints until day 35 post-randomization, secondary infections, and adverse events. The neonatologist adjudicating probable relapses and lab personnel are blinded. Three hundred fifty subjects will be recruited in each arm, assuming a non-inferiority margin of 7%, one-sided alpha error 5%, and power of 90%. Analysis will be per protocol and by intention-to-treat. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board monitors adverse events and will perform one interim analysis when 50% of expected primary outcomes have occurred or 50% of subjects have completed follow-up, whichever is earlier. OBrien-Fleming criteria will be used to stop for mid-term benefit and Pococks to stop for mid-term harm. A priori subgroup analyses are planned by birth weight categories, gram-stain status of pathogens, and radiological pneumonia. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide evidence to guide practice regarding optimum duration of antibiotics for culture-proven neonatal bacterial sepsis. If a 7-day regime is proved to be non-inferior to a 14-day regime, it is likely to reduce hospital stay, costs, adverse effects of drugs, and nosocomial infections.

In an online study (N = 301), we manipulated the target of COVID-19 restrictions as impacting self or community. We hypothesized that (a) greater pandemic-related financial stress would predict greater reactance, (b) the self-focused restriction condition would elicit greater reactance than the community-focused restriction condition, (c) reactance would be greatest for financially-stressed individuals in the self-focused condition, and (d) greater reactance would predict lower adherence to social distancing guidelines. Independent of political orientation and sense of community, greater financial stress predicted greater reactance only in the self-focused condition; the community-focused condition attenuated this association. Additionally, greater reactance was associated with lower social distancing behavior. These findings suggest that economic hardship exacerbates negative responses to continued personal freedom loss.

METHODS: A set of questionnaire assessing coping patterns, coping flexibility, and depressive symptoms were administered to 428 students (234 men and 194 women). RESULTS: A total of 266 participants both completed the entire set of questionnaires and reported a frequency of two or more stressful life events (the criterion needed to calculate variance in perceived controllability). Findings showed that higher levels of depressive symptoms were significantly associated with higher levels of both event frequency (r = .368, p < .001) and event impact (r = .245, p < .001) and lower levels of perceived controllability (r = -.261, p < .001), coping effectiveness (r = -.375, p < .001), and ratio of strategy to situation fit (r = -.108, p < .05). Depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with cognitive flexibility (variance of perceived controllability; r = .031, p = .527), Gender was not a significant moderator of any of the reported associations. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that Chinese university students with depressive symptoms reported experiencing a greater number of negative events than did non-depressed university students. In addition, undergraduates with depressive symptoms were more likely than other undergraduates to utilize maladaptive coping methods. Such findings highlight the potential importance of interventions aimed at helping undergraduate students with a lower coping flexibility develop skills to cope with stressful life events.","output":"Coping flexibility in college students with depressive symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: RDW has been analyzed in recent decades as a poor prognostic factor, associated with an increased risk of mortality from all causes: heart disease, lung disease, sepsis, influenza, cancer, complications associated with heart failure, coronary disease, viral hepatitis, COPD, development of DM2, stroke and anemia, which makes it a nonspecific marker of disease with the potential to provide a stratified quantification of risk in a new disease. Objectives: To determine if laboratory tests predict mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia upon admission to hospital. Secondary outcome: evaluate if any laboratory parameter predicts longer hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Case control retrospective study of COVID-19 pneumonia patients, admitted to the Peruvian Air Force Hospital from April 6th to June 27th, 2020.

Here, we describe a feasibility study to assess active HCV infection by screening Phetchabun residents ages 35 to 69 years for anti-HCV antibodies by using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) at the point of care. Positive anti-HCV results were further evaluated for active infection using qualitative HCV RNA assay, followed by quantitative HCV viral load determination in a subset of samples. Currently, we have identified 6.2% (10,621/170,163) anti-HCV positive individuals, of whom 74.9% (3,930/5,246) demonstrated detectable viral RNA. Quantitative test found that 97.5% (1,001/1,027) had HCV viral load >=5,000 IU/mL. Thus, primary screening with anti-HCV RDT followed by qualitative HCV RNA evaluation could identify active and chronic HCV infection in almost all individuals with a viral load >=5,000 IU/mL, which is the current threshold for the National Health Security Office treatment in Thailand.

Carboxylic acid functionalized polysulfone (PSFNA) was synthesized by modifying polysulfone (PSF) with 6-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (HNA). A series of polymer blend UF membranes were fabricated by adding different amounts of PSFNA into polyethersulfone (PES) to form a homogeneous casting solution. The influences of PSFNA on the morphology, thermal stability, hydrophilicity, filtration performance and antifouling properties of the blend membranes were investigated. The results indicated that by adding PSFNA into PES membranes, the finger-like pores in the membranes became larger, and the porosity and surface hydrophilicity of the membranes were improved. Compared with the pristine PES membrane, PES/PSFNA membranes demonstrated improved filtration performance, resulting in both increased water flux and higher bovine serum albumin (BSA) rejection. At a feed pressure of 0.1 MPa, the PES/PSFNA membrane with 4.0 wt% PSFNA had a pure water flux of 478 L m-2 h-1, which was 1.7 times higher compared with the PES membrane (287 L m-2 h-1).

Using panel data of A-share listed manufacturing companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2012 to 2019, combined with the Xtfrontier model and trans-log production function, we measure the index of the bias of technical change of the manufacturing industry in China. Furthermore, we adopt a fixed effects model to test the impact of an increase of investment in automated machines on the bias of technical change. We also use an intermediary effect model to examine the intermediate mechanism from the perspectives of capital and skill matching. The results show that technical change in the manufacturing industry is biased toward automated machine capital. An incremental increase in RAMOC leads to technical change in the manufacturing industry becoming biased toward automated machine capital, wherein the intermediary mechanism is the labor structure effect. Based on industrial linkage, the investment in automated machines in the upstream (downstream) manufacturing industry increases, the technical change of the downstream (upstream) manufacturing industry is biased toward automated machine capital, and the forward linkage effect is greater than the backward linkage effect. This research enhances understanding of (1) the direction and characteristics of technical change in China, (2) how to improve the output efficiency of automated machines, (3) differences in factor revenue distribution, and (4) how new growth points in the economy can be cultivated.

Despite these numbers have been relatively stable in recent years, tuberculosis is still considered one of the top 10 deadliest diseases worldwide. Over the years, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has developed a form of resistance to first-line tuberculosis treatments, specifically to isoniazid, leading to multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. In this context, the EU and Indian DBT funded project STriTuVaDIn Silico Trial for Tuberculosis Vaccine Developmentis supporting the identification of new interventional strategies against tuberculosis thanks to the use of Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS), a computational framework capable of predicting the immunity induced by specific drugs such as therapeutic vaccines and antibiotics. RESULTS: Here, we present how UISS accurately simulates tuberculosis dynamics and its interaction within the immune system, and how it predicts the efficacy of the combined action of isoniazid and RUTI vaccine in a specific digital population cohort. Specifically, we simulated two groups of 100 digital patients. The first group was treated with isoniazid only, while the second one was treated with the combination of RUTI vaccine and isoniazid, according to the dosage strategy described in the clinical trial design. UISS-TB shows to be in good agreement with clinical trial results suggesting that RUTI vaccine may favor a partial recover of infected lung tissue. CONCLUSIONS: In silico trials innovations represent a powerful pipeline for the prediction of the effects of specific therapeutic strategies and related clinical outcomes.

In 2020, the authors followed Kern's 6-step approach to curricular development to create and evaluate a novel COVID-19 curriculum for medical students at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine and evaluate its learning outcomes. The primary goal of the curriculum was to provide third- and fourth-year medical students an opportunity for workplace learning in the absence of clinical clerkships, specifically for students to develop clerkship-level milestones in the competency domains of practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and systems-based practice. The curriculum was designed to match students with faculty-mentored projects occurring primarily in virtual formats. A total of 126 students enrolled in the curriculum and completed a survey about their learning outcomes (100% response rate). Of 35 possible clerkship-level milestones, there were 12 milestones for which over half of students reported development, in competency domains including practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and interpersonal and communication skills. Thematic analysis of students' qualitative survey responses demonstrated 2 central motivations for participating in the curriculum: identity as physicians-in-training, and patient engagement. Six central learning areas were developed during the curriculum: interprofessional teamwork, community resources, technology in medicine, skill-building, quality improvement, and specialty-specific learning. This analysis demonstrates that students can develop competencies and achieve rich workplace learning through project-based experiential learning, even in virtual clinical workplaces. Furthermore, knowledge of community resources, technology in medicine, and quality improvement were developed through the curriculum more readily than in traditional clerkships, and could be considered as integral learning objectives in future curricular design.","output":"Lessons From Learners: Adapting Medical Student Education During and Post-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic severely affected many aspects of human life.

All outcomes displayed good to excellent intra- and inter-reliability with intra-class correlation coefficients ranging from 0.836 to 0.997. The majority of people had a mask (60.8%) but 22.1% of them wore it improperly, 45.4% were not physical distancing, and 27.6% were simultaneously mask and physical distancing non-compliant. Transmission behaviors varied by demographics with white, obese males least likely to be mask-compliant and white, obese females least likely to physical distance. Certain environments (e.g., crosswalks) were identified as hot spots where higher rates of adverse transmission behaviors occurred. This study introduces a reliable method for obtaining objective data on COVID-19 transmission behaviors and related factors which may be useful for agent-based modeling and policy formation.","output":"A Direct Observation Video Method for Describing COVID-19 Transmission Factors on a Micro-Geographical Scale: Viral Transmission (VT)-Scan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Possibly, and due to poor eating habits and unhealthy lifestyle, many viruses are transmitted to human people. Such is the case, of the novel coronavirus SARS-Cov-2, which has expanded of exponential way, practically, to whole world population. For this reason, the enhancement of real microscopic images of this coronavirus is of great importance. Of this way, one can highlight the S-spikes and visualizing those areas that show a high density, which are related to active zones of viral germination and major spread of the virus. The SARS-Cov-2 images were captured from nasopharyngeal samples of Cuban symptomatic individuals (RT-PCR positives for SARS-CoV-2) and processed via scanning electron microscopy. However, many times these microscopic images present some blurring problems, and the S-spikes do not look well defined. Therefore, the aim of this work is to propose new computational methods to carry out enhancement and segmentation of SARS-Cov-2 high-resolution microscopic images. The proposed strategy obtained very satisfactory results, and we validated its performance, together with specialist physicians, on a set of 1005 images. Due to the importance of the obtained results, this first work will be addressed to the application of the proposed algorithm. A second paper will deeply analyze the theory related to these algorithms.","output":"SARS-CoV-2: enhancement and segmentation of high-resolution microscopy imagesPart I"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychological distress caused by decreased physical activity (PA) is a growing concern among the elderly due to public health measures since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Self-administered questionnaires assessed the changes in PA, SWB, HRQoL. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant associated risk factors for decreased PA. Of 165 participants (valid response rate, 41.3%; mean age, 78.5  8.0 years), 47.3% became less active, 23.0% became more active, and 29.7% maintained PA levels. There was a significant decrease in SWB at baseline and follow-up after COVID-19 restrictions in the less active group (p < 0.01). Higher levels of moderate or strenuous exercise/sports activity at baseline (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.24), and lower mental component HRQoL scores at baseline (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99) were associated with an increased risk of decreased PA.

Increasing human-animal interactions are perceived as driving factors in pathogen transfer, emphasising the close relationships between human, animal and environmental health. Contemporary livelihood and market patterns tend to degrade ecosystems and their services, driving a cycle of degradation in increasingly tightly linked socio-ecological systems. This contributes to reductions in the natural regulating capacities of ecosystem services to limit disease transfer from animals to humans. It also undermines natural resource availability, compromising measures such as washing and sanitation that may be key to managing subsequent human-to-human disease transmission. Human activities driving this degrading cycle tend to convert beneficial ecosystem services into disservices, exacerbating risks related to zoonotic diseases. Conversely, measures to protect or restore ecosystems constitute investment in foundational capital, enhancing their capacities to provide for greater human security and opportunity. We use the DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State change-Impact-Response) framework to explore three aspects of zoonotic diseases: (1) the significance of disease regulation ecosystem services and their degradation in the emergence of Covid-19 and other zoonotic diseases; and of the protection of natural resources as mitigating contributions to both (2) regulating human-to-human disease transfer; and (3) treatment of disease outbreaks. From this analysis, we identify a set of appropriate response options, recognising the foundational roles of ecosystems and the services they provide in risk management. Zoonotic disease risks are ultimately interlinked with biodiversity crises and water insecurity. The need to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic ongoing at the time of writing creates an opportunity for systemic policy change, placing scientific knowledge of the value and services of ecosystems at the heart of societal concerns as a key foundation for a more secure future. Rapid political responses and unprecedented economic stimuli reacting to the pandemic demonstrate that systemic change is achievable at scale and pace, and is also therefore transferrable to other existential, global-scale threats including climate change and the 'biodiversity crisis'. This also highlights the need for concerted global action, and is also consistent with the duties, and ultimately the self-interests, of developed, donor nations.","output":"The role of ecosystems in mitigation and management of Covid-19 and other zoonoses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Electronic medical records (EMR) provide a unique opportunity for efficient, large-scale clinical investigation in psychiatry. However, such studies will require development of tools to define treatment outcome. METHOD Natural language processing (NLP) was applied to classify notes from 127 504 patients with a billing diagnosis of major depressive disorder, drawn from out-patient psychiatry practices affiliated with multiple, large New England hospitals. Classifications were compared with results using billing data (ICD-9 codes) alone and to a clinical gold standard based on chart review by a panel of senior clinicians. These cross-sectional classifications were then used to define longitudinal treatment outcomes, which were compared with a clinician-rated gold standard. RESULTS Models incorporating NLP were superior to those relying on billing data alone for classifying current mood state (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85-0.88 v. 0.54-0.55). When these cross-sectional visits were integrated to define longitudinal outcomes and incorporate treatment data, 15% of the cohort remitted with a single antidepressant treatment, while 13% were identified as failing to remit despite at least two antidepressant trials. Non-remitting patients were more likely to be non-Caucasian (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The application of bioinformatics tools such as NLP should enable accurate and efficient determination of longitudinal outcomes, enabling existing EMR data to be applied to clinical research, including biomarker investigations. Continued development will be required to better address moderators of outcome such as adherence and co-morbidity.","output":"Using electronic medical records to enable large-scale studies in psychiatry: treatment resistant depression as a model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 has caused widespread transmission around the world. As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 cases in total by the end of March, April, May, and June following viral introduction. METHODS: We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 cases are reached or the end of June, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under four different combinations of parameter values to test the sensitivity of our results. RESULTS: We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algerias estimated probability of reaching 10,000 cases by end of March was close to 100% under all scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 1,000 cases in total reported by end of June whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 cases by then was higher than 50% even under the most optimistic scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 cases far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.","output":"Importations of COVID-19 into African countries and risk of onward spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined students learning adjustments in an introductory statistics class in response to the unexpected challenge presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show significant correlations in grades, page views, and on-time assignment submissions (OTAS) suggesting that the in-person and online learning modalities were comparable. The distributions of student learning activities were narrowly clustered around the means with smaller standard deviations recorded during the online sessions. Grades were positively correlated with OTAS for the in-person classes. For online classes using synchronous screen sharing, grades were positively associated with attendance; however, they were negatively influenced by the numbers of page views in the learning management system. The relations between attendance and achievement might be influenced by the complexity of content material. Students benefited more from attending classes in technical topics such as inferential statistics compared to descriptive statistics. It appears that participating in synchronous classes was a more effective means of learning inferential statistics than merely reviewing the instructors notes. In contrast, no correlation between grades and attendance was observed for in-person learning sessions covering descriptive statistics. There were no differences in learning adjustments between male and female students and both showed substantial resilience in adapting to the changes. Students unanimously looked forward to returning to campus. This study suggests it is the students individual learning approaches and behaviors that have a greater impact on their learning outcomes than the modality in which they are taught.

The risk of infection after in-hospital exposure has not yet been quantified and effective strategies to prevent it remain unclear. METHODS: All incidences of patient-to-patient exposure to SARS-CoV-2 on non-COVID wards between October and December 2020 at a UK hospital trust were identified. Patient contacts were traced, and data collected on SARS-CoV-2 testing, symptoms, and outcomes. Factors associated with acquiring infection and mortality were investigated. RESULTS: Of 575 patients exposed, 118 (19.5%) tested positive within 14 days of their exposure, with secondary attack rates (SAR) ranging from 0 to 72%. 68.6% (81/118) of secondary cases had not been in the same bay as the index case. For exposed patients, sharing a bay with the index case and having spent longer on the ward with them were associated with acquiring infection (ORs of 3.8, 95% CI: 1.89, 7.74, and 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.15 respectively). 71% of secondary cases tested positive while asymptomatic and 94.6% had tested negative earlier in their admission. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to describe the outcomes of a cohort of patients exposed to COVID-19 in hospital. Exposure to COVID-19 in hospital commonly leads to transmission that is not confined to the index case's bay. This study confirms that asymptomatic testing is important and suggests that an increased frequency of testing may be beneficial.

Due to this unique population composition, it has been suggested that Qatar may not follow suicide trends of high-income countries. Additionally, there is paucity of information on suicidal trends and rates due to social and cultural reasons. The Covid-19 pandemic has additionally impacted mental health of migrants differently form native Qataris. OBJECTIVES: This study explores suicidal behavior trends among individuals attending the main Emergency Department in the state of Qatar for mental health emergencies. The study also compared these trends for pre-pandemic period to early post pandemic period. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of individuals attending the main emergency department of the country from 1st December 2019 to 30th June 2020 was carried out using a composite data collection form. This identified 799 individuals presenting with mental health emergencies. Suicidal behaviors, relevant sociodemographic data, along with factors known to be associated with suicidal behaviors were collected for this group. RESULTS: 24.9% (n = 199) of the sample presented with suicidal behaviors. Younger age (31.16  9.497), current hopelessness (70; 54.7%), history of suicidal thoughts (50; 47.2%), history of suicidal attempts (43; 34.7%), history of self-harm thoughts (35; 39.3%), history of self-harm attempts (41; 37.6%) were highly significantly associated with suicidal behavior (p < 0.01). Qataris formed 27% of the group presenting with suicidal behaviors although they constitute only around 10% of the population. There was no significant change in the rate of presenting with suicidal behaviors during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports an annual incidence of suicidal behaviors in Qatar lower than that has been previously reported.

METHODS: This study was designed as a prospective cohort and nested case-control study. A total of 96 eligible patients with COVID-19 in convalescence were enrolled from Beijing Youan Hospital and Beijing Huimin Hospital and followed up from the hospital discharged day. Patients were divided into the CM (64 cases) and the control groups (32 cases) based on the treatment with or without CM and followed up at 14, 28, 56, and 84 days after discharge. In the CM group, patients received the 28-day CM treatment according to two types of CM syndrome. Improvements in clinical symptoms, CM syndrome, and absorption of lung inflammation were observed. RESULTS: All the 96 patients completed the 84-day follow-up from January 21 to March 28, 2020. By the 84th day of follow-up, respiratory symptoms were less than 5%. There was no significant difference in the improvement rates of symptoms, including fatigue, sputum, cough, dry throat, thirst, and upset, between the two groups (P>0.05). Totally 82 patients (85.42%) showed complete lung inflammation absorption at the 84-day follow-up. On day 14, the CM group had a significantly higher absorption rate than the control group (P<0.05) and the relative risk of absorption for CM vs. control group was 3.029 (95% confidence interval: 1.026-8.940). The proportions of CM syndrome types changed with time prolonging: the proportion of the pathogen residue syndrome gradually decreased, and the proportion of both qi and yin deficiency syndrome gradually increased. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 in convalescence had symptoms and lung inflammation after hospital discharge and recovered with time prolonging.

To estimate the impact of K-12 closures and reopening policies on children's social interactions and COVID-19 incidence in California's Bay Area, we collected data on children's social contacts and assessed implications for transmission using an individual-based model. Elementary and Hispanic children had more contacts during closures than high school and non-Hispanic children, respectively. We estimated that spring 2020 closures of elementary schools averted 2167 cases in the Bay Area (95% CI: -985, 5572), fewer than middle (5884; 95% CI: 1478, 11.550), high school (8650; 95% CI: 3054, 15 940) and workplace (15 813; 95% CI: 9963, 22 617) closures. Under assumptions of moderate community transmission, we estimated that reopening for a four-month semester without any precautions will increase symptomatic illness among high school teachers (an additional 40.7% expected to experience symptomatic infection, 95% CI: 1.9, 61.1), middle school teachers (37.2%, 95% CI: 4.6, 58.1) and elementary school teachers (4.1%, 95% CI: -1.7, 12.0). However, we found that reopening policies for elementary schools that combine universal masking with classroom cohorts could result in few within-school transmissions, while high schools may require masking plus a staggered hybrid schedule. Stronger community interventions (e.g. remote work, social distancing) decreased the risk of within-school transmission across all measures studied, with the influence of community transmission minimized as the effectiveness of the within-school measures increased.","output":"School closures reduced social mixing of children during COVID-19 with implications for transmission risk and school reopening policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) studies have provided critical insight into the pathogenesis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). scRNAseq workflows are generally designed for the detection and quantification of eukaryotic host mRNAs and not viral RNAs.

We examine the sociodemographic profiles of participants receiving different information sources and the impact of various COVID-19-related information sources on public worry. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey with a total of 2007 participants aged 20 years and above recruited anonymously was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sociodemographic data, frequencies at which participants received COVID-19-related information, the information sources (e.g., traditional media, interpersonal information exchange, and academic courses), and the levels of past, current, and anticipated worry about COVID-19 were assessed. Results: The most common sources of COVID-19-related information were internet media (80.52%), traditional media (52.62%), family members (24.36%), coworkers (23.57%), friends (21.08%), academic courses (20.18%), and medical staff (19.03%). We found that the COVID-19-related information from traditional media, internet media, and friends was associated with higher current worry (the unstandardized regression coefficient, B, ranged from 0.27 to 0.30), and the information from friends was associated with higher past worry (B was 0.18).

METHODS: A pre-post study was conducted within the Pain Registry for Epidemiological, Clinical, and Interventional Studies and Innovation (PRECISION Pain Research Registry) using data in the 3 months before and 3-6 months after the declaration of a national emergency related to COVID-19. Participants 21-79 years old with chronic low back pain were included in the study and provided self reported data at relevant quarterly encounters. Use of exercise therapy, yoga, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and opioids for low back pain was measured. The primary outcomes were low back pain intensity and back related functioning measured with a numerical rating scale and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, respectively. Secondary outcomes included health related quality of life scales measured with the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, including scales for physical function, anxiety, depression, low energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance, participation in social roles and activities, and pain interference with activities. RESULTS: A total of 476 participants were included in this study. The mean age of participants at baseline was 54.0 years (standard deviation, 13.2 years; range, 22-81 years). There were 349 (73.3%) female participants and 127 (26.7%) male participants in the study.

People with SMI were 3.04 more likely (95% C.I. = 2.42-3.82) to have obesity than the general population, but there was no difference in the prevalence of overweight. Women with schizophrenia were 1.44 (95% C.I. = 1.25-1.67) times more likely than men with schizophrenia to live with obesity; however, no gender differences were found among those with bipolar disorder. Conclusion People with SMI have a markedly high prevalence and higher odds of obesity than the general population. This may contribute to the very high prevalence of physical health conditions and mortality in this group. People with SMI around the world would likely benefit from interventions to reduce and prevent obesity.","output":"Prevalence of Overweight and Obesity in People With Severe Mental Illness: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus merupakan salah satu virus yang dapat menyebabkan gejala ringan dan sampai gejala berat, yang belum pernah ditemukansebelumnya pada manusia.

Instead, we are now in the midst of a global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. National and international pandemic preparedness plans have focused on developing vaccines and antiviral treatments. Another way to confront the COVID-19 pandemic (and future pandemics) might be to treat patients with inexpensive and widely available generic drugs that target the host response to infection, not the virus itself. The feasibility of this idea was tested during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014. This experience should inform our approach to treating COVID-19 patients. It could also save lives during outbreaks of other emerging infectious diseases and episodes of everyday acute critical illness. If this bottom up syndromic approach to treating acute critical illness were shown to be effective, it could have a dramatic impact on health, equity and security throughout the world. HIGHLIGHTS: Uncertainty about the outcome of COVID-19 is driving the social, economic and political distress associated with the pandemic.

Successive analysis was conducted comparing COVID-19 positive patients with COVID-19 free with inverse probability propensity score weights using simple regression to account for these two confounders (peripheral tip as central/peripheral and hospitalization as no/yes). METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective cohort study collected data from seven hospitals in Lombardy during the pandemic period from February 21st to May 31st 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2206 VADs were evaluated, 1107 (50.2%) of which were inserted in COVID-19 patients. In COVID-19 cohort the first choice was Long Peripheral Cannula in 388 patients (35.1%) followed by Midline Catheter in 385 (34.8%). The number of \\"central tip\\" VADs inserted in COVID-free inpatients and COVID-19 positive were similar (307 vs 334). We recorded 42 (1.9%) CRT; 32 (79.2%) were observed in COVID-19 patients.

The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed at the Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre on March 1st, a large public hospital with 1200 beds, covering an area over 400000 inhabitants in southern Madrid. During March 2020 highly active circulation of SARS-CoV-2 was experienced in Madrid with 24090 cases officially reported by March 29th. Methods Since the beginning of the epidemics the Occupational Health and Safety Service (OHSS) organized the consulting and testing of the hospital personnel with confirmed exposure and also those presenting symptoms suggestive of viral respiratory infection. For molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from suspected cases and processed at the Microbiology Laboratory by automatized specific PCR methods that was operative from February 25th as part of the preparedness. Results From a total of 6800 employees of the hospital, 2085 (30,6 %) were tested during the period 1-29 March 2020, some of them repeatedly (2286 total samples). The first HCW infected was confirmed on March 9th. A total of 791 HCW and personnel were confirmed to be infected by March 29th, representing 38% of those tested and 11,6 % of all the hospital workers. The proportion of infected individuals was estimated among the different groups of occupational exposure and the evolution of the cases during the expansive epidemic wave was compared between HCW and those patients attending at the Emergency Department (ER) during the same period and adjusted by the same age range. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR detection between HCW from high risk areas involved in close contact with COVID-19 patients in comparison with clerical, administrative or laboratory personnel without direct contact with patients. The curves of evolution of accumulated cases between patients and HCW during March 2020 showed an almost parallel shape. Discussion The recommendation from our OHSS did not include testing of asymptomatic cases but was highly proactive in testing even patients with minor symptoms therefore, a high proportion of HCW and non-sanitary personnel was tested in March 2020 during the rapid period of expansion of the epidemics in Madrid, accounting for a total of 30,6 % of the hospital employees. Most of the COVID-19 cases among the hospital HCW and personnel were mild and managed at home under self-isolation measures, however 23 (3%) required hospitalization mostly due to severe bilateral interstitial pneumonia, two of those cases required mechanical ventilation at the ICU. No fatalities occurred during the study period. Although there were some cases of highly probable transmission from COVID-19 patients to HCWs, mainly at the first phase of the epidemics, there were no significant differences on the infection rates of HCW and hospital personnel that can be related to working in areas of high exposure risk. Furthermore, the evolution of cases during the same time period (March 2020) between patients attending the ER and hospital staff suggests that both groups were driven by the same dynamics. This experience is similar to the communicated from Wuhan verified by the WHO Joint Mission and also from recent experiences at hospital in the Netherlands, where most of the infections of HCW were related to household or community contacts. Significance Since the collective of hospital HCW are exhaustively screened in specific centers, their rate of infection for SARS-CoV-2 could be an indicator of the epidemic dynamics in the community. There appears to be a close connection between HCW infection and the driving forces of transmission in the community. Although we cannot exclude an additional risk factor of infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the fact of the hospital environment, the similar proportions of positive cases among all the areas of the hospital and the evolutive wave of infection, as compared with the community, are clear arguments against a major factor of occupational risk. Exhaustive testing, such as the one carried out in our institution, covering over one third of all the workers, could be used as a reference of the population infected in the community. Since a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases can be asymptomatic and not all the hospital employees were actually tested, it is highly likely that this 11,6 % is a minimum estimation of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Madrid during the first 4 weeks of the epidemics. This is in high and clear contrast with the official figures circulating at national and international levels. This has important implications to more precisely estimate the actual number of cases in the community and to develop public health policies for containment, treatment and recovery.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in Health Care Workers in a large public hospital in Madrid, Spain, during March 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A classic two-parameter epidemiological SIR-model of the coronavirus propagation is considered.

Further, remote electronic exams (E-exams) were considered as mode of assessment. Objectives: This cross-sectional study evaluated the students' experience of remote E-exams during the COVID-19 pandemic among Medical Sciences students in Jordan. Materials and Methods: A survey of 29 questions was prepared on Google forms and distributed among students at Faculties of Medical Sciences (Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing and Applied Medical Sciences) at Jordan University of Science and Technology. The questions include students' demographics, stress experience, and factors contributing to stress as well as behavioral changes related to remote E-exams. Responses were analyzed using descriptive, cross tabulation and Chi-square tests. Results: Among 1019 respondents, 32% reported more stress with remote E-exams. This was associated with academic major and gender. Among students with more stress during remote E-exams, the exam duration, mode of questions navigation and technical problems (exam platform and internet connectivity) appeared as the main factors related to stress in 78%, 76% and >60%, respectively. Other factors include concern regarding the teaching methods, exam environment and students' dishonesty. Remote E-exams had negative impact on students' dietary habits (increase consumption of caffeine and high energy drinks, high sugar food, fast food), sleep (reduction in sleeping hours, more consumption of insomnia medications), physical activity (less exercises) and smoking habits (increase). Conclusion: Results suggested a negative impact of E-exams on students within Medical Faculties. Robust exam platform and remote mock E-exams are recommended to reduce students' potential stress. A stress-free environment is very essential to encourage students to adopt remote E-exams, particularly if the pandemic will take longer.

Cardiac arrhythmia seems to be a risk factor for mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the mechanisms, risk factors and outcomes of new arrhythmic events (NAEs) in this disease are unclear. METHODS: All patients with confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively included in this single centre study. Patients who were alive and admitted <30 days before the database lock were excluded. RESULTS: 3416 consecutive patients were reviewed and 1476 finally enrolled (65.9  20.9 years, 57.3% male). 76 (5.1%) patients had NAEs. Most of them were new atrial fibrillation episodes (48 patients, 3.2%), mostly seen in patients with no previous arrhythmia (38 patients, 79.2%). Atrial flutter (AFL) accounted for 20% of all NAEs. Ventricular arrhythmias were seen in 9 (0.6%) patients. Multivariable analysis showed that prior AFL, heart failure, dyslipidaemia, lopinavir/ritonavir, and combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were independently associated with NAEs. 66 (86.8%) patients with NAEs died. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a lower survival of patients with NAEs (P < 0.001). Eight out of 9 (88.9%) and 41 out of 48 (85.4%) patients with ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation respectively died. Older age, male gender and NAEs were independently associated with death. NAEs and other outcomes, such as heart failure, thromboembolism, and bleeding independently predicted death. CONCLUSIONS: NAEs are relatively uncommon in COVID-19 patients and mainly have an atrial mechanism. AFL is particularly frequent in this disease. The use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir, is associated with them, especially when used in combination.

Exacerbation of mental health distress and disordered eating could have significant negative effects on long-term weight management and quality of life for these patients if untreated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of a telephone-based cognitive behavioral therapy (Tele-CBT) intervention in improving depressive, anxiety, and disordered eating symptoms during COVID-19. METHODS: Participants were recruited as part of a larger randomized controlled trial study (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT03315247) between March 2020 and March 2021 and randomized 1:1 to receive Tele-CBT or standard bariatric care. Outcomes of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Emotional Eating Scale (EES), and Binge Eating Scale (BES) were measured at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 3 months post-intervention. Linear mixed models were used to test the effect of intervention group, time, and group-by-time interaction for each outcome. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Mean (SD) age of participants was 47.68 (9.36) years and 80.2% were female. There were significant group-by-time interactions for all outcomes and significant differences between groups across time. There were significant decreases in mean GAD-7 (p = 0.001), PHQ-9 (p < 0.001), EES-Total (p = 0.001), EES-Anger (p = 0.003), EES-Anxiety (p < 0.001), EES-Depression (p < 0.001), and BES (p = 0.002) scores for the Tele-CBT group at post-intervention and follow-up when compared to baseline and the control group.

Studies were conducted in West Africa, Haiti, and Singapore. No research studies have focused on outcomes and support for bereaved people during a pandemic. Studies have tended to focus on survivors who are those who had the illness and recovered, recognizing that some of these individuals will also be bereaved people. Previous pandemics appear to cause multiple losses both directly related to death itself and also in terms of disruption to social norms, rituals, and mourning practices. This affects the ability for an individual to connect with the deceased both before and after the death, potentially increasing the risk of complicated grief. In view of the limited research, specific learning from the current COVID-19 crisis and the impact on the bereaved would be pertinent. Current focus should include innovative ways to promote connection and adapt rituals while maintaining respect. Strong leadership and coordination between different bereavement organisations is essential to providing successful postbereavement support.","output":"Supporting Adults Bereaved Through COVID-19: A Rapid Review of the Impact of Previous Pandemics on Grief and Bereavement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bilateral ground-glass opacities and a combination of consolidation and ground-glass opacities mainly in the subpleural lung regions is a noteworthy high-resolution CT feature of Corona Virus Disease 2019 which may help in the early diagnosis of the disease.","output":"High-resolution CT features of 17 cases of Corona Virus Disease 2019 in Sichuan province, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND. The role of humoral immunity in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not fully understood owing, in large part, to the complexity of antibodies produced in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is a pressing need for serology tests to assess patient-specific antibody response and predict clinical outcome. METHODS. Using SARS-CoV-2 proteome and peptide microarrays, we screened 146 COVID-19 patients plasma samples to identify antigens and epitopes. This enabled us to develop a master epitope array and an epitope-specific agglutination assay to gauge antibody responses systematically and with high resolution. RESULTS. We identified 54 linear epitopes from the Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) protein and showed that epitopes enabled higher resolution antibody profiling than protein antigens. Specifically, we found that antibody responses to the S(811-825), S(881-895) and N(156-170) epitopes negatively or positively correlated with clinical severity or patient survival. Moreover, we found that the P681H and S235F mutations associated with the coronavirus variant B.1.1.7 altered the specificity of the corresponding epitopes. CONCLUSIONS. Epitope-resolved antibody testing not only offers a high-resolution alternative to conventional immunoassays to delineate the complex humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and differentiate between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, it may also be used as predictor of clinical outcome. The epitope peptides can be readily modified to detect antibodies against variants in both the peptide array and latex agglutination formats. FUNDING.

SARS-CoV-2 evolution is driven by the mechanisms at molecular and organism scales and regulated by the transmission pathways at the population scale. In this review, we show that infectivity-based natural selection was discovered as the mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission in July 2020. In April 2021, we proved beyond all doubt that such a natural selection via infectivity-based transmission pathway remained the sole mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 evolution. However, we reveal that antibody-disruptive co-mutations [Y449S, N501Y] debuted as a new vaccine-resistant transmission pathway of viral evolution in highly vaccinated populations a few months ago. Over one year ago, we foresaw that mutations spike protein RBD residues, 452 and 501, would\\"have high chances to mutate into significantly more infectious COVID-19 strains\\". Mutations on these residues underpin prevailing SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Theta, Kappa, Lambda, and Mu at present and are expected to be vital to emerging variants. We anticipate that viral evolution will combine RBD co-mutations at these two sites, creating future variants that are tens of times more infectious than the original SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, two complementary transmission pathways of viral evolution: infectivity and vaccine-resistant, will prolong our battle with COVID-19 for years. We predict that RBD co-mutation [A411S, L452R, T478K], [L452R, T478K, N501Y], [L452R, T478K, E484K, N501Y], [K417N, L452R, T478K], and [P384L, K417N, E484K, N501Y] will have high chances to grow into dominating variants due to their high infectivity and/or strong ability to break through current vaccines, calling for the development of new vaccines and antibody therapies.","output":"Review of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Child mortality is a global health problem. The United Nations' 2018 report on levels and trends on child mortality indicated that under-five mortality is one of the major public health problems in Ghana with a rate of 60 deaths per 1000 live births.

Methods In this study, we investigated the effects of some selected risk factors on child mortality using data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic Health Survey. We modelled the relationship between child mortality and the risk factors using a logistic regression model under the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. We used the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm to simulate parameter estimates from the posterior distributions, and statistical analyses were carried out using STATA version 14.1. Results Results from the frequentist framework are in line with those from the Bayesian framework. The results showed an increased risk of death among children who were delivered through caesarean and reduced relative odds of death among children whose sizes are average or large at birth and whose mothers have formal education.

However, its cardiac manifestations are less frequently studied. We aimed to analyze the available COVID-19 data on acute cardiac injury, using troponin and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. METHODS We performed a systematic review on Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases until March 25, 2020. Relevant records reporting the incidence of acute cardiac injury as well as troponin and BNP levels were collected from published peer-reviewed articles with further analysis according to the clinical status of the patients (severe, non-severe, and death). RESULTS Eleven records of 1394 individuals were included. The mean age of patients with acute cardiac injury was 56.6  33.4 years (males: 54.3%). The incidence of acute cardiac injury was 15% (95% CI: 11, 20%). Further analysis revealed that dead or severe patients had significantly higher percentages of myocardial injury, compared to non-severe ones (peer-reviewed: 44%, 95% CI: 16, 74% vs. 24%, 95% CI: 15, 34% vs. 5%, 95% CI: 1, 12%, respectively).

However, in this study, we wanted to explore the possibility of using IL-1 to improve the prognosis of sepsis by triggering local differentiation of bone marrow cells (BMCs) into regulatory dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo, thereby reversing the immune paralysis in late-phase sepsis. Sepsis mouse models were induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and lethal Escherichia coli O18 infection. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with IL-1 after CLP and after the lethal infection. Septic BMCs and liver immune cells were isolated at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 14 days post-CLP. BMCs and liver cells isolated from septic mice treated with IL-1 were adoptively transferred into CLP mice. GFP(+)-C57BL/6 parabiosis models were established. Serum IL-1 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, and the number, ratio, and phenotype of immune cells were observed by flow cytometry. IL-1 treatment improved the survival of sepsis and increased the numbers of BMCs and liver immune cells in septic mice. Moreover, IL-1 stimulation increased the number and the percentage of CD11c(?)CD45RB(high) DCs in septic BM and liver. Adoptive transfer of septic BMCs, liver immune cells, and CD11c(?)CD45RB(high) DCs treated with IL-1 into CLP mice attenuated sepsis. IL-1 triggered the redistribution of CD11c(?)CD45RB(high) DCs as well as BMCs in parabiosis models. IL-1 protects against sepsis by stimulating local proliferation and differentiation of BMCs into CD11c(?)CD45RB(high) DCs at immune organs and non-immune organs.

This case series highlights the transition from in-person to telebehavioral health practice of a Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training for Schizophrenia group due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article summarizes: (a) the staff procedures needed to transition the group from in-person to telebehavioral health, (b) participant outcome data, (c) session attendance data, and (d) survey results from facilitators and participants about barriers and facilitators of the transition to telebehavioral health, and about how the virtual platform altered the therapeutic relationship and engagement. Participant outcome and engagement data suggest that, not only were two participants able to transition to telehealth and complete the program, but both participants also showed notable improvement in treatment engagement, goal progress, and skill acquisition. Surveys of six facilitators and one participant highlight how the transition to telebehavioral health had treatment advantages (e.g., therapeutic relationship, treatment engagement, group dynamics).

These flies have undergone a variety of specializations during their evolution including an exclusive diet consisting solely of vertebrate blood for both sexes as well as an obligate viviparous reproductive biology. Alongside these adaptations, Glossina species have developed intricate relationships with specific microbes ranging from mutualistic to parasitic. These relationships provide fundamental support required to sustain the specializations associated with tsetse's biology. This chapter provides an overview on the knowledge to date regarding the biology behind these relationships and focuses primarily on four bacterial species that are consistently associated with Glossina species. Here their interactions with the host are reviewed at the morphological, biochemical and genetic levels. This includes: the obligate symbiont Wigglesworthia, which is found in all tsetse species and is essential for nutritional supplementation to the blood-specific diet, immune system maturation and facilitation of viviparous reproduction; the commensal symbiont Sodalis, which is a frequently associated symbiont optimized for survival within the fly via nutritional adaptation, vertical transmission through mating and may alter vectorial capacity of Glossina for trypanosomes; the parasitic symbiont Wolbachia, which can manipulate Glossina via cytoplasmic incompatibility and shows unique interactions at the genetic level via horizontal transmission of its genetic material into the genome in two Glossina species; finally, knowledge on recently observed relations between Spiroplasma and Glossina is explored and potential interactions are discussed based on knowledge of interactions between this bacterial Genera and other insect species. These flies have a simple microbiome relative to that of other insects. However, these relationships are deep, well-studied and provide a window into the complexity and function of host/symbiont interactions in an important disease vector.","output":"Bacterial Symbionts of Tsetse Flies: Relationships and Functional Interactions Between Tsetse Flies and Their Symbionts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans has morphogenesis as a virulence factor. The morphogenesis of C. albicans is closely related to pathogenicity (1). Ras1 in C. albicans is an important switch in the MAPK pathway for morphogenesis (2, 3). The MAPK pathway is important for the virulence, such as cell growth, morphogenesis, and biofilm formation (4, 5). Ume6 is a well-known transcriptional factor for hyphal-specific genes (6). Despite numerous studies, as a recent issue, it is necessary to develop a new drug that uses a different pathway mechanism to inhibit resistant C. albicans strains caused by chronic prescription of azole or echinocandin drugs, which are mainly used. Here, we show that the small carbazole derivatives attenuated the pathogenicity of C. albicans through inhibition of the Ras1/MAPK pathway. We found that the small molecules inhibit morphogenesis through repressing protein and RNA levels in Ras/MAPK related genes including UME6 and NRG1. Furthermore, we found the antifungal effect of the small molecules in vivo using a candidiasis murine model. We anticipate our findings are that the small molecules are the promising compounds for the development of new antifungal agents for the treatment of systemic candidiasis and possibly for other fungal diseases. Author summary The infection by the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans occurs mainly in immunocompetent and immunocompromised humans, such as AIDS patients, immunosuppressant-treated organ transplant patients, and recent COVID-19 patients. Morphogenesis which the ability to switch between yeast and hyphal growth forms is one of the representative virulence factors of C. albicans. Here, we describe novel small molecules that show antifungal effects such as the inhibition of the morphogenesis and the biofilm formation, and maintenance of biofilm. Moreover, we found that these small molecules had antifungal activity in mouse experiments, and confirmed that they were also effective in drug-resistant C. albicans strains. Studies of some small molecules with structures similar to ours have already been reported to exhibit growth inhibitory activity against bacteria and Candida species. However, the mechanism of action of these molecules has not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated, for the first time, the mechanism by which these two small molecules inhibit C. albicans pathogenicity through inhibition of specific pathways. Our study, through the research of the mechanism of action of novel small molecules, provides new insights into the development of drug candidates not only for wild-type C. albicans, but also for strains resistant to existing drugs.","output":"Inhibition of Ras1-MAPK pathways for hypha formation by novel drug candidates in Candida albicans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The project realize an idea from students of Scientific High school involved in a multidisciplinary path focused on ONE HEALTH approach and ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION After skill buildings webinars the students decided to build a survey in order to Raise awareness about how any individual behavior Underline the importance of information, even scientific, in order to take appropriate choices.

Sanaria? PfSPZ vaccines are produced using aseptically reared Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. The bionomics of sporogonic development of P. falciparum in A. stephensi to fully mature salivary gland PfSPZ is thought to be modulated by several components of the mosquito innate immune system. In order to increase salivary gland PfSPZ infections in A. stephensi and thereby increase vaccine production efficiency, a gene knock down approach was used to investigate the activity of the immune deficiency (IMD) signaling pathway downstream effector leucine-rich repeat immune molecule 1 (LRIM1), an antagonist to Plasmodium development. METHODS: Expression of LRIM1 in A. stephensi was reduced following injection of double stranded (ds) RNA into mosquitoes. By combining the Gal4/UAS bipartite system with in vivo expression of short hairpin (sh) RNA coding for LRIM1 reduced expression of LRIM1 was targeted in the midgut, fat body, and salivary glands. RT-qPCR was used to demonstrate fold-changes in gene expression in three transgenic crosses and the effects on P. falciparum infections determined in mosquitoes showing the greatest reduction in LRIM1 expression. RESULTS: LRIM1 expression could be reduced, but not completely silenced, by expression of LRIM1 dsRNA. Infections of P. falciparum oocysts and PfSPZ were consistently and significantly higher in transgenic mosquitoes than wild type controls, with increases in PfSPZ ranging from 2.5- to tenfold. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium falciparum infections in A. stephensi can be increased following reduced expression of LRIM1. These data provide the springboard for more precise knockout of LRIM1 for the eventual incorporation of immune-compromised A. stephensi into manufacturing of Sanarias PfSPZ products.

The precise mechanism by which COVID-19 causes myocardial injury is still unknown. Myocarditis following administration of COVID-19 vaccines, especially those based on mRNA, has also been described. However, no reports of heart failure following reinfection with COVID-19 in patients immunized with an inactivated vaccine have been identified. Case description: Male, 47-year-old, of African descent, construction worker, with type II diabetes, with a history of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in December 2020 and May 2021, confirmed by RT-PCR.

After the second episode of SARS-CoV-2 infection, he was diagnosed with severe heart failure as a sequelae of myocarditis. Conclusion: It is essential to do a proper follow-up after infection by SARS-CoV-2, since even with proper immunization, there is a possibility that the patient was reinfected and had severe cardiac sequelae as a consequence, and the hypothesis of an etiology associated with the use of an inactivated vaccine against COVID-19 with a potential immune enhancement mechanism following re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 cannot be rejected.","output":"Heart failure secondary to myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 reinfection: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although the impact of pathogens on the evolution of the mammalian immune system is still under debate, proteins, which both regulate immune responses and serve as cellular receptors for pathogens should be at the forefront of pathogen-driven host evolution. The CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) gene family codes for such proteins and indeed shows tremendous species-specific variation between human and rodents. Since little is known about the CEA gene family in other lineages of placental mammals, we expected to gain new insights into the evolution of the rapidly diverging CEA family by analyzing the CEA family of the dog. RESULTS: Here we describe the complete CEA gene family in the dog. We found that the gene coding for the ITIM-bearing immunoregulatory molecule CEACAM1 gave rise to a recent expansion of the canine CEA gene family by gene duplication, similar to that previously found in humans and mice. However, while the murine and human CEACAMs (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules) are predominantly secreted and GPI-anchored, respectively, in the dog, most of the CEACAMs represent ITAM-bearing transmembrane proteins. One of these proteins, CEACAM28, exhibits nearly complete sequence identity with the ligand-binding N domain of CEACAM1, but antagonizing signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic tail. Comparison of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions indicates that the CEACAM28 N domain is under the strongest purifying selection of all canine CEACAM1-related CEACAMs. In addition, CEACAM28 shows a similar expression pattern in resting immune cells and tissues as CEACAM1. However, upon activation CEACAM28 mRNA and CEACAM1 mRNA are differentially regulated. CONCLUSION: Thus, CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 are the first paired immune receptors identified within the CEA gene family, which are expressed on T cells and are most likely involved in the fine-tuning of T cell responses. The direction of gene conversion accompanied by purifying selection and expression in immune cells suggests the possibility that CEACAM28 evolved in response to selective pressure imposed by species-specific pathogens.","output":"Species-specific evolution of immune receptor tyrosine based activation motif-containing CEACAM1-related immune receptors in the dog"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 coronavirus disease(COVID-19) has cost a great loss to the health and economic property of Chines people Under such a special circumstance, how to deal with such patients with acute aortic syndrome has become a serious challenge Rapid diagnosis of concomitant COVID-19, safe and effective transportation, implementation of the interventional procedure, protection of vascular surgical team and postoperative management and follow-up of such patients have become urgent problems for us Combined with the latest novel government documents, the literature and the experiences from Wuhan, we answered the above questions briefly and plainly We also hope to inspire the national vascular surgeons to manage critical emergencies in vascular surgery and even routine vascular diseases with COVID-19, as a final point to limit the severe epidemic situation, and minimize the damage of COVID-19","output":"[Countermeasures and treatment for aortic acute syndrome with 2019 coronavirus disease]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While there are no official figures, data from the pet food industry show that in 20191 25% of UK households owned a dog, compared with 33%2 in 2021, with the number of dogs rising from nine million to 12 5 million PFMA releases its new top ten pets 2019: pets are the tonic for yappy days www pfma org uk/news/pfma-releases-its-new-top-ten-pets-2019 2 Pet Food Manufacturers Association www pfma org uk/pet-population-2021 3 Tulloch JSP Minford S Pimblett V Rotheram M Christley RM Westgarth C Paediatric emergency department dog bite attendance during the covid-19 pandemic: an audit at a tertiary childrens hospital","output":"Sixty seconds on . . . dog bites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Serological tests detect antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the ongoing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Results All tests showed very high diagnostic specificity. Sensitivities in samples collected at least 14 days after disease onset were slightly lower than manufacturers' claims for Roche (93.0%), Abbott (90.8%), and Siemens COV2T (90.3%), and distinctly lower for Siemens COV2G (78.8%). Concordantly negative results were enriched for immunocompromised patients. ROC curve analyses suggest a lowering of the cut-off index for the Siemens COV2G assay. Finally, the combination of two anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is feasible when considering borderline reactive results.

Disruption in antenatal care (ANC) provisions during lockdown is expected due to diversion of public health facilities on pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the proportion of pregnant women who had not completed the ideal number of antenatal visits, availability of ironCfolic acid (IFA) supplements and challenges in availing health services during the period of lockdown. METHODS: A concurrent mixed-methods study was conducted among pregnant women in Puducherry, India. Information on obstetric characteristics and details regarding antenatal visits were collected through telephonic interviews. In-depth interviews were conducted to understand the perceived challenges in availing health services during the lockdown period. RESULTS: Out of 150 pregnant women, 62 [41.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 33.6C49.3] did not complete the ideal number of visits and 61 (40.7%, 95% CI 32.7C49.0) developed health problems.

Moreover, the FGHAM approach has overcome the difficulties of applying multiple integration and differentiation procedures while obtaining the solution using well-established methods such as homotopy analysis method and homotopy perturbation method. The computational efficiency of the proposed method is analyzed using a comparative study. The advantage of the proposed method is shown with a numerical example using the comparative study between FGHAM and Monte Carlo simulation.

But heparin also increases blood loss causing possible harm for the patient. Heparin has an unpredictable effect in the individual patient. The activated clotting time (ACT) can measure the effect of heparin. Currently, this ACT is not measured during NCAP as the standard of care, contrary to during cardiac interventions, open and endovascular. A RCT will evaluate if ACT-guided heparinization results in less TEC than the current standard: a single bolus of 5000 IU of heparin and no measurements at all. A goal ACT of 200C220 s should be reached during ACT-guided heparinization and this should decrease (mortality caused by) TEC, while not increasing major bleeding complications. This RCT will be executed during open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery, as this is a standardized procedure throughout Europe. METHODS: Seven hundred fifty patients, who will undergo open AAA repair of an aneurysm originating below the superior mesenteric artery, will be randomised in 2 treatment arms: 5000 IU of heparin and no ACT measurements and no additional doses of heparin, or a protocol of 100 IU/kg bolus of heparin and ACT measurements after 5 min, and then every 30 min. The goal ACT is 200C220 s. If the ACT after 5 min is < 180 s, 60 IU/kg will be administered; if the ACT is between 180 and 200 s, 30 IU/kg. If the ACT is > 220 s, no extra heparin is given, and the ACT is measured after 30 min and then the same protocol is applied. The expected incidence for the combined endpoint of TEC and mortality is 19% for the 5000 IU group and 11% for the ACT-guided group. DISCUSSION: The ACTION-1 trial is an international RCT during open AAA surgery, designed to show superiority of ACT-guided heparinization compared to the current standard of a single bolus of 5000 IU of heparin. A significant reduction in TEC and mortality, without more major bleeding complications, must be proven with a relevant economic benefit.

Vitamin D plays an important role in immune function and inflammation. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the impact of vitamin D status and supplementation on COVID-19 related mortality and health outcomes. METHODS: We searched four databases until December 18th 2020, and trial registries until January 20th 2021. Two reviewers screened the studies, collected data, assessed the risk of bias, and graded the evidence for each outcome across studies, independently and in duplicate. Pre-specified outcomes of interest were mortality, ICU admission, invasive and non-invasive ventilation, hospitalization, time of hospital stay, disease severity and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We only included data from peer-reviewed articles in our primary analyses. RESULTS: We identified 31 peer-reviewed observational studies. In our primary analysis, there was a positive trend between serum 25(OH)D level <20a?ng/ml and an increased risk of mortality, ICU admission, invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation or SARS-CoV-2 positivity. However, these associations were not statistically significant. Mean 25(OH)D levels was 5.9a?ng/ml (95% CI [-9.5, -2.3]) significantly lower in COVID-19 positive, compared to negative patients. The certainty of the evidence was very low. We identified 32 clinical trial protocols, but only three have published results to-date. The trials administer vitamin D doses of 357 to 60,000a?IU/day, from one week to 12a?months. Eight megatrials investigate the efficacy of vitamin D in outpatient populations. A pilot trial revealed a significant decrease in ICU admission with calcifediol, compared to placebo (ORa?=a?0.003), but the certainty of the evidence was unclear. Another small trial showed that supplementation with cholecalciferol, 60,000a?IU/day, decreased fibrinogen levels, but did not have an effect on D-dimer, procalcitonin and CRP levels, compared to placebo. The third trial did not find any effect of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 related health outcomes. CONCLUSION: While the available evidence to-date, from largely poor-quality observational studies, may be viewed as showing a trend for an association between low serum 25(OH)D levels and COVID-19 related health outcomes, this relationship was not found to be statistically significant. Calcifediol supplementation may have a protective effect on COVID-19 related ICU admissions. The current use of high doses of vitamin D in COVID-19 patients is not based on solid evidence.

Decades of research have since demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of off-label use of misoprostol as a uterotonic in pregnant women to prevent and treat post-partum hemorrhage, treat incomplete abortion, or terminate first-trimester pregnancy. Global health experts emphasize misoprostols potential to revolutionize access to reproductive health care in developing countries. Misoprostol does not require refrigeration, can be self-administered or with the aid of a non-physician, and is relatively inexpensive. It holds particular promise for improving reproductive health in sub-Saharan Africa, where most global maternal mortality related to post-partum hemorrhage and unsafe abortion occurs. Although misoprostol has been widely recognized as an essential obstetric medication, its application remains highly contested precisely because it disrupts medical and legal authority over pregnancy, delivery, and abortion. I draw on fieldwork in Francophone Africa to explore how global health organizations have negotiated misoprostols abortifacient qualities in their reproductive health work. I focus on this region not only because it has some of the worlds highest rates of maternal mortality, but also fertility, thereby situating misoprostol in a longer history of family planning programs in a region designated as a zone of overpopulation since the 1980s. Findings suggest that stakeholders adopt strategies that directly address safe abortion on the one hand, and integrate misoprostol into existing clinical protocols and pharmaceutical supply systems for legal obstetric indications on the other. Although misoprostol has generated important partnerships among regional stakeholders invested in reducing fertility and maternal mortality, the stigma of abortion stalls its integration into routine obstetric care and availability to the public.

Our main ambition is to improve the preparedness level and response effectiveness of healthcare authorities in fighting pandemics/epidemics by implementing analytical techniques. Building on lessons from the Chinese experience in the COVID-19 outbreak, we first develop a deterministic multi-objective mixed integer linear program (MILP) which determines the location and size of new pandemic hospitals (strategic level planning), periodic regional health resource re-allocations (tactical level planning) and daily patient-hospital assignments (operational level planning). Taking the forecasted number of cases along a planning horizon as an input, the model minimizes the weighted sum of the number of rejected patients, total travel distance, and installation cost of hospitals subject to real-world constraints and organizational rules. Next, accounting for the uncertainty in the spread speed of the disease, we employ an across scenario robust (ASR) model and reformulate the robust counterpart of the deterministic MILP. The ASR attains relatively more realistic solutions by considering multiple scenarios simultaneously while ensuring a predefined threshold of relative regret for the individual scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of proposed models on the case of Wuhan, China. Taking the 51 days worth of confirmed COVID-19 case data as an input, we solve both deterministic and robust models and discuss the impact of all three level decisions to the quality and performance of healthcare services during the pandemic. Our case study results show that although it is a challenging task to make strategic level decisions based on uncertain forecasted data, an immediate action can considerably improve the response effectiveness of healthcare authorities. Another important observation is that, the installation times of pandemic hospitals have significant impact on the system performance in fighting with the shortage of beds and facilities.","output":"A robust multi-objective model for healthcare resource management and location planning during pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: There is a lack of evidence addressing several important human factors questions pertaining to the quality of supportive information provided by commercial manufacturers that can affect the adoption and use of lateral flow serology assays in practice. We aimed to: (1) identify and assess the quality of information that commercial manufacturers provided for their point-of-care tests (POCTs) and (2) examine the implications of these findings on real-world settings. DESIGN: We used a content analysis methodology in two stages to systematically, code and analyse textual data from documents of commercial manufacturers. A deductive approach was applied using a coding guide based on the validated Point-of-Care Key Evidence Tool (POCKET) multidimensional checklist. An inductive approach was used to identify new patterns or themes generated from our textual analysis. SETTING: Publicly available supportive information documents by commercial manufacturers for lateral flow serology, were identified and gathered from online searches. PARTICIPANTS: Supportive information documents retrieved from online searches over 3 months (March 2020 to June 2020). RESULTS: A total of 79 POCTs were identified that met the study inclusion criteria. Using the POCKET coding guide, we found that the quality of information varied significantly between the manufacturers and was often lacking in detail. Our inductive approach further examined these topics and found that several statements were vague and that significant variations in the level of details existed between manufacturers. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed significant concerns surrounding the supportive information reported by manufacturers for lateral flow serology assays. Information transparency was poor and human factor issues were not properly addressed to mitigate the risk of improper device use, although it should be noted that the results of our study are limited by the data that manufactures were prepared to disclose.

Although the stay-at-home order was one of the most effective methods to contain its spread, residents in lower-income neighborhoods faced barriers to practicing social distancing. We aimed to quantify the differential impact of stay-at-home policy on COVID-19 transmission and residents mobility across neighborhoods of different levels of socioeconomic disadvantage. MethodsThis was a comparative interrupted time-series analysis at the county level. We included 2,087 counties from 38 states which both implemented and lifted the state-wide stay-at-home order. Every county was assigned to one of four equally-sized groups based on its levels of disadvantage, represented by the Area Deprivation Index. Prevalence of COVID-19 was calculated by dividing the daily number of cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases by the number of residents from the 2010 Census. We used the Social Distancing Index, derived from the COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform, to measure the social distancing practice.

We calculated a comparative change of daily trends in COVID-19 prevalence and Social Distancing Index between counties with three highest disadvantage levels and those with the least level before and after the implementation and lifting of the stay-at-home order, separately. ResultsOn both stay-at-home implementation and lifting dates, COVID-19 prevalence was much higher among counties with the highest or lowest disadvantage level, while mobility decreased as the disadvantage level increased. Mobility of the most disadvantaged counties was least impacted by stay-at-home implementation and relaxation compared to counties with the most resources; however, disadvantaged counties experienced the largest relative increase in COVID-19 infection after both stay-at-home implementation and relaxation. ConclusionsNeighborhoods with varying levels of socioeconomic disadvantage reacted differently to the implementation and relaxation of COVID-19 mitigation policies. Policymakers should consider investing more resources in disadvantaged counties as the pandemic may not stop until most neighborhoods have it under control.","output":"Differential Impact of Mitigation Policies and Socioeconomic Status on COVID-19 Prevalence and Social Distancing in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Clinical trials for systemic lupus erythematosus (\\"lupus\\") under-enroll Black individuals despite higher disease prevalence, morbidity and mortality among Black than White individuals. To begin to address this disparity, we leveraged community-academic partnerships in two U.S. cities (Boston and Chicago) to train Popular Opinion Leaders (POLs) to disseminate information about clinical trials in predominantly Black communities. METHODS The team of community and academic partners collaboratively developed a five-module curriculum about clinical trials, barriers, facilitators, and structural racism in research. We enrolled POLs in Boston and Chicago to participate virtually in the curriculum and assessed knowledge gained by comparing pre- and post- test scores. We described the POLs' ability to disseminate information about clinical trials through their communities. RESULTS We enrolled 19 POLs in Boston and 16 in Chicago; overall 71% reported a lupus diagnosis, 94% were female, and 80% self-identified as Black or African American. The program was adapted to virtual formats due to the COVID-19 pandemic. POLs demonstrated significant improvement comparing pre/post scores for the conduct of clinical trials and history of racism in clinical research. Fifteen POLs (43%) reported their dissemination of information about clinical trials; information reached 425 community members in Boston (90% virtually) and 1,887 in Chicago (95% virtually). CONCLUSION By leveraging community-academic partnerships, we developed and implemented a curriculum to promote familiarity with clinical trials, leading to information dissemination by POLs in predominantly Black communities that are under-represented in lupus clinical trials.

The clinical features and outcomes of the most critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by HAdV-55 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, single-center observational study of pneumonia with ARDS in immunocompetent adults admitted to our respiratory ICU. We prospectively collected and analyzed clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, sequential tests of viral load in respiratory tract and blood, treatments and outcomes. RESULTS: The results for a total of five consecutive patients with severe ARDS with confirmed HAdV-55 infection were included. All five patients were immunocompetent young men with a median age of 32 years. The mean time from onset to dyspnea was 5 days. Arterial blood gas analysis at ICU admission revealed profound hypoxia. Mean partial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen was 58.1. Mean durations from onset to a single-lobe consolidation shown on chest X-rays (CXRs) and, from the first positive CXR to bilateral multilobar lung infiltrates, were 2 days and 4.8 days, respectively. The viral load was higher than 1  10(8) copies in three patients and was 1  10(4) in one patient. It was negative in the only patient who survived. The mean duration for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) failure and IMV failure were 30.8 hours and 6.2 days, respectively. Four patients received venovenous ECMO. Four (80%) of the five patients died despite receiving appropriate respiratory support. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV-55 may cause severe ARDS in immunocompetent young men. Persistent high fever, dyspnea and rapid progression to respiratory failure within 2 weeks, together with bilateral consolidations and infiltrates, are the most frequent clinical manifestations of HAdV-55-induced severe ARDS. Viral load monitoring may help predict disease severity and outcome. The NPPV and IMV failure rates were very high, but ECMO may still be the respiratory support therapy of choice.

SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to the ACE II receptor and begins viral replication. The effects and clinical findings of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver, kidney, heart, gastrointestinal (GI) system and especially lungs have been widely discussed. However, the effects on the pancreas-another organ that also expresses ACE II-have not been studied. METHODS: This work prospectively evaluated data from 316 patients who were admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients were categorized into three according to the severity of pneumonia (mild, severe, critical). Demographic data, rate of pancreatitis, biochemical parameters, and radiological images from each group were analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups and outcomes were compared: COVID-19 patients with acute pancreatitis (Group P) and without acute pancreatitis (Group C). RESULTS: The median age was 54 (18-87), and the median age for patients with acute pancreatitis was 55 (26-84). As an expected finding, we found a positive correlation between advanced age and mortality (p = 0.0003). 12.6% of the patients had acute pancreatitis. While pancreatitis was not seen in patients on mild status, the rate of pancreatitis was 32.5% in critical patients. Hospitalization and mortality rates were higher in patients with COVID-19 accompanied by acute pancreatitis (p = 0.0038 and p < 0.0001, respectively). C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and ferritin were significantly higher in those who had pancreatitis (p < 0.0001). D-Dimer and procalcitonin levels had only a small difference (p = 0.1127 and p = 0.3403, respectively). CONCLUSION: Acute pancreatitis alone is a clinical condition that can lead to mortality and may be one of the reasons for the exaggerated immune response developing in the progression of COVID-19. Our results point out that the presence of pancreatic damage triggered by SARS-CoV-2 can deteriorate the clinical condition of patients and the mortality rate may increase in these patients.","output":"Association between Acute Pancreatitis and COVID-19: Could Pancreatitis Be the Missing Piece of the Puzzle about Increased Mortality Rates?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of this review paper was to discuss the gut microbiota-related aspects of COVID-19 patients. We presented the faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, gut microbiota imbalance, and fecal microbiota transplantation as a hidden source of this virus. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed the available literature (PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar databases) regarding COVID-19 and gut microbiota related aspects. RESULTS The gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort/pain, may occur in these patients. Notably, these symptoms may contribute to the severity of COVID-19. Recent several studies have revealed a new SARS-CoV-2 transmission possibility, opening a fresh view on COVID-19. It is observed the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via faecal-oral route. Fecal microbiota transplantation may be a hidden source of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 and other factors may significantly alter the composition of gut microbiota. Among others, loss of bacterial diversity, the decrease of commensal microbes as well as the increase of opportunistic pathogens are observed. CONCLUSIONS The alterations of gut microbiota in COVID-19 patients consequently may lead to the development of gut dysbiosis-related diseases even after recovery from COVID-19. Therefore, it is recommended to screen stool samples taken from recovered patients at least 35 days after clearance of virus from respiratory tract. Before 35 days period, SARS-CoV-2 may still be detected in feces. It is also recommended to screen the composition as well as the activity of gut microbiota to assess its balance. In the case of gut dysbiosis, there should be introduced an appropriate method of its modulation. Additionally, all the fecal samples which are prepared for fecal microbiota transplantation should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 to provide protection for its recipients.","output":"COVID-19 - gastrointestinal and gut microbiota-related aspects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need to strengthen global scientific collaboration, and to ensure the fundamental right to universal access to scientific progress and its applications.

The study aimed to explore the relationship between pathogenic microorganisms and the hospital mortality of SAE patients and develop a nomogram for the prediction of hospital mortality in SAE patients. METHODS: The study is a retrospective cohort study. The lasso regression model was used for data dimension reduction and feature selection. Model of hospital mortality of SAE patients was developed by multivariable Cox regression analysis. Calibration and discrimination were used to assess the performance of the nomogram. Decision curve analysis (DCA) to evaluate the clinical utility of the model. RESULTS: Unfortunately, the results of our study did not find intestinal infection and microorganisms of the gastrointestinal (such as: Escherichia coli) that are related to the prognosis of SAE. Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression indicated that factors including respiratory failure, lactate, international normalized ratio (INR), albumin, SpO(2), temperature, and renal replacement therapy were significantly correlated with hospital mortality. The AUC of 0.812 under the nomogram was more than that of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (0.745), indicating excellent discrimination. DCA demonstrated that using the nomogram or including the prognostic signature score status was better than without the nomogram or using the SAPS II at predicting hospital mortality.

The ability of GONC to provide an intrinsic electrochemical signal arising from the reduction of the electrochemically reducible oxygen functionalities present on its surface, allows GONC to be used as a simple and sensitive biosensing platform. Different intrinsic electroactivity of the material was obtained at each step of the genosensing process, starting from the immobilization of a short-stranded DNA probe and followed by the incubation with different concentrations of the target 2019-nCoV DNA strand.

An outbreak of EV71 in South East Asia in 1997 affected over 120,000 people and caused neurological disorders in a few individuals. The control of EV71 infection through public health interventions remains minimal and treatments are only symptomatic. Recently, human scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2) has been reported to be a cellular receptor of EV71. We expressed human SCARB2 gene in NIH3T3 cells (3T3-SCARB2) to study the mechanisms of EV71 entry and infection. We demonstrated that human SCARB2 serves as a cellular receptor for EV71 entry. Disruption of expression of SCARB2 using siRNAs can interfere EV71 infection and subsequent inhibit the expression of viral capsid proteins in RD and 3T3-SCARB2 but not Vero cells. SiRNAs specific to clathrin or dynamin or chemical inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis were all capable of interfering with the entry of EV71 into 3T3-SCARB2 cells. On the other hand, caveolin specific siRNA or inhibitors of caveolae-mediated endocytosis had no effect, confirming that only clathrin-mediated pathway was involved in EV71 infection. Endocytosis of EV71 was also found to be pH-dependent requiring endosomal acidification and also required intact membrane cholesterol. In summary, the mechanism of EV71 entry through SCARB2 as the receptor for attachment, and its cellular entry is through a clathrin-mediated and pH-dependent endocytic pathway.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is one of the most common chronic diseases in older adults. Telehealth is widely used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of older patients and healthcare providers in the application of telehealth and online health information to chronic disease management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study with data generated from 52 individual semi-structured interviews with 29 patients [Law of the Peoples Republic of China on the protection of the rights and interests of older people (2018 Revised Version) = >60 years old] with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 23 healthcare providers.

Both parties set up the interactions in 59% of pairs, followed by mentees being responsible in 24%. Mentors reported experiencing mutual respect (94%), a personal connection (67%), clear expectations (44%), and shared values (44%). Mentees similarly reported mutual respect (94%), shared values (76%), a personal connection (59%) and clear expectations (47%). 96% had mentor/mentee relationship outside ACRO program; however, 62% felt that a formal program is more beneficial than informal opportunities. CONCLUSION The results of our mentorship program highlight the continued interest and need for formal radiation oncology mentorship programs. The major strength of the program has been the high rates of interaction which is based on mutual respect, shared values and personal connection. Areas of future focus includes recruiting more new practitioners and private practice radiation oncologists to help enrich and diversify the mentorship program.","output":"Formalized Mentorship in Radiation Oncology: Bridging Existing Gaps in Mentorship."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is considerable hype about blockchain in almost every industry, including finance, with significant investments globally. We conduct a systematic review of 851 records and construct a final article sample of 183 for the sample period 2012 to 2020 to identify relevant factors for blockchain adoption in corporate governance. We conduct textual and empirical analysis to develop a decentralized autonomous governance framework and link traditional corporate governance theories to blockchain adoption. Furthermore, we explore present and future use cases and implications of blockchains in corporate governance. Using our systematic review and textual analysis, we further identify gaps and common trends between prior academic and industry literature. Moreover, for our empirical analysis, we compile a unique database of blockchain investments to forecast future investments. In addition, we explore blockchain potential in corporate governance during and post COVID-19. We find prior academic articles to mostly focus on regulation (49 studies) and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) (46 studies), while industry articles tend to concentrate on exchanges (10 studies) and cryptocurrencies (9 articles). A significant growth in literature is observed for 2017 and 2018.

If, however, the contact persons of every infected patient could be identified, the number of virus transmissions could be reduced, while the more incisive measures could be softened. For this purpose, contact tracing using smartphones is being considered as a promising technique. Here, smartphones emit and scan for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals for detecting devices in range. When a device is detected, its distance is estimated by evaluating its received signal strength. The main insight that is exploited for distance estimation is that the attenuation of a signal increases with the distance along which it has traveled. However, besides distance, there are multiple additional factors that impact the attenuation and hence disturb distance estimation. Among them, frequency selective hardware and signal propagation belong to the most significant ones. For example, a BLE device transmits beacons on three different frequencies (channels), while the transmit power and the receiver sensitivity depend on the frequency. As a result, the received signal strength varies for each channel, even when the distance remains constant. However, the information on which wireless channel a beacon has been received is not made available to a smartphone. Hence, this error cannot be compensated, e.g., by calibration. In this paper, we for the first time provide a solution to detect the wireless channel on which a packet has been received on a smartphone. We experimentally evaluate our proposed technique on multiple different smartphone models. Our results help to make contact tracing more robust by improving the accuracy of distance estimation.","output":"Identifying the BLE Advertising Channel for Reliable Distance Estimation on Smartphones"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How well can a society and an economy face up to COVID-19 depends, among other factors, on how many jobs can be performed at home. Work from home has the potential to increase firms' productivity and quality of workers' lives regardless of COVID-19, but it can also create new challenges. In this paper, we estimate the share of Czech workers who could work from home, using detailed Czech labour force survey data and an internationally recognised occupational classification methodology. Overall, we apply in the Czech context a methodology developed by Dingel and Neiman and published by the Journal of Public Economics in 2020. Our results show that about one third of Czech workers can perform their jobs from home. This share is comparable with countries at similar per capita income levels and with the share of workers who worked from home in Czechia during COVID-19 in the spring of 2020. The ability to work from home is distributed unequally across sectors, regions and workers' education levels. Whereas around four fifths of workers in the financial or the information technology sectors can work from home, less than one in five workers in agriculture and culture can work from home. Most university-educated workers can work from home, but only one in ten workers with primary education can do so. About a half of the workers in Prague can work from home, while only about a quarter can do so in the rest of the Czech Republic. ? 2021 Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka.

The optimal status of vitamins and microelements is considered crucial for the proper functioning of the immune system and necessary for successful recovery. Most patients with respiratory distress in COVID-19 are vitamin and microelement deficient, with vitamin D and selenium deficiency being the most common. Anyway, various micronutrient supplements are widely and arbitrarily used for prevention or in the treatment of COVID-19. We aimed to summarize current knowledge about molecular and physiological mechanisms of vitamins (D, A, C, B6, B9, B12) and microelements (selenium, zinc, copper, iron) involved in the immune system regulation in consideration with COVID-19 pathogenesis, as well as recent findings related to their usage and effects in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. In the early course of the pandemic, several, mainly observational, studies reported an association of some micronutrients, such as vitamin C, D, and zinc, with severity reduction and survival improvement. Still, emerging randomized controlled trials showed no effect of vitamin D on hospitalization length and no effect of vitamin C and zinc on symptom reduction. Up to date, there is evidence neither for nor against the use of micronutrients in the treatment of COVID-19. The doses that exceed the recommended for the general population and age group should not be used, except in clinical trials.

Variable importance analysis provides the tools to assess the importance of input variables when dealing with complex interactions, making the machine learning model more interpretable and computationally more efficient.

In this article, we present two variable importance techniques, a nonparametric solution, called mh - 2, and a parametric method based on Global Sensitivity Analysis. The mh - 2 employs a multivariate continuous response framework to deal with the multiclass classification problem. Based on the permutation importance framework, the proposed mh - 2 algorithm captures the dissimilarities between the distribution of misclassification errors generated by the base learner, Conditional Inference Tree, before and after permuting the values of the input variable under analysis. The GSA solution is based on the Covariance decomposition methodology for multivariate output models. Both solutions will be assessed in a comparative study of several Random Forest-based techniques with emphasis in the multiclass classification problem with different imbalanced scenarios.

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to shed light on relations between caregiver mental reaction to the pandemic and caregiver distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms, memory impairment progression, and functional impairment of people with neurocognitive disorder during the period of confinement in Greece. METHODS: The study included caregivers of patients with mild (Na=a13) and major (Na=a54) neurocognitive disorder. The caregiver-based telephone interview was based on items of the neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire, the AD8 Dementia Screening Instrument, and the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale. Regarding the mental impact of the COVID-19 crisis on caregivers, four single questions referring to their worries in the last seven days were posed, in addition to the scales Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R). A stepwise linear regression model was employed for studying the relationship between caregiver distress and demographic and clinical data and caregiver mental reaction to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. RESULTS: Caregiver distress severity during the confinement period was influenced not only by memory deficits (pa=a0.009) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (pa< a0.001) of patients, but also by caregiver hyperarousal (pa=a0.003) and avoidance symptoms (pa=a0.033) and worries directly linked to the COVID-19 crisis (pa=a0.022).

The risk of infection in indoor environments is typically modelled using the Wells-Riley model or a Wells-Riley-like formulation, usually assuming the pathogen dose follows a Poisson distribution (mono-pathogen assumption). Aerosols that hold more than one pathogen copy, i.e. poly-pathogen aerosols, break this assumption even if the aerosol dose itself follows a Poisson distribution. For the largest aerosols where the number of pathogen in each aerosol can sometimes be several hundred or several thousand, the effect is non-negligible, especially in diseases where the risk of infection per pathogen is high. Here we report on a generalization of the Wells-Riley model and dose-response models for poly-pathogen aerosols by separately modeling each number of pathogen copies per aerosol, while the aerosol dose itself follows a Poisson distribution. This results in a model for computational risk assessment suitable for mono-/poly-pathogen aerosols. We show that the mono-pathogen assumption significantly overestimates the risk of infection for high pathogen concentrations in the respiratory tract fluid. The model also includes the aerosol removal due to filtering by the individuals which becomes significant for poorly ventilated environments with a high density of individuals, and systematically includes the effects of facemasks in the infectious aerosol source and sink terms and dose calculations.","output":"Risk assessment for airborne disease transmission by poly-pathogen aerosols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have promoted telework to contain the spread of the virus. This massive switch to telework may have an important impact on workers mental health. Research from before the pandemic has shown inconsistent findings on its effect on health, which might be explained by opposing mechanisms underlying this effect (e.g. better work-life balance versus less social support). We aim to enhance our understanding of the impact of telework on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic by investigating the explanatory role of work-home interference (WHI) and social support by colleagues. Methods: Data were collected in a heterogenous sample of 5959 Belgian workers, who participated in at least one of four online surveys during the initial lockdown and a period of initial relaxations of the COVID-19 measures (April-June 2020, time lag of four weeks between measurements). Psychological distress was measured with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), using a threshold of 2/3.

The relationship between maladaptive behaviours in autistic individuals and increase in care burden among their caregivers is also well established. However, no study has yet examined these associations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main aim of this study was to explore the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on autistic individuals and their caregivers. METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted with the caregivers of 58 autistic individuals across the mental health services at Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar. The extent of care burden was measured using the Care Burden Interview, whereas changes in behaviour in autistic individuals was assessed using the Revised Overt Aggression Scale. RESULTS: A total of 58 caregivers participated in the study. Out of these, 24 (41%) reported a clinically significant increase in their care burden. Among caregivers reporting an increase in care burden, two-third were caring for individuals whose behaviour either remained unchanged or improved during social restrictions. Nine autistic people (15.5%) were reported to have no aggression prior to the implementation of COVID-19 social restrictions compared to 13 (22.4%) individuals during COVID-19 social restrictions.

With a large proportion of patients referred to Hospital Eye Services (HES) for diagnostics and disease management, the referral process results in unnecessary referrals from erroneous diagnoses and delays in access to appropriate treatment. A potential solution is a teleophthalmology digital referral pathway linking community optometry and HES. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The HERMES study (Teleophthalmology-enabled and artificial intelligence-ready referral pathway for community optometry referrals of retinal disease: a cluster randomised superiority trial with a linked diagnostic accuracy study) is a cluster randomised clinical trial for evaluating the effectiveness of a teleophthalmology referral pathway between community optometry and HES for retinal diseases. Nested within HERMES is a diagnostic accuracy study, which assesses the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) decision support system (DSS) for automated diagnosis and referral recommendation. A postimplementation, observational substudy, a within-trial economic evaluation and discrete choice experiment will assess the feasibility of implementation of both digital technologies within a real-life setting. Patients with a suspicion of retinal disease, undergoing eye examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, will be recruited across 24 optometry practices in the UK. Optometry practices will be randomised to standard care or teleophthalmology. The primary outcome is the proportion of false-positive referrals (unnecessary HES visits) in the current referral pathway compared with the teleophthalmology referral pathway. OCT scans will be interpreted by the AI DSS, which provides a diagnosis and referral decision and the primary outcome for the AI diagnostic study is diagnostic accuracy of the referral decision made by the Moorfields-DeepMind AI system. Secondary outcomes relate to inappropriate referral rate, cost-effectiveness analyses and humanCcomputer interaction (HCI) analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the LondonBromley Research Ethics Committee (REC 20/LO/1299). Findings will be reported through academic journals in ophthalmology, health services research and HCI.

However, current single cytokine-targeted strategies display limited therapeutic efficacy. Here, we report that peritoneal M2 macrophages-derived extracellular vesicles (M2-EVs) are multi-target nanotherapeutics to resolve cytokine storm. In detail, primary peritoneal M2 macrophages exhibited superior anti-inflammatory potential than immobilized cell lines. Systemically administrated M2-EVs entered major organs and were taken up by phagocytes (e.g., macrophages). M2-EVs treatment effectively reduced excessive cytokine (e.g., TNF- and IL-6) release in vitro and in vivo, thereby attenuated oxidative stress and multiple organ (lung, liver, spleen and kidney) damage in endotoxin-induced cytokine storm. Moreover, M2-EVs simultaneously inhibited multiple key proinflammatory pathways (e.g., NF-B, JAK-STAT and p38 MAPK) by regulating complex miRNA-gene and gene-gene networks, and this effect was collectively mediated by many functional cargos (miRNAs and proteins) in EVs. In addition to the direct anti-inflammatory role, human peritoneal M2-EVs expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and thus could serve as nanodecoys to prevent SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in vitro. As cell-derived nanomaterials, the therapeutic index of M2-EVs can be further improved by genetic/chemical modification or loading with specific drugs.

Patients awaiting cardiopulmonary transplantation form a vulnerable group at increased risk because of their end stage cardiovascular or respiratory disease. We evaluated the impact of COVID pandemic on our transplant program. Methods We retrospectively reviewed our adult and paediatric heart and lung transplant activity from 2015. We assessed deaths on the active waiting list between Jan - 27th May for each yearly period and compared our transplant activity for each financial year up to April 2020 and our activity between Jan - 27th May 2020 (the first UK pandemic peak) comparing this to the same period over the last five years. This allowed us to directly compare the effect of COVID with previous years activity. Results A total of 19 heart patients died during Jan to 27th May 2020. Out of the total deaths 4 were from paediatric group, 11 were post-transplant and 5 on the active list. There were no cardiac deaths related to COVID 19. The total deaths during the same period were 19, 24, 20 and 32 in the years 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. A total of 41 lung patients died during Jan to 27th May 2020. Out of the total 11 were on the active list awaiting transplant and 19 were post-transplant deaths. Of these 2 were COVID deaths. The corresponding deaths during year 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 46, 51, 49 and 46 respectively. Transplant activity from Jan to 27th May in 2016-19 averaged 32 (16 hearts,16 lungs); activity during the same time period in 2020 was 4 lungs and 13 hearts, clearly affected by reduced activity due to COVID19. Conclusion This audit does not suggest a significant rise in mortality due to the COVID 19 pandemic in vulnerable patients either pre or post-transplantation.

The impact on mortality of this patients burden has not been determined. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Through retrieval of administrative data from a large referral hospital of Northern Italy, we determined Aalen-Johansen cumulative incidence curves to describe the in-hospital mortality, stratified by fixed covariates. Age- and sex-adjusted Cox models were used to quantify the effect on mortality of variables deemed to reflect the stress on the hospital system, namely the time-dependent number of daily admissions and of total hospitalized patients, and the calendar period. Of the 1225 subjects hospitalized for COVID-19 between February 20 and May 13, 283 died (30-day mortality rate 24%) after a median follow-up of 14 days (interquartile range 5C19). Hospitalizations increased progressively until a peak of 465 subjects on March 26, then declined. The risk of death, adjusted for age and sex, increased for a higher number of daily admissions (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] per an incremental daily admission of 10 patients: 1.13, 95% Confidence Intervals [CI] 1.05C1.22, p = 0.0014), and for a higher total number of hospitalized patients (AHR per an increase of 50 patients in the total number of hospitalized subjects: 1.11, 95%CI 1.04C1.17, p = 0.0004), while was lower for the calendar period after the peak (AHR 0.56, 95%CI 0.43C0.72, p<0.0001). A validation was conducted on a dataset from another hospital where 500 subjects were hospitalized for COVID-19 in the same period. Figures were consistent in terms of impact of daily admissions, daily census, and calendar period on in-hospital mortality.

We present our experience in transvesical laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (T-LESS) removal of eroded materials, and a review of the literature in this field. MATERIALS AND METHODS From June 2015 to May 2017 eight females, with an average age of 66.5 years (range 55-80 years), were referred to our Center because of the erosion of polypropylene material in the bladder, after anti-incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse treatment. Patients were diagnosed with ultrasound and cystoscopy. Seven bladder erosions and one bladder and urethral penetration were found. Patients were qualified for removal with the T-LESS approach. The Tri-Port + disposable set and standard laparoscopic instruments were used. The eroded materials were dissected and cut away, and the defects of the bladder wall were closed with barbed sutures. The peri-operative efficacy and safety of the method were assessed, and the patients were scheduled for follow-up visits at 6 weeks and every 3 months thereafter. The patients were offered a cystoscopic exam during the 7-10 month period after the operation. RESULTS The procedures were completed successfully in all patients. No blood loss or complications were observed. The mean operative time was 54.5 min, and the average hospital stay was 30 h. During a follow-up at 11 months, all patients were cured, except for one who presented urethral erosion. CONCLUSIONS The T-LESS technique for removal of eroded meshes is a safe and effective method.

In the emergency department (ED), patients who need supplemental oxygen or respiratory support are admitted to the hospital, but the course of normoxic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. In our health system, the policy during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was to admit all patients with abnormal chest imaging (CXR) regardless of their oxygen level. We also admitted febrile patients with respiratory complaints who resided in congregate living. We describe the rate of decompensation among patients admitted with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection but who were not hypoxemic in the ED. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of patients admitted to our health system between March 1CMay 5, 2020 with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We queried our registry to find patients who were admitted to the hospital but had no recorded oxygen saturation of <92% in the ED and received no supplemental oxygen prior to admission. Our primary outcome was decompensation at 72 hours, defined by the need for respiratory support (oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation, or intubation). RESULTS: A total of 840 patients met our inclusion criteria. Of those patients, 376 (45%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sixty patients (7.1%) with suspected COVID-19 required respiratory support at 72 hours including 27 (3%) of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Among the 376 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 54 patients (14%) had normal CXR in the ED. One-third of patients with normal CXRs decompensated at 72 hours. Seven SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in our cohort died during their hospitalization, of whom five had normal CXRs on admission.

Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of 235 randomly selected patients admitted to a major health care system with a diagnosis of PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Severe disease was defined as the presence of any of the following: respiratory rate 30, oxygen saturation 89% at rest, requirement of mechanical ventilation, non-respiratory organ failure, septic shock, or death. Presence of these symptoms were assessed for each patient upon initial presentation to the emergency department, and in their overall hospital course. Socioeconomic status was estimated by extrapolating US census data for median household income from each patients zip code. Household incomes were then separated into quintiles. The percentage of patients within each quintile who were severe upon presentation and severe overall was determined. Demographic data for each subject was collected and logistic regression was used to control for confounding variables. Results: Of the 235 patients, the income quintiles were as follows: q1: <source -38,100;q2: $38,101-46,700;q3: $46,701-56,600;q4: $56,601-72,000;q5: $72,001+. The population was 43% White, 24% American Indian or Alaska Native, 19% Black, 5% Asian, 1% Pacific Islander, 1% Middle Eastern, and 8% two or more races. 27% of the study population was of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Using a logistic regression to control for confounding variables, a statistically significant association was seen between median income and likelihood of severe disease on presentation (odds ratio with each increasing quintile 0.80;95% CI 0.66-0.96) as well as between median income and likelihood of severe disease overall (odds ratio with each increasing quintile 0.74;95% CI 0.59-0.93). Severe disease upon presentation to the emergency department was associated with a longer length of stay (3.6 days longer on average, p = 0.002) and an increased likelihood of death (odds ratio 3.6;95% CI 1.58-8.02). Conclusions: Lower socioeconomic status as measured by median household income for a persons home zip code is associated with a higher rate of severe COVID-19 disease both on presentation to the emergency department and during their overall hospital course. For each 1-quintile increase in median household income, the odds of severe disease on presentation decreases by 20% (p = 0.018) and the odds of severe disease overall decreases by 26% (p = 0.009).

This work provides molecular scale information into sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and NaOH ion-pairing processes to provide a physical basis for later development of thermodynamic models. Solubility isotherms of NaNO2 in aqueous mixtures with NaOH and total alkalinity were also measured. Spectroscopic characterization of these solutions utilized high-field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Raman spectroscopy, with additional solution structure detailed by X-ray total scattering pairwise distribution function analysis (X-ray PDF). Despite the NO2- deformation Raman band's insensitivity to added NaOH in saturated NaNO2 solutions, 23Na and 15N NMR studies indicated the Na+ and NO2- chemical environments change likely due to ion pairing. The ion pairing correlates with a decrease in diffusion coefficient of solution species as measured by pulsed field gradient 23Na and 1H NMR. Two-dimensional correlation analyses of the 2800-4000 cm-1 Raman region and X-ray PDF indicated that saturated NaNO2 and NaOH mixtures disrupt the hydrogen network of water into a new structure where the length of the OO correlations is contracted relative to the typical H2O structure.

We recently encountered two cases of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens showing atypical amplification curves in the RT-qPCR. METHODS: We performed whole-genome sequencing of 63 samples (2 showing aberrant RT-qPCR curve and 61 samples infected with SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously in the same area) followed by Phylogenetic tree analysis. RESULTS: We found that the viruses showing abnormal RT-qPCR curves were Delta-type variants of SARS-CoV-2 with a single nucleotide mutation in the probe-binding site. There were no other cases with the same mutation, indicating that the variant had not spread in the area. After searching the database, hundreds of variants were reported globally, and one in Japan contained the same mutation. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the variant was very close to other Delta variants endemic in Japan but quite far from the variants containing the same mutation reported from outside Japan, suggesting sporadic generation of mutant in some domestic areas. CONCLUSIONS: These findings propose two key points: i) mutations in the region used for SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR can cause abnormal amplification curves, and ii) various mutations can be generated sporadically and unpredictably; therefore, efficient and robust screening systems are needed to promptly monitor the emergence of de novo variants.","output":"A SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant containing mutation in the probe binding region used for RT-qPCR test in Japan exhibited atypical PCR amplification and might induce false negative result"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context-sensitive fusion grammars are a special case of context-dependent fusion grammars where a rule has only a single positive context condition instead of finite sets of positive and negative context conditions. They generate hypergraph languages from start hypergraphs via successive applications of context-sensitive fusion rules and multiplications of connected components, as well as a filtering mechanism to extract terminal hypergraphs from derived hypergraphs in a certain way. The application of a context-sensitive fusion rule consumes two complementarily labeled hyperedges and identifies corresponding attachment vertices provided that the context condition holds. In this paper, we show that the Post correspondence problem can be formulated very intuitively by such a grammar.

The questionnaire comprised three main components: (1) demographic information, previous working experience, actual working schedule; (2) individual chronotype, either calculated by Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ); (3) self-perception of risk of medication error. RESULTS Midwives (n = 401) responded \\"yes, at least once\\" to the question dealing with self-perception of risk of medication error in 48.1% of cases. Cluster analysis showed that perception of risk of medication errors was associated with class of age 31-35 years, shift work schedule, working experience 6-10 years, and Intermediate-type MEQ score. CONCLUSIONS Perception of the risk of medication errors is present in near one out of two midwives in Italy. In particular, younger midwives with lower working experience, engaged in shift work, and belonging to an Intermediate chronotype, seem to be at higher risk of potential medication error. Since early morning hours seem to represent highest risk frame for female healthcare workers, shift work is not always aligned with individual circadian preference.

We proposed a new theoretical explanation about the model for dust cake formation and growth, especially for the compression model at higher filtration superficial velocities in dynamic granular filters. The thickness and porosity of dust cakes can be estimated by formulas. Then, the effects of cake formation and growth on filtration performance were examined. It is found that there is an optimum thickness of the cake at which the dynamic granular filter achieves excellent collection efficiency with low system resistance. Moreover, an increasing pattern of pressure drop with cake thickness under different filtration superficial velocities was observed. Experimental results show that the pressure drops across the filter system and dust cake increase exponentially with increasing filtration superficial velocity. An appropriate filtration superficial velocity should be considered to achieve optimum filtration performance in dynamic granular filters. It is expected that the results of this study could provide useful information on designing dynamic granular filters for removal of dust particulates in Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC) and Pressurized Fluidized-Bed Combustion (PFBC).","output":"Experimental study of dust deposition in dynamic granular filters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In addition to human cases, cases of COVID-19 in captive animals and pets are increasingly reported.

METHODS: A multicentric retrospective case series study based on administrative databases that included all COVID-19 cases admitted in 19 Spanish hospitals from 1 March to 15 April 2020. Socio-demographic data were collected. Outcomes were critical care admission and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: We included 10,110 COVID-19 patients admitted to 18 Spanish hospitals (median age 68 (IQR 54C80) years old; 44.5% female; 14.8% were not born in Spain). Among these, 779 (7.7%) cases were admitted to critical care units and 1678 (16.6%) patients died during the hospitalization. Age, male gender, being immigrant, and low hospital saturation were independently associated with being admitted to an intensive care unit. Age, male gender, being immigrant, percentile of average per capita income, and hospital experience were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.

However, intracorporeal knot-tying under direct laparoscopy is difficult and requires proficiency. We conducted a retrospective study comparing the results of a long unidirectional barbed suturing technique (with V-Loc180 suture) and the results of conventional suturing as applied to laparoscopic myomectomy. METHODS In women who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy in our university hospital between January 2011 and April 2013, uninterrupted suturing of 2 or more layers was performed. These women were divided into 2 groups according to the method of suturing: those in whom standard absorbable sutures were used (group P, n =42) and those in whom our suturing technique was used (group V, n =41). Patient characteristics and surgical variables were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS No significant between-group difference was observed in age (p = .975), body mass index (p = .778), GnRHa administration (p = .059), intraoperative vasopressin dose (p = .364), intraoperative blood loss (73.8  64.1 vs. 59.3  54.0 mL, respectively; p = .199), myoma mass (212.6  133.3 vs. 208.3  198.4 g, respectively; p = .134), Hb (p = .517), or postoperative hospital stay (p = .314).

No patient required intraoperative transfusion or conversion to laparotomy.

First, a novel mutation-immune model is proposed to modify the classical SIR model to simulate the transmission of mutable viruses that can be permanently immunized in small-world networks. Then, the influences of the size, coordination number and disorder parameter of the small-world network on the spread of the epidemic are analyzed in detail. Finally, the influences of mutation cycle and infection rate on epidemic transmission in small-world network are investigated further. The results show that the structure of the small-world network and the virus mutation cycle have an important impact on the spread of the epidemic. For viruses that can be permanently immunized, virus mutation is equivalent to making the immune cycle of human beings from infinite to finite. The dynamical behavior of the modified SIR epidemic model changes from an irregular, low-amplitude evolution at small disorder parameter to a spontaneous state of wide amplitude oscillations at large disorder parameter. Moreover, similar transition can also be found in increasing mutation cycle parameter. The maximum valid variation mutation decreases with the increase of disorder parameter and coordination number, but increase with respect to system size. In addition above, as the infection rate increases, the fraction of the infected increases and then decreases. As the mutation cycle increases, the time-average fraction of the infected and the infection rate corresponding to the maximum time-average fraction of the infected also decrease.

Others have been indirectly affected; for example, there has been a startling increase in hunger brought about by the pandemic. Many countries have sought to relieve this problem through public policy. This research examines the effectiveness of enhanced Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in the U.S. to alleviate hunger. METHODS: Using a biweekly cross-sectional survey and corresponding population weights from the U.S. Census Bureau, we estimate the effects of enhanced SNAP benefits on hunger in the U.S. as measured by food insufficiency. We use a Bayesian structural time series analysis to predict counterfactual values of food insufficiency. We supplement these findings by examining the effect of enhanced SNAP benefits on observed visits to a food pantry network in a midsized U.S. city. FINDINGS: Our primary finding estimates that nationwide a total 850,000 (95% credible interval 024C146 million) instances of food insufficiency were prevented per week by the 15 percent increase in SNAP benefits enacted in January 2021. Secondarily, we find similar effects associated with SNAP benefit increases and local food pantry visits. Specifically, enhanced SNAP benefits resulted in fewer visits to the food pantry network than were predicted in the counterfactual model. INTERPRETATION: These results not only indicate that the policies enacted to mitigate hunger caused by the COVID-19 pandemic helped, but also quantifies how much these benefits helped on a national scale. As a result, policymakers can use this data to benchmark future policy actions at scale.

The incidence domination was likely due to a fitness advantage that could be driven by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) residue change (N501Y), which also emerged independently in other variants of concern such as the beta/B.1.351 and gamma/P.1 strains. Here, we present a functional characterization of the alpha/B.1.1.7 variant and show an eightfold affinity increase towards human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). In accordance with this, transgenic hACE2 mice showed a faster disease progression and severity after infection with a low dose of B.1.1.7, compared to an early 2020 SARS-CoV-2 isolate. When challenged with sera from convalescent individuals or anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies, the N501Y variant showed a minor, but significant elevated evasion potential of ACE-2/RBD antibody neutralization.

Researchers have employed a range of assessment instruments to evaluate quality of life among polio survivors. Hence, to select the appropriate scale, it is crucial to compare the contents and psychometric properties of these instruments. PURPOSE This scoping review explores quality of life instruments that are used in polio literature and analyzes their contents and psychometric properties using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) criteria. METHOD Using the Arksey and O'Malley framework, we conducted a literature search in the following electronic databases Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar to identify relevant studies that focused on quality of life of polio survivors. Of the 88 articles that qualify for full-text screening, 34 studies met our inclusion criteria. Two independent reviewers extracted data from the selected studies via Covidence, a reference manager that allows for blinding of reviews. RESULTS Most of the instruments included in this review are generic, self-reported, and multidimensional. Despite having mostly adequate psychometric properties, these properties were not evaluated in polio survivors. CONCLUSION The information provided in this review could be used to guide instrument selection and identify the need to develop a new tool or to adapt a pre-existing scale for measuring quality of life among polio survivors.","output":"Quality of life assessment scales in polio survivors: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A vital arm of the innate immune response to viral infection is the induction and subsequent antiviral effects of interferon (IFN). Rotavirus reduces type I IFN induction in infected cells by the degradation of IFN regulatory factors. Here, we show that the monkey rotavirus RRV and human rotavirus Wa also block gene expression induced by type I and II IFNs through a mechanism allowing signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 activation but preventing their nuclear accumulation. In infected cells, this may allow rotavirus to block the antiviral actions of IFN produced early in infection or by activated immune cells. As the intracellular expression of rotavirus nonstructural proteins NSP1, NSP3, and NSP4 individually did not inhibit IFN-stimulated gene expression, their involvement in this process is unlikely. RRV and Wa rotaviruses also prevented the tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated nuclear accumulation of NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-driven gene expression. In addition, NF-kappaB was activated by rotavirus infection, confirming earlier findings by others. As NF-kappaB is important for the induction of IFN and other cytokines during viral infection, this suggests that rotavirus prevents cellular transcription as a means to evade host responses. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of this strategy by a double-stranded RNA virus.","output":"Rotavirus antagonizes cellular antiviral responses by inhibiting the nuclear accumulation of STAT1, STAT2, and NF-kappaB."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The journal Microbes and Infection is celebrating its vigintennial anniversary and has reunited for this occasion two dozen reviews illustrating achievements of the past as well as future challenges in the field of infectious diseases.

Providing quality care service of neonatal resuscitation reduces neonatal mortality. However, challenges to providing quality neonatal resuscitation are not well investigated in Ethiopia. Hence, this study is conducted to assess the quality provision of neonatal resuscitation in Ethiopia. METHOD: We used data from the Ethiopian 2016 Emergency Obstetric Newborn Care survey, conducted in 3804 health facilities providing maternal and newborn health services. We described the quality of neonatal resuscitation services according to the structure, process and outcome triad of quality dimension. Data from registers and birth records for the last 12 months prior to the survey were extracted. In each facility, the three last eligible charts of resuscitated neonates were reviewed and the highest frequency of chart of resuscitated baby was considered to the analysis. Thus, a total of 555 charts were assessed. Logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between the neonatal resuscitation processes, provider, facility and newborn characteristics with neonatal outcome at the time of discharge. RESULTS: The finding suggested that, around two-third, 364(65.6%) of the asphyxiated babies resuscitated by bag and mask type of neonatal resuscitation. Of the babies who had got neonatal resuscitation 463 (83.4%) survived. Resuscitated neonates with a gestational age of greater than 37 weeks and above (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) =1.82; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (1.09C3.04)), availability of priority equipment in health facilities for neonatal resuscitation (AOR = 1.24, 95% CI (1.09, 1.54)) and women who had 12 h and less duration of labor (AOR = 1.76; 95% CI (1.23, 3.13)) were the independent factors of survival of the neonate. CONCLUSION: Only half of the health facilities were ready for neonatal resuscitation (NR) in terms of priority equipments. However, eight out of ten babies survived after NR in Ethiopia. Gestational age, priority equipment for NR and duration of labor were determinants of survival of resuscitated neonates in Ethiopia. Therefore, the availability of priority equipment and attentive care and follow-up for premature neonates and those face prolonged labor need to be improved in Ethiopia.","output":"Quality of neonatal resuscitation in Ethiopia: implications for the survival of neonates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objective: The prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on mental health, which has emerged as a major public health issue around the world. This study aimed to analyze trends and network structure of grow-your-own (GYO) through Instagram, one of the most influential social media platforms, to encourage and sustain home gardening activities for promotion of emotional support and physical health. Methods: A total of 6,388 posts including keyword hashtags #gyo and #growyourown on Instagram from June 13, 2020 to April 13, 2021 were collected. Word embedding was performed using Word2Vec library, and 7 clusters were identified with K-means clustering: GYO, garden and gardening, allotment, kitchen garden, sustainability, urban gardening, etc. Moreover, we conducted social network analysis to determine the centrality of related words and visualized the results using Gephi 0.9.2. Results: The analysis showed that various combinations of words, such as #growourrownfood, #growourrownveggies, and #growwhatyoueat revealed preference and interest of users in GYO, and appeared to encourage their activities on Instagram. In particular, #gardeningtips, #greenfingers, #goodlife, #gardeninglife, #gardensofinstagram were found to express positive emotions and pride as a gardener by sharing their daily gardening lives. Users were participating in urban gardening through #allotment, #raisedbeds, #kitchengarden and we could identify trends toward self-sufficiency and sustainable living.

Our aim was to conduct a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of azithromycin in reducing exacerbations in asthma, and the sub-phenotypes of non-eosinophilic asthma, eosinophilic asthma and severe asthma. METHOD We completed a systematic search of EMBASE, Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrails.gov and reference lists of previous systematic reviews in February 2019. We included parallel-group double-blind randomised controlled trials in adults comparing at least 8 weeks of azithromycin treatment with placebo, where the outcome of exacerbations was assessed over at least 6 months. Data were extracted from published sources, Cochrane risk of bias tool was applied and IPD were sought from authors. Reviews were undertaken in duplicate. We conducted an IPD meta-analysis on the primary outcome of exacerbations and a random effects meta-analysis for secondary outcomes. PROSPERO registration: CRD42018075259.

This study aimed to 1) investigate the impact of living with a person infected with SARS-CoV-2; 2) understand how household members implemented infection control recommendations in their home; and 3) identify the information and support needs of household members. METHODS: For this observational mixed-methods study, households with a person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited via drive-through testing sites of Municipal Health Services, healthcare worker screening or hospital emergency visits in the University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands and via primary care physicians, hospital emergency visits or preoperative screening in the University Hospital of Antwerp, Belgium. We recorded household characteristics, including characteristics of all household members, together with their views on prevention measures. In a subset of households one adult household member was asked to participate in an interview investigating their views on preventive measures. Survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics and interview data by rapid framework analysis. A triangulation protocol was used to integrate findings. RESULTS: Thirty-four households (120 household members) were included in the quantitative survey. Twenty-two households were invited to be interviewed, of which 18 completed an interview (response 81.8%). Survey data showed that almost all households implemented some preventive measures, the use of face masks being least frequently reported. Measures taken depended on what was physically possible, the perceived severity of illness of the index patient and to what extent household members were willing to limit social interaction. Respondents did not believe in the effectiveness of wearing face masks within the house, and from the interviews this was explained by media coverage of face masks, impracticality and the stigma associated with wearing masks. Interviewees reported that quarantine had a high emotional burden and wished to have more information about the exact duration of quarantine, their own COVID-19 status, symptoms and when to seek medical help. CONCLUSION: People were willing to implement prevention measures, however actual adherence depended on perceived severity of illness and the perceived risk of becoming infected. Homes are social environments and recommendations for infection prevention should account for this context. Incorporating our findings into policy making could provide households with more relevant and actionable advice.","output":"Experiences and needs of persons living with a household member infected with SARS-CoV-2: A mixed method study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has created unique challenges to healthcare systems throughout the world.

The causative pathogen is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Novel therapeutic agents are desperately needed. Because of the frequent mutations in the virus and its ability to cause cytokine storms, targeting the viral proteins has some drawbacks. Targeting cellular factors or pivotal inflammatory pathways triggered by SARS-CoV-2 may produce a broader range of therapies. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) might be beneficial against SARS-CoV-2 because of its anti-inflammatory and antiviral characteristics and possible ability to regulate crucial host factors. However, the mechanism underlying how GA regulates host factors remains to be determined. Methods: In our report, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis to identify possible GA targets, biological functions, protein-protein interactions, transcription-factor-gene interactions, transcription-factor-miRNA coregulatory networks, and the signaling pathways of GA against COVID-19. Results: Protein-protein interactions and network analysis showed that ICAM1, MMP9, TLR2, and SOCS3 had higher degree values, which may be key targets of GA for COVID-19. GO analysis indicated that the response to reactive oxygen species was significantly enriched. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the IL-17, IL-6, TNF-, IFN signals, complement system, and growth factor receptor signaling are the main pathways. The interactions of TF genes and miRNA with common targets and the activity of TFs were also recognized. Conclusions: GA may inhibit COVID-19 through its anti-oxidant, anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory effects, and its ability to activate the immune system, and targeted therapy for those pathways is a predominant strategy to inhibit the cytokine storms triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Glycyrrhizic Acid for COVID-19: Findings of Targeting Pivotal Inflammatory Pathways Triggered by SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of COVID-19 changed the use and delivery of health care services, requiring an abrupt shift in treatment and staffing models (1)(,)(2).

However, disparities between guidelines and nurses' practice are frequently reported, which undermines the implementation of these guidelines into practice. This article explores the experience of frontline emergency nurses regarding guideline implementation and provides an in\\\\depth account of their strategies in bridging guideline\\\\practice gaps. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive design was used. METHODS: Semi\\\\structured, face\\\\to\\\\face, individual interviews were conducted between November 2013CMay 2014.

However, many medical schools do not offer this as a mandatory curriculum, or minimize it. Sexual health as an academic area was introduced in the 1970s, but there have been few cohort evaluations of its impact. This was limited by the availability of few psychometric scales for evaluation. We evaluated the full, mandatory, sexual health course in year 1 medicine at a large state university in the Midwest US, including the course with lectures; panels and tutorials; a video app to give students feedback on their sexual history taking skills; and a 3-station sexual history OSCE at the end of the course. RESULTS: Seventy-four medical students (43% of the course cohort) volunteered, for an incentive, to complete evaluation materials pre- and post-course. We used the Sexual Health Education for Professionals Scale (SHEPS), designed and with appropriate psychometric standardization for such evaluation. The SHEPS data covers 7-point Likert scale ratings of 37 patient situations, asking first how well the student could communicate with such a patient, and on the second part how much knowledge they have to care for such a patient. The third subscale examines personal sexual attitudes and beliefs. Data indicated that the matched pretest-posttest ratings for skills and knowledge were all statistically significant and with very large effect sizes. Few of the attitude subscale items were significant and if so, had small effect sizes. Sexual attitudes and beliefs may be well-formed before entry into medical school, and sexual health teaching and learning has minimal effect on sexual attitudes in this US sample. However, using the 3 sexuality OSCE cases scores as outcomes, two of the 26 attitude-belief items predicted > 24% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: The sexual health course produced major changes in Communications with patients sexual health skills and Knowledge of sexual health, but little change in personal Attitudes about sexuality.

Some adolescents who tend to use Internet excessively have a poorer health status, and engage in more risky behaviors than others. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the predictor role of Internet addiction in high- risk behaviors and the general health status among adolescences. METHODS: This was a descriptive-analytical study of structural equation modeling, conducted on 300 students of Alborz University of Medical Sciences. The multi-stage sampling method was used to identify the number of students aged 19C21 years studying in each faculty in the first stage and convenience sampling was used in the second stage. Data were collected using Iranian Adolescents Risk-taking Scale (IARS), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) and the Young's Internet Addiction Test (YIAT). The data were analyzed using LISREL version 8.8. RESULTS: The results of the measurement model using LISREL software showed a goodness of fit for the conceptual model. Internet addiction had a significant direct positive effect on the adolescents' high-risk behaviors ( = 0.17). Also, Internet addiction had a significant positive effect on the adolescents' general health status ( = 0.33) and general health problems increased by 0.33 per unit of Internet use. The result of structural model revealed no significant effects of general health on high-risk behaviors. Based on the value of the variance determined, Internet addiction could predict 11% of general health. Also, general health and Internet addiction together could predict 2.7% of high- risk behaviors. CONCLUSION: Given the effect of Internet addiction on the general health and high-risk behavior, it is recommended that adolescents will be screened about internet addiction and the necessary training is given to the adolescents on the appropriate use of Internet.

The high morbidity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) make it a significant threat to global public health. Elucidating its pathogenesis is essential to finding effective therapy. A retrospective study was conducted on 71 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Data on cytokines, T lymphocytes, and other clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected from patients with variable disease severity. The effects of cytokines on the overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of patients were analyzed. The critically severe and severe patients had higher infection indexes and significant multiple organ function abnormalities than the mild patients (P < 0.05). IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly higher in the critically severe patients than in the severe and mild patients (P < 0.05). IL-6 and IL-10 were closely associated with white blood cells, neutrophils, T lymphocyte subsets, D-D dimer, blood urea nitrogen, complement C1q, procalcitonin C-reactive protein. Moreover, the IL-6 and IL-10 levels were closely correlated to dyspnea and dizziness (P < 0.05). The patients with higher IL-10 levels had shorter OS than the group with lower levels (P < 0.05). The older patients with higher levels of single IL-6 or IL-10 tended to have shorter EFS (P < 0.05), while the patients who had more elevated IL-6 and IL-10 had shorter OS (P < 0.05).

Typically, TMB is evaluated by comprehensive genomic profiling but this requires use of finite tissue specimens and costly, time-consuming laboratory processes. Histologic subtype classification represents an established component of lung adenocarcinoma histopathology, but can be challenging and is associated with substantial inter-pathologist variability. Here we developed a deep learning system to both classify histologic patterns in lung adenocarcinoma and predict TMB status using de-identified Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images. We first trained a convolutional neural network to map histologic features across whole slide images of lung cancer resection specimens. On evaluation using an external data source, this model achieved patch-level area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78-0.98 across nine histologic features. We then integrated the output of this model with clinico-demographic data to develop an interpretable model for TMB classification. The resulting end-to-end system was evaluated on 172 held out cases from TCGA, achieving an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.63-0.80). The benefit of using histologic features in predicting TMB is highlighted by the significant improvement this approach offers over using the clinical features alone (AUC of 0.63 [95% CI 0.53-0.72], p = 0.002). Furthermore, we found that our histologic subtype-based approach achieved performance similar to that of a weakly supervised approach (AUC of 0.72 [95% CI 0.64-0.80]). Together these results underscore that incorporating histologic patterns in biomarker prediction for lung cancer provides informative signals, and that interpretable approaches utilizing these patterns perform comparably with less interpretable, weakly supervised approaches.","output":"Comparative analysis of machine learning approaches to classify tumor mutation burden in lung adenocarcinoma using histopathology images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with a wide range of acute and chronic health effects, including increased risk of respiratory infection. However, evidence specifically related to novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is limited. METHODS: COVID-19 case counts for 111 Canadian health regions were obtained from the COVID-19 Canada Open Data portal. Annual PM2.5 data for 2000-2016 were estimated from a national exposure surface based on remote sensing, chemical transport modelling and ground observations, and minimum and maximum temperature data for 2000-2015 were based on a national interpolated surface derived from thin-plate smoothing splines. Population counts and sociodemographic data by health region were obtained from the 2016 census, and health data (self-rated health and prevalence of smoking, obesity, and selected chronic diseases) by health region, were obtained from the Canadian Community Health Survey. Data on total number of COVID-19 tests and changes in mobility comparing post-vs. pre-introduction of social distancing measures were available by province. Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression models. RESULTS: After controlling for province, temperature, demographic and health characteristics and days since peak incidence by health region, long-term PM2.5 exposure exhibited a positive association with COVID-19 incidence (incidence rate ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.97-1.18 per g/m3). This association was larger in magnitude and statistically significant in analyses excluding provinces that reported cases only for aggregated health regions, excluding health regions with less than median population density, and restricted to the most highly affected provinces (Quebec and Ontario). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a positive association between COVID-19 incidence and long-term PM2.5 exposure in Canadian health regions. The association was larger in magnitude and statistically significant in more highly affected health regions and those with potentially less exposure measurement error.

Few studies on this subject are found in the municipal nursing home setting, and causes need to be identified. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions of errors connected to medication management in nursing homes by exploring the perspective of first-line registered nurses, registered nurses, and non-licensed staff involved in the care of older persons. METHODS: A qualitative research approach was applied based on semi-structured interviews with 21 participants at their workplaces: Seven in each of the occupational categories of first-line registered nurses, registered nurses, and non-licensed staff. Subcategories were derived from transcribed interviews by content analysis and categorized according to the Man, Technology, and Organization concept of error causation, which is as a framework to identify errors. RESULTS: Mistakes in medication management were commonly perceived as a result of human shortcomings and deficiencies in working conditions such as the lack of safe tools to facilitate and secure medication management. The delegation of drug administration to non-licensed staff, the abandonment of routines, carelessness, a lack of knowledge, inadequate verbal communication between colleagues, and a lack of understanding of the difficulties involved in handling the drugs were all considered as risk areas for errors. Organizational hazards were related to the ability to control the delegation, the standard of education, and safety awareness among staff members. Safety issues relating to technology involved devices for handling prescription cards and when staff were not included in the development process of new technological aids. A lack of staff and the lack of time to act safely in the care of the elderly were also perceived as safety hazards, particularly with the non-licensed staff working in nursing homes. CONCLUSIONS: The staff working in nursing homes perceive that the risks due to medication management are mainly caused by human limitations or technical deficiencies.

The effectiveness of tFUS on human brain has been demonstrated, but how tFUS influences the human voluntary motor processing in the brain remains unclear.

RESULTS The ESI illustrates the ultrasound modulated MRCP source dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolutions. The MRCP source is imaged and its source profile is further evaluated for assessing the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on the voluntary MRCP. Moreover, the effect of ultrasound pulse repetition frequency (UPRF) is further assessed in modulating the MRCP. The ESI results show that tFUS significantly increases the MRCP source profile amplitude (MSPA) comparing to a sham ultrasound condition, and further, a high UPRF enhances the MSPA more than a low UPRF does.

Airway management and other head and neck procedures risk exposure to mucosal surfaces, secretions, droplets, and aerosols that may harbor the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This review provides guidance on optimal practice approaches for performing patient evaluation and management of head and neck procedures with the shared goal of providing safe and effective patient care while minimizing the risk of viral transmission. METHODS: The scientific literature was evaluated, focusing on strategies to reduce risk to health care workers involved in airway management and head and neck surgery. The search strategy involved curating consensus statements and guidelines relating to COVID-19 or prior coronavirus outbreaks in relation to aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) and other high-risk procedures, with the search restricted to the scope of head and neck anesthesia. A multidisciplinary team analyzed the findings, using iterative virtual communications through video conference, telephone, email, and shared online documents until consensus was achieved, loosely adapted from the Delphi technique. Items without consensus were so indicated or removed from the manuscript. RESULTS: Health care worker infection and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and prior outbreaks mandate robust standards for infection control. Most head and neck anesthesiology procedures generate aerosols, and algorithms may be modified to mitigate risks. Examples include preoxygenation before induction of anesthesia, rapid sequence induction, closing circuits expeditiously, and consideration of apneic technique for surgical entry of airway. Rescue measures are also modified, with supraglottic airways elevated in the difficult airway algorithm to minimize the need for bag mask ventilation. Personal protective equipment for AGPs include fit-tested N95 mask (or purified air positive respirator), gloves, goggles, and gown for patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Meticulous donning and doffing technique, minimizing personnel and room traffic, diligent hand hygiene, and social distancing all can decrease risks. Perioperative management approaches may differ from commonly employed patterns including avoidance of techniques such as jet ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen and instead utilizing techniques with a closed ventilatory circuit and secured endotracheal tube, minimizing open suctioning, and preventing aerosolization at emergence. Recommendations are made for the following head and neck procedures and considerations: primary airway management; high-flow nasal oxygen delivery; jet ventilation for laryngotracheal surgery; awake intubation; transnasal skull base surgery; tracheostomy; and use of personal protective equipment. COVID-19 testing may facilitate decision making, but it is currently often unavailable and urgency of surgical treatment must be considered. CONCLUSIONS: During pandemics, head and neck anesthesia and surgical teams have a duty to not only provide high quality patient care but also to ensure the safety of the health care team. Several specific perioperative approaches are recommended that have some variance from commonly employed practices, focusing on the reduction of AGP to minimize the risk of infection from patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic: implications for the head and neck anesthesiologist"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have isolated a recombinant virus between the A59 and JHM strains of mouse hepatitis virus, which contain a single species of nonsegmented RNA genome. This recombinant was derived by mixed infection of DBT cells with temperature-sensitive mutants of A59 and JHM at nonpermissive temperature. Viruses recovered at this temperature were screened by oligonucleotide fingerprinting of their genomic RNAs. One recombinant virus, B1, was found to contain mostly A59-derived sequences, but the 3 kilobases at the 5' end of the genomic RNA was derived from JHM. Thus, the crossover point in the B1 genome is located within gene A, which codes for the viral RNA polymerases. The study of the intracellular RNA species of B1 virus revealed that probably all of the virus-specific subgenomic mRNA species contained the body sequences of strain A59 but the leader sequences of JHM. This result indicates that the JHM leader RNA, which differs from the A59 leader RNA, could be fused to the mRNAs of a different virus strain during RNA transcription. Furthermore, B1 virus-infected cells contain an additional subgenomic mRNA species which is transcribed from a new initiation site within gene C, suggesting that the leader RNA could determine the site of initiation for coronavirus mRNAs.

Consistently, ectopic over-expression of GTP-Rac1 facilitates but an inactive Rac1 (N17) or a specific Rac1 inhibitor (NSC23766) inhibits rotavirus replication. In conclusion, we have identified 6-TG as an effective inhibitor of rotavirus replication via the inhibition of Rac1 activation. Thus, for transplantation patients or IBD patients infected with rotavirus or at risk of rotavirus infection, the choice of 6-TG as a treatment appears rational.","output":"6-Thioguanine inhibits rotavirus replication through suppression of Rac1 GDP/GTP cycling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Latest report of NASA claims that planet average surface temperature has risen about 1 62 degrees F since the late 19th century because of increased human-made emissions into atmosphere Due to recent COVID-19 pandemic, this planet is getting relief from pollution, as Wright stated that the sudden fall in pollution is observed in India, a country having world's 30 most polluted cities, similarly Gohd stated that satellite track emissions drop over china during this coronavirus outbreak These facts showing, human is responsible to increase the pollution in this planet, therefore current study aims to test a model which can help in changing consumer behavior into consumer green behavior A significant trend has been observed towards the recognition of the strategic importance of protecting the environment by enforcing laws These kind of efforts are in favor of reducing consumption of plastic bags, and the need for practical and rapid measures to reduce the amount of plastic waste has increased, especially nylon bags, has increased However, plastic bags are still the most common and used by many individuals, who prefer them to others to put their needs and belongings and their various purchases, or to save their food and drink because of its ease Data were collected from shoppers at Cyberjaya (Malaysia) and Bangkok (Thailand) Findings indicate that knowledge and attitude have a significant and positive impact on consumer green behavior;the study also identified that the ban on plastic bags also has a significant and positive influence on consumer green behavior This more considerable influence shows the need for such governmental interventions to moderate consumers' environmentally unfriendly behavior, and we cannot merely rely on consumers' acknowledgement of understanding the danger","output":"Consumer green behaviour: An approach towards environmental sustainability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The sanitary emergency installed in the world, generated by the pandemic of COVID-19, instigates the search for scientific strategies to mitigate the damage caused by the disease to different sectors of society. The disease caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, reached 216 countries/territories, where about 199 million people were reported with the infection. Of these, more than 4 million died. In this sense, strategies involving the development of new antiviral molecules are extremely important. The main protease (Mpro) from SARS-CoV-2 is an important target, which has been widely studied for antiviral treatment. This work aims to perform a screening of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of synthetic hybrids from thymoquinone and artemisin (THY-ART) against COVID-19. RESULTS: Molecular docking studies indicated that hybrids of artemisinin and thymoquinone showed a relevant interaction with the active fraction of the enzyme Mpro, when compared to the reference drugs. Furthermore, hybrids show an improvement in the interaction of substances with the enzyme, mainly due to the higher frequency of interactions with the Thr199 residue. ADMET studies indicated that hybrids tend to permeate biological membranes, allowing good human intestinal absorption, with low partition to the central nervous system, potentiation for CYP-450 enzyme inhibitors, low risk of toxicity compared to commercially available drugs, considering mainly mutagenicity and cardiotoxicity, low capacity of hybrids to permeate the bloodCbrain barrier, high absorption and moderate permeability in Caco-2 cells. In addition, T1CT7 tend to have a better distribution of their available fractions to carry out diffusion and transport across cell membranes, as well as increase the energy of interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 target. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid products of artemisinin and thymoquinone have the potential to inhibit Mpro, with desirable pharmacokinetic and toxicity characteristics compared to commercially available drugs, being indicated for preclinical and subsequent clinical studies against SARS-CoV-2.

To minimize or stop the transmission of the virus, several different measures have been taken by countries worldwide and including in Ethiopia. The World Health Organization (WHO), the Ethiopian Ministry of Health, and the Ethiopian Public Health Institute recommended frequent hand wash with soap and water as one of the prevention measures for the transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, the provision of water supply, sanitation, and hygiene is the main problem in developing countries. After the COVID-19 outbreak, the water related challenges exacerbated the situation before the pandemic existed. Accordingly, the additional supply of water is required to sufficiently provide water for hand wash. This paper mainly addresses how much additional water is required daily for domestic consumption after the coronavirus pandemic by educational institutions, Adama Science and Technology University as a case study. The data was collected with a questionnaire by the randomly selected respondents and analyzed by SPSS (Statistical package for social sciences).The analysis shown that the consumption of water has been changed after the Corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic existed. The highest percentage of the responses to the questionnaire, more than 35% require water (2C5) liters per day and more than 60% of the respondents need additional water up to 5 L per day after the pandemic existed. Based on the analysis, total daily water use by the institute before the COVID-19 existed was 24.2 m(3)/day. These amounts of water not sufficiently satisfy the daily water requirements of the institution even before the pandemic. After the pandemic existed, the water consumption drastically increased to 29 m(3)/day.

Logistic regression was used to reveal the socio-economic determinants of households food consumption and coping strategies, as reported on self-administered questionnaires. Respondents were asked to retrospectively indicate how lockdown affected their food consumption.Results: More than half (55.7%) of respondents and 50.8% of their spouses reported a decline in their earning capacity. A high (>4days/week) mean consumption frequency of six food groups was reported. Consuming less expensive (mean, 2.64  SD 2.44 days/week) or less preferred foods (1.93  2.04 days/week), and meal rationing (limit portions at meal time -1.50  2.11 days/week, reduce meal number- 1.4  2.19 days/week, limit adults intake- 1.28  2.18 days/week) were the most common coping strategies adopted by the households.. The likelihood of adopting coping strategies was significantly higher amongst households with income decline, the less educated and self-employed categories.Conclusion: In this study, a high frequency of diverse food consumption and mild adoption of food related coping strategies was generally observed, however the impact of the lockdown on food coping strategies was significantly felt by some groups.

Given that we have identified several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including Aspirin potently induce the degradation of AXL, we questioned whether NSAIDs could counteract the AXL-mediated neoplastic phenotypes. Here we found NSAIDs downregulate PKA activity via the PGE2 /EP2/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway and interrupt the PKA-dependent interaction between CDC37 and HSP90, resulting in an incorrect AXL protein folding and finally AXL degradation through the ubiquitination-proteasome system (UPS) pathway. Furthermore, NSAIDs not only sensitized the MEK inhibitor treatment, but also reduced EMT and relapse mediate by AXL in tumor tissue. Our findings suggest that the combination of inhibitors and NSAIDs, especially Aspirin, could be a simple but efficient modality to treat melanoma in which AXL is a key factor for drug-resistance, metastasis, and relapse.","output":"NSAIDs Sensitize Melanoma Cells to MEK Inhibition and Inhibit Metastasis and Relapse by Inducing Degradation of AXL."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are responsible for considerable morbidity, mortality and health-care resource use. For the Netherlands, we estimated age and risk-group specific numbers of antibiotics, otologicals and cardiovascular prescriptions per 10,000 person-years during periods with elevated activity of influenza or RSV, and compared these with peri-season rates. Data were taken from the University of Groningen in-house prescription database (www.iadb.nl) and virological surveillance for the period 1998C2006. During influenza and RSV periods excess antibiotic prescriptions were estimated for all age groups. In the age groups 0C1 and 2C4 years, excess antibiotic prescriptions during periods with elevated RSV activity (65% and 59% of peri-seasonal rates) exceeded the surpluses estimated during the influenza-activity periods (24% and 34% of peri-seasonal rates) while for otologicals excess prescriptions were higher for influenza (22% and 27%) than for RSV (14% and 17%). Among persons of 50 years and older, notably those without medical high-risk conditions, excess prescriptions for cardiovascular medications were estimated during the influenza periods at approximately 10% (this was also already seen in persons aged 45C49).

So far, there has not been an analysis of the RES convergence process across countries worldwide, given that the issue of climate change is a global externality. Previous analyses have focused on specific regions, such as EU, OECD, provinces of China. This paper fills this gap, providing new evidence on the convergence process of RES for the 176 countries that account for more than 98% of the world population, from 1990 to 2018.

Moreover, the final implementation assessment was conducted by standard double-blind examinations. Results: After 4C8 weeks training, the 44 residents were assessed for clinical skills from six dimensions, including medical history collection, physical examination, history report and inpatient record writing, case analysis, and overviewing capability. Compared with the mean scores of 68 residents rotated in internal medicine in 2019, the mean scores on physical examination, inpatient record writing, and overviewing capability in 2020 group were higher with significance ([85.72  8.33] vs.[79.22  10.12], P = 0.0006), ([90.28  10.70] vs. [81.82  8.03], P < 0.0001), ([80.31  8.70] vs. [73.04  12.74], P = 0.0012), whereas scores on skills of medical history collection and history report were slightly lower ([82.11  9.02] vs. [85.06  7.23], P = 0.0586), ([79.30  8.17] vs. [83.21  5.01], P = 0.0022), while scores on case analysis did not show huge gap but with polarized performance in 2020 group ([74.38  10.29] vs. [78.13  8.53], P = 0.0386).

Using a translational exposure model, we tested the hypothesis that maternal transfer of a commercial mixture of PBDEs, DE-71, produces ASD-relevant behavioral and neurochemical deficits in female offspring. C57Bl6/N mouse dams (F0) were exposed to DE-71 via oral administration of 0 (VEH/CON), 0.1 (L-DE-71) or 0.4 (H-DE-71) mg/kg bw/d from 3 wk prior to gestation through lactation. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated in utero and lactational transfer of PBDEs (ppb) to F1 female offspring brain tissue at postnatal day (PND) 15 which was reduced by PND 110. Neurobehavioral testing of social novelty preference (SNP) and social recognition memory (SRM) revealed that adult L-DE-71 F1 offspring display altered short- and long-term SRM, in the absence of reduced sociability, and increased repetitive behavior. These effects were concomitant with reduced olfactory discrimination of social odors. Additionally, L-DE-71 exposure also altered short-term novel object recognition memory but not anxiety or depressive-like behavior.

While checklists and frameworks can support academic researchers' awareness of patient engagement methods, less guidance appears available to support their understanding of how to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with their patient partners. This knowledge is essential as patient partners report that the social atmospheres of research teams significantly impacts the quality of their experiences. This study sought to develop theory regarding how academic researchers support and sustain patient engagement in patient-oriented research. METHODS A six-step, rapid realist review was conducted: (1) research question development, (2) preliminary theory development, (3) search strategy development; (4) study selection and appraisal, (4) data extraction, analysis and synthesis (5) identification of relevant formal theories, and (6) theory refinement with stakeholders. Findings were additionally distilled by collective competence theory. RESULTS A program theory was developed from 62 international studies which illuminated mechanisms supporting academic researchers to engage patient partners, contexts supporting these mechanisms, and resources that enabled mechanism activation. Interaction between seven contexts (patient-oriented research belief, prior interaction with a healthcare system, prior interaction with a particular academic researcher, educational background of patient partner, prior experience with patient-oriented research, study type, and time lived in a rural-urban setting) and seven mechanisms (deciding to become involved in patient-oriented research, recognizing valuable experiential knowledge, cultural competence, reducing power differentials, respectful team environment, supporting patient partners to feel valued, and readiness to research) resulted in an intermediate outcome (sense of trust). Trust then acted as an eighth mechanism which triggered the final-level outcome (empowered patient-centred lens). CONCLUSIONS Our theory posits that if patient partners trust they are a member of a supportive team working alongside academic researchers who authentically want to incorporate their input, then they are empowered to draw upon their experiential knowledge of health care systems and contribute as researchers in patient-oriented research. Our theory extends conceptual thinking regarding the importance of trust on patient-oriented research teams, how patient partners' trust is shaped by team interactions, and the role that academic researchers have within those interactions.","output":"A rapid realist review of patient engagement in patient-oriented research and health care system impacts: part one."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 ravages the world, many countries are faced with the grim reality of not having enough critical-care resources to go around.

This paper shares the experience of developing triage criteria and a mechanism for prioritizing intensive care unit resources in a middle-income country with the potential to be applied to other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) faced with a similar (if not more of a) challenge when responding to the global pandemic.

In summary, the experience from the Thai protocol development highlights three important lessons. First, stakeholder consultation and public engagement are crucial steps to ensure the protocol reflects the priorities of society and to maintain public trust in the health system. Second, all bodies and actions proposed in the protocol must not conflict with existing laws to ensure smooth implementation and adherence by professionals.

RESULTS The rectosigmoid junction registers as an intermittent pressure band of 26.2  7.2 mmHg, or intermittent phasic transient pressure increases at a dominant frequency of 3 cpm and an amplitude of 28.6  8.6 mmHg; or a combination of tone and transient pressures, at a single sensor, 10-17 cm above the anal verge. Features are its relaxation or contraction in concert with relaxation or contraction of the anal sphincters when a motor pattern such as a high-amplitude propagating pressure wave or a simultaneous pressure wave comes down, indicating that such pressure increases or decreases at the rectosigmoid junction are part of neurally driven programs. We show that the junction is a site where motor patterns end, or where they start; e.g. retrogradely propagating cyclic motor patterns emerge from the junction. CONCLUSIONS The rectosigmoid junction is a functional sphincter that should be referred to as the sphincter of O'Beirne; it is part of the \\"braking mechanism,\\" contributing to continence by keeping content away from the rectum.

The mechanism of JHMV-induced demyelination remains unclear, though its tropism for oligodendrocytes had led to the belief that JHMV causes demyelination by direct lysis of these myelin-producing cells. However, several studies have also implicated the involvement of immune responses in the demyelinating process. In this communication, we present evidence that generalized immunosuppression with gamma irradiation prevents JHMV-induced demyelination, a finding that was not limited to a particular strain of JHMV or to one strain of mouse. In addition, significant paralytic-demyelinating disease was restored to infected, irradiated mice after the adoptive transfer of nylon wool nonadherent splenic cells and appeared to be restricted by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). These observations indicate that the principal mechanisms of JHMV-induced demyelination are most likely immunopathological.","output":"Demyelination induced by murine hepatitis virus JHM strain (MHV-4) is immunologically mediated"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the recent announcement of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy in clinical trials by several manufacturers for protection against severe disease, a comprehensive post-efficacy strategy for the next steps to ensure vaccination of the global population is now required.

Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis. What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients; assessed since the 4th-6th day of illness onset, such increases seem to be predictive of an adverse prognosis. Our hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities. TZD are PPAR agonists that act on nuclear receptors, thereby triggering certain transcription factors. TZD were widely used for type-2 diabetes in the first decade of this century and although concerns have been raised for possible side effects associated with long-term treatment, their use has been recently revaluated for their anti-inflammatory properties in numerous medical conditions.","output":"Can pioglitazone be potentially useful therapeutically in treating patients with covid-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently put the world under stress, resulting in a global pandemic.

Alterations in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and bone are strictly interconnected, and vitamin D plays key roles in several metabolic pathways that are involved in maintaining musculoskeletal health and glucose homeostasis. We reviewed the available literature on mechanisms underlying osteosarcopenic obesity, with a focus on the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis and treatment of the condition. We found that, although evidence from large observational studies and pre-clinical experiments strongly supports a role of vitamin D deficiency in the pathogenesis of osteosarcopenic obesity, the common belief that vitamin D improves musculoskeletal health lacks solid clinical evidence, as trials specifically aimed at assessing the effects of vitamin D supplementation in patients with osteosarcopenic obesity are not available, and trials that investigated the role of vitamin D on muscle and bone health in other patient populations either showed no or even detrimental effects.

To improve this epistemic situation, it is important to employ open-ended classificatory concepts, to understand when different research programs are tracking the same real kind, and to maintain an ongoing commitment to interact causally with real kinds to focus reference on those kinds. A tempting view of these non-idealized epistemic conditions should be avoided: that they signal an ontological structure of the social world so plentiful that it would permit ameliorated (norm-driven, conceptually engineered) classificatory schemes to achieve their normative aims regardless of whether they defer (in ways to be described) to real-kind classificatory schemes.

This work makes an assessment of wildlife susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing the similarities of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Protease, Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) -both recognized as receptors and protease for coronavirus spike protein- and the genetic variation of the viral protein spike in the recognition sites. The sequences from different mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, and the sequence from SARS-CoV-2 S protein were obtained from the GenBank. Comparisons of aligned sequences were made by selecting amino acids residues of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and S protein; phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the same sequences. The species susceptibility was ranked by substituting the values of amino acid residues for both proteins. Our results ranked primates at the top, but surprisingly, just below are carnivores, cetaceans and wild rodents, showing a relatively high potential risk, as opposed to lab rodents that are typically mammals at lower risk. Most of the sequences from birds, reptiles and amphibians occupied the lowest ranges in the analyses. Models and phylogenetic trees outputs showed the species that are more prone to getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, during this short pandemic period, a high haplotypic variation was observed in the RBD of the viral S protein, suggesting new risks for other hosts. Our findings are consistent with other published results reporting laboratory and natural infections in different species. Finally, urgent measures of wildlife monitoring are needed regarding SARS-CoV-2, as well as measures for avoiding or limiting human contact with wildlife, and precautionary measures to protect wildlife workers and researchers; monitoring disposal of waste and sewage than can potentially affect the environment, and designing protocols for dealing with the outbreak.","output":"Assessing the SARS-CoV-2 threat to wildlife: Potential risk to a broad range of mammals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Musculoskeletal diseases often lead to functional limitations and debility.

Reductions in white cell counts, driven by lower levels of lymphocytes, have been observed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Neutropenia during COVID-19 has not been reported. We present data for 56 patients who were taking clozapine and had COVID-19. METHODS: We included patients who were taking clozapine at the time they tested positive for COVID-19. We compared absolute neutrophil counts, lymphocyte counts and white cell counts between baseline and the first week of infection, and baseline and the second week of infection. RESULTS: We observed reductions in absolute neutrophil counts (p = 0.005), lymphocyte counts (p = 0.003) and white cell counts (p < 0.001) between baseline and the first 7 days of COVID-19. All cell counts had returned to baseline levels by days 8 to 14. Six patients experienced neutropenia (absolute neutrophil counts < 2.0  10(9)/L) and of those, 4 underwent mandatory cessation of clozapine. For 3 patients, clozapine treatment had been established for more than 6 months with no previous neutropenia, neutrophil levels returned to baseline within 2 weeks and no further neutropenia was observed on restarting treatment. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective chart review; larger cohorts are required. Clozapine plasma levels were largely not measured by clinicians.

ApoEs influence the onset of Alzheimers disease (AD) in an isoform-dependent manner: ApoE4 increases AD risk, while ApoE2 decreases it. Previously we demonstrated that syndecans, a transmembrane proteoglycan family with increased expression in AD, trigger the aggregation and modulate the cellular uptake of amyloid beta (A). Utilizing our previously established syndecan-overexpressing cellular assays, we now explore how the interplay of ApoEs with syndecans contributes to key events, namely uptake and aggregation, in A pathology. The interaction of ApoEs with syndecans indicates isoform-specific characteristics arising beyond the frequently studied ApoECheparan sulfate interactions. Syndecans, and among them the neuronal syndecan-3, increased the cellular uptake of ApoEs, especially ApoE2 and ApoE3, while ApoEs exerted opposing effects on syndecan-3-mediated A uptake and aggregation. ApoE2 increased the cellular internalization of monomeric A, hence preventing its extracellular aggregation, while ApoE4 decreased it, thus helping the buildup of extracellular plaques. The contrary effects of ApoE2 and ApoE4 remained once A aggregated: while ApoE2 reduced the uptake of A aggregates, ApoE4 facilitated it. Fibrillation studies also revealed ApoE4s tendency to form fibrillar aggregates.

This surrounding stroma is referred to as the Breast Tumor Microenvironment (BTME). The components of BTME interact with cancerous breast cells for the promotion of BC. The reciprocal cross-talk between BTME and neoplastic breast cells, through the secretion of chemicals, growth factors and chemokines, may lead to cell proliferation, migration, metastasis as well as immune response suppression. Multiple genetic loci, in association with stromal components, are linked to immunological stimuli to induce BC in ductal cells. These genes participate in tumor activation pathways and promote carcinogenesis via Fibroblast, Leukocyte, and Endothelial Cells-mediated responses. The collaborative effect of the cellular components and BTME-associated genes plays vital role in tumor initiation and metastasis of breast cells. This process involves genes which cause degenerative changes in ECM leading to Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transitions (EMT), which finally causes metastatic BC. This shows that metastatic breast cancer results from combined activation of different cellular and extracellular components and their activity is primarily controlled by activation of genetic cascade. These components work simultaneously to cause metastatic BC.","output":"Combined Interaction of Cellular and Extracellular Components Causes Genetic Cascade Activation in Breast Cancer Metastasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Rapidly evolving viral strains leading to epidemics and pandemics necessitates quick diagnostics and treatment to halt the progressive march of the disease.

Little is known about the operational impacts of transitioning from in-person to video visits in specialty clinics. In 2018, the Stanford South Asian Translational Heart Initiative (SSATHI), a preventive cardiology clinic focused on high-risk South Asian adults, introduced CardioClick, a program replacing in-person follow-up visits with video visits. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that implementation of video visits increased the efficiency of clinic operations. Methods: We extracted visit-level data from the EHR for 134 patients enrolled in CardioClick with video follow-up visits from June 14, 2018 to April 21, 2020 and a cohort of 276 patients enrolled in the in-person SSATHI prevention program with follow-up visits from September 11, 2014 to March 6, 2020. Results: Patients in CardioClick and the in-person cohort were similar in terms of age (mean 45 years), gender balance (23 vs 21% female), and cardiometabolic risk profiles. There were 181 video and 637 in-person follow-up visits. Video visits were shorter than in-person visits, both in terms of total clinic time [median 22 min (IQR 16, 29) vs 67 min (48, 100)] and provider time required [median22 min (IQR 16, 29) vs 30 min (12, 58)].

Methods: We performed a preliminary case series of 4 patients with synchronous upper urinary tract (UUT) tumor and invasive bladder cancer who underwent simultaneous laparoscopic cystectomy and unilateral or bilateral nephroureterectomy with umbilical RPS between 2014 and 2017 at our hospital. Demographic data, pathologic features, the surgical technique, and outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. Result: All 4 patients were men whose median age was 79 years (range 65-85 years) and median body mass index was 24.2 kg/m2 (range 21.5-27.3 kg/m2). The laparoscopic approach was technically successful in all 4 patients without the need for open conversion. The median total operative time was 434 minutes (range 372-481 minutes). The median estimated blood loss was 773 ml (range 153-923 ml), median interval to resuming oral intake was 2 days (range 1-7 days), and median hospital stay was 16 days (range 13-20 days).

Each landscape and habitat has a kaleidoscope of niches supporting an enormous variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species, and each species or taxon supports an even more impressive array of macro- and micro-parasites. Infectious pathogens that originate in wild animals have become increasingly important throughout the world in recent decades, as they have had substantial impacts on human health, agricultural production, wildlife-based economies and wildlife conservation. The emergence of these pathogens as significant health issues is associated with a range of causal factors, most of them linked to the sharp and exponential rise of global human activity. Among these causal factors are the burgeoning human population, the increased frequency and speed of local and international travel, the increase in human-assisted movement of animals and animal products, changing agricultural practices that favour the transfer of pathogens between wild and domestic animals, and a range of environmental changes that alter the distribution of wild hosts and vectors and thus facilitate the transmission of infectious agents. Two different patterns of transmission of pathogens from wild animals to humans are evident among these emerging zoonotic diseases. In one pattern, actual transmission of the pathogen to humans is a rare event but, once it has occurred, human-to-human transmission maintains the infection for some period of time or permanently. Some examples of pathogens with this pattern of transmission are human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, influenza A, Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome. In the second pattern, direct or vector-mediated animal-to-human transmission is the usual source of human infection. Wild animal populations are the principal reservoirs of the pathogen and human-to-human disease transmission is rare. Examples of pathogens with this pattern of transmission include rabies and other lyssaviruses, Nipah virus, West Nile virus, Hantavirus, and the agents of Lyme borreliosis, plague, tularemia, leptospirosis and ehrlichiosis. These zoonotic diseases from wild animal sources all have trends that are rising sharply upwards. In this paper, the authors discuss the causal factors associated with the emergence or re-emergence of these zoonoses, and highlight a selection to provide a composite view of their range, variety and origins. However, most of these diseases are covered in more detail in dedicated papers elsewhere in this Review.","output":"The role of wildlife in emerging and re-emerging zoonoses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 was caused by the original coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV2), which originated in Wuhan, China.

The principal testing method for COVID-19 detection, according to the WHO, is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Isolation of patients, quarantine, masking, social distancing, sanitizer use, and complete lockdown were all vital health-care procedures for everyone.

COVID-19 outbreaks among meat and poultry processing facility workers can rapidly affect large numbers of persons. Assessment of COVID-19 cases among workers in 115 meat and poultry processing facilities through April 27, 2020, documented 4,913 cases and 20 deaths reported by 19 states (1). This report provides updated aggregate data from states regarding the number of meat and poultry processing facilities affected by COVID-19, the number and demographic characteristics of affected workers, and the number of COVID-19-associated deaths among workers, as well as descriptions of interventions and prevention efforts at these facilities. Aggregate data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths among workers identified and reported through May 31, 2020, were obtained from 239 affected facilities (those with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case in one or more workers) in 23 states.* COVID-19 was confirmed in 16,233 workers, including 86 COVID-19-related deaths. Among 14 states reporting the total number of workers in affected meat and poultry processing facilities (112,616), COVID-19 was diagnosed in 9.1% of workers. Among 9,919 (61%) cases in 21 states with reported race/ethnicity, 87% occurred among racial and ethnic minority workers. Commonly reported interventions and prevention efforts at facilities included implementing worker temperature or symptom screening and COVID-19 education, mandating face coverings, adding hand hygiene stations, and adding physical barriers between workers. Targeted workplace interventions and prevention efforts that are appropriately tailored to the groups most affected by COVID-19 are critical to reducing both COVID-19-associated occupational risk and health disparities among vulnerable populations. Implementation of these interventions and prevention efforts? across meat and poultry processing facilities nationally could help protect workers in this critical infrastructure industry.","output":"Update: COVID-19 Among Workers in Meat and Poultry Processing Facilities D United States, AprilCMay 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathogenic microbes are the main cause of various undesired infections in living organisms, including humans.

The turbulence and instability during the pandemic initiated the growth of internationalization activities at the institutional level in two directions: first, it increased attention to the quality of work with current international students, including student support, adaptation issues, student engagement, and second, due to the risks in student enrolment, it brought universities to rethink their internationalization instruments and strategies for work with international applicants and future students. Indeed, the ongoing changes in global education call for reconsideration of the priorities and methods of internationalization: new forms of internationalization become widespread practices, new instruments are necessary for student recruitment, and new push and pull factors come into play. While internationalization of education in Russia during the pandemic was addressed at the national level to a degree, the universities carried out the key activities and had to come up with solutions in the field.

Regarding to the Covid-19 pandemic, in many cases the transition was completed in a short time and even unplanned. The transition to a distributed approach creates new, unexpected problems in the collaboration of distributed product development teams, which have to be solved continuously. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop a concept that offers methods for the continuous improvement of distributed collaboration that are appropriate to the specific circumstances. Following a literature search, 135 participants were asked about the need for methodological support in identifying and developing improvement potentials in distributed collaboration. The demand was confirmed by the majority of participants. Consequently, a concept was developed to methodically support the improvement process. The developed concept was designed as an interactive tool, which offers the user methods for methodical approach to improvement potentials in accordance with his needs and resources. The basis is the problem-solving methodology SPALTEN. For a standardized and comprehensive description of the methods, fact sheets were prepared.

We have used the modified Bateman SIZ algorithm to predict the effects of interventional measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS Model parameters, e.g., doubling time and rate of decrease in the number of infectious persons were obtained from published reports. Predictions were made for the status quo on June 1, 2020, and for interventional measures obtained for 4 scenarios. These included vaccination of the whole population using a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine having an efficacy of 50% and 100%, mass-testing for COVID-19 coronavirus and application of the Corona-Warn-App. RESULTS The principle findings were 1) without new measures to control the pandemic, the daily number of infectious persons could reach a peak of > 4,500 daily within 18 months when > 67,000 persons would have been infected. This could be prevented by using a vaccine with 50% efficacy which was almost equally effective as a vaccine with 100% efficacy. Application of the Corona-Warn-App was the most effective method and more effective than testing for COVID-19. The methodology used has been described in detail to enable other researchers to apply the modified Bateman SIZ model to obtain predictions for COVID-19 outbreaks in other regions. Application of the model has been verified by independent investigators using different commercial software packages. CONCLUSION The modified Bateman SIZ model has been verified and used to predict the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Heidelberg. Lockdown measures alone are insufficient to control the pandemic during 2021. Vaccination, diagnostic tests, and use of the Corona-Warn-App with quarantine could successfully control the spread of the coronavirus infection in the community. The Corona-Warn-App applied correctly may be the most effective. The model showed that vaccination with 50% efficacy is almost as effective as vaccination with 100% efficacy.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic predictions using the modified Bateman SIZ model and observational data for Heidelberg, Germany: Effect of vaccination with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, coronavirus testing and application of the Corona-Warn-App."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was officially declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Given the novelty of the virus, and hence, lack of official guidance on effective containment strategies, individual countries opted for different containment approaches ranging from herd immunity to strict lockdown. The opposing strategies followed by the United Kingdom and its former colony, Malaysia, stand exemplary for this. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was implemented for testing in both counties. Malaysia acted with strict quarantining rules and infection surveillance. The United Kingdom followed an initially lenient, herd-immunity approach with strict lockdown only enforced weeks later. Although based on the same health-care structure historically, Malaysia developed a more unified health system compared with the United Kingdom. We suggest that this more centralized structure could be one possible explanation for why Malaysia was able to react in a more timely and efficient manner, despite its closer geographic proximity to China. We further explore how the differences in testing and quarantining strategy, as well as political situation and societal compliance could account for the discrepancy in the United Kingdom's versus Malaysia's relative success of COVID-19 containment.","output":"The Impact of United Kingdom and Malaysia's Inherent Health Systems on Their COVID-19 Responses: A Comparison of Containment Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: : Excessive drinking accounts for more than 95,000 deaths annually in the United States. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-related factors (e.g., social, economic, policy) may have affected alcohol consumption. Emergency department (ED) visits involving acute alcohol consumption (referred to as alcohol-related) are a useful indicator for assessing changes in alcohol-related harms. METHODS: : The 2018C2020 National Syndromic Surveillance Program data, which include nonfatal ED visits from facilities in 49 states and Washington, DC, were analyzed. Trends in the number of alcohol-related ED visits among people 15 years, and weekly alcohol-related ED visit rates (per 10,000 total visits) overall, by demographic characteristics, and quarter (Q) were assessed. Quarterly rates for 2018 and 2019 were averaged to increase baseline data stability. RESULTS: : Alcohol-related visits accounted for 1.6% of 60,474,770 total visits (2018), 1.7% of 61,564,380 total visits (2019), and 1.8% of 52,174,507 total visits (2020). The number of alcohol-related ED visits generally increased during the first eight months of 2018 and 2019. However, it sharply declined at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-MarchCmid-April 2020, before resuming pre-pandemic patterns. Alcohol-related ED visits per 10,000 were higher during quarters in 2020 than corresponding quarters in 2018C2019 (Q1: +7.3%, Q2: +23.8%, Q3: +9.7%, Q4: +6.5%). CONCLUSIONS: : Alcohol-related ED visit rates per 10,000 total visits increased during 2020 versus 2018C2019, with the greatest percentage difference in the second quarter. Fewer people sought ED care in 2020 than 2018C2019 but alcohol-related visits declined to a lesser extent than total visits.","output":"Trends in Emergency Department Visits Related to Acute Alcohol Consumption Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States, 2018C2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract It is well known that the lungs of asthmatics show airway wall remodelling and that asthma exacerbations are linked to respiratory infections.

As greater numbers of patients survive, so has the recognition that individuals with Fontan circulation face a variety of challenges. The goal of a normal quality and duration of life will not be reached by all. The hurdles fall into a variety of domains. From a cardiovascular perspective, the Fontan circulation is fundamentally flawed by its inherent nature of creating a state of chronically elevated venous pressure and congestion, accompanied by a relatively low cardiac output. Ventricular dysfunction, atrioventricular valve regurgitation, and arrhythmia may directly impact cardiac performance and can progress with time. Problems are not limited to the cardiovascular system. Fontan circulatory physiology impacts a multitude of biological processes and health parameters outside the heart. The lymphatic circulation is under strain manifesting as variable degrees of protein-rich lymph loss and immune system dysregulation. Organ system dysfunction develops through altered perfusion profiles. Liver fibrosis is ubiquitous, and a process of systemic fibrogenesis in response to circulatory stressors may affect other organs as well. Somatic growth and development can be delayed. Behavioral and mental health problems are common, presenting as clinically important levels of anxiety and depression. Most striking is the high variability in prevalence and magnitude of these complications within the population, indicating the likelihood of additional factors enhancing or mitigating their emergence.

Skeletal fragility secondary to diabetes increases the risk of fractures and is underestimated by currently available diagnostic tools like fracture risk assessment (FRAX) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In this narrative review we describe the relationship and pathophysiology of skeletal fragility and fractures in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), effect of glucose lowering medications on bone metabolism and the approach to diagnosing and managing osteoporosis and bone fragility in people with diabetes (PWD). METHODS A literature search was conducted on PubMed for articles in English that focused on T2DM and osteoporosis or bone/skeletal fragility. Articles considered to be of direct clinical relevance to physicians practicing diabetes were included. RESULTS T2DM is associated with skeletal fragility secondary to compromised bone remodeling and bone turnover. Long duration, poor glycemic control, presence of chronic complications, impaired muscle function, and anti-diabetic medications like thiazolidinediones (TZD) are risk factors for fractures among PWD. Conventional diagnostic tools like DXA and FRAX tool underestimate fracture risk in diabetes. Presence of diabetes does not alter response to anti-osteoporotic treatment in post-menopausal women. CONCLUSION Estimation of fragility fracture risk should be included in standard of care for T2DM along with screening for traditional complications. Physicians should proactively screen for and manage osteoporosis in people with diabetes.

On the other hand, risk thresholds were considered relevant to individual decision-making and professionals duty to care. All agreed that decision-making should not be influenced by rewards or reprimands. It was agreed also that decisions to resuscitate should not be considered as moral heroism or supererogatory - regardless of PPE availability - but rather as minimally decent.

METHODS: In May 2020, we contacted by phone all the patients who underwent in March and April to remote monitoring visits for DF during the lockdown for COVID-19, with a structured interview, focusing on their perceptions about telemedicine service for DF and on the anxiety toward COVID and DF. RESULTS: We analyzed 257 remote monitoring visits in 211 patients. Two hundred and six patients answered the follow-up interview; 177 patients (85.9%) remembered the monitoring visit, 140 (67.9%) the health care professional and 181 patients (87.9%) the reason of contact; 169 patients were alone during the visit, 37 with a relative. Patients judged useful both the monitoring during pandemic (4.35  0.28 on a maximum of five) and the possibility to continue after the lockdown (4.34  0.23 on a maximum of five). Eventually, we observed that DF patients were more worried by DF than by COVID on a scale from 0 (not fear at all) to 5 (terrified) (4.79  0.05 vs. 3.27  1.03, p < 0.05).

Results Fear-related behaviors can adversely affect the course of epidemics. Past outbreaks of infectious diseases (Ebola and Zika virus) have shown that maladaptive behavior, related to increased psychological stress and anxiety, can interfere with the implementation of treatment strategies and actions and can contribute to a further spread.

To treat paucisymptomatic patients, we have implemented a \\"fast track\\" pathway in our emergency department, using LUS as a valid alternative. Minimal data is available in the literature about interobserver reliability and the level of expertise needed to perform a reliable examination. Our aim was to assess these. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center prospective study. We enrolled 96 patients. 12 lung areas were explored in each patient with a semiquantitative assessment of pulmonary aeration loss in order to obtain the LUS score.

This paper aims to define system requirements for COVID-19 management under future transmission and response scenarios, based on surveillance system performance to date. Methods From 1st November 2020 to 30th June 2021 community transmission was eliminated in Australia, allowing investigation of system performance in detecting novel outbreaks, including against variants of concern (VoCs). We characterised surveillance systems in place from peer-reviewed and publicly available data, analysed the epidemiological characteristics of novel outbreaks over this period, and assessed surveillance system sensitivity and timeliness in outbreak detection. These findings were integrated with analysis of other critical COVID-19 public health measures to establish requirements for future COVID-19 management. Findings Australia reported 25 epidemiologically distinct outbreaks and 5 distinct clusters of cases in the study period, all linked through genomic sequencing to breaches in quarantine facilities housing international travellers. Most (21/30, 70%) were detected through testing of those with acute respiratory illness in the community, and 9 through quarantine screening. For the 21 detected in the community, the testing rate (percent of the total State population tested in the week preceding detection) was 2.07% on average, was higher for those detected while prior outbreaks were ongoing. For 17/30 with data, the delay from the primary case to detection of the index case was, on average 4.9 days, with 10 of the 17 outbreaks detected within 5 days and 3 detected after > 7days. One outbreak was preceded by an unexpected positive wastewater detection. Of the 24 outbreaks in 2021, 20 had publicly available sequencing data, all of which were VoCs. Surveillance for future VoCs using a similar strategy to that used for detecting SARS-CoV-2 to date would necessitate a 100-1,000-fold increase in capacity for genomic sequencing. Interpretation Australia's surveillance systems performed well in detecting novel introduction of SARS- CoV-2 in a period when community transmission was eliminated, introductions were infrequent and case numbers were low. Detection relied on community surveillance in symptomatic members of the general population and quarantine screening, supported by comprehensive genomic sequencing. Once vaccine coverage is maximised, the priority for future COVID-19 control will shift to detection of SARS-CoV-2 VoCs associated with increased severity of disease in the vaccinated and vaccine ineligible. This will require ongoing investment in maintaining surveillance systems and testing of all international arrivals, alongside greatly increased genomic sequencing capacity. Other essential requirements for managing VoCs are maintaining outbreak response capacity and developing capacity to rapidly engineer, manufacture, and distribute variant vaccines at scale. The most important factor in management of COVID-19 now and into the future will continue to be how effectively governments support all sectors of the community to engage in control measures.","output":"Opening up safely: public health system requirements for ongoing COVID-19 management based on evaluation of Australia's surveillance system performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The molecular regulatory mechanisms of host responses to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection during the early subclinical stage are still not clear.

The most related function of the differentially expressed mRNAs between infected and uninfected tissues was proliferation of endothelial cells, indicating that MAP infection may lead to the over-proliferation of endothelial cells. In addition, 46.2% of detected mRNAs displayed alternative splicing events. The pre-mRNA of two genes related to macrophage maturation (monocyte to macrophage differentiation-associated) and lysosome function (adenosine deaminase) showed differential alternative splicing events, suggesting that specific changes in the pre-mRNA splicing sites may be a mechanism by which MAP escapes host immune responses. Moreover, 9 miRNAs were differentially expressed after MAP infection. The integrated analysis of microRNAome and transcriptome revealed that these miRNAs might regulate host responses to MAP infection, such as proliferation of endothelial cells (bta-miR-196 b), bacteria recognition (bta-miR-146 b), and regulation of the inflammatory response (bta-miR-146 b).","output":"Altered microRNA expression and pre-mRNA splicing events reveal new mechanisms associated with early stage Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter considers the relationship between the conspiracy theorythe idea that a historical or political event (or series of events) occurred as a consequence of a carefully worked out plan, plotted in secret by a small group of powerful individualsand antisemitism.

Second, the sample collection dates differ from country to country. We attempt to tackle these problems using the vaccination data, confirmed cases data, and national statistics. We construct Bayesian models to estimate the numbers of people who have antibodies produced by infection or vaccination separately. For the number of people with antibodies due to infection, we develop a hierarchical model for combining the information included in both confirmed cases data and national statistics. At the same time, we propose regression models to estimate missing values in the vaccination data.

METHODS: All psychiatric admissions aged 65 or older in the 3 months before and after COVID-19 (from November 2019 to April 2020), in the previous 2 years (from November 2017 to April 2018 and from November 2018 to April 2019), and in the year of SARS (from November 2002 to April 2003) in a major gazette inpatient psychiatric unit in Hong Kong, which serves a catchment population of 1.4 million, were anonymously reviewed. The number of psychogeriatric admissions between different timeframes was compared, and factors that might explain the increase in admissions following COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS: Psychogeriatric admissions increased by 21.4% following the COVID-19 outbreak. This increase was not explained by seasonal variation and was greater and lasted longer than that in SARS. A rising trend in admissions for older adults living in residential care homes was observed. The increase in admissions was associated with fewer outpatient attendance, fewer home visits by nurses, and more older adults with dementia requiring inpatient care. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the impact of COVID-19 on older adults' mental health, greater demand for inpatient psychogeriatric services in COVID-19 than in SARS, and the importance of maintaining support for community-living older adults, in particular those with dementia, and their caregivers in reducing the needs for inpatient psychiatric treatment during the pandemic.

METHODS: We analyzed the data from the Cerner deidentified COVID-19 data set derived from 62 health care facilities. The data set included patients with an emergency department or inpatient encounter with discharge diagnoses codes that could be associated with suspicion of or exposure to COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: There were a total of 154 (0.2%) and 667 (0.3%) patients with intracerebral hemorrhage among 85,645 patients with COVID-19 and 197,073 patients without COVID-19, respectively. In the multivariate model, there was a lower risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio 0.5; 95% confidence interval 0.5C0.6; p < .0001) after adjustment for sex, age strata, race/ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, nicotine dependence/tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, long-term anticoagulant use, and alcohol abuse. The proportions of patients who developed pneumonia (58.4% versus 22.5%; p < .0001), acute kidney injury (48.7% versus 31.0%; p < .0001), acute myocardial infarction (11% versus 6.4%; p = .048), sepsis (41.6% versus 22.5%; p < .0001), and respiratory failure (61.7% versus 42.3%; p < .0001) were significantly higher among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 compared with those without COVID-19. The in-hospital mortality among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 was significantly higher compared with that among those without COVID-19 (40.3% versus 19.0%; p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis does not suggest that rates of intracerebral hemorrhage are higher in patients with COVID-19. The higher mortality in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 compared with those without COVID-19 is likely mediated by higher frequency of comorbidities and adverse in-hospital events.

We have investigated the incidence and impact of key bacterial/fungal infections in COVID-19 persons in England. Methods We extracted laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases (01/01/2020-02/06/2020) and blood and lower-respiratory specimens positive for 24 genera/species of clinical relevance (01/01/2020-30/06/2020) from Public Health Englands national laboratory surveillance system. We defined coinfection and secondary infection as a culture-positive key organism, isolated within 1-day, or 2-27 days, respectively of the SARS-CoV-2 positive date. We described the incidence and timing of bacterial/fungal infections and compared characteristics of COVID-19 patients with and without bacterial/fungal infection. Results One-percent (n=2,279/223,413) of COVID-19 persons in England had co/secondary infection, &gt;65% were bloodstream infections. The most common causative organisms were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cases with co/secondary infections were older than without (median 70-years [IQR:58-81] vs 55-years [IQR:38-77]), and a higher percentage of cases with secondary infection were of Black or Asianst ethnicity than cases without (67% vs 41%, and 99% vs 82%, respectively, p&lt;0001). Age-sex-adjusted case fatality rates were higher in COVID-19 cases with a coinfection (230% [95%CI:188%-276%] or secondary infection (265% [95%CI:145%-394%]), than those without (76% [95%CI:75%-77%])(p&lt;0005). Conclusions Co/secondary bacterial/fungal infections were rare in non-hospitalised and hospitalised persons with COVID-19, varied by ethnicity and age, and were associated with higher mortality.

From almost 40,000 recorded roadkill cases for all species, these species were registered 60, 22, 26 and 3 times, respectively, thus being rare events. Registered beaver roadkill numbers correlated with an increased registration effort and traffic intensity, while otter roadkill correlated with a registration effort only, and mink roadkill correlated with an increased population (estimated through its proxy and the number of hunted individuals per year). The roadkill was not always in close proximity to waterbodies, with 38C54% of roadkill of these species occurring over 200 m from the nearest water source. With the American mink and muskrat being invasive species in the EU and the Eurasian otter protected in many countries, it could be considered valuable to enhance the registrations of their roadkill (using targeted efforts by drivers, hunters or other citizen scientists) in order to obtain the extrapolated amount of roadkill and to use this knowledge in species management. ABSTRACT: We previously showed that registration efforts and traffic intensity explain 90% of variation in mammal roadkill numbers, 70% of variation in the numbers of recorded species and 40% of diversity variation. Here we analyze semiaquatic mammal roadkill in Lithuania in 2002C2021, relating these to the monitoring effort. From 39,936 analyzed roadkill, the European beaver (Castor fiber) was registered 60 times, American mink (Neovison vison) 26 times, otter (Lutra lutra) 22 times and muskrat (Ondatra zibethica) 3 times. The average roadkill indexes were 0.000065, 0.00076, 0.00061 and 0.00010 ind./km/day, and the extrapolated annual roadkill for the country was 44C357, 36C456, 49C464 and 89C144 individuals, respectively. Beaver roadkill numbers correlated with the registration effort and traffic intensity, otter roadkill with registration effort only and mink with hunting bag (number of hunted individuals per year). Roadkill was not always related to proximity to water, with 38C54% of roadkill occurring over 200 m from the nearest water source.

Notably, viral pseudoparticles were inhibited from transferring their contents into the host cell cytosol by IFN, and IFITM3 was required and sufficient for this action. We further demonstrate that IFN expands Rab7 and LAMP1-containing structures, and that IFITM3 overexpression is sufficient for this phenotype.

Collectively our data are consistent with the prediction that viruses that fuse in the late endosomes or lysosomes are vulnerable to IFITM3's actions, while viruses that enter at the cell surface or in the early endosomes may avoid inhibition. Multiple viruses enter host cells through the late endocytic pathway, and many of these invaders are attenuated by IFN. Therefore these findings are likely to have significance for the intrinsic immune system's neutralization of a diverse array of threats.","output":"IFITM3 Inhibits Influenza A Virus Infection by Preventing Cytosolic Entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is the highly transmissible etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has become a global scientific and public health challenge since December 2019. Several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged globally raising concern about prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Early detection and in-depth analysis of the emerging variants allowing pre-emptive alert and mitigation efforts are thus of paramount importance. RESULTS: Here we present ClusTRace, a novel bioinformatic pipeline for a fast and scalable analysis of sequence clusters or clades in large viral phylogenies. ClusTRace offers several high-level functionalities including lineage assignment, outlier filtering, aligning, phylogenetic tree reconstruction, cluster extraction, variant calling, visualization and reporting. ClusTRace was developed as an aid for COVID-19 transmission chain tracing in Finland with the main emphasis on fast screening of phylogenies for markers of super-spreading events and other features of concern, such as high rates of cluster growth and/or accumulation of novel mutations. CONCLUSIONS: ClusTRace provides an effective interface that can significantly cut down learning and operating costs related to complex bioinformatic analysis of large viral sequence sets and phylogenies.

In order to develop the effective antiviral therapies, it is required to understand the molecular mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The main protease, or 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)), plays the essential role in the coronavirus replication that makes the enzyme a promising therapeutic target. Viral enzymes are known to be multifunctional. Particularly, 3CL(pro) of SARS-CoV was shown to induce apoptosis in addition to its main function. In the present study we analyzed the cytotoxicity of active SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) and its inactivated form upon their individual expression in four human cell lines. For this purpose, we constructed a protein biosensor which allows to detect the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) and confirmed the expression of the active protease in all cell lines used. We studied viability and morphology of the cells and found that both active and inactivated enzyme variants induce no cell death in contrast to the homologous 3CL protease of SARS-CoV.

The levels of particulate matter have been shown to have decreased after regional and national lockdowns in a number of countries. COVID-19 possesses an elevated reproduction number (R0) due to its high transmission rate. COVID-19 genes have been found adherent to particulate matter which has been suggested as a vector for this virus' transmission. Following lockdown in China, the original viral Clade D steadily decreased mirroring the decline in particulate matter. Two months after the COVID-19 index case was reported in Wuhan early December 2019, a persistent mutation was noted at the D614 gene position of the viral spike protein establishing the Clade G variant. Clade G started to appear early in February and steadily attained predominance after lockdown in late February. It may be postulated that the changes in the source of airborne particulate matter, possibly derived from tobacco smoking (66% of Chinese males are smokers), may have contributed to the appearance of Clade G. Once the pandemic spread beyond China, in all countries affected except for Iceland, a consistent pattern arose whereby the initial viral Clade D outbreak was rapidly displaced by Clade G. It is hypothesized that changes in the source of COVID-19's vector in the form of particulate matter may have contributed to natural selection favouring Clade G. The \\"open orientation\\" of Clade G spike protein's three peptides as opposed to the \\"closed orientation\\" of the Clade D may have allowed easier adherence of the viral mutant to cells and as a corollary also to particulate matter. There may also have been differences between both viral Clades in the spike protein's hydrophobic properties. Experimental research on the hypothesis that particulate matter may potentially act as a COVID-19 vector needs to be undertaken. Besides the potential vector effect, the deleterious effects of particulate matter on respiratory immunity and cardiovascular health are well known and consequently airborne pollution in all its forms should be addressed on a global scale.","output":"Could changes in the airborne pollutant particulate matter acting as a viral vector have exerted selective pressure to cause COVID-19 evolution?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY: Many of software for network visualization are available, but existing software have not been optimized to infection cluster visualization, especially the current worldwide invasion of COVID-19 since 2019. To reach the spatiotemporal understanding of epidemics, we have developed Haplotype Explorer.

Time dependent transition of the network can be exported as continuous sections for making a movie. Here, we introduce features and products of Haplotype Explorer, demonstrating time-dependent snapshots and a movie of haplotype networks inferred from total of 4,282 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. ABSTRACT: The worldwide eruption of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 reached 10 million cases by late June 2020. In order to understand the epidemiological landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have attempted to elucidate phylogenetic relationships between collected viral genome sequences using haplotype networks. However, currently available applications for network visualization are not suited to understand the COVID-19 epidemic spatiotemporally due to functional limitations, that motivated us to develop Haplotype Explorer, an intuitive tool for visualizing and exploring haplotype networks. Haplotype Explorer enables to dissect epidemiological consequences via interactive node filters and provides the perspective on infectious disease dynamics depend on regions and time, such as introduction, outbreak, expansion, and containment. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Haplotype Explorer by showing features and an example of visualization. The demo using SARS-CoV-2 genomes are available at https://github.com/TKSjp/HaplotypeExplorer/blob/master/Example/.

Quantifying the effect of crowds is challenging, however, due to potential co-occurring drivers of home advantage (e.g., travel, location familiarity). Therefore, the present research aims to isolate the crowd effect by utilizing a natural experiment created by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which eliminated crowds in approximately 50% of games in the 2020/2021 NBA regular season (N = 1080). Using mixed models (fixed effect: crowds;random effects: team, opponent) we show, in games with crowds, home teams won 58.65% of games and outrebounded (average rebound differential = 2.28 rebounds) and outscored (average points differential = 2.18 points) their opponents. This was a significant improvement compared to games without crowds, of which home teams won 50.60% of games (p < .001) and failed to outrebound (average rebound differential = -0.41 rebounds, p < .001) or outscore (average points differential = -0.13 points, p < .05) their opponents. Further, the crowd-related increase in average rebound differential fully mediated the relationship between crowds and average points differential. Taken together, these results suggest that home advantage in the 2020/2021 NBA season was predominately driven by the presence of home crowds and their influence on the effort exerted to rebound the basketball.","output":"Home is where the hustle is: The influence of crowds on effort and home advantage in the National Basketball Association"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Suicide is a major cause of death in many countries, and previous suicidal attempt is known to be the predictor of future suicide. Korea is considered one of the countries with the highest suicide rate among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members for over a decade. We aimed to investigate the epidemiologic characteristics of hospitalised patients after suicidal acts in Korea. METHODS Data from the Korean National Hospital Discharge In-depth Injury Survey were analysed, and patients older than 9 years admitted to nationwide hospitals after suicidal acts from 2005 to 2016 were included. Their epidemiologic characteristics were explored, and we divided them into groups according to suicidal means (injury vs. poisoning) and treatment outcome (good vs. poor). The association of each characteristic with injury as suicidal means and with poor treatment outcome were explored. RESULTS The sample included 7609 patients (corresponding to 227,571 in national population). More patients were female than male, and most were in their 40s in both sexes. Hospitalisation rate peaked in patients older than 80 years for both sexes. Male and young patients aged 10-19 years and capital residents showed relatively higher odds of choosing injury as suicidal means. Males and patients aged 40-64 and 65 years showed relatively higher odds of poor treatment outcome. LIMITATIONS Some suicide attempters were excluded from the survey such as those who did not visit a hospital after the suicide attempt.

Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology that may provide effective behavioral therapeutics for chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct a double-blind, parallel-arm, single-cohort, remote, randomized placebo-controlled trial for a self-administered behavioral skills-based VR program in community-based individuals with self-reported chronic low back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A national online convenience sample of individuals with self-reported nonmalignant low back pain with duration of 6 months or more and with average pain intensity of 4 or more/10 was enrolled and randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 daily (56-day) VR programs: (1) EaseVRx (immersive pain relief skills VR program); or (2) Sham VR (2D nature content delivered in a VR headset). Objective device use data and self-reported data were collected. The primary outcomes were the between-group effect of EaseVRx versus Sham VR across time points, and the betweenCwithin interaction effect representing the change in average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep over time (baseline to end-of-treatment at day 56). Secondary outcomes were global impression of change and change in physical function, sleep disturbance, pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, pain medication use, and user satisfaction. Analytic methods included intention-to-treat and a mixed-model framework. RESULTS: The study sample was 179 adults (female: 76.5%, 137/179; Caucasian: 90.5%, 162/179; at least some college education: 91.1%, 163/179; mean age: 51.5 years [SD 13.1]; average pain intensity: 5/10 [SD 1.2]; back pain duration 5 years: 67%, 120/179). No group differences were found for any baseline variable or treatment engagement. User satisfaction ratings were higher for EaseVRx versus Sham VR (P<.001). For the between-groups factor, EaseVRx was superior to Sham VR for all primary outcomes (highest P value=.009), and between-groups Cohen d effect sizes ranged from 0.40 to 0.49, indicating superiority was moderately clinically meaningful. For EaseVRx, large preCpost effect sizes ranged from 1.17 to 1.3 and met moderate to substantial clinical importance for reduced pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress. Between-group comparisons for Physical Function and Sleep Disturbance showed superiority for the EaseVRx group versus the Sham VR group (P=.022 and .013, respectively). Pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, pain acceptance, prescription opioid use (morphine milligram equivalent) did not reach statistical significance for either group. Use of over-the-counter analgesic use was reduced for EaseVRx (P<.01) but not for Sham VR. CONCLUSIONS: EaseVRx had high user satisfaction and superior and clinically meaningful symptom reduction for average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress compared to sham VR. Additional research is needed to determine durability of treatment effects and to characterize mechanisms of treatment effects. Home-based VR may expand access to effective and on-demand nonpharmacologic treatment for chronic low back pain.

Vaccine development was immediately propelled to the centre of all our scientific, public health and community efforts. Despite the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines arguably being the greatest and most palpable achievements of the past 12 months, they have also been one of the most contentious and debated issues during the pandemic. However, what uniquely differentiates vaccine development is its intimate relationship with the community it seeks to serve; both in its clinical trial testing as an efficacious and safe prophylactic, and its post-developmental roll-out success, as an effective public health tool. These relationships have birthed a myriad of complexities, from community-based mistrust, to academically contended ethical dilemmas. Indeed, the accelerated advances in the COVID-19 vaccine race have further exacerbated this phenomenon, bringing with it new ethical dilemmas that need to be examined to ensure the continued clinical success of these therapeutics and a renewed societal trust in clinical medicine. In this paper, we discuss two major ethical dilemmas: (1) the equipoise of continuing new vaccine trials in the advent of successful candidates and (2) the maleficence of blinded placebo arms. Accordingly, we discuss six different potential approaches to these ethical dilemmas: (1) continuing with placebo-controlled trials, (2) transitioning from placebo-controlled to open-label, (3) unblinding at-risk priority groups only, (4) transitioning to a blinded stepped-wedge cross-over design, (5) progressing to a blinded active-controlled stepped-wedge cross-over trial, and (6) conducting randomised stepped-wedge community trials. We also propose a decision-making algorithm for relevant stakeholders in advanced stages of vaccine trials. It is important to remember that the emergent nature of the COVID-19 situation does not justify a compromise on core ethical values.

ABSTRACT Background: Heart transplant recipients do not escape SARS-CoV-2 infection, their immunocompromised status puts them at high risk for infection. The clinical severity of presentation is uncertain, its mortality in heart transplant patients has not yet been determined. Material and Methods: observational, retrospective. From March 2020 to February 2021, heart transplant recipients with qRT-PCR positivity to SARS-CoV-2-2 were gathered. The following variables were assessed: age, sex, time of transplantation at the time of infection, mortality, hospitalization, extra oxygen requirement,comorbidities, and severity of infection. Results: Eight SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were gathered, aged 53.8  7.6 years. One female patient (12.5%) and 7 males (87.5%), mean transplantation time 72.8  38.0 months. Mortality was 12.5%, (one patient who was hospitalized).Seven patients were treated at home;3 (37.5%) required supplemental oxygen.Comorbidities were diabetes mellitus 87.5%, arterial hypertension 87.5%, obesity: 25%, the clinical presentation was severe in 1 patient (12.5%), moderate in 2 (25%) and mild in 5 patients (62.5%). Analysis: SARS-CoV-2 infection in heart transplant recipients presents a mild to moderate clinical picture, despite the comorbidities presented. It could be that the immunosuppressant taken prior to the surgery confers a protective effect.","output":"Sars-cov-2 infection in heart transplant recipients.

We developed and evaluated a novel, community-based approach (Test-to-Care Model) designed to address these barriers for socioeconomically vulnerable Latinx individuals with newly diagnosed COVID-19 and their households. METHODS: This three-week demonstration project was nested within an epidemiologic surveillance study in a primarily Latinx neighborhood in the Mission district of San Francisco, California. The Test-to-Care model was developed with input from community members and public health leaders. Key components included: (1) provision of COVID-19-related education and information about available community resources, (2) home deliveries of material goods to facilitate safe isolation and quarantine (groceries, personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies), and (3) longitudinal clinical and social support. Newly SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive participants were eligible to participate. Components of the model were delivered by the Test-to-Care team, which was comprised of healthcare providers and community health workers (CHWs) who provided longitudinal clinic- and community-based support for the duration of the isolation period to augment existing services from the Department of Public Health (DPH). We evaluated the Test-to-Care Model using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework and drew upon multiple data sources including: programmatic data, informal interviews with participants and providers/CHWs and structured surveys among providers/CHWs. RESULTS: Overall, 83 participants in the surveillance study were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 95% (79/83) were Latinx and 88% (65/74) had an annual household income <$50,000. Ninety-six percent (80/83) of participants were reached for results disclosure, needs assessment and DPH linkage for contact tracing. Among those who underwent an initial needs assessment, 45% (36/80) were uninsured and 55% (44/80) were not connected to primary care. Sixty-seven percent (56/83) of participants requested community-based CHW support to safely isolate at their current address and 65% (54/83) of all COVID-19 participants received ongoing community support via CHWs for the entire self-isolation period. Participants reported that the intervention was highly acceptable and that their trust increased over timeCthis resulted in 9 individuals who disclosed a larger number of household members than first reported, and 6 persons who requested temporary relocation to a hotel room for isolation despite initially declining this service; no unintended harms were identified. The Test-to-Care Model was found to be both acceptable and feasible to providers and CHWs. Challenges identified included a low proportion of participants linked to primary care despite support (approximately 10% after one month), and insufficient access to financial support for wage replacement. CONCLUSIONS: The Test-to-Care Model is a feasible and acceptable intervention for supporting self-isolation and quarantine among newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients and their households by directly addressing key barriers faced by socioeconomically vulnerable populations.","output":"Evaluation of a novel community-based COVID-19 Test-to-Care model for low-income populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: A recent summary of ASHA surveys (fielded in March and April 2020) has delineated the pandemic-related challenges in education of communication sciences and disorders (CSD) This paper aimed to estimate how COVID-19 affected college seniors' learning and course performance, and discuss how a threat is posed to workforce entering Methods: Ninety-eight written reflections were analyzed using a descriptive analysis to determine how sudden termination of face-to-face instruction affected learning, and subsequently impacted seniors' completion of course assignments and test performance Results: It was found that students' loss of motivation, concentration, and/or self-discipline when adjusting and adapting to the pandemic posed the greatest challenge to knowledge acquisition and studying Losing class engagement and face-to-face clinical exposure greatly hindered skill application;both elements lowered preparedness and satisfaction of college experience, and might reduce seniors' competitiveness and readiness to launch a new job Conclusions: As the coronavirus era is evolving, student comments and reflections become particularly valuable for gaining insights into improving online teaching and learning for future career ? 2020 The Korean Association of Speech-Language Pathologists","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on college seniors' learning and performance in communication sciences and disorders: Students' self-reflections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective treatment or vaccine is not yet available for combating SARS coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) that caused the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, their molecular mechanisms of pharmacological action remain unclear. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate their native binding sites on TMPRSS2. We revealed that both drugs could spontaneously and stably bind to the TMPRSS2 catalytic center, and thereby inhibit its proteolytic processing of the S protein. Also, we found that Nafamostat is more specific than Camostat for binding to the catalytic center, consistent with reported observation that Nafamostat blocks the SARS-CoV-2 infection at a lower concentration.

However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients contracted COVID-19 or not, non-HD COVID-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The results showed that lymphocytes of T cell, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells in PBMCs of HD patients decreased significantly than other groups. HD patients with COVID-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. Our study indicates that HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area in the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage. HD Patients with COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.","output":"2019 novel coronavirus disease in hemodialysis (HD) patients: Report from one HD center in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 causes a mild to severe respiratory disease called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Control of SARS-CoV-2 spread will depend on vaccine-induced or naturally acquired protective herd immunity. Until then, antiviral strategies are needed to manage COVID-19, but approved antiviral treatments, such as remdesivir, can only be delivered intravenously. Enisamium (laboratory code FAV00A, trade name Amizon?) is an orally active inhibitor of influenza A and B viruses in cell culture and clinically approved in countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Here we show that enisamium can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infections in NHBE and Caco-2 cells. In vitro, the previously identified enisamium metabolite VR17C04 directly inhibits the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that VR17C04 prevents GTP and UTP incorporation. To confirm enisamiums antiviral properties, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adult, hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which needed medical care either with or without supplementary oxygen. Patients received either enisamium (500 mg per dose) or placebo for 7 days. A pre-planned interim analysis showed in the subgroup of patients needing supplementary oxygen (n = 77) in the enisamium group a mean recovery time of 11.1 days, compared to 13.9 days for the placebo group (log-rank test; p=0.0259). No significant difference was found for all patients (n = 373) or those only needing medical care (n = 296). These results thus suggest that enisamium is an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis and that enisamium treatment shortens the time to recovery for COVID-19 patients needing oxygen.","output":"Enisamium is an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase and shows improvement of recovery in COVID-19 patients in an interim analysis of a clinical trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eye blink detection is a challenging problem that many researchers are working on because it has the potential to solve many facial analysis tasks, such as face anti-spoofing, driver drowsiness detection, and some health disorders. There have been few attempts to detect blinking in the wild scenario, while most of the work has been done under controlled conditions. Moreover, current learning approaches are designed to process sequences that contain only a single blink ignoring the case of the presence of multiple eye blinks. In this work, we propose a fast framework for eye blink detection and eye blink verification that can effectively extract multiple blinks from image sequences considering several challenges such as lighting changes, variety of poses, and change in appearance. The proposed framework employs fast landmarks detector to extract multiple facial key points including the ones that identify the eye regions. Then, an SVD-based method is proposed to extract the potential eye blinks in a moving time window that is updated with new images every second. Finally, the detected blink candidates are verified using a 2D Pyramidal Bottleneck Block Network (PBBN). We also propose an alternative approach that uses a sequence of frames instead of an image as input and employs a continuous 3D PBBN that follows most of the state-of-the-art approaches schemes.

The frothing ability of these plants is attributed to saponins which are also welldocumented to possess antimicrobial attributes. In the light of COVID-19, soap and hand hygiene have taken center stage. The pandemic has also revealed the low access to running water and commercial soaps in many marginalized and poor communities to the detriment of global health. Thus, soapy plants, either in their natural form or through incorporation in commercial products, may be a relevant additional weapon to assist communities to improve hand hygiene and contribute to curbing COVID-19 and other communicable infections. This review paper was compiled from a review of literature that was published between 1980 and 2020. We found 68 plant species, including those which are already used as traditional soaps. Our findings support the potential use of extracts from soapy plants because of their putative viricidal, bactericidal, and fungicidal activities for use in crude home-based formulations and possibly for developing natural commercial soap products. ? 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, in order to dwell deeper into the measures taken by the policy makers around the world, this paper specifically analyzes how the monetary policies have been devised, in response to COVID-19. For this purpose, this paper has taken into consideration a panel of 8 Asian economies that have been affected the most acutely by the virus, have faced multiple lockdowns, and have also experienced other economic restraints, due to this very phenomenon. In order to compare the possible monetary policy options, and their outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper refers to the global recession shock, as a valid point of reference. In addition to this, in order to gain access to the empirical evidence, the ARDL methodology has been applied on the quarterly data from 2005Q3 to 2020Q3. The results of the study have indicated that various plans have been taken into consideration, so as to lessen the consequences of these shocks that have trickled down into the respective economies of these countries. That is to put forth that, in the incidence of global recession, the monetary authorities have resorted to a less prudent stance. Whereas, more flexibility, through a persistent decrease in the policy rate has been observed since the pandemic first hit the world.

Frequently multiple pass protocols are used. A split bolus contrast protocol can reduce the number of passes through the body, and thereby radiation exposure, in this relatively young and vitally threatened population. PURPOSE To evaluate three protocols for single pass total body scanning in 64-slice multidetector CT (MDCT) on optimal image quality. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three total body CT protocols were prospectively evaluated in three series of 10 consecutive trauma patients. In Group A unenhanced brain and cervical spine CT was followed by chest-abdomen-pelvis CT in portovenous phase after repositioning of the arms. Group B underwent brain CT followed without arm repositioning by a one-volume contrast CT from skull base to the pubic symphysis. Group C was identical to Group A, but the torso was scanned with a split bolus technique. Three radiologists independently evaluated protocol quality scores (5-point Likert scale), parenchymal and vascular enhancement and artifacts. RESULTS Overall image quality was good (4.10) in Group A, more than satisfactory (3.38) in Group B, and nearly excellent (4.75) in Group C (P < 0.001). Interfering artifacts were mostly reported in Group B in the liver and spleen.

The systolic blood pressure of the rat caudal artery was detected. And trial fibrosis was detected by Picrosirius red staining and Massons trichrome staining. Expressions of transforming growth factor- (TGF-), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1), Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), galectin-3, -smooth muscle actin (-SMA), and collagen I/III were subjected to qPCR and western blot. Furthermore, SHP-1 binding to c-Src was verified by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). Results showed that the expressions of TGF-, TIMP1, MMP-2, CTGF, -SMA, galectin-3, and collagen I were increased markedly in the Ang II intervention group, and the expressions of p-ERK1/2, p-Akt, and p-p38MAPK were also increased dramatically.

Follow-up data were correlated with measures of pre-COVID-19 status (anthropometrics, comorbidities) and measures of severity of the acute infection. RESULTS A total of 22 (65%) women and 12 (26%) men reported excessive fatigue. In all, 20 women (67%) and 17 men (37%) reported decreased physical function. Female sex was associated with fatigue. Loss of physical function was associated with pre-COVID-19 presence of heart disease and absence of lung disease. Severity of the acute COVID-19 infection was not associated with fatigue or change in functional status. Fatigue and functional status were correlated with both generic HRQoL and lung disease-specific HRQoL.

However, supervised physical activity programs have several limitations, including costs and availability. Therefore, our study proposes a novel approach for the implementation of a patient-executed, activity trackerCguided exercise program to bridge this gap. OBJECTIVE: Our trial aims to investigate the impact that an activity trackerCguided, patient-executed exercise program for patients undergoing radiotherapy has on cancer-related fatigue, health-related quality of life, and preoperative health status. METHODS: Patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer (OnkoFit I trial) or neoadjuvant, definitive, or postoperative treatment for other types of solid tumors (OnkoFit II trial) will be randomized (1:1:1) into 3-arm studies. Target accrual is 201 patients in each trial (50 patients per year). After providing informed consent, patients will be randomized into a standard care arm (arm A) or 1 of 2 interventional arms (arms B and C). Patients in arms B and C will wear an activity tracker and record their daily step count in a diary. Patients in arm C will receive personalized weekly targets for their physical activity. No further instructions will be given to patients in arm B. The target daily step goals for patients in arm C will be adjusted weekly and will be increased by 10% of the average daily step count of the past week until they reach a maximum of 6000 steps per day. Patients in arm A will not be provided with an activity tracker. The primary end point of the OnkoFit I trial is cancer-related fatigue at 3 months after the completion of radiotherapy. This will be measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue questionnaire. For the OnkoFit II trial, the primary end point is the overall quality of life, which will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General sum score at 6 months after treatment to allow for recovery after possible surgery. In parallel, blood samples from before, during, and after treatment will be collected in order to assess inflammatory markers. RESULTS: Recruitment for both trials started on August 1, 2020, and to date, 49 and 12 patients have been included in the OnkoFit I and OnkoFit II trials, respectively.

In addition, participants in the postgraduate and hands-on courses were asked to complete questions about case volume and comfort levels related to procedures/topics in those courses. All respondents to this initial survey were sent a 3-month follow-up questionnaire in which they were asked how successfully they had implemented the intended practice changes and what, if any, barriers they encountered. Postgraduate and hands-on course participants completed case volume and comfort level questions. Descriptive statistical analysis of this deidentified data was undertaken. RESULTS Response rates were 42% and 56% for CME-eligible attendees/respondents for the immediate postmeeting and 3-month follow-up questionnaires, respectively. Top learning themes for respondents were Bariatric, Hernia, Foregut, and Colorectal. Improving minimally invasive surgical (MIS) technique and managing complications related to MIS procedures were top intended practice changes. Partial implementation was common with top barriers including cost restrictions, lack of institutional support, and lack of time. CONCLUSIONS The 2012 annual meeting analysis provides insight into educational needs among respondents and will help with planning content for future meetings.","output":"Evolution of practice gaps in gastrointestinal and endoscopic surgery: 2012 report from the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) Continuing Education Committee."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients configure a risk group for complications or death by COVID-19. For many of them, postponing or replacing their surgical treatments is not recommended. During this pandemic, surgeons must discuss the risks and benefits of treatment, and patients should sign a specific comprehensive Informed consent (IC). OBJECTIVES: To report an IC and an algorithm developed for oncologic surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We developed an IC and a process flowchart containing a preoperative symptoms questionnaire and a PCR SARS-CoV-2 test and described all perioperative steps of this program. RESULTS: Patients with negative questionnaires and tests go to surgery, those with positive ones must wait 21 days and undergo a second test before surgery is scheduled. The IC focused both on risks and benefits inherent each surgery and on the risks of perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infections or related complications. Also, the IC discusses the possibility of sudden replacement of medical staff member(s) due to the pandemic; the possibility of unexpected complications demanding emergency procedures that cannot be specifically discussed in advance is addressed. CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, specific tools must be developed to ensure safe experiences for surgical patients and prevent them from having misunderstandings concerning their care.","output":"Informed consent and a risk-based approach to oncologic surgery in a cancer center during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoo tonic, highly pathogenic virus. The new type of coronavirus with contagious nature spread from Wuhan (China) to the whole world in a very short time and caused the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 has turned into a global public health crisis due to spreading by close person-to-person contact with high transmission capacity. Thus, research about the treatment of the damages caused by the virus or prevention from infection increases everyday. Besides, there is still no approved and definitive, standardized treatment for COVID-19. However, this disaster experienced by human beings has made us realize the significance of having a system ready for use to prevent humanity from viral attacks without wasting time. As is known, nanocarriers can be targeted to the desired cells in vitro and in vivo. The nano-carrier system targeting a specific protein, containing the enzyme inhibiting the action of the virus can be developed. The system can be used by simple modifications when we encounter another virus epidemic in the future. In this review, we present a potential treatment method consisting of a nanoparticle-ribozyme conjugate, targeting ACE-2 receptors by reviewing the virus-associated ribozymes, their structures, types and working mechanisms.","output":"Virus-associated ribozymes and nano carriers against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a total of 1536 blood serum samples analysed by ELISA, antibodies for IAV nucleoprotein (NP) were detected in 30.3%.

Seven-day Consultant presence and morning AMU discharges have been advocated to improve hospital bed management. AIMS: To determine whether a later time of daily peak AMU occupancy correlates with measures of hospital stress; whether seven-day Consultant presence, for COVID-19, abolished weekly periodicity of discharges. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. METHODS: Anonymised AMU admission and discharge times were retrieved from the Profile Information Management System (PIMS), at a large, urban hospital from 14th April 2014-31st December 2018 and 20th March-2nd May 2020 (COVID-19 peak). Minute-by-minute admission and discharge times were combined to construct a running total of AMU bed occupancy. Fourier transforms were used to determine periodicity. We tested association between i) average AMU occupancy and ii) time of peak AMU occupancy, with measures of hospital stress (total medical bed occupancy and 'medical outliers' on non-medical wards). RESULTS: Daily, weekly and seasonal patterns of AMU bed occupancy were evident. Timing of AMU peak occupancy was unrelated to each measure of hospital stress: total medical inpatients (Spearman's rho, rs=0.04, P = 0.24); number of medical outliers (rs=-0.06, P = 0.05). During COVID-19, daily bed occupancy was similar, with continuation of greater Friday and Monday discharges than the weekend. CONCLUSIONS: Timing of peak AMU occupancy did not alter with hospital stress. Efforts to increase morning AMU discharges are likely to have little effect on hospital performance. Seven-day Consultant presence did not abolish weekly periodicity of discharges - other factors influence weekend discharges.","output":"Rhythmicity of patient flow in an acute medical unit: relationship to hospital occupancy, seven-day working, and the effect of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational cohort study.

METHODS: AO Spine COVID-19 and Spine Surgeon Global Impact Survey includes domains on surgeon demographics, location of practice, type of practice, COVID-19 perceptions, institutional preparedness and response, personal and practice impact, and future perceptions. The survey was distributed by AO Spine via email to members (n = 3805). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify differences between practice settings. RESULTS: A total of 902 surgeons completed the survey. In all, 45.4% of respondents worked in an academic setting, 22.9% in privademics, 16.1% in private practice, and 15.6% in public hospitals. Academic practice setting was independently associated with performing elective and emergent spine surgeries at the time of survey distribution. A majority of surgeons reported a >75% decrease in case volume. Private practice and privademic surgeons reported losing income at a higher rate compared with academic or public surgeons. Practice setting was associated with personal protective equipment availability and economic issues as a source of stress. CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicates that practice setting affected both preparedness and response to COVID-19. Surgeons in private and privademic practices reported increased worry about the economic implications of the current crisis compared with surgeons in academic and public hospitals. COVID-19 decreased overall clinical productivity, revenue, and income.

SARS-CoV-2 can decrease cell surface ACE2 directly by internalization of ACE2 bound to the virus and indirectly by increased ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17)-mediated shedding of ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed in the heart, lungs, vasculature, kidney and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where it counteracts the deleterious effects of angiotensin II (AngII) by catalyzing the conversion of AngII into the vasodilator peptide angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)). The down-regulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 can be detrimental to the cardiovascular system and kidneys. Further, decreased ACE2 can cause gut dysbiosis, inflammation and potentially worsen the systemic inflammatory response and coagulopathy associated with SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to elucidate the crucial role of ACE2 both as a regulator of the reninCangiotensin system and a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as the implications for Coronavirus disease 19 and its associated cardiovascular and renal complications.","output":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and COVID-19 in cardiorenal diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have studied the role of restrictions to lateral mobility in the segregation of proteins to apical and basolateral domains of MDCK epithelial cells.

The marker proteins were preferentially extracted from the \\"incorrect\\" domain (i.e., the apical domain for a basolateral marker), indicating that the cytoskeletal anchoring was most effective on the \\"correct\\" domain. The two basolateral markers were unpolarized and almost completely extractable in cells prevented from establishing cell-cell contacts by incubation in low Ca++ medium, while an apical marker was only extracted from the basal surface under the same conditions. Procedures were developed to apply fluorescent probes to either the apical or the basolateral surface of live cells grown on native collagen gels. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of predominantly basolateral antigens showed a large percent of cells (28- 52%) with no recoverable fluorescence on the basal domain but normal fluorescence recovery on the apical surface of most cells (92-100%). Diffusion coefficients in cells with normal fluorescence recovery were in the order of 1.1 x 10(-9) cm2/s in the apical domain and 0.6-0.9 x 10(-9) cm2/s in the basal surface, but the difference was not significant. The data from both techniques indicate (a) the existence of mobile and immobile protein fractions in both plasma membrane domains, and (b) that linkage to a domain specific submembrane cytoskeleton plays an important role in the maintenance of epithelial cell surface polarity.","output":"Selective anchoring in the specific plasma membrane domain: a role in epithelial cell polarity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) is a rare disorder caused by a deficiency of an enzyme, coproporphyrinogen oxidase, in the heme synthetic pathway. This disease has a highly variable clinical presentation with acute attacks of neurologic symptoms that can last from days to months. Rarely, it and other acute porphyrias may cause ascending paralysis, which is difficult to distinguish from Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS). Acute attacks can be triggered by factors that increase the synthesis of heme, such as hormonal changes, certain medications, dietary changes, and infections. We report a 26-year-old female with HCP who presented with acute ascending flaccid paralysis and respiratory failure after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and was initially misdiagnosed and treated for GBS. She was transferred to our neurosciences intensive care unit, where the diagnosis of acute porphyria was established. Initial improvement occurred during treatment for several weeks with hemin (Panhematin?) and continued with givosiran (Givlaari?), which was recently introduced for the prevention of acute attacks. We suggest that acute porphyria should be part of the differential diagnosis when GBS is suspected. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an attack of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) that developed after a COVID-19 infection and the first with advanced paresis to be treated with givosiran.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 76 patients hospitalized in ICU, who stayed for at least four days with COVID-19 pneumonia, from May 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 in Lahore Health Care Hospital and Al-Shafi Hospital. Patients were labelled as COVID-19 pneumonia on radiological basis as bilateral ground-glass opacity in lower zones and RT-PCR positive result in nasopharyngeal swab. All patients were oxygen dependent, either on high flow oxygen via non rebreathing mask or invasive positive pressure ventilation support. Serum albumin levels were measured daily from first day to fourth day of ICU admission. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 26 and Microsoft excel 2016. RESULTS: Out of 76 patients of COVID-19 pneumonia admitted in ICU who stayed for more than four days, 38 patients expired. The mean age of all the patients was 58.912.56 years, 38(50%) of the patients were 60 years and 49 (62%) of them were male. On day four of ICU admission, mean serum albumin of discharged patients was 3.830.22 g/dl while mean serum albumin level of expired patients was 2.960.46 g/dl. Strong negative correlation (r = -767) was found between decrease in serum albumin level and increase number of deaths from COVID-19 pneumonia.

There are many mechanisms and factors which have been postulated to be associated with the neurodegenerative pathway(s) resulting in distinctive loss of neurons in the substantia nigra. Subsequently, the neuropathology is more widespread and exhibited in other areas of the brain, and enteric nervous system. Aggregates of misfolded -synuclein or Lewy bodies are the hallmark of the illness and appear to be central in the whole cascade of cell destruction. There are many processes implicated in neuronal destruction including: oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, an imbalance in protein homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Interesting, inflammation induced by pathogens (including, bacteria and viruses) has been associated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori and Helicobacter suis appear to colonise the gut, and elicit systemic immune responses, which is them transmitted via the gut-axis to the brain, where cytotoxic cytokines induce neuroinflammation and cell death. This conforms to the bottomCtop hypothesis proposed by Braak. The gut is also implicated in two other theories postulated in the development and progression of the disorder, namely, the topCdown and the threshold. There is a possibility that these theories may be inter-linked and operate together to certain degree. Ultimately specific trigger factors or conditions may govern the occurrences of these processes in genetically predisposed individuals.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatened to interrupt ART Surge progress following the detection of the first case in Nigeria in February 2020. To overcome this disruption, CDC Nigeria designed and implemented adapted ART Surge strategies during FebruaryCSeptember 2020. METHODS: Adapted ART Surge strategies focused on continuing expansion of HIV services while mitigating COVID-19 transmission. Key strategies included an intensified focus on community-based, rather than facility-based, HIV case-finding; immediate initiation of newly-diagnosed PLHIV on 3-month ART starter packs (first ART dispense of 3 months of ART); expansion of ART distribution through community refill sites; and broadened access to multi-month dispensing (MMD) (3C6 months ART) among PLHIV established in care. State-level weekly data reporting through an Excel-based dashboard and individual PLHIV-level data from the Nigeria National Data Repository facilitated program monitoring. RESULTS: During FebruaryCSeptember 2020, the reported number of PLHIV initiating ART per month increased from 11,407 to 25,560, with the proportion found in the community increasing from 59 to 75%. The percentage of newly-identified PLHIV initiating ART with a 3-month ART starter pack increased from 60 to 98%. The percentage of on-time ART refill pick-ups increased from 89 to 100%.

METHODS: We conducted an online survey of 638 adults in Brazil on March 25-28, 2020, about one month (32 days) cross-sectionally after the first COVID-19 case in South America was confirmed in S?o Paulo. The 638 adults were in 25 states out of the 26 Brazilian states, with the only exception being Roraima, the least populated state in the Amazon. Of all the participating adults, 24%, 20%, and 18% of them were located in Rio de Janeiro state, Santa Catarina state, and S?o Paulo state respectively. RESULTS: In Brazil, 52% (332) of the sampled adults experienced mild or moderate distress, and 18.8% (120) suffered severe distress. Adults who were female, younger, more educated, and exercised less reported higher levels of distress. Each individual's distance from the Brazilian epicenter of S?o Paulo interacted with age and workplace attendance to predict the level of distress. The \\"typhoon eye effect\\" was stronger for people who were older or attended their workplace less. The most vulnerable adults were those who were far from the epicenter and did not go to their workplace in the week before the survey.

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised, physics driven domain specific transporter framework with an attention mechanism to identify relevant key points with applications in ultrasound imaging. The proposed framework identifies key points that provide a concise geometric representation highlighting regions with high structural variation in ultrasound videos. We incorporate physics driven domain specific information as a feature probability map and use the radon transform to highlight features in specific orientations. The proposed framework has been trained on130 Lung ultrasound (LUS) videos and 113 Wrist ultrasound (WUS) videos and validated on 100 Lung ultrasound (LUS) videos and 58 Wrist ultrasound (WUS) videos acquired from multiple centers across the globe. Images from both datasets were independently assessed by experts to identify clinically relevant features such as A-lines, B-lines and pleura from LUS and radial metaphysis, radial epiphysis and carpal bones from WUS videos. The key points detected from both datasets showed high sensitivity (LUS = 99\\\\% , WUS = 74\\\\%) in detecting the image landmarks identified by experts. Also, on employing for classification of the given lung image into normal and abnormal classes, the proposed approach, even with no prior training, achieved an average accuracy of 97\\\\% and an average F1-score of 95\\\\% respectively on the task of co-classification with 3 fold cross-validation.

Facial masks can alter verbal communication, causing potential safety problems. Methods: Eight types of masks (medical, PPE and cloth), one face-shield and four combinations of the same devices were tested, mounted on Head and Torso Simulator with an artificial mouth. For each configuration, tests were carried out in an anechoic chamber with an appropriate measurement chain for signal acquisition and processing. Results: The results show that medical devices exhibit lower attenuation at high frequencies, even compared to cloth. FFP2 and FFP3 have attenuations greater than 5 dB in the octave bands of 4 and 8 kHz, with negligible influence on acoustic performance due to the presence of valves. Face shield distorts the vocal spectrum, behaving like a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency around 1 kHz, with a steep slope (with attenuation > 10 dB at 4 and 8 kHz) and an accentuated resonance at 1 kHz (about 6-8 dB), due to the thin PET screen. Clear mask shows low attenuation up to 4 kHz and adds the benefit of lip reading, especially useful for workers with hearing difficulties.

Additionally, alterations of the gut microbiota have been demonstrated to contribute to sepsis-related mortality. We sought to determine if there were alterations in the gut microbiota with a novel sepsis model in old adult mice, which enter a state of persistent inflammation, immunosuppression and catabolism (PICS), as compared to young adult mice, which recover with the sepsis model. METHODS Mixed sex old (20 mo) and young (4 mo) C57Bl/6J mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture with daily chronic stress (CLP+DCS) and were compared to naive age-matched controls. Mice were sacrificed at CLP+DCS day 7 and feces collected for bacterial DNA isolation. The V3-V4 hypervariable region was amplified, 16S rRNA gene sequencing performed, and cohorts compared. -Diversity was assessed using Chao1 and Shannon indices using rarefied counts, and -diversity was assessed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. RESULTS Na?ve old adult mice had significantly different  and -diversity compared to na?ve adult young adult mice. After CLP+DCS, there was a significant shift in the  and -diversity (FDR = 0.03 for both) of old adult mice (na?ve vs. CLP+DCS). However, no significant shift was displayed in the microbiota of young mice that underwent CLP+DCS in regards to -diversity (FDR = 0.052) and -diversity (FDR = 0.12), demonstrating a greater overall stability of their microbiota at 7 days despite the septic insult. The taxonomic changes in old mice undergoing CLP+DCS were dominated by decreased abundance of the order Clostridiales and genera Oscillospira. CONCLUSION Young adult mice maintain an overall microbiome stability 7 days after CLP+DCS after compared to old adult mice. The lack of microbiome stability could contribute to PICS and worse long-term outcomes in older adult sepsis survivors.

Despite their ubiquity, there is a lack of interdisciplinary epidemiologic and economic research that has collected primary impact data, particularly associated with indirect costs, from families during ARIs in children. METHODS: We conducted a 12-month cohort study in 234 preschool children with impact diary recording and PCR testing of nose-throat swabs for viruses during an ARI. We used applied values to estimate a virus-specific mean cost of ARIs. RESULTS: Impact diaries were available for 72% (523/725) of community-managed illnesses between January 2003 and January 2004. The mean cost of ARIs was AU$309 (95% confidence interval $263 to $354). Influenza illnesses had a mean cost of $904, compared with RSV, $304, the next most expensive single-virus illness, although confidence intervals overlapped. Mean carer time away from usual activity per day was two hours for influenza ARIs and between 30 and 45 minutes for all other ARI categories. CONCLUSION: From a societal perspective, community-managed ARIs are a significant cost burden on families and society. The point estimate of the mean cost of community-managed influenza illnesses in healthy preschool aged children is three times greater than those illnesses caused by RSV and other respiratory viruses. Indirect costs, particularly carer time away from usual activity, are the key cost drivers for ARIs in children. The use of parent-collected specimens may enhance ARI surveillance and reduce any potential Hawthorne effect caused by compliance with study procedures. These findings reinforce the need for further integrated epidemiologic and economic research of ARIs in children to allow for comprehensive cost-effectiveness assessments of preventive and therapeutic options.","output":"The cost of community-managed viral respiratory illnesses in a cohort of healthy preschool-aged children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Australian Nursing and Midwifery Accreditation Council prescribes midwifery accreditation standards that support students' development in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health and cultural safety to be deemed practice ready.

METHODS The Ganngaleh nga Yagaleh cultural safety assessment tool was used to collect online quantitative data from post graduate midwifery students at the commencement and completion of an online subject. RESULTS Through a purposive sample (n = 10) participant perceptions of culturally safe practices remained relatively unchanged, except for three items of the Ganngaleh nga Yagaleh cultural safety assessment tool. DISCUSSION Findings demonstrate that when post graduate midwifery students are exposed to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives of Australia's colonial history it impacts their sense of optimism, personal values and beliefs about the healthcare they will provide to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. However, midwifery students who self-identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people, reported a decline in optimism when imagining a healthcare system free of racism.

METHODS: We searched scientific databases to identify cohort studies with the number of deaths in patients with MS. We fitted inverse-variance weighted meta-regressions with random-effects models to identify potential moderators (determinants) of COVID-19-related lethality (outcome). RESULTS: After an independent screening, 18 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria; all data were collected before anti-SARS-COV-2 vaccination was available. Out of 5,634 patients, 111 died, yielding a pooled death rate of 1.97% (95% confidence intervals 1.61C2.33). There was a substantial heterogeneity between the included studies (Q(17) = 66.9, p < 0.001; I(2) = 77.5%), but no relevant publication bias (p = 0.085). Higher lethality was observed in studies including older patients ( = 0.80, p = 0.025) and in studies with higher proportions of patients with comorbidity ( = 0.17, p = 0.046), progressive disease course ( = 0.15, p = 0.027), and current treatment with anti-CD20 agents ( = 0.18, p < 0.001). Otherwise, higher proportions of patients treated with interferon beta ( = C 0.16, p < 0.001) and teriflunomide ( = C 0.11, p = 0.035) were associated with lower lethality.

Their gender, age, onset time were recorded. Take epidemiological history, fever, and the blood lymphocytes decline as clinical indicators, used CT to evaluate the possibility of COVID-19 and range of lung involvement. According to the current national standards, throat swabs of suspected cases were collected and the nucleic acid of COVID-19 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The Xiangya process was constructed according to multi-index, compared with clinical indicators, CT results and national standards, the efficiency of detecting confirmed cases were verified in the test and verification library. Results: A continuous cohort of 382 adults who screened COVID-19 was included in which 261 cases were in the test library and 121 cases were in the verification library. In the 382 cases, 192 were males (50.3%) and 190 were females (49.7%), with a median age of 35 years (range: 15-92 years). There were 183 cases (47.9%) with epidemiological history, 275 cases (72.0%) with fever, 212 cases (55.5%) with decreased hemolytic lymphocytes, CT positive 114 cases (29.8%), 43 cases (11.3%) with positive CT-COVID-19, and 30 cases (7.9%) with positive throat swab nucleic acid. Compared with clinical indicators, the sensitivity and specificity of CT were 0.950 and 0.704, respectively. The accuracy of CT to make a definite diagnosis was higher than that of epidemiological history, fever, and blood lymph count decline (0.809 vs 0.660, 0.532, 0.596, P=0.001, 0.002, 0.003, respectively). The sensitivity of this process and the program recommended by the Health Commission all were high (all were 1.000) , and the specificity and accuracy of the process were higher than the program recommended by the Health Commission (0.872 vs 0.765, 0.778 vs 0.592, both P<0.001). The CT-COVID-19 would have reduced the missed diagnosis rate caused by false negative of nucleic acid test (31 vs 64, difference rate 51.6%), the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 64.5% (20/31).

Vaccine efficacy was significantly more influential on vaccine acceptance among whites than among Blacks, while bringing a vaccine to market under a Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization had a stronger adverse effect on willingness to vaccinate among older Americans and women. Democrats were more sensitive to vaccine efficacy than Republicans, and both groups responded differently to various endorsements of the vaccine. We also explored whether past flu vaccination history, attitudes toward general vaccine safety, and personal contact with severe cases of Covid-19 can explain variation in group vaccination hesitancy. Many subgroups that exhibit the greatest Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy did not report significantly lower frequencies of flu vaccination. Several groups that exhibited greater Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy also reported greater concerns about vaccine safety generally, but others did not.

Perry et al.s paper addresses the politics of responsibility, asking who is responsible for keeping older people safe in light of Covid-19 though a citywide senior housing coalition in Detroit. The second paper, authored by Johnson, speaks to the politics of access and structural inequalities that create disparities in end-of-life care for unhoused older adults. The third and fourth papers, by Stinchcombe and colleagues and Oswald, critically examine dominant paradigms of age-friendliness in Canada and the United States though a politics of representation that highlights who is (in)visible in these initiatives. The final paper by Reyes, on the civic participation of Latinx and African American older adults, illustrates how structural change cannot happen without engaging these populations in the political process. Together, these papers exemplify the politics of environmental gerontology and demonstrate that without acknowledgment of multi-layered identities and the structures contributing to their inequities, environmental gerontology is inadequate, as it may overlook important social and environmental factors that connect older people to the places where they live and die.","output":"From Margin to Center: Intersectionality and the Politics of Environmental Gerontology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Good quality friendships and relationships are critical to the development of social competence and are associated with quality of life and mental health in childhood and adolescence. Through social distancing and isolation restrictions, the COVID\\\\19 pandemic has had an impact on the way in which youth socialize and communicate with friends, peers, teachers and family on a daily basis. In order to understand children's social functioning during the pandemic, it is essential to gather information on their experiences and perceptions concerning the social changes unique to this period. The objective of this study was to document children and adolescents' perspectives regarding their social life and friendships during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, through qualitative interviews. METHODS: Participants (N = 67, 5C14 years) were recruited in May and June 2020. Semi\\\\structured interviews were conducted via a videoconferencing platform. A thematic qualitative analysis was conducted based on the transcribed and coded interviews (NVivo). RESULTS: The upheavals related to the pandemic provoked reflection among the participants according to three main themes, each of which included sub\\\\themes: (1) the irreplaceable nature of friendship, (2) the unsuspected benefits of school for socialization and (3) the limits and possibilities of virtual socialization.

Aims This study was done to assess the distribution of various types of mullerian anomalies in infertile women, their classification based on ESHRE and AFS, associated anomalies, types of diagnostic modalities used, surgical interventions done(if any), various types of infertility treatment used and their outcomes. Setting and Design A retrospective analysis in a tertiary level hospital. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective study in which the women found to have mullerian anomalies were recruited from infertility clinic from July 2019 to March 2020. They were classified according to ESHRE and AFS criteria and their records were analyzed after taking various factors like age, ovarian reserve, duration of infertility, treatment given , associated ovarian and tubal factors and pregnancy outcomes. Statistical Analysis Analysis was performed in Excel. Results There were 30 women with mullerian anomalies. Unicornuate uterus was most common anomaly. Four women required septoplasty in view of septate uterus. Five women had associated renal anomalies in form of shrunken kidney and ectopic kidney. Most of these women were considered for controlled ovarian stimulation followed by intrauterine insemination. In our study 16.6% women had successful pregnancy outcome. Conclusion Mullerian anomalies continue to attract infertility specialist as they pose challenge in making clear diagnosis and its management as obstetrics outcomes are excellent after septum resection in women with septate uterus and conservative management in women with other anomalies.

In this paper, a novel stochastic model was proposed aiming to account for the unique transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and capture the effects of intervention measures implemented in Mainland China. We found that: (1) instead of aberration, there was a remarkable amount of asymptomatic virus carriers, (2) a virus carrier with symptoms was approximately twice more likely to pass the disease to others than that of an asymptomatic virus carrier, (3) the transmission rate reduced significantly since the implementation of control measures in Mainland China, and (4) it was expected that the epidemic outbreak would be contained by early March in the selected provinces and cities in China.","output":"Prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak in China based on a new stochastic dynamic model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 crisis resulted in a worldwide shift from in-person instruction to remote instruction, in order to mitigate the spread of the virus. The aim of this study was to survey Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students' perceptions of learning during the instructional shift as well as assess the impact of this shift on learning outcomes. SUBJECTS: One hundred twenty-five students enrolled in the DPT program were recruited to participate in this study. METHODS: A survey was completed by students 12 days after the switch to remote instruction. Students rated multiple aspects of remote instruction. In addition, exam scores of students before and after the shift to remote instruction were compared, and final semester grades were compared to previous years. RESULTS: Most respondents reported that they did not learn as well during remote instruction (83%);however, students' exam scores during remote instruction indicated otherwise. Open-ended questions revealed varied student responses regarding remote learning, workload, and burnout. CONCLUSION: A disconnect seems to exist between student perceptions of learning with actual learning outcomes. While these results may positively support remote instruction, qualitative data indicate that student experience of remote instruction must be considered to avoid burnout and stress among students.","output":"Student Perceptions and Outcomes of Total On-Line (SPOT-ON) Curriculum Shift During the COVID-19 Crisis: Can Students Still Learn Remotely?

However, limited data are available from countries with less COVID-19 burden focusing on concurrent stroke and ACS hospitalisation rates from the same population. METHODS: The study was conducted in three geographically and demographically representative COVID-19 referral university hospitals in Greece. We recorded the rate of stroke and ACS hospital admissions during a 6-week period of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 and compared them with the rates of the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS: We found a greater relative reduction of stroke admissions (51% [35 vs 71]; incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.49, p=0.001) compared with ACS admissions (27% [123 vs 168]; IRR: 0.73, p=0.009) during the COVID-19 outbreak (p=0.097).

CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalisation rates both for stroke and ACS were reduced during the COVID-19 outbreak in a country with strict social distancing measures, low COVID-19 incidence and low population mortality.

A cross-sectional, population-based survey study of US adults age 18 years and older was distributed in early September 2020. The primary outcome was the intention to receive the flu vaccine assessed with a survey instrument based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. Three-hundred sixty-four adults (59.1% female, 66.5% white), completed the survey. Twenty percent of participants had already received the flu vaccine, 54.3% indicated high probability of getting the flu vaccine this flu season, and 49% would get it at a doctors office. Concerns regarding adverse effects from the flu vaccine was a major barrier to vaccination and family (58.1%) was the primary influencer in participants decision to get vaccinated. Participants who indicated that getting the vaccine was beneficial to them and that their doctor thinks they should get the flu vaccine were significantly more likely to have the intent of getting vaccinated. Approximately half of US adults believed that the flu vaccine was beneficial to them and indicated intent to receive the vaccine this flu season.

COVID-19 vaccines uptake appears to have an essential role in the successful control of the COVID-19 pandemic. ObjectiveTo examine predictors of COVID-19 vaccination uptake and reasons for decline of vaccination. MethodsWe followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for this systematic review. We searched Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, CINAHL, and a pre-print service (medRxiv) from inception to July 12, 2021. We used the following key-words: vaccin*, COVID-19, and uptake. We included all types of studies (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods) reporting COVID-19 vaccination uptake. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021267460). ResultsTwelve studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. COVID-19 vaccination uptake ranged from 28.6% to 98% in the general population, while among healthcare workers ranged from 33.3% to 94.5%, and among patients ranged from 36% to 80%. The main predictors of COVID-19 vaccination uptake were male gender, white race, older age, higher socioeconomic status, higher self-perceived COVID-19 vulnerability, increased information about COVID-19 vaccines, and chronic illness. The most important reasons for decline of vaccination were concerns about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, illness, medication, pregnancy, fertility, breastfeeding, religious reasons, ethical reasons, previous COVID-19 diagnosis, self-estimation that COVID-19 is not a severe disease, and limited knowledge about the vaccines. ConclusionsSeveral factors affect COVID-19 vaccination uptake, while various reasons affect peoples decision to refuse to take a COVID-19 vaccine. These findings are essential to further enhance our understanding of COVID-19 vaccination uptake and design specific interventions.

To determine whether these expectations can be fulfilled or whether there are also negative consequences, social aspects should be assessed as early as the R&D phase. Potential social impacts can be assessed with the help of a social life cycle assessment (SLCA). A common problem in SLCA studies is the large number of social aspects. Thus, it is important to prioritize the most relevant aspects. Scholars agree that socioeconomic indicators should not be selected on a purely intuitive and common sense basis and that a standardized approach is missing. A three-step process has been developed to identify the most vulnerable and relevant social aspects. These three steps were implemented into a case study to empirically test the method.

Methods and Results In a propensity score-matched outpatient cohort (January-May 2020) of 2263 Medicare Advantage and commercially insured individuals with hypertension and a positive outpatient SARS-CoV-2, we determined the association of ACE inhibitors and ARBs with COVID-19 hospitalization. In a concurrent inpatient cohort of 7933 hospitalized with COVID-19, we tested their association with in-hospital mortality. The robustness of the observations was assessed in a contemporary cohort (May-August). In the outpatient study, neither ACE inhibitors (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 0.53-1.13, P=0.18) nor ARBs (HR, 0.88; 0.61-1.26, P=0.48) were associated with hospitalization risk. ACE inhibitors were associated with lower hospitalization risk in the older Medicare group (HR, 0.61; 0.41-0.93, P=0.02), but not the younger commercially insured group (HR, 2.14; 0.82-5.60, P=0.12; P-interaction 0.09).

An economic evaluation conducted at an early stage of development of CAR-T therapy for treatment of adult relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia could provide insight into factors contributing to the cost of treatment, the potential clinical benefits, and what the health system can afford. Traditionally, stakeholders are engaged in certain parts of health technology assessment processes, such as in the identification and selection of technologies, formulation of recommendations, and implementation of recommendations; however, little is known about processes for stakeholder engagement during the conduct of the assessment. This is especially the case for economic evaluations. Stakeholders, such as clinicians, policy-makers, patients, and their support networks, have insight into factors that can enhance the validity of an economic evaluation model. This research outlines a specific methodology for stakeholder engagement and represents an avenue to enhance health economic evaluations and support the use of these models to inform decision making for resource allocation. This protocol may inform a tailored framework for stakeholder engagement processes in future economic evaluation model development. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will involve clinicians, healthcare researchers, payers, and policy-makers, as well as patients and their support networks in the conduct and verification of an early economic evaluation of a novel health technology to incorporate stakeholder-generated knowledge. Three stakeholder-specific focus groups will be conducted using an online adaptation of the nominal group technique to elicit considerations from each.

Our multivariate analyses utilize multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression to examine the association between living arrangements and the COVID-19 outcome measures. Results show that those living alone were more likely to report having symptoms and having had a test for COVID-19. However, older adults in multigenerational (PR=1.532, 95% CI 1.15, 2.04, p<0.001) and skipped generation households (PR=1.607, 95% CI 1.04, 2.48, p<0.001) were more likely than solo-dwellers to test positive for COVID-19. Those with symptoms were more likely to test, regardless of their living arrangement.

However, among many treatment interventions being tested globally, beneficial effects and clinical improvements have been reported when convalescent plasma is used for treating COVID-19 patients. We prepared a guiding protocol for treating early to moderate COVID-19 patients with plasma transfusion from convalescent COVID-19 patients. This protocol was deduced based on previously published reports and studies that evaluated and tested convalescent plasma as a prospective therapy for COVID-19 patients. The protocol covers instructions on patient and donor selection criteria, plasma harvesting, plasma product specifications, dosage and precautions for convalescent plasma collection and transfusion process. Altogether, we prepared a treatment protocol that is tailored to the context of Sudan to be adopted by Sudan's health authority.

Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes, COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R0, across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.19-0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4-3.6 days). We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6-8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R0 value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. This translates to herd immunity thresholds needed to stop transmission to be between 73% and 84%. We further analyze how vaccination schedules depends on R0, the duration of vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and show that individual-level heterogeneity in vaccine induced immunity can significantly affect vaccination schedules.","output":"Estimating the reproductive number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States and eight European countries and implications for vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we present a toolset and related resources for rapid identification of viruses and microorganisms from short-read or long-read sequencing data.

UniqueKMER can generate complete sets of unique k-mers for each genome within a large set of viral or microbial genomes. For convenience, unique k-mers for microorganisms and common viruses that afflict humans have been generated and are provided with the tools. As a lightweight tool, fastv accepts FASTQ data as input and directly outputs the results in both HTML and JSON formats. Prior to the k-mer analysis, fastv automatically performs adapter trimming, quality pruning, base correction and other preprocessing to ensure the accuracy of k-mer analysis. Specifically, fastv provides built-in support for rapid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) identification and typing. Experimental results showed that fastv achieved 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 from sequencing data; and can distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and other coronaviruses.

Previous works proposed the automated method for excluding vessels from the liver region. However, only user-defined liver region remained a manual process. Therefore, this work aimed to develop an automated liver region segmentation technique to automate the whole process of median LIC calculation. METHODS: 553 MR examinations from 471 thalassemia major patients were used in this study. LIC maps (in mg/g dry weight) were calculated and used as the input of segmentation procedures. Anatomical landmark data were detected and used to restrict ROI. After that, the liver region was segmented using fuzzy c-means clustering and reduced segmentation errors by morphological processes. According to the clinical application, erosion with a suitable size of the structuring element was applied to reduce the segmented liver region to avoid uncertainty around the edge of the liver. The segmentation results were evaluated by comparing with manual segmentation performed by a board-certified radiologist. RESULTS: The proposed method was able to produce a good grade output in approximately 81% of all data. Approximately 11% of all data required an easy modification step. The rest of the output, approximately 8%, was an unsuccessful grade and required manual intervention by a user. For the evaluation matrices, percent dice similarity coefficient (%DSC) was in the range 86-92, percent Jaccard index (%JC) was 78-86, and Hausdorff distance (H) was 14-28 mm, respectively. In this study, percent false positive (%FP) and percent false negative (%FN) were applied to evaluate under- and over-segmentation that other evaluation matrices could not handle. The average of operation times could be reduced from 10 s per case using traditional method, to 1.5 s per case using our proposed method.

Methods: : We established an individual-based computer model to simulate the occurrence, infection, discovery, quarantine, and quarantine release (recovery) of AIIs or patients within the community. The model was used to explore the effects of measures such as active tracing, laboratory testing, active treatment, and home quarantine on the epidemic. Results: : Given the condition that R 0 =1.2, when a case of imported AII was reported in the community, the implementation of measures reduced the number of AIIs and patients by 62.2% and 62.4%, respectively. The number of undetected AIIs and patients peaked at 302 d of the epidemic, reaching 53 and 20 individuals, respectively.

In the present study we describe a novel protective immuno-modulatory function of CAP in inflammation. Among the three members of the Sorbs family of adapter molecules, which include CAP (Sorbs1), ArgBP2 (Sorbs2), and Vinexin (Sorbs3), CAP consistently down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, and myeloid-derived leukocytes, after Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. Upon the same TLR stimulation, ArgBP2 partially down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in mouse fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, while Vinexin rather promoted their production. Mechanistically, CAP limited pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by suppressing the phosphorylation of Inhibitor of kappa B (I&#954;B) kinase (I&#954;&#954;)-&#945; and I&#954;&#954;-? and their downstream NF-&#954;B-dependent signalling pathway.

However, very little is known about the role that subsurface microorganisms may play in the biogeochemical cycling of Cu. In this study, we investigate the bioreduction of Cu(II) by the subsurface metal-reducing bacterium, Geobacter sulfurreducens Rapid removal of Cu from solution was observed in cell suspensions of G. sulfurreducens when supplied with Cu(II), while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses showed the formation of electron dense nanoparticles associated with the cell surface. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) point analysis and EDX spectrum image maps revealed the nanoparticles are rich in both Cu and S. This was confirmed by x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-Ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses which identified the nanoparticles as Cu2S. Biomineralization of CuxS nanoparticles in soils has been reported to enhance the colloidal transport of a number of contaminants including Pb, Cd, and Hg. However, formation of these CuxS nanoparticles has only been observed under sulfate-reducing conditions and could not be repeated using isolates of implicated organisms. As G. sulfurreducens is unable to respire sulfate, and no reducible sulfur was supplied to the cells, these data suggest a novel mechanism for the biomineralization of Cu2S under anoxic conditions. The implications of these findings for the biogeochemical cycling of Cu and other metals as well as the green production of Cu catalysts are discussed.ImportanceDissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria are ubiquitous in soils and aquifers and are known to utilize a wide range of metals as terminal electron acceptors. These transformations play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of metals in pristine and contaminated environments and can be harnessed for bioremediation and metal bioprocessing purposes. However, relatively little is known about their interactions with Cu. As a trace element that becomes toxic in excess, Cu can adversely affect soil biota and fertility. In addition, biomineralization of Cu nanoparticles has been reported to enhance mobilization of other toxic metals. Here, we demonstrate that when supplied with acetate under anoxic conditions, the model metal-reducing bacterium, Geobacter sulfurreducens, can transform soluble Cu(II) to Cu2S nanoparticles. This study provides new insights into Cu biomineralization by microorganisms and suggests that contaminant mobilization enhanced by Cu biomineralization could be facilitated by Geobacter species and related organisms.","output":"Biomineralization of Cu2S nanoparticles by Geobacter sulfurreducens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Lauteure propose danalyser les facteurs en jeu dans le passage dune situation aigu? de la premire vague de la COVID,  une situation chronique, en service de mdecine griatrique dans le contexte, dj tendu, de lh?pital.

Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology that may provide effective behavioral therapeutics for chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct a double-blind, parallel-arm, single-cohort, remote, randomized placebo-controlled trial for a self-administered behavioral skills-based VR program in community-based individuals with self-reported chronic low back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A national online convenience sample of individuals with self-reported nonmalignant low back pain with duration of 6 months or more and with average pain intensity of 4 or more/10 was enrolled and randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 daily (56-day) VR programs: (1) EaseVRx (immersive pain relief skills VR program); or (2) Sham VR (2D nature content delivered in a VR headset). Objective device use data and self-reported data were collected. The primary outcomes were the between-group effect of EaseVRx versus Sham VR across time points, and the between-within interaction effect representing the change in average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep over time (baseline to end-of-treatment at day 56). Secondary outcomes were global impression of change and change in physical function, sleep disturbance, pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, pain medication use, and user satisfaction. Analytic methods included intention-to-treat and a mixed-model framework. RESULTS: The study sample was 179 adults (female: 76.5%, 137/179; Caucasian: 90.5%, 162/179; at least some college education: 91.1%, 163/179; mean age: 51.5 years [SD 13.1]; average pain intensity: 5/10 [SD 1.2]; back pain duration &#8805;5 years: 67%, 120/179). No group differences were found for any baseline variable or treatment engagement. User satisfaction ratings were higher for EaseVRx versus Sham VR (P<.001). For the between-groups factor, EaseVRx was superior to Sham VR for all primary outcomes (highest P value=.009), and between-groups Cohen d effect sizes ranged from 0.40 to 0.49, indicating superiority was moderately clinically meaningful. For EaseVRx, large pre-post effect sizes ranged from 1.17 to 1.3 and met moderate to substantial clinical importance for reduced pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress. Between-group comparisons for Physical Function and Sleep Disturbance showed superiority for the EaseVRx group versus the Sham VR group (P=.022 and .013, respectively). Pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, pain acceptance, prescription opioid use (morphine milligram equivalent) did not reach statistical significance for either group. Use of over-the-counter analgesic use was reduced for EaseVRx (P<.01) but not for Sham VR. CONCLUSIONS: EaseVRx had high user satisfaction and superior and clinically meaningful symptom reduction for average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress compared to sham VR. Additional research is needed to determine durability of treatment effects and to characterize mechanisms of treatment effects. Home-based VR may expand access to effective and on-demand nonpharmacologic treatment for chronic low back pain.

To identify features useful for supporting the confirmation of comorbid anxiety disorders, we investigated the prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders and their associated factors in Japanese patients with mood disorders using data from our previously reported JET-LMBP study. Patients and Methods: Patients with bipolar disorder (BD; n=114) and patients with major depressive disorder (MDD; n=334), all with major depressive episodes (DSM-IV-TR) were analyzed. Comorbid anxiety disorders were confirmed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Demographic and clinical features were assessed using patient background forms, including the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report Japanese version, 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and Child Abuse and Trauma Scale (CATS). Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and severity of depressive symptoms was used to identify factors associated with comorbid anxiety disorders (post hoc analysis). Results: The prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders was significantly higher in patients with BD (53.2%) than in patients with MDD (37.2%). Factors associated with comorbid anxiety disorders in BD included no spouse, interpersonal rejection sensitivity, higher CATS sexual abuse scores, and lower SF-36 mental component summary scores. In MDD, factors included hypersomnia, pathological guilt feelings, higher CATS neglect scores, and lower SF-36 physical component summary scores. Conclusion: Comorbid anxiety disorders were commonly seen in Japanese patients with mood disorders.

ED patients referred for outpatient GI follow-up were examined from before and after implementation of the GI TOC program. The GI TOC program at Stony Brook University Hospital (initiated July 2019) involved a message generated by ED referral orders to GI clinic. This message pool was reviewed by a Gastroenterologist who triaged each patient for urgency and directed patients to appropriate GI subspecialty clinics. The GI office then called patients to facilitate appointment scheduling. Patients discharged from the ED prior GI TOC were simply given the GI office phone number.

Conclusion: Patient navigation through a GI TOC program can result in improved outpatient GI follow-up. Expediting patient care, GI TOC programs can decrease repeat ED visits and costly hospitalizations. GI provider review of consults for urgency and appropriate subspecialty clinics can introduce increased efficiency in patient care.

Subsequent trials have been conflicting in their results and the utility of the drug has been widely debated. Methods: This is a record-based retrospective cohort study carried out in a 1000-bedded government teaching hospital in North India. The medical e-records of the Covid-19 positive patients who were admitted between June and November 2020 were reviewed for eligibility. After making the necessary exclusions, 112 patients were included in the remdesivir cohort and 85 in the standard care cohort. All the baseline characteristics of relevance and details of hospital admission were collected. The following outcomes in relation to remdesivir administration were assessed: all-cause mortality until discharge C stratified as per baseline oxygen support, age, gender and comorbidities;proportion of severe and non-severe patients progressing to mechanical ventilation later on;and time to clinical recovery in survivors. Results: There was a statistically significant association of higher mortality with the administration of remdesivir (odds ratio, OR 2.3, p-value 0.008) with a Cox regression hazard ratio of 1.590 (CI 0.944C2.679). The trend towards poorer outcomes in the remdesivir cohort persisted even after sub-stratification for age, gender, baseline severity (oxygen need) and comorbidities but failed to reach statistical significance in most of the strata. Similarly, remdesivir administration was associated with higher rates of progression to mechanical ventilation amongst those severe and non-severe patients who were not on mechanical ventilation at admission (49 % versus 15 %, p-value < 0.001, OR 5.2). This association was significant overall as well as for severe category patients when assessed separately (56% versus 26 %, p-value 0.04, OR 3.1). There was, however, no difference in the days taken for clinical recovery between the two groups (13.23 days versus 12.8 days, p-value 0.77). Conclusion: Remdesivir administration was associated with overall worse clinical outcomes. This study contradicts the benefits shown with remdesivir in previous clinical trials done in controlled settings and highlights the challenges that newer therapies face in real life hospital settings.

METHODS: A multi-site cross-sectional design was conducted from 1st through 30th of August 2020 at public health facilities of the study area. Adult outpatients with T2DM and hypertension visiting hospitals and health centers were included in the study. A proportion to size allocation method was used to determine the required sample size per facility. Data was collected using the 8-item Morisky medication adherence scale. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyze data. A 95% confidence interval and p&#8804;0.05 statistical significance was considered to determine factors associated with poor medication adherence. RESULTS: A total of 409 patients were included in the present study. About 57% of the patients reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has posed negative impacts on either of their follow-up visits, availability of medications, or affordability of prices. And, 21% have reported that they have been affected in all aspects. The overall magnitude of poor medication adherence was 72%. Patients with extreme poverty were more likely to have good medication adherence (AOR: 0.59; 95%C.I: 0.36-0.97), whereas attendance to a health center (AOR: 1.71; 95%C.I: 1.02-2.85), presence of comorbidity (AOR: 2.05; 95%C.I: 1.13-3.71), and current substance use history (AOR: 11.57; 95%C.I: 1.52-88.05) predicted high odds of poor adherence. CONCLUSION: Over a three-fourth of the patients, in the study setting, have poor adherence to their anti-diabetic and antihypertensive medications.

Primary method of transmission was firstly thought to be animal to human transmission. However, it has been observed that the virus is transmitted from human to human via respiratory droplets. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been isolated from patient stools, suggesting a possible gastrointestinal (GI) involvement. Most commonly reported clinical manifestations are fever, fatigue and dry cough. Interestingly, a small percentage of patients experience GI symptoms with the most common being anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The presence of viral RNA in stools is also common and fecal tests can be positive even after negative respiratory samples. The exact incidence of digestive symptoms is a matter of debate. The distribution of Angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 receptors in multiple organs in the body provides a possible explanation for the digestive symptoms' mechanism. Cases with solely GI symptoms have been reported in both adults and children. Viral RNA has also been detected in stool and blood samples, indicating the possibility of liver damage, which has been reported in COVID-19 patients. The presence of chronic liver disease appears to be a risk factor for severe complications and a poorer prognosis, however data from these cases is lacking. The aim of this review is firstly, to briefly update what is known about the origin and the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but mainly to focus on the manifestations of the GI tract and their pathophysiological background, so that physicians on the one hand, not to underestimate or disregard digestive symptoms due to the small number of patients exhibiting exclusively this symptomatology and on the other, to have SARS-CoV-2 on their mind when the \\"gastroenteritis\\" type symptoms predominate.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic: Pathophysiology and manifestations from the gastrointestinal tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continuing emergence of variant forms of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus is the probable consequence of using the current Covid\\\\19 vaccines. These vaccines do not induce the same immunity as do naturally occurring infections. First, the vaccines are given by intramuscular injections. This is far less effective than natural infection in stimulating the development of virus specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) producing cells and cytotoxic T cells (CTL) within the respiratory mucosa. Virus exposure in a previously vaccinated individual with limited mucosal immunity increases the risk of a persistent, subclinical infection, which will initially be restricted to the superficial mucosa. NIH and CDC officials have alluded to this possibility in advising those who have been vaccinated to continue wearing masks lest they may infect others. The second major distinction between the Covid\\\\19 vaccines and natural infection is the FDA allowance of using only one component as the antigen, namely the spike protein. Deletion or other modifications of a single targeted component can occur more readily as an immune evasion mechanism than concurrent genetic modifications of multiple antigenic components. Covid\\\\19 vaccine evoked immunity will, therefore, exert a strong immunoselective pressure for major modifications or deletion of the spike protein. With successive additional changes in the few remaining viral components that are normally targeted by cellular immunity, as well as the incorporation of sufficient genetic sequences from cells and other microbes; non\\\\immunogenic, pathogenic viruses will then emerge. These viruses will no longer be immunologically restricted to the respiratory mucosa and will become more widespread within the body. The immune evasion/escape mechanism utilized in this manner is termed stealth adaptation. It was initially identified in the cytomegaloviruses of monkeys used to produce polio vaccines. Not only were these viruses probably involved in causing AIDS, but they can account for the rise in many chronic illnesses, such as autism and the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Until proven otherwise, the neuropsychiatric symptoms of the Long Covid syndrome in previously healthy individuals, are consistent with brain infection with stealth adapted coronaviruses. This illness is, therefore, likely to be infectious, including the possibility of transplacental transmission. Testing for stealth adapted viruses in these patients is best performed using virus cultures followed by genetic sequencing. Even though cellular immunity fails to effectively suppress stealth adapted viruses, these viruses as well as the conventional viruses from which they are derived, are still susceptible to a non\\\\immunological anti\\\\virus defense mechanism mediated by the alternative cellular energy (ACE) pathway. This pathway is reflected in an added kinetic activity of the body's fluids. The environmental life\\\\force energy for the ACE pathway is called KELEA (Kinetic Energy Limiting Electrostatic Attraction). Water with high levels of KELEA is available for clinical studies. Enhancing the ACE pathway in those who are susceptible to severe Covid\\\\19 illness and in Long Covid syndrome patients is arguably preferable to risking the development of new forms of stealth adapted viruses by using the current Covid\\\\19 vaccines.","output":"Stealth Adapted Coronaviruses Resulting From the Use of Covid\\\\19 Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has hugely disrupted supply chains (SCs) in different sectors globally.

The outbreak of SARS created international anxiety because of its novelty, its ease of transmission in certain settings, and the speed of its spread through jet travel, combined with extensive media coverage. The psychological impacts of SARS, coupled with travel restrictions imposed by various national and international authorities, have diminished international travel in 2003, far beyond the limitations to truly SARS hit areas. Governments and press, especially in non SARS affected areas, have been slow to strike the right balance between timely and frequent risk communication and placing risk in the proper context. Screening at airport entry points is costly, has a low yield and is not sufficient in itself. The low yield in detecting SARS is most likely due to a combination of factors, such as travel advisories which resulted in reduced travel to and from SARS affected areas, implementation of effective pre-departure screening at airports in SARS-hit countries, and a rapid decline in new cases at the time when screening was finally introduced. Rather than investing in airport screening measures to detect rare infectious diseases, investments should be used to strengthen screening and infection control capacities at points of entry into the healthcare system.

We hypothesized that IL-6 trans-signaling in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) leads to endotheliopathy (a proinflammatory and procoagulant state) and liver injury in COVID-19. METHODS: Coagulopathy, endotheliopathy, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were retrospectively analyzed in a subset (n = 68), followed by a larger cohort (n = 3,780) of patients with COVID-19. Liver histology from 43 patients with COVID-19 was analyzed for endotheliopathy and its relationship to liver injury. Primary human LSECs were used to establish the IL-6 trans-signaling mechanism. RESULTS: Factor VIII, fibrinogen, D-dimer, von Willebrand factor (vWF) activity/antigen (biomarkers of coagulopathy/endotheliopathy) were significantly elevated in patients with COVID-19 and liver injury (elevated ALT). IL-6 positively correlated with vWF antigen (p = 0.02), factor VIII activity (p = 0.02), and D-dimer (p <0.0001). On liver histology, patients with COVID-19 and elevated ALT had significantly increased vWF and platelet staining, supporting a link between liver injury, coagulopathy, and endotheliopathy. Intralobular neutrophils positively correlated with platelet (p <0.0001) and vWF (p <0.01) staining, and IL-6 levels positively correlated with vWF staining (p <0.01). IL-6 trans-signaling leads to increased expression of procoagulant (factor VIII, vWF) and proinflammatory factors, increased cell surface vWF (p <0.01), and increased platelet attachment in LSECs. These effects were blocked by soluble glycoprotein 130 (IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitor), the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, and STAT1/3 small-interfering RNA knockdown. Hepatocyte fibrinogen expression was increased by the supernatant of LSECs subjected to IL-6 trans-signaling. CONCLUSION: IL-6 trans-signaling drives the coagulopathy and hepatic endotheliopathy associated with COVID-19 and could be a possible mechanism behind liver injury in these patients. LAY SUMMARY: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection often have liver injury, but why this occurs remains unknown. High levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its circulating receptor, which form a complex to induce inflammatory signals, have been observed in patients with COVID-19.

Les expriences rcentes du SRAS et de la grippe aviaire en sont les meilleurs exemples. Abstract Emergent viruses have attracted attention during years 2003 and 2004. Ancient fears have reappeared regarding pathogenic agents, capable to result in epidemics with high mortality rates. Such events constitute really repeated threats. The analysis of mechanisms permitting emergence of these viruses has shown that they are not random phenomenons, but they result from accumulated factors leading to transmission from animals to men. Several modes of transmission of infection include: either direct transmission, or by intermediate vectors (mosquitoes, ticks and other (mammals) animals). Convergence of ecologic, economic and epidemiologic factors confer to the epidemics potential ability do spread widely. With the development of surveillance networks and improvement in diagnostic technologies, these new viruses are better identified. Recent occurrence of SARS and of the avian influenza are best examples of such experiences.","output":"Virus mergents ou menaces  rptition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus pneumonia has been listed as one of the Class B infectious disease but is managed as Class A infectious disease.

All this involves difficulties in finding the right ventilation parameters and an adequate driving pressure to guarantee sufficient ventilation. Therefrom, new mechanical ventilation techniques were sought that could help overcome the aforementioned obstacles. A new mode of mechanical ventilation is being presented, i.e., a Positive + Negative Synchronized Ventilation (PNSV), characterized by the association and integration of two pulmonary ventilators; one acting inside the chest with positive pressures and one externally with negative pressure. The peculiarity of this combination is the complete synchronization, which takes place with specific electronic modifications. The PNSV can be applied both in a completely non-invasive and invasive way and, therefore, be used both in acute care wards and in ICU. The most relevant effect found, due to the compensation of opposing pressures acting on the chest, is that, during the entire inspiratory act created by the ventilators, the pressure at the alveolar level is equal to zero even if adding together the two ventilators pressures; thus, the transpulmonary pressure is doubled. The application of this pressure for 1 hour on elderly patients suffering from severe acute respiratory failure, resulted in a significant improvement in blood gas analytical and clinical parameters without any side effects. An increased pulmonary recruitment, including posterior lung areas, and a reduction in spontaneous ventilatory rate have also been demonstrated with PNSV. This also paves the way to the search for the best ventilatory treatment in critically ill or ARDS patients. The compensation of intrathoracic pressures should also lead, although not yet proven, to an improvement in venous return, systolic and cardiac output. In the analysis of the study in which this method was applied, the total transpulmonary pressure delivered was the sum of the individual pressures applied by the two ventilators. However, this does not exclude the possibility of reducing the pressures of the two machines to modulate a lower but balanced total transpulmonary pressure within the chest.","output":"A new mode of mechanical ventilation: positive + negative synchronized ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Excessive inflammation triggered by a hitherto undescribed mechanism is a hallmark of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and is associated with enhanced pathogenicity and mortality.

The same clinic templates which existed for face-to-face encounters have been retrospectively adapted, without consideration of any potential difference in duration of consultations. Rheumatology practitioners from a variety of clinical backgrounds work alongside the rheumatology consultants, providing clinical care to patients with both inflammatory arthritis and connective tissue disease. Objectives: To record the duration of all scheduled telephone consultations carried out by advances rheumatology practitioners in a 4-week period. Methods: All scheduled telephone clinic encounters over a 4-week period were timed and the duration recorded in a spreadsheet. Data was collected in real time by all 8 rheumatology advanced practitioners working within the rheumatology department of a district general hospital, following each clinic episode. Results: Data was recorded from a total of 337 clinic appointments. Of these, 317 (94%) were booked as routine, 3 (0.9%) as urgent, 4 (1.2%) were expedited following an advice line contact, and 13 (3.9%) no data was recorded. 28 (8%) of the patients did not answer when contacted. 80 (24%) clinic appointments lasted 15 minutes or less, 186 (55%) lasted 16 -30 minutes, 37 (11%) lasted 31 -45 minutes, and 6 (2%) lasted 46 -60 minutes. The average duration was 22 minutes. Conclusion: Within this department, remote consultations appear to have a similar duration when compared against the traditional clinic template for a fully faceto-face clinic, with some encounters lasting significantly longer than the planned duration. This would appear to differ to telephone consultations used in other settings, such as general practice where the duration is reportedly shorter1. This may be representative of the additional complexity and co-morbidity of a typical rheumatology patient, or due to the multi-faceted nature of a rheumatology follow-up appointment2. Although remote consultations are effective in limiting risk of exposure to Covid-19, they may not offer a quicker or more efficient service compared with the face-to-face model. Further study in this field is required to evaluate this widely adopted new pattern of working.","output":"Duration of telephone consultations amongst rheumatology practitioners in a district general hospital-adapting to remote consultation in a COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV2 pandemic has exposed the acute vulnerability of the health systems of countries worldwide.

The clinical relevance of liver injury related to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear with a need for prospective studies on the impact of liver function test (LFT) abnormalities at baseline. DESIGN: Data of 217 patients without pre-existing liver disease prospectively included in the COVID-19 registry of the LMU university hospital were analysed in order to assess the association of abnormal LFT at admission and course of the disease. Severe course was defined as admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or as COVID-19-related death. RESULTS: Abnormal LFT at baseline was present in 58% of patients, with a predominant elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (42%), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) (37%) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (27%), hypoalbuminaemia was observed in 33%. Elevation of ALT and GGT, as well as hypoalbuminaemia, was associated with higher proportions of patients requiring ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, hypoalbuminaemia combined with abnormal AST or GGT at hospital admission was a highly significant independent risk factor for ICU admission (OR 46.22 and 38.8, respectively) and for a composite endpoint of ICU admission and/or COVID-19-related death (OR 42.0 and 26.9, respectively).

An accurate and validated transmission model for T. solium would serve as an important new tool for control and elimination, as it would allow for comparison of available intervention strategies, and prioritization of the most effective strategies for control and elimination efforts. METHODS: We developed a spatially-explicit agent-based model (ABM) for T. solium (\\"CystiAgent\\") that differs from prior T. solium models by including a spatial framework and behavioral parameters such as pig roaming, open human defecation, and human travel. In this article, we introduce the structure and function of the model, describe the data sources used to parameterize the model, and apply sensitivity analyses (Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC)) to evaluate model parameters. RESULTS: LHS-PRCC analysis of CystiAgent found that the parameters with the greatest impact on model uncertainty were the roaming range of pigs, the infectious duration of human taeniasis, use of latrines, and the set of \\"tuning\\" parameters defining the probabilities of infection in humans and pigs given exposure to T. solium. CONCLUSIONS: CystiAgent is a novel ABM that has the ability to model spatial and behavioral features of T. solium transmission not available in other models. There is a small set of impactful model parameters that contribute uncertainty to the model and may impact the accuracy of model projections. Field and laboratory studies to better understand these key components of transmission may help reduce uncertainty, while current applications of CystiAgent may consider calibration of these parameters to improve model performance. These results will ultimately allow for improved interpretation of model validation results, and usage of the model to compare available control and elimination strategies for T. solium.","output":"Understanding transmission and control of the pork tapeworm with CystiAgent: a spatially explicit agent-based model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fetal safety is a major concern with the global spread of COVID-19, but there is scarce information regarding vertical transmission and how it affects the fetus.

Recognition of the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia is essential for assessing the bleeding risk and tailoring therapeutic options. A typical clinical scenario is the occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients experiencing transient thrombocytopenia during myelosuppressive chemotherapy. In such patients, the severity of thrombocytopenia, thrombus burden, clinical symptoms, and the timing of VTE relative to thrombocytopenia must be considered. In clinical practice, distinct hematological disorders characterized by low platelet counts and a thrombogenic state require specific diagnostics and treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed to assess significant risk factors in adult patients deceased from COVID-19 infection by evaluating Electronic Medical Records and post-mortem analysis in COVID-19 patients deceased between April 2020 to October 2020. All patients underwent post-mortem evaluation along with medical history analysis, including data on disease duration, hospitalization, and clinical peculiarities. RESULTS: Medical records of 1487 COVID-19 patients revealed that the prevalence of males was higher (by 23%) than females; the median age for males was 71 years of age whereas for females it was 78.

However, these cases rarely represent all cases in the wider community. In this context, community-based investigations may provide additional insight into key risk factors for infection, however, the benefits of these more laborious data collection strategies remains unclear. Methods We used different subsets of the data from a comprehensive outbreak investigation to compare the inferences we make in alternative investigation strategies. Results The outbreak investigation team interviewed 1,933 individuals from 460 homes. 364 (18%) of individuals had symptoms consistent with chikungunya. A theoretical clinic-based study would have identified 26% of the cases. Adding in community-based cases provided an overall estimate of the attack rate in the community. Comparison with controls from the same household revealed that those with at least secondary education had a reduced risk. Finally, enrolling residents from households across the community allowed us to characterize spatial heterogeneity of risk and identify the type of clothing usually worn and travel history as risk factors. This also revealed that household-level use of mosquito control was not associated with infection. Conclusions These findings highlight that while clinic-based studies may be easier to conduct, they only provide limited insight into the burden and risk factors for disease.

The reductions were seen across the different blood components (packed red blood cells [PRBC]: 585 vs. 1840, platelet rich plasma: 372 vs. 1313, single donor platelet 18 vs. 16), with a significant reduction in the mean PRBC transfused per PRBC transfusion session (1.11 vs 1.99, p<0.001) in 2020, compared to 2019. There were however no major differences in the transfusion practices across the different phases of the lockdown. Our study highlights the detrimental reduction in transfusion services due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdown and showcases the remedial strategies taken to maximize transfusion support to patients during this period. Our observations might help to provide insights to adequately combat possible similar adverse situations in the future.","output":"Transfusion practices during the COVID-19 pandemic: an experience from a hematology daycare in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Knowledge bases (KBs) and text often contain complementary knowledge: KBs store structured knowledge that can support long range reasoning, while text stores more comprehensive and timely knowledge in an unstructured way.

This scenario in a way increased the rubber solid waste disposal problem; therefore, the production of biodegradable gloves may be an option to overcome this problem. However, the need to study the shelf life of biodegradable gloves is crucial before commercialization. There are well-established models to address the failure properties of gloves as stated in the American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) D7160. In this study, polysaccharide-based material-filled natural rubber latex (PFNRL) gloves, which are biodegradable gloves, were subjected to an accelerated aging process at different temperatures of 50C80 C for 1C120 days. Prediction models based on Arrhenius and shift factors were used to estimate the shelf life of the PFNRL gloves. Based on the results obtained, the estimated time for the PFNRL gloves to retain 75% of their tensile strength at shelf temperature (30 C) based on Arrhenius and shift factor models was 2.8 years. Verification on the activation energy based on the shift factor model indicated that the shelf life of PFNRL gloves is 2.9 years, which is only a 3.6% difference. The value obtained is aligned with the requirement in accordance with ASTM D7160, which states that only up to a maximum of 3 years shelf life is allowed for the gloves under accelerated aging conditions.","output":"Biodegradable Gloves for Waste Management Post-COVID-19 Outbreak: A Shelf-Life Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: RNA vaccines against Covid-19 have demonstrated a95% efficacy in Phase III clinical trials. Although complete vaccination consisted of two-doses, the onset of protection for both licensed RNA vaccines was observed as early as 12 days after a single dose. The adaptive immune response that coincides with this onset of protection could represent the necessary elements of immunity against Covid-19. Methods: Serological and T cell analysis was performed in a cohort of 20 healthcare workers after receiving the first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine. The primary endpoint was the adaptive immune responses detectable at Days 7 and 10 after dosing. Results: Spike-specific T cells and binding antibodies were detectable 10 days after the first dose of vaccine, in contrast to receptor-blocking and SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies which were mostly undetectable at this early time-point.

A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of coronavirus pathogenesis is needed, including how these highly virulent strains differ from those that cause milder, common-cold like disease. While significant progress has been made in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with the host cell, non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) has largely been omitted from the analyses. Nsp3 is a viral protease with important roles in viral protein biogenesis, replication complex formation, and modulation of host ubiquitinylation and ISGylation. Herein, we use affinity purification-mass spectrometry to study the host-viral protein-protein interactome of nsp3 from five coronavirus strains: pathogenic strains SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV; and endemic common-cold strains hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43. We divide each nsp3 into three fragments and use tandem mass tag technology to directly compare the interactors across the five strains for each fragment. We find that few interactors are common across all variants for a particular fragment, but we identify shared patterns between select variants, such as ribosomal proteins enriched in the N-terminal fragment (nsp3.1) dataset for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We also identify unique biological processes enriched for individual homologs, for instance nuclear protein important for the middle fragment of hCoV-229E, as well as ribosome biogenesis of the MERS nsp3.2 homolog. Lastly, we further investigate the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 N-terminal fragment with ATF6, a regulator of the unfolded protein response. We show that SARS-CoV-2 nsp3.1 directly binds to ATF6 and can suppress the ATF6 stress response. Characterizing the host interactions of nsp3 widens our understanding of how coronaviruses co-opt cellular pathways and presents new avenues for host-targeted antiviral therapeutics.","output":"Comparative host interactomes of the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 3 and human coronavirus homologs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The overall objectives of this rapid scoping review are to (a) identify the common triggers of stress, burnout, and depression faced by women in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (b) explore individual-, organizational-, and systems-level interventions that can support the well-being of women HCWs during a pandemic. Design: This scoping review is registered on Open Science Framework (OSF) and was guided by the JBI guide to scoping reviews and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension to scoping reviews. A systematic search of literature databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo and ERIC) was conducted from inception until June 12, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Interventions: We included review articles and primary studies that reported on stress, burnout, and depression in HCWs; that primarily focused on women; and that included the percentage or number of women included. All English language studies from any geographical setting where COVID-19 has affected the population were reviewed. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Studies reporting on mental health outcomes (e.g., stress, burnout, and depression in HCWs), interventions to support mental health well-being were included. Results: Of the 2,803 papers found, 28 were included. The triggers of stress, burnout and depression are grouped under individual-, organizational-, and systems-level factors. There is a limited amount of evidence on effective interventions that prevents anxiety, stress, burnout and depression during a pandemic. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings show that women HCWs are at increased risk for stress, burnout, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative outcomes are triggered by individual level factors such as lack of social support; family status; organizational factors such as access to personal protective equipment or high workload; and systems-level factors such as prevalence of COVID-19, rapidly changing public health guidelines, and a lack of recognition at work.","output":"Occupational Stress, Burnout, and Depression in Women in Healthcare During COVID-19 Pandemic: Rapid Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has caused nearly all face-to-face classes in all schools and institutions of higher education around the world to stop temporarily, including Malaysia to curb the spread of the virus.

In order to assess whether B. dendrobatidis is present on the native amphibians of Hong Kong, we sampled wild populations of Amolops hongkongensis, Paa exilispinosa, P. spinosa and Rana chloronota during 2005-2006. Amphibians infected with B. dendrobatidis have been found in the international trade, so we also examined the extent and nature of the amphibian trade in Hong Kong during 2005-2006, and assessed whether B. dendrobatidis was present in imported amphibians. All 274 individuals of 4 native amphibian species sampled tested negative for B. dendrobatidis, giving an upper 95% confidence limit for prevalence of 1.3%. Approximately 4.3 million amphibians of 45 species from 11 countries were imported into Hong Kong via air over 12 mo; we did not detect B. dendrobatidis on any of 137 imported amphibians sampled. As B. dendrobatidis generally occurs at greater than 5% prevalence in infected populations during favorable environmental conditions, native amphibians in Hong Kong appear free of B. dendrobatidis, and may be at severe risk of impact if it is introduced. Until it is established that the pathogen is present in Hong Kong, management strategies should focus on preventing it from being imported and decreasing the risk of it escaping into the wild amphibian populations if imported.

However, whether early radiographic change is a predictor of fatality remains unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of all laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to a quarantine unit at Tongji Hospital, a large regional hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 31 and March 5, 2020. Confirmed cases were defined by positive RT-PCR detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in throat-swab specimens. Chest CT images were reviewed independently by two radiologists. The Tongji Hospital ethics committee approved this study. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. As of March 25, 85 confirmed patients were discharged, 15 died, and 2 remained hospitalized. When compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (median age, 69 [interquartile range, 58-77] vs. 55 [44-66], p = 0.003), and more likely to have decreased lymphocyte count (0.5 vs. 0.9  109/L, p = 0.006), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (569.0 vs. 272.0 U/L, p < 0.001), elevated d-dimer (> 1 g/mL, 86% vs. 37%, p = 0.002) on admission. Older age and elevated LDH were independent risk factors for fatality in a multivariate regression model included the above variables. In a subset of patients with CT images within the first week, higher total severity score, and more involved lung lobes (5 involved lobes) in CT images within the first week were significantly associated with fatality. Moreover, in this subset of patients, higher total severity score was the only independent risk factor in a multivariate analysis incorporating the above mentioned variables. CONCLUSIONS: Older age, elevated LDH on admission, and higher severity score of CT images within the first week are potential predictors of fatality in adults with COVID-19.

To date there is emerging evidence to provide effectiveness and compliance to intervention measures on COVID-19 due to rapid spread of the disease. We synthesized evidence of community interventions and innovative practices to mitigate COVID-19 as well as previous respiratory outbreak infections which may share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. In the study, we systematically searched the literature on community interventions to mitigate COVID-19, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), H1N1 Influenza and MERS (middle east respiratory syndrome) epidemics in PubMed, Google Scholar, World Health Organization (WHO), MEDRXIV and Google from their inception until May 30, 2020 for up-to-date published and grey resources. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicates. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020183064). Of 41,138 papers found, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria in various settings in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). One of the papers from LMICs originated from Africa (Madagascar) with the rest from Asia 9 (China 5, Bangladesh 2, Thailand 2); South America 5 (Mexico 3, Peru 2) and Europe 2 (Serbia and Romania). Following five studies on the use of face masks, the risk of contracting SARS and Influenza was reduced OR 0.78 and 95% CI = 0.36-1.67. Equally, six studies on hand hygiene practices reported a reduced risk of contracting SARS and Influenza OR 0.95 and 95% CI = 0.83-1.08. Further two studies that looked at combined use of face masks and hand hygiene interventions showed the effectiveness in controlling the transmission of influenza OR 0.94 and 95% CI = 0.58-1.54. Nine studies on social distancing intervention demonstrated the importance of physical distance through closure of learning institutions on the transmission dynamics of disease. The evidence confirms the use of face masks, good hand hygiene and social distancing as community interventions are effective to control the spread of SARS and influenza in LMICs. However, the effectiveness of community interventions in LMICs should be informed by adherence of the mitigation measures and contextual factors taking into account the best practices. The study has shown gaps in adherence/compliance of the interventions, hence a need for robust intervention studies to better inform the evidence on compliance of the interventions. Nevertheless, this rapid review of currently best available evidence might inform interim guidance on similar respiratory infectious diseases like Covid-19 in Kenya and similar LMIC context.","output":"Community interventions in Low-And Middle-Income Countries to inform COVID-19 control implementation decisions in Kenya: A rapid systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis is an unprecedented event.

We, therefore, explored the lived experiences of patients and patient representatives in all six World Health Organisation (WHO) regions regarding healthcare at the time of COVID-19 and extracted suggestions for care redesign after the pandemic. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews until saturation. Thematic analysis followed a modified form of meaning condensation. We established rigour by transcript checking, inter-coder agreement, quote variation and standardised reporting. Results: Disadvantaged people experienced an unprecedented inequity in healthcare due to the pandemic. The main reasons were the reduction in public care services and limited access to information, transportation, technology and income. Stigmatisation from COVID-19 differed between cultural contexts and ranged from none to feeling 'ashamed' and 'totally bashed'. Participants experienced telehealth as indispensable but with limitations. These included giving 'bad news', such as having an eye removed because of melanoma, and the difficulty of providing end-of-life care over the phone. Patient representatives redefined their role and became indispensable influencers throughout the pandemic and beyond. Conclusion: We reached out to individuals with a diversity of perspectives, including minorities and marginalised populations.

During this period, the average rate of tests completed for SARS-CoV-2 increased to more than 4,000 per day (Figure 1A), the percentage of hospitalized individuals who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 increased to approximately 80% (Figure 1B), the median turnaround time from specimen collected to result reported decreased to less than 1 day (Figure 1C), and the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 clinical specimens collected in VHA facilities that were tested at VHA laboratories increased to more than 80% (Figure 1D). Based on inventories of high-throughput and rapid diagnostic instruments (Figure 2), VHA could perform at least 20,000 tests for SARS-CoV-2 per week. Figure 1.

The clinical manifestations of DEN are variable, and the disease may present subclinically or asymptomatically. A quarter of patients develop classical dengue (CD) or severe dengue (SD), which is potentially lethal and involves vascular permeability changes, severe hemorrhage and organ damage. The involvement of the liver is a fairly common feature in DEN, and alterations range from asymptomatic elevation of transaminases to acute liver failure. Since its introduction in Brazil in 1990, two strains of Dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 (DENV-2) have been detected: Lineage I, which is responsible for an outbreak in 1991, and Lineage II, which caused an epidemic greater than the previous one and had a different epidemiological profile. To date, studies on different strains of the same serotype/genotype and their association with disease severity are scarce. In addition, one of the greatest challenges regarding the study of DEN pathogenesis and the development of drug and vaccine therapies is the absence of an animal model that reproduces the disease as it occurs in humans. The main goals of this study were to assess BALB/c mouse susceptibility experimentally infected by two distinct DENV-2 strains and characterize possible differences in the clinical signs and alterations induced in the liver resulting from those infections. Mice infected by the two DENV-2 lineages gained less weight than uninfected mice; however, their livers were slightly heavier. Increased AST and AST levels were observed in infected mice, and the number of platelets increased in the first 72 h of infection and subsequently decreased. Mice infected with both lineages presented leukocytosis but at different times of infection. The histopathological changes induced by both lineages were similar and comparable to the changes observed in DEN fatal cases. The viral genome was detected in two liver samples. The results demonstrate the susceptibility of BALB/c mice to both DENV-2 lineages and suggest that the changes induced by those strains are similar, although for some parameters, they are manifested at different times of infection.","output":"Comparative analysis of liver involvement caused by two DENV-2 lineages using an immunocompetent murine model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To quantify the delay in SARS-CoV-2 real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and test result reporting in Mexico and Colombia, and to assess the relation between margination status and these delays. Methods: We quantified time in days from symptom onset until testing (latency one) and delay in test results report (latency two) using freely available country-wide open data from Mexico and Colombia. Directed acyclic graphs were built to determine which associations were appropriate to assess. Stratification by margination status, state and hospitalization status was used to determine corresponding associations. Results: In almost all the study period latency two was longer than latency one. Median latency one was 3 (IQR 0-6) days and latency two 7 (IQR 4-11) days in Colombia, while in Mexico they were 3 (IQR 1-5) days and 4 (IQR 3-6) days. In Colombia, worse margination status prolonged latency two. In Mexico, a lower number and percentage of point-of-care (POC) tests in areas with worse margination. Conclusion: POC tests must be used as a widespread means to reduce latency two, and until then should be prioritized in areas with longer latency two.

The performance of Fe(ii)-S codoped g-C3N4 compounds in RhB photocatalytic degradation was found to increase 5 times. This significant enhancement in catalytic activity is probably related to the enhanced visible light adsorption and the mobility of photoinduced electron/hole pairs, attributable to bandgap narrowing and also lowering in the surface electrostatic potential compared to that of the pure g-C3N4 nanosheets.

METHODS: This was an interventional study in which adult patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) were consecutively enrolled. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality after the initiation of MV. The secondary endpoints were length of MV, volume of lung injury, and the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and acute liver failure. RESULTS: Thirty patients with COVID-19 underwent nintedanib therapy. We included 30 patients not receiving nintedanib as the historical control group. There were no significant differences in 28-day mortality between the groups (23.3% vs 20%, p = 0.834). Lengths of MV were significantly shorter in the nintedanib group (p = 0.046).

Little generalizable data exists on the experiences of MAiD providers who comprise a small, and intentionally hidden, population. OBJECTIVE: To examine the nature, extent, and consequences of physicians participation in MAiD. DESIGN: An anonymous, multi-wave, mailed survey (RR= 55%). PARTICIPANTS: An enriched sample (n=583) of Colorado physicians caring for potential MAiD patients. MAIN MEASURES: Physician willingness, preparedness, and participation in a continuum of MAiD activities. Other outcomes include the effects of providing MAiD and the barriers physicians face related to MAiD. KEY RESULTS: Overall, 81.1% of respondents were willing to discuss MAiD with a patient, 88.3% to refer for MAiD, 46.3% to be a consultant, and 28.1% to be an attending. Fewer felt prepared to discuss MAiD (54.4%), provide a MAiD referral (62.8%), be a consultant (30.7%), or be an attending (18.0%). More than half of respondents (52.3%) had discussed MAiD with a patient, 27.3% provided a MAiD referral, 12.8% had been a MAiD consultant, and 8.5% had been a MAiD attending. Among MAiD consultants and attendings, 75% reported that their most recent MAiD case was emotionally fulfilling and professionally rewarding, though 75% also reported that it was time consuming and 46.9% reported that it was ethically challenging. Common barriers to physician participation in MAiD include lack of knowledge about MAiD (46.8%), the emotional (45.6%) and time (41.7%) investments, and ethical concerns (41.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians in our sample are both willing and prepared to discuss MAiD with patients and to provide MAiD referrals. Fewer are prepared and willing to serve as an attending or consultant and fewer have provided these services.

However, the literature that involves both equity and efficiency in its analysis of healthcare spatial allocation is rare, and the spatial accessibility of multilevel healthcare is difficult to measure by traditional methods in a large region with diversified population distribution. METHODS: To assist in solving these issues, this paper aims to build an equity and efficiency integrated analytical framework by proposing a new GTL-2SFCA approach to analyze the spatial accessibility of multilevel healthcare; maximum and minimum floating catchments of different levels of healthcare were assigned to ensure a combination of universal search coverage and efficient hospitalization behavior simulation. RESULTS: The analytical framework was applied and tested in Hubei, China. Almost half of the residents (47.95%) and townships (44.98%) have access to both public general hospitals (PGHs) and primary healthcare centers (PHCs) services, 36.89% of the residents enjoy only one sufficient service, either PGHs or PHCs, and the remaining residents (15.16%) are faced with the risk of lacking access to both services. The results reveal that there are core-periphery effects of multilevel healthcare throughout Hubei and isolate clusters that have adequate access in the western region. The polarization effect of higher-level healthcare and the polycentric pattern of lower-level healthcare coexist. The multilevel healthcare shortage was identified in some areas in boundary and peripheral regions.

Therefore, having a knowledgeable healthcare workforce with appropriate skills and competencies to prevent and manage outbreaks of a neglected infectious disease such as LF in Nigeria will potentially enhance public health. Thus, this survey assessed the level of knowledge of LF and its prevention and control (PC) measures amongst the healthcare workers (HCWs) during a LF outbreak in Katsina state, Nigeria. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During this cross-sectional survey, HCWs complete a validated 29-item questionnaire comprising 18 items on the knowledge of LF and its PC measures and an item on global self-evaluation of their LF knowledge. Psychometric properties of the questionnaire were evaluated. Chi-square and binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. Out of 435 HCWs invited, a total of 400 participated in the study (92% response rate). The majority of participants (51.8%) demonstrated inadequate LF knowledge, with 62.9% of those scoring low having a high self-perception of their LF knowledge with the global scale. This LF knowledge over-estimation was predicted by LF training status (odds ratio (OR) 2.53; 95% CI: 1.49C4.30; p = 0.001). The level of LF knowledge and its PC measures among the study participants was low (11.608.14, 64.4%) and predicted by participants LF training status (OR 2.06; 95% CI: 1.19C3.57; p = 0.009), place of work (OR 1.82; 95% CI: 1.07C3.08; p = 0.03) and their designations (OR 2.40; 95% CI: 1.10C5.22; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The level of knowledge of LF and its PC measures among the HCWs surveyed was suboptimal and participants LF training status, place of work and occupational category were the significant predictors. In addition, LF knowledge overestimation on a global scale was observed among a majority of HCWs and this was also predicted by LF training status. Therefore, there is a critical need for health authorities in Nigeria to prioritize continuous on-the-job training of HCWs on priority neglected tropical diseases such as Lassa fever.","output":"Knowledge of Lassa fever, its prevention and control practices and their predictors among healthcare workers during an outbreak in Northern Nigeria: A multi-centre cross-sectional assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This letter argues that we need to pay particular attention to people with dementia during this difficult time of the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the effectiveness of this approach depends on the adherence of a large segment of the population. OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to estimate, the acceptability in France of a contact tracing app using mobile phones, and to investigate the barriers to its use. METHODS: The Health Literacy Survey 2019 survey questioned 1 003 people in France during the COVID-19 pandemic on the basis of quota sampling. It collected sociodemographic characteristics and health literacy but also information on communication with caregivers, trust in institutions, and COVID-19 knowledge and preventive behaviours. The acceptability of a mobile app for contact tracing was measured by a single question, the responses of which were grouped into three modalities: App-supporting, App-willing and App-reluctant. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with the acceptability of a mobile app in the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Only 19.2% (193 out of 1 003) were App-supporting while half of the participants (n=504, 50.3%) were reluctant. The factors associated with willing or supporting the tracking app were: lower financial deprivation (respectively adjusted Odds Ratio=0.8, 95% Confidence Interval [0.69 - 0.93] and adjusted Odds Ratio=0.7, 95% Confidence Interval [0.58 - 0.84]) and higher perceived usefulness of using a mobile app to send health questionnaires to doctors (respectively adjusted Odds Ratio=2.3, 95% Confidence Interval [1.70 - 3.26] and adjusted Odds Ratio=3.1, 95% Confidence Interval [2.04 - 4.82]). Age over 60 (adjusted Odds Ratio=1.9, 95% Confidence Interval [1.13 - 3.22]), trust in political representatives (adjusted Odds Ratio=2.7, 95% Confidence Interval [1.72 - 4.23]), feeling concerned about the pandemic situation (adjusted Odds Ratio=2.2, 95% Confidence Interval [1.47 - 3.32]), and knowledge about the transmission of COVID-19 (adjusted Odds Ratio=2.0, 95% Confidence Interval [1.39 - 2.96]) increased the likelihood of supporting the tracking app. CONCLUSIONS: The most economically precarious people, who are more at risk of SARS-CoV-2, are also the most reluctant to use a contact tracing app. Therefore, optimal adherence can only be effective with a targeted discourse on public health benefits to adopt such an app which should be combined with a reduction in inequalities by acting on structural determinants.","output":"Early acceptability of a mobile app for contact tracing in the COVID-19 pandemic: French national online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Comprehensive data on early prognostic indicators in patients with mild COVID-19 remains sparse.

Examinations during the shut down (March 9, 2020, to June 6, 2020) were excluded. Patient-specific factors (eg, race, ethnicity), imaging modalities, and care settings were extracted from the Research Data Warehouse. Primary outcome was number of diagnostic radiology examinations per day compared pre- and post-COVID-19 shutdown. Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression determined features associated with completing an examination. RESULTS: Despite resumption of nonurgent services, marked decrease in radiology examination utilization persisted in all care settings post-COVID-19 shutdown (869 examinations per day preshutdown [59,080 examinations in 68 days] versus 502 examinations per day postshutdown [19,594 examinations in 39 days]), with more significantly decreased odds ratios for having examinations in inpatient and outpatient settings versus in the emergency department.

Also, the effect of gender on the outcomes of COVID-19 has not been well-defined. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to May 29, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using random effect model. P < 0.05 was considered a statistically significant publication bias. Results: Out of 1,223 studies, 34 satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 5,057 patients with a mean age of 49 years were evaluated. Fever (83.0%, CI 77.5C87.6) and cough (65.2%, CI 58.6C71.2) were the most common symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (18.5%, CI 12.7C24.4) and Cardiovascular disease (14.9%, CI 6.0C23.8). Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72.0%, CI 54.3C84.6) and lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0C62.4) were the most common. Bilateral ground-glass opacities (66.0%, CI 51.1C78.0) was the most common CT scan presentation. The pooled mortality rate was 6.6%, with males having significantly higher mortality compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2C9.1, P = 0.01). Conclusion: COVID-19 has caused a significant number of hospitalization and mortality worldwide. Mortality associated with COVID-19 was higher in our study compared to the previous reports from China. The mortality was significantly higher among the hospitalized male group. Further studies are required to evaluate the effect of different variables resulting in sex disparity in COVID-19 mortality.","output":"COVID-19 Clinical Characteristics, and Sex-Specific Risk of Mortality: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The bivalve mollusk, Anadara tuberculosa (Black Shell, in Spanish Concha Prieta), is found on Americas Pacific coast, where it is harvested for subsistence and commercial markets. This paper aims to diagnose the performance of the black shells value chain.

Its design was non-experimental, field, cross-sectional and ex post facto. The investigation was carried out from January to October 2019 in the Jambel archipelago, El Oro province, Ecuador. The study population consisted of 565 individuals, shellfish collectors, shellfish associations managers, traders, and restaurants from the A. tuberculosa production chain. The sample size was estimated at 222 informants. The type of sampling used was probabilistic, random, stratified, and with proportional allocation, with an effective participation rate of those selected of approximately 80%. The questionnaire was applied personally through the structured survey method, in writing, in the work area, and with their consent. The performance of the value chain was diagnosed in the dimensions of productivity, competitiveness, and quality of life, reaching a 75.1% index, a result that indicates that the value chain has a moderate to good performance level. The competitiveness dimension reached the highest performance, followed by productivity. Quality of life was the dimension with the lowest performance. The value chain can be improved if the following challenges are met: (1) Restoration of the mangrove ecosystem, (2) Promotion of low-intensity shellfish aquaculture, (3) Good sanitary management and purification, (4) Promotion of value-focused ventures, (5) Strengthening of organizations and agreements for the use and custody of mangroves, and (6) Strengthening of institutions that contribute to the advancement of these challenges.","output":"Performance and Challenges in the Value Chain of the Anadara tuberculosaBivalve Mollusk in Ecuador"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging evidence suggests that blue light has the potential to inactivate viruses. Therefore, we investigated the effect of 405 nm, 410 nm, 425 nm and 450 nm pulsed blue light (PBL) on human alpha coronavirus HCoV-229 E and human beta coronavirus HCoV-OC43, using Qubit fluorometry and RT-LAMP to quantitate the amount of nucleic acid in irradiated and control samples. Like SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are single stranded RNA viruses transmitted by air and direct contact; they have similar genomic sizes as SARS-CoV-2, and are used as surrogates for SARS-CoV-2. Irradiation was carried out either at 32.4 J cm(?2) using 3 mW cm(?2) irradiance or at 130 J cm(?2) using 12 mW cm(?2) irradiance. Results: (1) At each wavelength tested, PBL was antiviral against both coronaviruses. (2) 405 nm light gave the best result, yielding 52.3% (2.37 log(10)) inactivation against HCoV-OC43 (p < .0001), and a significant 1.46 log (10) (44%) inactivation of HCoV-229E (p < .01). HCoV-OC43, which like SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus, was more susceptible to PBL irradiation than alpha coronavirus HCoV-229E. The latter finding suggests that PBL is potentially antiviral against multiple coronavirus strains, and that, while its potency may vary from one virus to another, it seems more antiviral against beta coronaviruses, such as HCoV-OC43. (3) Further, the antiviral effect of PBL was better at a higher irradiance than a lower irradiance, and this indicates that with further refinement, a protocol capable of yielding 100% inactivation of viruses is attainable.","output":"Pulsed blue light inactivates two strains of human coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Optimal timing for catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia is an important yet unresolved subject. While it is clear that it is indicated with relatively advanced disease, it is still uncertain how early it should be recommended.

RECENT FINDINGS: The latest expert consensus statement added a new timing indication for catheter ablation after the first episode of monomorphic VT, in patients with ischemic heart disease and an ICD. SUMMARY: Early referral for catheter ablation reduces the number of VT recurrences; however, an impact on mortality has not been demonstrated yet. Guidelines and real-world data alike show an increasing trend to refer patients after the first VT episode in ICD patients.

METHODS: We conducted two household surveys among the non-institutionalized adult population from May 30 to June 17, 2020, in Lajeado, an 84,000-inhabitant industrial city in southern Brazil. Primary outcome was prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths occurring up to June 20, 2020. We summarized prevalence rates across surveys with meta-analysis. We assessed age-range IFR and hospitalization rate and regressed these rates over age strata using nonlinear (exponential) coefficients of determination (R2). RESULTS: Summarized overall prevalence was 3.40% (95% CI, 2.74-4.18), 34% lower in older adults &#8805;60 years. Prevalence was 14.3 and 5.4 times higher among household contacts and meat-precessing plant (MPP) workers, respectively. IFR ranged from 0.08% (0.06-0.11) to 4.63% (2.93-7.84) in individuals 20-39 years and &#8805;60 years, respectively. R2 for hospitalization rate and IFR over age were 0.98 and 0.93 (both p-values <0.0001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population-based study in Brazil to estimate COVID-19 prevalence, hospitalization, and fatality rates per age stratum. Rates were largely age-dependent. Household contacts and MPP workers are at higher risk of infection. Our findings are valuable for health-policy making and resource allocation to mitigate the pandemic.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 population-based prevalence, risk factors, hospitalization, and fatality rates in southern Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanomaterials have wide-ranging biomedical applications in prevention, treatment and control of diseases. Nanoparticle based vaccines have proven prodigious prophylaxis of various infectious and non-infectious diseases of human and animal concern. Nano-vaccines outnumber the conventional vaccines by virtue of plasticity in physio-chemical properties and ease of administration. The efficacy of nano-based vaccines may be attributed to the improved antigen stability, minimum immuno-toxicity, sustained release, enhanced immunogenicity and the flexibility of physical features of nanoparticles. Based on these, the nano-based vaccines have potential to evoke both cellular and humoral immune responses. Targeted and highly specific immunological pathways required for solid and long lasting immunity may be achieved with specially engineered nano-vaccines. This review presents an insight into the prevention of infectious diseases (of bacterial, viral and parasitic origin) and non-infectious diseases (cancer, auto-immune diseases) using nano-vaccinology.

Most skilled nursing facility patients are older, and many have medical conditions that cannot be changed. However, conditions related to nutrition/muscle mass may be impacted if there is early identification/intervention. To help determine the diagnosis and potential impact of nutrition/muscle mass-related conditions in skilled nursing facilities, this study evaluated 2016C2020 US Medicare claims data. Methods aimed to identify a set of skilled nursing facility claims with one or more specific diagnoses (COVID-19, malnutrition, sarcopenia, frailty, obesity, diabetes, and/or pressure injury) and then to determine length of stay, discharge status, total charges, and total payments for each claim. Mean values per beneficiary were computed and betweenCgroup comparisons were performed. Results documented that each year, the total number of Medicare skilled nursing facility claims declined, whereas the percentage of claims for each study diagnosis increased significantly. For most conditions, potentially related to nutrition/muscle mass, Medicare beneficiaries had a shorter length of skilled nursing facility stays compared to those without the condition(s). Furthermore, a lower percentage of these Medicare beneficiaries were discharged home (except for those with claims for sarcopenia and obesity). Total claim charges for those with nutrition/muscle mass-related conditions exceeded those without (except for those with sarcopenia). We conclude that although the acuity level of patients in skilled nursing facilities continues to increase, skilled nursing facility Medicare claims for nutrition/muscle mass-related conditions are reported at lower levels than their likely prevalence. This represents a potential care gap and requires action to help improve patient health outcomes and skilled nursing facility quality metrics.","output":"Prevalence Rates and Characteristics of Malnutrition, Frailty, and Other Nutrition and Muscle Mass-Related Conditions Document Potential Quality of Care Gap for Medicare Patients in US Skilled Nursing Facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 epidemic has reached the island of Mayotte, a french overseas department on march 2020.

METHOD: Using Medline, we retrieved eighteen papers on eight different vaccine platforms in four animal models. Data were extracted on presence/absence of viral RNA in nose, throat, or lungs, and neutralizing antibody levels in the blood. RESULTS: All vaccines showed a tendency of reduced viral load after exposure. Particularly nasal swab results are likely to give an indication about the impact on virus excretion in the environment. Similarly, the reduction or prevention of viral replication in the bronchoalveolar environment might be related with disease prevention, explaining the high efficacy in clinical trials. DISCUSSION: Although it remains difficult to compare the results directly, the potential for a strong reduction of transmission was shown, indicating that the animal models predicted what is observed in the field after large scale human vaccination.

Because of the overlap of symptoms of Ebola virus disease and malaria, the care delivery of malaria is particularly sensitive to the indirect effects of the current Ebola-virus-disease epidemic. We therefore characterise malaria case management in the context of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic and document the effect of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic on malaria case management. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional survey of public health facilities in Guinea in December, 2014. We selected the four prefectures most affected by Ebola virus disease and selected four randomly from prefectures without any reported cases of the disease. 60 health facilities were sampled in Ebola-affected and 60 in Ebola-unaffected prefectures. Study teams abstracted malaria case management indicators from registers for January to November for 2013 and 2014 and interviewed health-care workers. Nationwide weekly surveillance data for suspect malaria cases reported between 2011 and 2014 were analysed independently. Data for malaria indicators in 2014 were compared with previous years. FINDINGS: We noted substantial reductions in all-cause outpatient visits (by 23 103 [11%] of 214 899), cases of fever (by 20249 [15%] of 131 330), and patients treated with oral (by 22 655 [24%] of 94 785) and injectable (by 5219 [30%] of 17 684) antimalarial drugs in surveyed health facilities. In Ebola-affected prefectures, 73 of 98 interviewed community health workers were operational (74%, 95% CI 65C83) and 35 of 73 were actively treating malaria cases (48%, 36C60) compared with 106 of 112 (95%, 89C98) and 102 of 106 (96%, 91C99), respectively, in Ebola-unaffected prefectures. Nationwide, the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic was estimated to have resulted in 74 000 (71 000C77 000) fewer malaria cases seen at health facilities in 2014. INTERPRETATION: The reduction in the delivery of malaria care because of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic threatens malaria control in Guinea. Untreated and inappropriately treated malaria cases lead to excess malaria mortality and more fever cases in the community, impeding the Ebola-virus-disease response.

This systematic review evaluates the effect of PPS on functional outcomes in older people. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the effect of PPS in older adults on functional outcomes (physical strength, frailty, mood and cognition, mortality and receipt of care). Four electronic databases were searched for studies published since year 2000. RESULTS: Eighteen studies (including 15 RCTs) were identified. One of five studies evaluating physical function reported benefit (improved grip strength). Two analyses of one prebiotic RCT assessed frailty by different methods with mixed results. Four studies evaluated mood with no benefit reported. Six studies evaluated cognition: four reported cognitive improvement in participants with pre-existing cognitive impairment receiving probiotics. Seven studies reported mortality as a secondary outcome with a trend to reduction in only one. Five studies reported length of hospital stay but only two peri-operative studies reported shorter stays. CONCLUSION: There is limited evidence that probiotics may improve cognition in older people with pre-existing cognitive impairment but no clear evidence of benefit of PPS on physical function, frailty, mood, length of hospitalisation and mortality. Larger studies with more homogenous interventions, accounting for confounding factors, such as diet, co-morbidities and medications, are required.

While synchronous phone or video visits have become more widely accepted, US policymakers and other key health care stakeholders have been hesitant to fully embrace asynchronous diagnosis and treatment. This is particularly true in the context of direct-to-consumer (DTC) platforms, where encounters are patient-initiated and there is no preestablished relationship with a provider. This hesitation is compounded by limited research comparing outcomes between asynchronous and synchronous care, especially in the DTC context. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore whether asynchronous care leads to different patient outcomes in the form of medication-related adverse events when compared to synchronous virtual care. METHODS: Using 10,000 randomly sampled patient records from a prominent US-based DTC platform, we analyzed the rates of patient-reported side effects from commonly prescribed erectile dysfunction medications and compared these rates across modalities of treatment. RESULTS: Asynchronous care resulted in lower but nonsignificant differences in the rates of the reported drug-related side effects compared to synchronous treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In some circumstances, such as treatment for erectile dysfunction, asynchronous care can offer the same level of safety in prescribing when compared to synchronous care.

Objective: The objective of this study is to provide allergists and other clinicians with pearls pertaining to the management of patients with asthma in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide some information regarding the risk of transmission among the pediatric population. Methods: Utilizing the case of one of our own patients with asthma who developed COVID-19 as context, we review the recent literature discussing the risk of COVID-19 in patients with asthma, the management of asthma medications in the time of the pandemic, and the risk of viral transmission. Results: Despite initial reports that asthma was a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19, subsequent investigation has shown that this is likely not true. Additionally, the use of systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids does not appear to increase the risk of severe COVID-19, but there is no evidence guiding the use of biologic therapy. There is conflicting evidence regarding the ability of children to transmit the virus. Conclusion: We provide pearls that asthma does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 and continued use of inhaled corticosteroids appears to be safe.

This paper first discusses the development of the shadow banking sector, its relevance for global financial stability, and current challenges for its regulation. Then, based on a case study of Ant Group, this paper discusses opportunities and challenges of the Chinese authorities regulatory approach and derives implications for the regulation in Europe. In summary, a regulation of large technology corporations that offer a large range of financial services comparable to traditional banks seems necessary with reference to financial stability, as these companies (potentially) have extensive market power.","output":"Regulierung des Schattenbankensektors: Der Fall des chinesischen BigTech Ant Group als Blaupause?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the post-lockdown challenges during Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic amongst the ophthalmologists in India. METHODS: An online survey was sent to the practicing ophthalmologists across India. Data were collected from the responding ophthalmologists and analysed using Medcalc 16.4 software. RESULTS: A total of 794 responses were obtained. Most respondents (51%) were in the age group 30C50 years and were in independent practice (40.05%). Almost three-fourth of ophthalmologists resumed their surgical services after a gap of more than a month post-lockdown. Almost a third of the respondents had significant reduction in their surgical workload during this period. Significant fear of contracting COVID-19 infection in the operation theatres was reported while moderate difficulty was found in procuring protective gear during immediate post-national lockdown period. CONCLUSION: The pandemic has changed the ophthalmic practice significantly, with patient and staff safety becoming areas of major concern. Both financial and psychological concerns affecting healthcare workers need addressing for continued patient care.","output":"Post-lockdown challenges for ophthalmologists during COVID-19 pandemic in India: A survey-based analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Rejection is the primary barrier to broader implementation of vascularized composite allografts (VCA), including face and limb transplants. The immunologic pathways activated in face transplant rejection have not been fully characterized. METHODS Utilizing skin biopsies prospectively collected over nine years from seven face transplant patients, we studied rejection by gene expression profiling, histology, immunostaining and T cell receptor sequencing. RESULTS Grade 1 rejection did not differ significantly from non-rejection, suggesting that it does not represent a pathologic state and that watchful waiting is warranted. In Grade 2, there was a balanced upregulation of both pro-inflammatory T cell activation pathways and anti-inflammatory checkpoint and immunomodulatory pathways, with a net result of no tissue injury. In Grade 3, IFN-driven inflammation, antigen presenting cell activation and infiltration of the skin by proliferative T cells bearing markers of antigen specific activation and cytotoxic effector molecules tipped the balance towards tissue injury. Rejection of VCA and solid organ transplants had both distinct and common features. VCA rejection was uniquely associated with upregulation of immunoregulatory genes, including SOCS1, induction of lipid antigen-presenting CD1 proteins, and infiltration by T cells predicted to recognize CD1b and CD1c. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the distinct features of VCA rejection reflect the unique immunobiology of skin and that enhancing cutaneous immunoregulatory networks may be a useful strategy in combatting rejection.","output":"Immunoregulatory and lipid presentation pathways are upregulated in human face transplant rejection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Blood type is among the most important genetical characteristics of any individual and is shown to be correlated with the development of a variety of illnesses including dental diseases. Finding the association of ABO and Rh blood groups and impacted tooth is important in order to predict which population is more vulnerable to grow impacted third molars that could lead to making better intervention. The present investigation tried to take a small step in that regard, by evaluating the correlation between ABO and Rh blood groups and the most commonly impacted tooth, bony impacted third molars among Iranian individuals. METHODS: The investigation was done retrospectively on patients who were referred to the Department of Oral Radiology, Shiraz University of Medical Science, Shiraz, Iran. The patients were classified according to their blood groups, and 40 patients were randomly selected for each blood type. Therefore, the impaction of their third molars was evaluated, and statistical analyses were done in order to find any association. RESULTS: A total of 320 participants contributed to the study; 136 (42%) were males and 184 (57%) were females. The mean age was 29  6 years. Among all participants, 205 (64%) had no impacted third molar, 26 (8%) had one impacted third molar, 43 (13%) had 2 impacted third molars, 5 (1%) had 3 impacted third molars, and 41 (12%) had 4 impacted molars. CONCLUSION: According to the results of the present study, nearly one out of three individuals has at least an impacted third molar in the Iranian population, being more prevalent in individuals between 20 and 30 years old.

Besides possible recycling routes to the plasma membrane and various organelles, previously described endocytic pathways (e.g., clathrin-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, CLIC/GEEC pathway) all appear to funnel the endocytosed material to Rab5-positive early endosomes that then mature into Rab7-positive late endosomes/lysosomes. By studying the uptake of a series of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), we identify an endocytic pathway that moves material to nonacidic Lamp1-positive late endosomes.

Given the significant burden associated with their development, it is imperative to determine strategies to minimize their occurrence. The objective of this review is to summarize the available evidence on the role of antibiotics following I&D of anorectal abscesses on fistula formation. Secondary objectives include determining if antibiotics are associated with morbidity, repeat presentation to the emergency department, and requirement for reoperation. METHODS/DESIGN MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, http://apps.who.int/trialsearch , and clinicaltrials.gov will be searched to identify published and ongoing unpublished interventional and observational studies evaluating the role of antibiotics post I&D on the incidence of fistula formation.

METHODS From January 2010 to April 2016, data from patients who had undergone a laparoscopic right colectomy in 2 different departments of 2 institutions (the Department of General and Minimally Invasive Surgery, San Camillo Hospital in Trento and the Department of Surgical Specialties and Nephrology, University Federico II in Naples) were retrospectively analyzed. We compared the data of patients in whom the stapler-access enterotomy was closed through a conventional absorbable suture (Group A), with the data of patients in whom a stapler-access enterotomy was closed through a V-Loc 180 suture (Group B). Biometric features and intraoperative and postoperative data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS The 2 groups (Group A: 40 patients; Group B: 40 patients) were comparable for biometric features and postoperative outcomes. The anastomosing time was lower in Group B. A statistically significant difference was noted in the mean operative time between Groups A and B (Group A = 134.92  34.17; Group B = 120.92  23.27, P = .035).

The shortage of diagnostic tests limited monitoring of the first wave of the pandemic. This study estimates and describes the wave in Navarre (Spain). METHODS: Enhanced epidemiological surveillance, seroepidemiological survey estimates and mortality registries were used to characterise the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from February to June 2020 in Navarre. RESULTS: A total of 10,358 persons (1.6?% of population) were confirmed with COVID-19, 1,943 cases were hospitalized (3 per 1,000 inhabitants), 139 were admitted to the ICU (21 per 100,000 inhabitants), and 529 people died from confirmed COVID-19 (80 per 100,000). Mortality increased exponentially with age, exceeding 1?% in people over 85 years. 58?% of deaths occurred amongst nursing home residents. The mortality registry received reporting of 733 confirmed or probable COVID-19 deaths, while the excess deaths during this period were 613 (20.9?%) concentrated from mid-March to the end of April. It is estimated that, at the end of June, 6.7?% (n?=?44,000) of the population had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and 10.3?% had had the infection. The estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence increased sharply in the first half of March and decreased quickly during the home lockdown in the second half of March.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated its limitations. Mobile health clinic programs in the US already play important, albeit under-appreciated roles in the healthcare system. They provide access to healthcare especially for displaced or isolated individuals; they offer versatility in the setting of a damaged or inadequate healthcare infrastructure; and, as a longstanding community-based service delivery model, they fill gaps in the healthcare safety-net, reaching social-economically underserved populations in both urban and rural areas. Despite an increasing body of evidence of the unique value of this highly adaptable model of care, mobile clinics are not widely supported. This has resulted in a missed opportunity to deploy mobile clinics during national emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as using these already existing, and trusted programs to overcome barriers to access that are experienced by under-resourced communities. MAIN TEXT: In March, the Mobile Healthcare Association and Mobile Health Map, a program of Harvard Medical Schools Family Van, hosted a webinar of over 300 mobile health providers, sharing their experiences, challenges and best practices of responding to COVID 19. They demonstrated the untapped potential of this sector of the healthcare system in responding to healthcare crises. A Call to Action: The flexibility and adaptability of mobile clinics make them ideal partners in responding to pandemics, such as COVID-19. In this commentary we propose three approaches to support further expansion and integration of mobile health clinics into the healthcare system: First, demonstrate the economic contribution of mobile clinics to the healthcare system. Second, expand the number of mobile clinic programs and integrate them into the healthcare infrastructure and emergency preparedness. Third, expand their use of technology to facilitate this integration. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the economic and social impact that mobile clinics are having in our communities should provide the evidence to justify policies that will enable expansion and optimal integration of mobile clinics into our healthcare delivery system, and help us address current and future health crises.","output":"Mobile health clinic model in the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons learned and opportunities for policy changes and innovation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundIn light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government has prioritised reducing obesity rates.

Methods: Data from three waves of the nationally representative COVID-19 Household Impact Survey (4/20/2020-6/8/2020) were used to describe social engagement and mental health symptoms during the pandemic. Associations between mental health and social engagement were assessed via multinomial logistic regression. Results: In this sample of 312 AAs (36.9% Chinese American, 30.9% South Asian American, 20.1% Filipino/Vietnamese American, and 12.0% Japanese/Korean American), daily communication with neighbors declined for Chinese, South Asian and Filipino/Vietnamese Americans but increased for Japanese/Korean Americans (P=.012) whereas communication with friends/family increased only for Filipino/Vietnamese, Japanese/Korean and South Asian Americans (P<0.001). Differences in self-reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, and hopelessness were observed across AA ethnic groups. In adjusted models, lower social engagement was associated with frequent (3-4 days/week) depressive symptoms during the preceding week (cOR:3.26, 95%CI:1.01-10.5). This association was heightened for Asian men (cOR:14.22, 95%CI:3.62-55.8). Conclusions: Heterogeneity of social engagement and mental health symptoms across AA ethnicities was observed. Understanding associations between social engagement and mental health within different communities is necessary to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate mental health treatment and care.","output":"Social Engagement and Mental Health Symptoms Across Asian American Ethnic Groups During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of December 2019 COVID-19 has spread rapidly around the world which has led to increased discussions across online platforms These conversations have also included various conspiracies shared by social media users Amongst them a popular theory has linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19 leading to misinformation and the burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom The understanding of the drivers of fake news and quick policies oriented to isolate and rebate misinformation are key to combating it OBJECTIVE: To develop an understanding of the drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies to deal with such misinformation METHODS: This paper performs a Social Network Analysis and Content Analysis of Twitter data from a 7-day period, Friday 27 March 2020 to Saturday 04 April 2020, in which the #5GCoronavirus hashtag was trending on Twitter in the United Kingdom Influential users are analyzed through social network graph clusters The size of the nodes is ranked by their betweenness centrality score and the graph's vertices are grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm Topics and Web sources utilized by users are examined RESULTS: Social Network Analysis identified that the two largest network structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast group The analysis also reveals that there was a lack of authority figure who was actively combating such misinformation Content analysis reveals that only 35% of individual tweets contained views that 5G and COVID-19 were linked whereas 32% denounced the conspiracy theory and 33% were general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions Thus, 65% of tweets derived from non-conspiracy theory supporters which suggests that although the topic attracted high volume only a handful of users genuinely believed the conspiracy This paper also shows that fake news websites were the most popular Web-source shared by users although YouTube videos were also shared The study also identified an account whose sole aim was to spread the conspiracy theory on Twitter CONCLUSIONS: The combination of quick targeted interventions oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information are key to reducing their impact Those users voicing their views against the conspiracy theory, link-baiting, or sharing humorous tweets inadvertently raised the profile of the topic, suggesting that policymakers should insist in the efforts of isolating opinions which are based on fake news Many social media platforms provide users with the ability to report inappropriate content which should be utilized This study is the first to analyse the 5G conspiracy theory in the context of COVID-19 on Twitter offering practical guidance to health authorities in how, in the context of a pandemic, rumors may be combated in the future CLINICALTRIAL:","output":"Dangerous Messages or Satire?

Investors often follow the news to collect the information that will help them decide which strategy to follow. In this study, we analyze how public news and historical prices can be used together to anticipate and prevent financial losses on the Brazilian stock market. We include an extensive set of 64 securities in our analysis, which represent various sectors of the Brazilian economy. Our analysis compares the traditional Buy & Hold and the moving average strategies to several experiments designed with 11 machine learning algorithms. We explore daily, weekly and monthly time horizons for both publication and return windows. With this approach we were able to assess the most relevant set of news for investors decision, and to determine for how long the information remains relevant to the market. We found a strong relationship between news publications and stock price changes in Brazil, suggesting even short-term arbitrage opportunities.

We reasoned that if a clade of species has been repeatedly exposed to a virus, then their proteins relevant for viral entry may exhibit adaptations that affect host susceptibility or response. We perform comparative analyses across the mammalian phylogeny of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in order to uncover evidence for selection acting at its binding interface with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We uncover that in rodents there is evidence for adaptive amino acid substitutions at positions comprising the ACE2-spike interaction interface, whereas the variation within ACE2 proteins in primates and some other mammalian clades is not consistent with evolutionary adaptations. We also analyze aminopeptidase N (APN), the receptor for the human coronavirus 229E, a virus that causes the common cold, and find evidence for adaptation in primates.

Resultados: Se incluyeron 615 trasplantados renales con COVID19 (62.6% varones), con una edad media de 57.5 a?os. El tratamiento inmunosupresor predominante antes del COVID19 era la triple terapia con prednisona, tacrolimus y cido micofenlico (54.6%) seguido de los regmenes con inbidores m-TOR (18.6%). Tras el diagnstico de la infeccin se suspendi el cido micofenlico en el 73.8% de los pacientes, el inhibidor m-TOR en el 41.4%, tacrolimus en el 10.5% y ciclosporina A en el 10%. A su vez, el 26.9% recibieron dexametasona y al 50.9% se les inici o aument la dosis de prednisona basal.

Introduction: SARS CoV2 infection has had a major impact on renal transplant patients with a high mortality in the first months of the pandemic. Intentional reduction of immunosuppressive therapy has been postulated as one of the cornerstone in the management of the infection in the absence of targeted antiviral treatment. This has been modified according to the patient\`s clinical situation and its effect on renal function or anti-HLA antibodies in the medium term has not been evaluated. Objectives: Evaluate the management of immunosuppressive therapy made during SARS-CoV2 infection, as well as renal function and anti-HLA antibodies in kidney transplant patients 6 months after COVID19 diagnosis. Material and methods: Retrospective, national multicentre, retrospective study (30 centres) of kidney transplant recipients with COVID19 from 01/02/20 to 31/12/20. Clinical variables were collected from medical records and included in an anonymised database. SPSS statistical software was used for data analysis. Results: 615 renal transplant recipients with COVID19 were included (62.6% male), with a mean age of 57.5 years. The predominant immunosuppressive treatment prior to COVID19 was triple therapy with prednisone, tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid (54.6%) followed by m-TOR inhibitor regimens (18.6%). After diagnosis of infection, mycophenolic acid was discontinued in 73.8% of patients, m-TOR inhibitor in 41.4%, tacrolimus in 10.5% and cyclosporin A in 10%. In turn, 26.9% received dexamethasone and 50.9% were started on or had their baseline prednisone dose increased. Mean creatinine before diagnosis of COVID19, at diagnosis and at 6 months was: 1.70.8, 2.11.2 and 1.81 mg/dl respectively (p<0.001). 56.9% of the patients (N=350) were monitored for anti-HLA antibodies. 94% (N=329) had no anti-HLA changes, while 6% (N=21) had positive anti-HLA antibodies. Among the patients with donor-specific antibodies post-COVID19 (N=9), 7 patients (3.1%) had one immunosuppressant discontinued (5 patients had mycophenolic acid and 2 had tacrolimus), 1 patient had both immunosuppressants discontinued (3.4%) and 1 patient had no change in immunosuppression (1.1%), these differences were not significant. Conclusions: The management of immunosuppressive therapy after diagnosis of COVID19 was primarily based on discontinuation of mycophenolic acid with very discrete reductions or discontinuations of calcineurin inhibitors. This immunosuppression management did not influence renal function or changes in anti-HLA antibodies 6 months after diagnosis.","output":"Manejo de la inmunosupresin en pacientes trasplantados de ri?n con COVID19.

METHODS: Systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020176156) on UVGI in N95 FFRs using Embase, Medline, Global Health, Google Scholar, WHO feed, and MedRxiv. Two reviewers independently determined eligibility and extracted predefined variables. Original research reporting on function, decontamination, or mask fit following UVGI were included. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Thirteen studies were identified, comprising 54 UVGI intervention arms and 58 N95 models. FFRs consistently maintained certification standards following UVGI. Aerosol penetration averaged 1.19% (0.70-2.48%) and 1.14% (0.57-2.63%) for control and UVGI arms respectively. Airflow resistance for the control arms averaged 9.79 mm H2O (7.97-11.70 mm H2O) vs 9.85 mm H2O (8.33-11.44 mm H2O) for UVGI arms. UVGI protocols employing a cumulative dose >20,000 J/m2 resulted in a 2 log reduction in viral load. A >3 log reduction was observed in seven UVGI arms using >40,000 J/m2. Impact of UVGI on fit was evaluated in two studies (16,200; 32,400 J/m2) and did not find evidence of compromise. Our findings suggest that further work in this area (or translation to a clinical setting) should use a cumulative UV-C dose of 40,000 J/m2 or greater, and confirm appropriate mask fit following decontamination.","output":"Decontaminating N95 and SN95 masks with Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI) does not impair mask efficacy and safety: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research has linked prenatal alcohol and tobacco use with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and variably with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

Plastic can be made from different polymers and contains a variety of substances, added intentionally to enhance the plastic's properties (metals added as fillers, colourants, etc.). Moreover, plastic can be contaminated during use and subsequent waste management. Consequently, if substances and contaminants are not removed during recycling, potentially problematic substances might be recycled with the targeted polymers, hence the need for quantitative data about the nature and presence of these substances in plastic. Samples of selected polymers (PET, PE, PP, PS) were collected from different origins; plastic household waste, flakes/pellets of reprocessed plastic from households and industry, and virgin plastic. Fifteen selected metals (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Ti, Zn) were quantified and the statistical analysis showed that both the polymer and origin influenced the metal concentration. Sb and Zn were potentially related to the production stage of PET and PS, respectively. Household plastic samples (waste and reprocessed) were found to contain significantly higher Al, Pb, Ti and Zn concentrations when compared to virgin samples. Only the concentration of Mn was reduced during washing, suggesting that parts of it was present as physical contamination.

METHODS Seventy-five HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) were recruited. Participants answered the Spanish versions of three Likert-type scales: HSS-21, Robsenberg's self-esteem scale, and the abbreviated version of the Zung's Depression Scale. RESULTS HSS-21 showed high reliability and validity; its factor structure included four components: concern with public attitudes; negative self-image; disclosure concerns; and enacted stigma. The level of stigma was high in 27 out of 75 (36%) participants; nevertheless, the score found in the component related to disclosure concerns indicated high level of stigma in 68% of participants. The score of HSS-21 was positively correlated with the score of depression and negatively correlated with the score of self-esteem. CONCLUSION Results demonstrated high reliability for the HSS-21; correlations with other scales supported its validity.

Results To understand the influence of such cross-reactive T cell responses, we used IEDB (Immune epitope database) and NetMHCpan (ver. 4.1) to identify candidate CD8 + T cell epitopes, restricted through HLA-A and B alleles, which are seen in a frequency of > 10% in the Sri Lankan population. Conservation analysis was carried out for these candidate epitopes with the HCoVs, OC43, HKU1, NL63 and with the current circulating different variants of SARS-CoV2. 12/18 the candidate CD8 + T cell epitopes (binding score of  0.90), which had a high degree of homology (> 75%) with the other three HCoVs were within the NSP12 and NSP13 proteins. They were predicted to be restricted through HLA-A*2402, HLA-A*201, HLA-A*206 and HLA-B alleles B*3501. 31 candidate CD8 + T cell epitopes that were specific to SARS-CoV2 virus (< 25% homology with other HCoVs) were predominantly identified within the structural proteins (spike, envelop, membrane and nucleocapsid) and the NSP1, NSP2 and NSP3.

However; documented evidence on the issue is not available as far as the social and behavior change communication (SBCC) on malaria is concerned. Enrolling the frontline providers this study measured the acceptability and feasibility of the school-engaged SBCC strategy on malaria prevention in malaria-endemic settings of Ethiopia. METHODS: A school-engaged SBCC strategy involving various communication and capacity-building interventions aimed to advance malaria preventive practices in primary schools in Jimma were implemented from 2017 to 2019. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 205 key stakeholders at the end of the intervention. Both acceptability and feasibility were measured using standardized tools. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and filled by the study participants. The SPSS version 26 was used to analyze the data. Multivariate general linear modeling was performed to identify the predictors of acceptability and feasibility of the program. P-value < 5% was considered to decide statistical significance. RESULTS: The result showed the mean scores (M, range = R) of acceptability and feasibility of the program were (M = 25.63, R = 6 to 30) and (M = 19.35, R = 5 to 25) respectively. The multivariate linear modeling showed acceptability was affected by self-efficacy; ( = 0.438, P < 0.001), community support; ( = 0.417, P < 0.001), school climate; ( = ? 0.16; P = 0.003), perceived malaria threat; ( = 0.40, P < 0.001) and knowledge; ( = 0.229, P = 0.013). Similarly, feasibility was influenced by self-efficacy; ( = 0.352, P < 0.001), community support; ( = 0.591, P < 0.001), school climate; ( = ? 0.099, P-value < 0.030) and perceived malaria threat; ( = 0.172, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: With a considerably high level of acceptability, the school-engaged SBCC strategy to enhance malaria preventive practices seems feasible. The SBCC strategy targeting personal factors such as malaria threat perceptions, knowledge and skills on the program, and contextual factors that include school social climate and community support would be fruitful to facilitate the implementation of the program.

Our observations suggest that protection increases over the six months following vaccination as a consequence of antibody maturation, resulting in improved potency of antibodies to viral escape mutations.","output":"Temporal Increase in Neutralization Potency of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies and Reduced Viral Variant Escape after Sputnik V Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Binocular vision uses the parallax principle of the human eye to obtain 3D information of an object, which is widely used as an important means of acquiring 3D information for 3D reconstruction tasks. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of 3D reconstruction, we propose a 3D reconstruction method that combines second-order semiglobal matching, guided filtering and Delaunay triangulation. First, the existing second-order semiglobal matching method is improved, and the smoothness constraint of multiple angle directions is added to the matching cost to generate a more robust disparity map. Second, the 3D coordinates of all points are calculated by combining camera parameters and disparity maps to obtain the 3D point cloud, which is smoothed by guided filtering to remove noise points and retain details. Finally, a method to quickly locate the insertion point and accelerate Delaunay triangulation is proposed. The surface of the point cloud is reconstructed by Delaunay triangulation based on fast point positioning to improve the visibility of the 3D model. The proposed approach was evaluated using the Middlebury and KITTI datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed second-order semiglobal matching method has higher accuracy than other stereo matching methods and that the proposed Delaunay triangulation method based on fast point location requires less time than the original Delaunay triangulation.","output":"3D reconstruction method based on second-order semiglobal stereo matching and fast point positioning Delaunay triangulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There are very few randomised, blinded trials comparing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) versus laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in achieving remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly silastic ring (SR)-LRYGB. We compared the effectiveness of (LSG) versus SR-LRYGB among patients with T2D and morbid obesity. METHODS Prospective, randomised, parallel, 2-arm, blinded clinical trial conducted in a single Auckland (New Zealand) centre. Eligible patients aged 20-55 years, T2D of at least 6 months duration and BMI 35-65 kg/m2 were randomised 1:1 to LSG (n = 58) or SR-LRYGB (n = 56) using random number codes disclosed after anaesthesia induction. Primary outcome was T2D remission defined by different HbA1c thresholds at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included weight loss, quality of life, anxiety and depressive symptoms, post-operative complications and mortality. RESULTS Mean  standard deviation (SD) pre-operative BMI was 42.5  6.2 kg/m2, HbA1c 63  16 mmol/mol (30% insulin-treated, 28% had diabetes duration over 10 years). Proportions achieving HbA1c  38 mmol/mol, < 42 mmol/mol, < 48 mmol/mol and < 53 mmol/mol without diabetes medication at 1 year in SR-LRYGB vs LSG were 38 vs 43% (p = 0.56), 52 vs 49% (p = 0.85), 75 vs 72% (p = 0.83) and 80 vs 77% (p = 0.82), respectively. Mean  SD % total weight loss at 1 year was greater after SR-LRYGB than LSG: 32.2  7.7 vs 27.1  7.5%, respectively (p < 0.001).

A piezoelectric transducer (PT) is driven in ultrasonic resonant frequency to generate electromechanical power for thermal sealing and cold dissection operations. The band-pass filter based oscillator was developed to automatically track the PT's optimal longitudinal resonance. However, under heavy loading conditions, the PT will lock to other unwanted transverse resonant modes and deliver no usable power to the surgical tip. To prevent this abnormal operation, a phase-locked loop based frequency discriminator with intervention and release logic was developed to ensure that the PT always operates at the proper frequency of 55.5 kHz. Another crucial challenge is that the changing of loading conditions induces a motional current sensing mismatch and a pole-zero pair, consequently causing instability and poor response time. Therefore, a sliding mode control method with reduced-order sensing was proposed to handle the extreme load changes and provide a fast power build-up time of 9.2 ms, which is 8% faster than previously reported designs and 49% faster than the best commercial product.

Understanding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is crucial in promoting vaccine acceptance among people with mental health diagnoses. This review aims to identify the prevalence and discuss factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the mentally ill population. MAIN BODY: We conducted a detailed literature search and included 15 articles for discussion in this review. Several studies showed varying trends of vaccine hesitancy rates among different countries. Major factors involved in vaccine hesitancy in general include mistrust, misinformation, believing in conspiracy theories, and negative attitudes towards vaccines. It was surprising that none of the studies were focused on vaccine acceptance rates and factors associated with vaccine hesitancy among the mentally ill population. However, studies do show that COVID-19 is associated with worse healthcare outcomes for psychiatric patients, and vaccine hesitancy correlated with a lower likelihood of receiving mental health treatment and vaccinations. Psychiatrists need to address issues among patients who are particularly vulnerable to the fear of vaccines which include anxiety, panic attacks, certain phobias including trypanophobia and agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and certain types of traumas. Psychiatrists need to communicate effectively, show respect, empathy, and deliver accurate and honest information about the vaccines. Motivational interviewing, getting people with mental health illness to organize vaccine campaigns, and involving families with mental health problems may promote vaccine acceptance among this group. CONCLUSION: Existing literature on the rates of vaccine hesitancy among people with mental health illness is limited. The mental health illness may increase the risk of hesitancy especially in patients having certain emotional disorders such as anxiety and phobia. More studies addressing vaccine hesitancy rates and factors associated with the mentally ill population need to be done in the future.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in patients with mental illness: strategies to overcome barriersa review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Numerous reports have described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 infected patients. However, data on the effects of bacterial coinfection on these patients are very scarce. Therefore, this study explores the impact of bacterial coinfection on the clinical and laboratory parameters amongst H1N1 hospitalized patients. FINDINGS: This retrospective study involved hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infections (September 2009 to May 2010). Relevant clinical data and the detection of bacterial coinfection from respiratory or sterile site samples were obtained. Multiplex PCR was used to determine the co-existence of other respiratory viruses. Comparison was made between patients with and without bacterial coinfection. The occurrence of coinfection was 34%; 14 (28%) bacterial and only 3 (6%) viral. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 5) was the commonest bacteria followed by Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3). In univariate analysis, clinical factors associated with bacterial coinfection were age > 50 years (p = 0.02), presence of comorbidity (p = 0.04), liver impairment (p = 0.02), development of complications (p = 0.004) and supplemental oxygen requirement (p = 0.02). Leukocytosis (p = 0.02) and neutrophilia (p = 0.004) were higher in bacterial coinfected patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age > 50 years and combined complications were predictive of bacterial coinfection. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial coinfection is not uncommon in H1N1 infected patients and is more frequently noted in the older aged patients and is associated with higher rates of complications. Also, as adjunct to clinical findings, clinicians need to have a higher index of suspicion if neutrophilia was identified at admission as it may denote bacterial coinfection.","output":"Epidemiology and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 infections: the effects of bacterial coinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Older patients with cancer are at risk of physical decline and impaired quality of life during oncological treatment. Exercise training has the potential to reduce these challenges. The study aim was to investigate the feasibility and effect of a multimodal exercise intervention in older patients with advanced cancer (stages III/IV). PATIENTS AND METHODS 84 older adults (65 years) with advanced pancreatic, biliary tract or non-small cell lung cancer who received systemic oncological treatment were randomized 1:1 to an intervention group or a control group. The intervention was a 12-week multimodal exercise-based program including supervised exercise twice weekly followed by a protein supplement, a homed-based walking program, and nurse-led support and counseling. The primary endpoint was change in physical function (30-second chair stand test) at 13 weeks. RESULTS Median age of the participants was 72 years (interquartile range (IQR) 68-75). Median adherence to the exercise sessions was 69% (IQR 21-88) and 75% (IQR 33-100) for the walking program. At 13 weeks, there was a significant difference in change scores of 2.4 repetitions in the chair stand test, favoring the intervention group (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, significant beneficial effects were seen for physical endurance (6-minute walk test), hand grip strength, physical activity, symptom burden, symptoms of depression and anxiety, global health status (quality of life), and lean body mass. No effects were seen for dose intensity, hospitalizations, or survival. CONCLUSION A 12-week multimodal exercise intervention with targeted support proved effective in improving physical function in older patients with advanced cancer during oncological treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Exercise is generally recommended during anti-cancer treatment to maintain physical function and to increase psychological wellbeing. While current evidence is mainly based on younger and middle-aged patients, this study showed that a multimodal exercise and support intervention increased physical function in older patients (65 years) with advanced cancer during oncological treatment. Hence, these new findings strengthen the basis for existing recommendations and highlight the importance of focusing on and supporting older patients with cancer in a physically active lifestyle and engagement in exercise training.","output":"Effects of a 12-week multimodal exercise intervention among older patients with advanced cancer - results from a randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The extent of vertical transmission (VT) of SARS-CoV-2 from mothers to neonates is still uncertain. We aimed to determine the incidence of VT. STUDY DESIGN In this prospective cohort study, all mother diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at time of delivery or up to one week prior and their neonate managed in a tertiary referral hospital for pregnancy complicated by COVID-19 in Rome, from April 2 to December 22, 2020, were included. Maternal infection was defined as nasopharyngeal swab test results positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Biological samples were collected before, at, and after delivery to test positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. RESULTS The cohort included 95 women and 96 neonates with documented SARS-CoV-2 test results. Four neonates (4.2%) tested positive. The incidence of VT, according to the guidance criteria for diagnosing perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection, was 5.2%. Neonatal symptoms were due to prematurity or fetal distress: symptomatic infants had lower median [min-max] gestational age (38.1 [29.3-40.6] vs 39.3 [33.9-41.9] weeks; p=.036), 1-min (9 [3-9] vs 9 [7-10]; p=.036), and 5-min Apgar scores (10 [6-10] vs 10 [8-10]; p=.012) than asymptomatic infants, and needed more frequently assistance in the delivery room (22.2% vs 2.5%; p=.008). Only 6 (7.1%) neonates had anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, despite the ongoing maternal infection. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of VT is low as is the detection of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in cord blood when infection is contracted late in pregnancy.

Upon transcription, single nucleotide variants (SNVs) may alter mRNA structure, with potential impacts on transcript stability, macromolecular interactions, and translation. However, plant genomes have not been assessed for the presence of these structure-altering polymorphisms or riboSNitches. RESULTS: We experimentally demonstrate the presence of riboSNitches in transcripts of two Arabidopsis genes, ZINC RIBBON 3 (ZR3) and COTTON GOLGI-RELATED 3 (CGR3), which are associated with continentality and temperature variation in the natural environment. These riboSNitches are also associated with differences in the abundance of their respective transcripts, implying a role in regulating the gene's expression in adaptation to local climate conditions. We then computationally predict riboSNitches transcriptome-wide in mRNAs of 879 naturally inbred Arabidopsis accessions. We characterize correlations between SNPs/riboSNitches in these accessions and 434 climate descriptors of their local environments, suggesting a role of these variants in local adaptation. We integrate this information in CLIMtools V2.0 and provide a new web resource, T-CLIM, that reveals associations between transcript abundance variation and local environmental variation. CONCLUSION: We functionally validate two plant riboSNitches and, for the first time, demonstrate riboSNitch conditionality dependent on temperature, coining the term conditional riboSNitch. We provide the first pan-genome-wide prediction of riboSNitches in plants.

Our objective was to describe outcomes of COVID-19 patients suffering IHCA at a rural hospital in Southern California. METHODS: Single-center retrospective observational study. A hospital registry of COVID-19 patients was queried for all patients who suffered IHCA and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) between May 1st and July 31st, 2020. A manual chart review was performed to obtain patient demographics, oxygen requirement prior to cardiac arrest (CA), details of the resuscitation including presence of an emergency physician, and final disposition. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were identified, most of whom were Hispanic, male, and aged 50-70. The most common medical comorbidities were diabetes and hypertension. Most patients suffered respiratory arrest, with an initial rhythm of pulseless electrical activity or asystole. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in 3/9 patients already receiving mechanical ventilation, but all 3 expired within the following 24 h. ROSC was achieved in 10/12 patients not already intubated, though most also expired within a few days. The only 2 patients who survived to discharge suffered respiratory arrest after their oxygen delivery device dislodged. CONCLUSION: At a small rural hospital with limited resources and a predominantly Hispanic population, cardiac arrest in a COVID-19 patient portends an extremely poor prognosis.

They interpreted the attack as exceeding the Bureau's privacy standards, and so introduced stronger privacy protections for the 2020 Census in the form of the TopDown Algorithm (TDA). This paper demonstrates that race and ethnicity can be inferred from the TDA-protected census data with substantially better precision and recall, using less prior knowledge: only the respondents' address. Race and ethnicity can be inferred with average 75% precision for 98% of the respondents, and can be inferred with 100% precision for 11% of the respondents.

We recently proposed the novel Nakayama-Higashiyama imprint cytological classification (N-H classification) based on small-sized lung adenocarcinoma surgical specimens, which correlated with histological patterns and nodal involvement. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between STAS and the N-H classification and to validate the N-H classification as an intraoperative predictor of the presence of STAS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 164 intraoperative imprint cytologies and their paired histologic specimens from patients undergoing surgical resection for lung adenocarcinoma in our institute in 2017-2019. Using the NH classification, imprint cytological findings were classified into 5 groups (Groups I to V) based on cell cluster shape, cell and nucleus size, and the existence of necrosis. We examined the characteristics of imprint cytology and STAS in the resected tissues and analyzed the relationship between them. RESULTS: Tumor STAS was observed in 29 (17.7 %) cases. The presence of STAS was significantly associated with the NH classification (P < 0.0001). STAS was present in 6 of 57 cases (10.5 %) in NH classification Group II, 11 of 42 cases (26.2 %) in Group III, and 12 of 28 cases (42.9 %) in Group IV/V; STAS was not observed in any case in Group I. Logistic regression analysis revealed that tumors with a ground glass opacity rate of <50 % on computed tomography (P = 0.00867) and Groups III-V of the NH classification (P = 0.00201) were significant independent predictors for STAS. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative imprint cytology with the N-H classification for lung adenocarcinoma is well correlated with the STAS status of the tumor and might have applications as an intraoperative predictive marker of STAS.

Chest CT findings were classified according to the modified COVID-19 reporting system created for this study. RT-PCR reference diagnostic test was accepted and the diagnostic performance of CT was evaluated. Results: A total of 498 patients [5422 (0;96)] were included in the study. The number of male patients [323 (65%)] was higher than female [175 (35%)]. RT-PCR test was positive in 94 (19%) of the patients. Patients with positive test results were found to be younger than negative ones. Chest CT was positive in 173 (35%) patients: 13% COVID-19 typical findings, 7% high suspect findings, 15% low suspect findings. The sensitivity of CT was 49%, the specificity was 69%, and the sensitivity of RT-PCR was 69%.

Based on the global NB model, CFR was positively associated with counties classified as completely rural (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.12-1.39) and mostly rural (IRR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.15-1.38) relative to mostly urban counties. Nonspatial regression indicates that COVID-19 CFR increases by a factor of 8.62, 5.87, 2.61, and 1.36 for one unit increase in county-level percent Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, and Asian/Pacific Islanders, respectively. Local spatial regression shows CFR was significantly higher in rural counties with a higher share of BIPOC in the Northeast and Midwest regions, and political inclination predicted COVID-19 CFR in rural counties in the Midwest region. In conclusion, spatial and racial/ethnic disparities exist for COVID-19 CFR across the US rural counties, and findings from this study have implications for public health.

At the current stage, the expression and function of circRASSF2 in breast cancer (BC) have not been clarified. According to our study, it is found that circRASSF2 sequences contain miR-1205 binding sites, and Homeobox gene A1 (HOXA1) is the target gene of miR-1205. Besides, the clinical observations and histopathologic study reveal that the expression of circRASSF2 increased to a significant extent in BC tissues and serum. Additionally, it is found that circRASSF2 expression had a positive correlation with distant metastasis, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, differentiation and tumor size, and that overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of circRASSF2 high expression BC patients were inferior to those with low circRASSF2 expression. In vitro study, an overt decrease was detected in the proliferation, clone formation ability, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in cells when circRASSF2 was knocked down. We confirmed the direct interaction between circRASSF2, miR-1205 and HOXA1 by a dual luciferase reporter system. Additionally, our study revealed that over-expression of miR-1205 decreased HOXA1 protein expression, and HOXA1 protein expression decreased when circRASSF2 were knocked down, and when miR-1205 expression was inhibited, HOXA1 expression was significantly increased. In conclusion, our study suggests that circRASSF2 regulates BC progression through the miR-1205/HOXA1 pathway. Our findings suggest the prospect of circRASSF2 serving as therapeutic target as such to cure BC patients.","output":"CircRASSF2 acts as a prognostic factor and promotes breast cancer progression by modulating miR-1205/HOXA1 axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: KIDS SAVE LIVES is a suggested training program by European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and aims to educate all children in First Aid We aimed to present the results of KIDS SAVE LIVES training program for the period 2016C2019 Methods: The Humanitarian Organisation KIDS SAVE LIVES -T ɦĦ? ?ƦϦԦ Z?ơ and the Hellenic Society of Emergency Prehospital Care set up a plan for establishing mandatory education of schoolchildren over 10 years old in CPR Having the approval of Greek Ministry of Education, the aforementioned Organisations implemented CPR training in primary and secondary schools Results: After 4 years of KIDS SAVE LIVES initiation in Greece, 53,793 schoolchildren 10 yrs, teachers, and parents were trained in 559 schools (46,217, 6681 and 895 accordingly) Today, Greece is the country with the youngest certified Instructors in Europe (100 BLS Provider and Instructor courses in schools) 18 victims of OHCA resuscitated by trained bystanders and Nefeli, is the first child that resuscitated an OHCA victim;6 volunteers resuscitated 12 choking victims Moreover, the program has been achieved the establishment of 140 public AEDs, the creation of an application with the location of 442 AEDs, the national school CPR championship, the Virtual Reality-CPR training, and online lessons of students due to COVID-19 prevention measures The official law proposal for the establishment of CPR training as a basic school subject has already applied to the Ministry of Education The pilot phase is expected to begin in September of 2020 with the initiation of CPR lessons by teachers who have been trained by our program Conclusion: KIDS SAVE LIVES course is a successful method for mass training events Incorporating training into the mandatory education syllabus, will facilitate the formation of a pool of young promising rescuers and contributing so to the future improvement of survival after OHCA","output":"KIDS SAVE LIVES in Greece-National training program of schoolchildren in cardiopulmonary resuscitation: Evaluating the impact of a 4 year nationwide educational seminar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Candida albicans can cause various infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. Its ability to develop resistance to the current antifungal drugs as well as its multiple virulence factors have rendered the problem even more complicated. Thus, in the present investigation, we elucidated an in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity of Encephalartos laurentianus methanol extract (ELME) against C. albicans clinical isolates for the first time. A phytochemical identification of 64 compounds was conducted in ELME using LC-MS/MS. Interestingly, ELME exhibited antifungal activity with MIC values that ranged from 32C256 g/mL. Furthermore, we investigated the antibiofilm activity of ELME against the biofilms formed by C. albicans isolates. ELME displayed antibiofilm activity using a crystal violet assay as it decreased the percentages of cells, moderately and strongly forming biofilms from 62.5% to 25%. Moreover, the antibiofilm impact of ELME was elucidated using SEM and fluorescent microscope. A significant reduction in the biofilm formation by C. albicans isolates was observed. In addition, we observed that ELME resulted in the downregulation of the biofilm-related tested genes (ALS1, BCR1, PLB2, and SAP5) in 37.5% of the isolates using qRT-PCR. Besides, the in vivo antifungal activity of ELME on the kidney tissues of rats infected with C. albicans was investigated using histological and immunohistochemical studies. ELME was found to protect against C. albicans induced renal damage, decrease desmin and inducible nitric oxide synthase, increase alkaline phosphatase, and increase infected rats survival rate. Additionally, the cytotoxicity of ELME was elucidated on Human Skin Fibroblast normal cells using MTT assay. ELME had an IC(50) of 31.26 g/mL.

Thus, it is essential not only to measure outcomes, but also to identify the mechanisms by which they are generated. Using a realist evaluation approach, we aimed to identify the mechanisms generating outcomes in a Danish peer support intervention for socially vulnerable people with type 2-diabetes (peers). By investigating the participating peers interactions, we furthermore examined how their individual contextual factors either facilitated or hindered the mechanisms in operation. METHODS: We used a multi-method case-study design (n = 9). Data included semi-structured interviews with four key groups of informants (peer, peer supporter, project manager, and a diabetes nurse) for each case (n = 25). Furthermore, we collected survey data from peers both before and after participation (n = 9). The interview data were analysed using a systematic text condensation, and the Intervention-context-actor-mechanism-outcome framework was used to structure the analysis. RESULTS: We identified 2 groups of mechanisms that improved diabetes self-management and the use of healthcare services (outcomes): perceived needs and readiness and encouragement and energy. However, the mechanisms only generated the intended outcomes among peers with a stable occupation and financial situation, a relatively good health condition, and sufficient energy (all defined as contextual factors). Independent of these contextual factors, experience of social and emotional support was identified as a mechanism within all peers that increased self-care awareness (defined as output). Dependent on whether the contextual factors facilitated or hindered the mechanisms to generate outcomes, we categorised the peers into those who achieved outcomes and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: We identified two groups of mechanisms that improved the peers diabetes self-management and use of healthcare services. The mechanisms only generated the intended outcomes if peers individual contextual factors facilitated an active interaction with the elements of the intervention. However, independent of these contextual factors, a third group of mechanisms increased self-care awareness among all peers. We highlight the importance of contextual awareness of the target groups in the design and evaluation of peer support interventions for socially vulnerable people with type 2-diabetes.

To date, no small-molecule clinical drugs are available that specifically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. To aid rational drug design, we determined a neutron structure of Mpro in complex with the &#945;-ketoamide inhibitor telaprevir at near-physiological (22 C) temperature. We directly observed protonation states in the inhibitor complex and compared them with those in the ligand-free Mpro, revealing modulation of the active-site protonation states upon telaprevir binding. We suggest that binding of other &#945;-ketoamide covalent inhibitors can lead to the same protonation state changes in the Mpro active site. Thus, by studying the protonation state changes induced by inhibitors, we provide crucial insights to help guide rational drug design, allowing precise tailoring of inhibitors to manipulate the electrostatic environment of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","output":"Direct Observation of Protonation State Modulation in SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease upon Inhibitor Binding with Neutron Crystallography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the start of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, there have been many scientific reports regarding gastrointestinal manifestations.

METHODS: A systematic literature search with MeSH terms was performed, scrutinising the Embase database, Google scholar, MEDLINE database through PubMed and The Cochrane Library, including articles from December 2019 until July 7 2020. Data were subsequently analysed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Ninety\\\\five studies were included in the qualitative analysis. 934/2149 (43%) patients tested positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in stool samples or anal swabs, with positive test results up to 70 days after symptom onset. A meta\\\\analysis executed with studies of at least 10 patients revealed a pooled positive proportion of 51.8% (95% CI 43.8 \\\\ 59.7%).

This study aimed to evaluate the pandemic's impact on psoriasis patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The multicenter study was conducted in 14 tertiary dermatology centers. Demographic data, treatment status, disease course, and cases of COVID-19 were evaluated in patients with psoriasis using the immunosuppressive treatment. RESULTS: Of 1827 patients included, the drug adherence rate was 68.2%. Those receiving anti-interleukin (anti-IL) drugs were more likely to continue treatment than patients receiving conventional drugs (OR = 1.50, 95% CI, 1.181-1.895, p = .001). Disease worsening rate was 24.2% and drug dose reduction increased this rate 3.26 and drug withdrawal 8.71 times. Receiving anti-TNF or anti-IL drugs was associated with less disease worsening compared to conventional drugs (p = .038, p = .032; respectively). Drug withdrawal causes were 'unable to come' (39.6%), 'COVID concern' (25.3%), and 'physician's and patient's co-decision' (17.4%). Four patients had COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms. The incidence was 0.0022% while it was 0.0025% in the general population.

In particular, four thiolated VK3 analogs exhibited superior biological potency against some Gram-positive bacterial strains, including Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC(?) 29213) and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC(?) 29212). Next, all thiolated VK3 analogs were evaluated for their potential of cell growth inhibition on the NCI-60 cancer cell lines panel. This screening underlined that the thiolated VK3 analogs have no visible cytotoxicity on different cancer cell lines. The selected two thiolated VK3 analogs (VK3a and VK3b), having minimal hemolytic activity, which also have the lowest MIC values on S. aureus and E. faecalis, were further evaluated for their inhibition capacities on biofilm formation after evaluating their potential in vitro antimicrobial activity against each of the 20 clinically obtained resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. VK3b showed excellent antimicrobial activity against clinically resistant S. aureus isolates. Furthermore, the tested molecules showed nearly two log(10) reduction in the viable cell count at six hours according to the time kill curve studies. Although these molecules decreased biofilm attachment about 50%, when sub-MIC concentrations were used these molecules increased the percentage of biofilm formation. The molecular docking of VK3a and VK3b in S. aureus thymidylate kinase was conducted in order to predict their molecular interactions. VK3a and VK3b exhibited excellent lead-likeness properties and pharmacokinetic profiles that qualify them for further optimization and development.

TRIAL DESIGN: A two-arm (1:1 ratio) cluster randomised controlled trial implementing Germ Defence via GP practices compared with usual care. PARTICIPANTS: Setting: All Primary care GP practices in England. PARTICIPANTS: All patients aged 16 years and over who were granted access by participating GP practices. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: We will ask staff at GP practices randomised to the intervention arm to share the weblink to Germ Defence with all adult patients registered at their practice during the 4-month trial implementation period and care will otherwise follow current standard management. Germ Defence is an interactive website ( http://GermDefence.org/ ) employing behaviour change techniques and practical advice on how to reduce the spread of infection in the home. The coronavirus version of Germ Defence helps people understand what measures to take and when to take them to avoid infection. This includes hand washing, avoiding sharing rooms and surfaces, dealing with deliveries and ventilating rooms. Using behaviour change techniques, it helps users think through and adopt better home hygiene habits and find ways to solve any barriers, providing personalised goal setting and tailored advice that fits users' personal circumstances and problem solving to overcome barriers. Comparator: Patients at GP practices randomised to the usual care arm will receive current standard management for the 4-month trial period after which we will ask staff to share the link to Germ Defence with all adult patients registered at their practice. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the effects of implementing Germ Defence on prevalence of all respiratory tract infection diagnoses during the 4-month trial implementation period. The secondary outcomes are: 1) incidence of COVID-19 diagnoses 2) incidence of COVID-19 symptom presentation 3) incidence of gastrointestinal infections 4) number of primary care consultations 5) antibiotic usage 6) hospital admissions 7) uptake of GP practices disseminating Germ Defence to their patients 8) usage of the Germ Defence website by individuals who were granted access by their GP practice RANDOMISATION: GP practices will be randomised on a 1:1 basis by the independent Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration (BRTC). Clinical Commission Groups (CCGs) in England will be divided into blocks according to region, and equal numbers in each block will be randomly allocated to intervention or usual care. The randomisation schedule will be generated in Stata statistical software by a statistician not otherwise involved in the enrolment of general practices into the study. BLINDING (MASKING): The principal investigators, the statistician and study collaborators will remain blinded from the identity of randomised practices until the end of the study.

The wide array of symptoms and variation in disease severity after SARS-CoV-2 infection might be related to heterogeneity in the immune responses of different patients. Here we describe a new method for a simple multi-antigen serological test that generates a full picture of seroconversion in a single reaction. The assay is based on the detection by flow cytometry of multiple immunoglobulin classes (isotypes) specific for four SARS-CoV-2 antigens: the Spike glycoprotein (one of the highly immunogenic proteins), its RBD fragment (the major target for neutralising antibodies), the nucleocapsid protein and the main cysteine-like protease. Until now, most diagnostic serological tests measured antibodies to only one antigen and some patients seemed to not make any antibody response. Our data reveal that while most patients respond against all the viral antigens tested, others show a marked bias to make antibodies against either proteins exposed on the viral particle or those released after cellular infection. Combining all the four antigens and using machine learning techniques, it was possible to clearly discriminate between patients and healthy controls with 100% confidence. Further, combination of antigens and different immunoglobulin isotypes in this multi-antigen assay improved the classification of patients with mild and severe disease. Introduction of this method will facilitate massive screenings of patients to evaluate their immune response. It could also support vaccination campaigns both to select non-immune individuals and to distinguish infected patients from vaccine responders.","output":"Bead-assisted SARS-CoV-2 multi-antigen serological test allows effective identification of patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the growth of Third Party Funds (DPK) in Islamic banks to see the economic strength during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Dengan menggunakan analisis menggunakan data time series dalam masa agregat semester pertama periode bulan Januari C Juni dan bulan pertama di semester kedua pada bulan Juli 2020. Sumber data diambil dari publikasi BNI Syariah dan BSM, berupa laporan keuangan bulanan. Sebagai pembanding digunakan data tahun 2018 dan 2019 pada periode bulan yang sama, sehingga diperoleh trend pertumbuhan DPK Bank Syariah di masa normal dan masa pandemi COVID-19. Hasil analisis korelasi dan komparasi, penelitian ini menemukan bahwa pandemi COVID-19 telah mempengaruhi tren dana masyarakat di bank syariah. Dalam memilih produk dana di bank, masyarakat menghindari risiko investasi dengan mengurangi simpanan dalam bentuk Dana Investasi dan lebih memilih produk aman yaitu Wadiah. Hal tersebut menyebabkan DPK di bank syariah baik di BNI Syariah maupun BSM mengalami pertumbuhan positif yang signifikan untuk simpanan Wadiah dan mengalami penurunan pada Dana Investasi selama masa pandemi COVID-19. Ini menunjukkan bahwa perbankan Syariah menghadapi risiko keuangan dalam situasi yang tidak normal selama masa pandemi COVID-19.","output":"Dampak pandemi COVID-19 terhadap pertumbuhan dana pihak ketiga pada bank syariah"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionData around end of life care in COVID-19 patients remains lacking We present a study of 89 COVID-19 hospital patients who received specialist palliative care (SPC) input, which provides a novel understanding of the symptom needs of those dying from COVID-19 MethodsRetrospective review of health-records of 89 COVID-19 patients with SPC involvement between 20/3/20 - 21/4/20 54 pre-pandemic control patients referred to SPC between 20/11/19 - 20/12/19 were included as comparison Results and discussion84% (n=75) of COVID-19 patients had died at follow-up compared to 44% (n=24) of controls Average time from SPC involvement to death was 3 4 days for COVID-19 patients and 8 3 days for controls COVID-19 patients were more breathlessness (92%, n=69 vs 75%, n=18) and pyrexial (44%, n=33 vs 4%, n=1) than controls Control patients were more likely to experience pain (58%, n=14 vs 17%, n=13) Agitation rates were similar in COVID-19 patients (45%, n=34) and controls (58%, n=14) High symptom burden and rapidity of deterioration in COVID-19 patients necessitated an increased use of continuous subcutaneous infusions (CSCIs), (69%, n=52 vs 46%, n=11) Median doses of opioids and benzodiazepines required in CSCIs to control symptoms were similar across both groups Median 24 hr CSCI morphine equivalent dose of 15 mg (n=51) in COVID-19 patients vs 10 mg (n=10) in controls Median CSCI midazolam dose of 10 mg in both groups (n=40 vs n=10 in controls) Few COVID-19 patients required glycopyrronium (n=15) and antiemetics (n=5) via a CSCI Conclusion and recommendationsCOVID-19 patients have a rapid deterioration and symptomatic dying phase with different symptom profile to control patients Symptom control in COVID-19 can be achieved with traditional drugs often at low doses, though with earlier use of CSCIs Education and reassurance for generalists in the early use of opioids and benzodiazepines is essential to managing symptoms of dying COVID-19 patients","output":"16 Do symptom control needs differ in patients dying from COVID-19?

In this study, the open reading frames of the TGEV S1 protein and in addition of the S or S1 proteins of PEDV were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector, pIRES, resulting in recombinant plasmids, pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S). Subsequently, 6C8 weeks old Kunming mice were inoculated with both DNA plasmids. Lymphocyte proliferation assay, virus neutralization assay, IFN- assay and CTL activity assay were performed. TGEV/PEDV specific antibody responses as well as kinetic changes of T lymphocyte subgroups of the immunized mice were analyzed. The results showed that the recombinant DNA plasmids increased the proliferation of T lymphocytes and the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subgroups. In addition, the DNA vaccines induced a high level of IFN- in the immunized mice. The specific CTL activity in the pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) group became significant at 42 days post-immunization.

This study aims to overview the cycling phenomenon during the Covid-19 Pandemic and the factors causing the cycling trend during a pandemic. In addition, the main highlight is to determine the emergence background of the cycling trend;whether it is an increase in people's awareness of sports or is it merely a lifestyle trend? The research method uses a systematic literature review by conducting literature reviews in reputable journals and scientific publications that discuss cycling in the pre-pandemic and pandemic times. Data analysis uses descriptive analysis and phenomenological approach as a theoretical framework. The results showed that four factors caused the cycling trend during the pandemic. Those factors are health, environment, media and lifestyle factors. Health reasons are due to the desire to maintain health and body immunity, and cycling is a sport recommended by health experts and according to the principle of physical distancing. Environmental factors are caused by being economical and environmentally friendly, supporting the \\"go green\\" program, and cyclist could get fresh and clean air. The media factor is driven by the significant influence of social media content and hashtags about cycling. While lifestyle factors arise due to following the latest trends, cycling can relieve stress and increase social status indicated by the price of bicycles and reasons for conformity in social groups. The increasing trend of cycling is mainly motivated by the desire to accompany the social demands of the current lifestyle, while the motivation related to health factors to increase body immunity in dealing with pandemic situations is secondary motivation.

We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine. We report here the evaluation of a library of nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These features include modifications on the sugar (2 or 3 modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base. The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues for their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and to prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (triphosphates of Carbovir, Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir; 3-OMe-UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2-OMe-UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2-F-dUTP, 2-NH(2)-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP). The coronaviruses possess an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2-OH at the 3-terminus of the growing RNA strand for proofreading. In this study, all nucleoside triphosphate analogues evaluated form Watson-Crick-like base pairs. The nucleotide analogues demonstrating termination either lack a 2-OH, have a blocked 2-OH, or show delayed termination. Thus, these nucleotide analogues are of interest for further investigation to evaluate whether they can evade the viral exonuclease activity. Prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA-approved medications for treatment of other viral infections, and their safety profiles are well established. After demonstrating potency in inhibiting viral replication in cell culture, candidate molecules can be rapidly evaluated as potential therapies for COVID-19.","output":"A Library of Nucleotide Analogues Terminate RNA Synthesis Catalyzed by Polymerases of Coronaviruses that Cause SARS and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This conceptual paper discussed on the importance of establishing Social Enterprise Companies with a Theoretical approach.

Although accelerating the vaccination process in recent months has reduced the incidence and mortality of the COVID-19 infection, the general population (particularly vulnerable groups) remains at risk of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. Over the last two months, Iran has encountered the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, i. e., the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of the SARS-CoV-2, with faster infectiousness and higher severity and mortality among hospitalized patients 1. Although fever, cough, and expectoration are the most common clinical features of COVID-19, recent studies have indicated an increasing number of skin manifestation reports in the disease. Besides, there is growing evidence that underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase the risk of adverse drug reactions 2. However, the enduring concern in our medical centers in recent days is a raised incidence of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) in recovered COVID-19 patients following monotherapy with older antiepileptic drugs (0.004 vs. 0.0008% - i. e., 5 times higher than the pre-COVID-19 period) 3. It is worth noting that these patients did not have any history of SJS/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or additional etiopathogenic factors, including infections, genetic factors (particularly HLA-B*1502 allele), and malignancy. Furthermore, for many years before developing the COVID-19 and recovering from it, they had been treated with the above drugs without showing any cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions. These observational findings raise two important questions: (i) Could a history of the COVID-19 infection be a potential risk factor for type IV hypersensitivity reactions to older antiepileptic drugs?

For this reason, issues on environmental goods can be put at the forefront to analyze the linkage between environmental regulations and trade flows in the perspective of international institutions. Within the framework of a gravity model, panel data on 112 exporter countries and 53 importer countries is used at a bilateral level over the period of 1989C2013 to gain an understanding of this trade-environmental regulation nexus. This paper proxies the environmental policies by employing the z-score, which includes three comprehensive environmental indicators. The findings indicate that the strict environmental policies impede the trade, and this effect is greater in terms of the environmental goods listed in APEC compared to the ones listed in OECD.

There is little information regarding pregnant womens views toward coronavirus vaccination in Japan. Therefore, we investigated the vaccination rate and reasons for vaccination and vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women in Japan. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 1,791 pregnant women using data from the Japan COVID-19 and Society Internet Survey, conducted from July to August 2021, and valid response from 1,621 respondents were analyzed. We defined participants with vaccine hesitancy as those who identified with the statement I do not want to be vaccinated or I want to wait and see before getting vaccinated. Multivariate Poisson regression analysis was used to investigate the factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: The prevalence of vaccination and vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women was 13.4% (n = 217) and 50.9% (n = 825), respectively. The main reasons for hesitancy were concerns about adverse reactions and negative effects on the fetus and breastfeeding. Vaccine hesitancy was significantly associated with the lack of trust in the government (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.03C1.54). Other factors, such as age, educational attainment, and state of emergency declaration, were not associated with vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination is not widespread among pregnant women in Japan, although many vaccines have been shown to be safe in pregnancy.

Although wastewaters can also be used for tracking SARS-CoV-2 at the population level, the reliability of this approach remains to be established, especially for early warning of outbreaks. Methods: We collected 377 samples from different treatment plants processing wastewaters of >1 million inhabitants in Valencia, Spain, between April 2020 and March 2021. Samples were cleaned, concentrated, and subjected to RT-qPCR to determine SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. These data were compared with cumulative disease notification rates over 7 and 14 day periods. Results: We amplified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 75% of the RT-qPCRs, with an estimated detection limit of 100 viral genome copies per liter (gc/L). SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration correlated strongly with disease notification rates over 14-day periods (Pearson r = 0.962, P < 0.001). A concentration >1000 gc/L showed >95% sensitivity and specificity as an indicator of more than 25 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Albeit with slightly higher uncertainty, these figures were reproduced using a 7-day period. Time series were similar for wastewaters data and declared cases, but wastewater RNA concentrations exhibited transient peaks that were not observed in declared cases and preceded major outbreaks by several weeks.

Given the effects of COVID-19 on pulmonary tissues, chest radiographic imaging has become a necessity for screening and monitoring the disease. Numerous studies have proposed Deep Learning approaches for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Although these methods achieved astonishing performance in detection, they have used limited chest X-ray (CXR) repositories for evaluation, usually with a few hundred COVID-19 CXR images only. Thus, such data scarcity prevents reliable evaluation with the potential of overfitting. In addition, most studies showed no or limited capability in infection localization and severity grading of COVID-19 pneumonia. In this study, we address this urgent need by proposing a systematic and unified approach for lung segmentation and COVID-19 localization with infection quantification from CXR images. To accomplish this, we have constructed the largest benchmark dataset with 33,920 CXR images, including 11,956 COVID-19 samples, where the annotation of ground-truth lung segmentation masks is performed on CXRs by a novel human-machine collaborative approach. An extensive set of experiments was performed using the state-of-the-art segmentation networks, U-Net, U-Net++, and Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN). The developed network, after an extensive iterative process, reached a superior performance for lung region segmentation with Intersection over Union (IoU) of 96.11% and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 97.99%. Furthermore, COVID-19 infections of various shapes and types were reliably localized with 83.05% IoU and 88.21% DSC.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three months after the extraction of all mandibular premolars and first molars, two recipient sites were selected. The osteotomies were randomly prepared with either conventional drills (drill sites) or a piezoelectric device (piezoelectric sites). Implants were installed and a submerged healing was allowed. The animals were euthanized in groups of six after 4 and 8 weeks of healing. Biopsies were obtained for histological preparation. Coronal level of osseointegration (bone level) and bone-to-implant contact percentage (BIC%) were evaluated. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of healing, the bone level was 0.6  0.9 mm for the piezoelectric sites and 1.6  0.7 mm for the drill sites (p = 0.173). After 8 weeks, the respective measures were 0.9  0.3 mm and 1.0  1.1 mm (p = 0.917). After 4 weeks of healing, a new bone apposed onto the implant surface was found at fractions of 54.9  6.7% and 55.1  16.6% for the piezoelectric and the drill sites, respectively (p = 0.674).

Quality expectations for 14 reuses have been enlisted, and 25 WWTTs have been evaluated in a total of 360 combinations. In Kanpur city, for water reuse in industrial cooling under restricted land and challenging influent quality conditions, a combination of Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) with Wuhrmann process (WP) is obtained as the most preferred suggestion. For non-potable domestic reuse, Anaerobic Anoxic Oxic (A2O) with Ultrafiltration (UF) and Reverse Osmosis (RO) is the most preferred combination. In Varanasi city, for vehicular washing operations and for flow augmentation (inland surface water), under energy-constraint scenario, high-rate activated sludge-based biological filtration and oxygenated reactor (BIOFOR-F) is suggested. For technology supplementation to existing ASP-based STPs in the city to obtain effluent for inland surface water augmentation, WP in combination with microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO) is suggested. Thus, the developed model may be used as a decision-making tool for planning a reuse-focused water reclamation program or for upgradation of existing STPs as per resource availability and target reuse objectives.","output":"Reuse-focused selection of appropriate technologies for municipal wastewater treatment: a multi-criteria approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Faced with novel coronavirus outbreak, the most hard-hit countries adopted a lockdown strategy to contrast the spread of virus.

Following these lines of research, we focus on air quality changes in the urban territory of Chieti-Pescara (Central Italy), identified as an area of criticality in terms of air pollution. Concentrations of [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] and benzene are used to evaluate air pollution changes in this Region. Data were measured by several monitoring stations over two specific periods: from 1st February to 10 th March 2020 (before lockdown period) and from 11st March 2020 to 18 th April 2020 (during lockdown period). The impact of lockdown on air quality is assessed through functional data analysis. Our work makes an important contribution to the analysis of variance for functional data (FANOVA). Specifically, a novel approach based on multivariate functional principal component analysis is introduced to tackle the multivariate FANOVA problem for independent measures, which is reduced to test multivariate homogeneity on the vectors of the most explicative principal components scores. Results of the present study suggest that the level of each pollutant changed during the confinement. Additionally, the differences in the mean functions of all pollutants according to the location and type of monitoring stations (background vs traffic), are ascribable to the [Formula: see text] and benzene concentrations for pre-lockdown and during-lockdown tenure, respectively.

At the same time, digital dentistry is rapidly spreading, especially in what concerns prosthetic rehabilitation. The present study aimed to compare, through a randomized clinical trial design, the analogical vs. the traditional workflow. Single-implant restorations have been run in 50 patients, with a 12-month maximum period of follow-up after implant placement. Data were analyzed through radiological, clinical, and customer satisfaction evaluation. Importantly, and surprisingly enough, no statistically significant differences emerged between the two kinds of workflow. When assessing customer satisfaction, however, patients clearly and significantly preferred the comfort of the digital vs. traditional workflow. ABSTRACT: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to compare the immediate-loading protocol, in single restorations in the esthetic zone, by comparing the digital workflow in a test group (TG) vs. the analogical workflow in a control group (CG). A total of 50 patients were enrolled, requiring single hopeless tooth extraction. Twenty-five patients (TG) were randomly assigned to the immediate-loading protocol using the digital workflow, and twenty-five patients (CG) were assigned to the conventional workflow. Clinical and radiographic parameters were evaluated at the time of implant insertion (baseline) and after 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. A clinician blind to conditions measured the Pink Esthetic Score (PES), as well as patient satisfaction. At 12-month follow-up, a cumulative survival rate of 100% was reported for all implants. No failures or biological complications were observed. No statistically significant differences were detected in the mean values of marginal bone loss and PES between the TG (0.12  0.66 mm for MBL, 7.75  0.89 for PES) and the CG (0.15  0.54 mm for MBL, 7.50  0.89 for PES). In 11 cases of TG, and 10 cases of CG, a one-year follow-up period showed an increased marginal bone level. No statistically significant differences were found in the mean total PES between test (7.75  0.89) and control (7.5  0.81) conditions. Furthermore, a customer satisfaction survey showed that patients preferred the digital workflow over the conventional workflow procedure (97.6  4.3 vs. 69.2  13.8). Digital workflow was more time-efficient than conventional workflow (97.2  7.3 vs. 81.2  11.3).

The pandemic also made the process of protecting individuals from tornadoes more challenging, especially when their personal residence lacks suitable shelter, and particularly for residents of mobile homes. The necessity of having to shelter with other families-either in a public shelter or at another residence-to protect themselves from a tornado threat conflicted with the advice of public health officials who recommended avoiding public places and limiting contact with the public to minimize the spread of COVID-19. There was also a perception that protecting against one threat could amplify the other threat. Asurvey was undertaken with the public to determine the general viewpoint to see if that was indeed the case. The results found that it was possible to attenuate both threats provided that careful planning and actions were undertaken. Understanding how emergency managers should react and plan for such dual threats is important to minimize the spread of COVID-19 while also maintaining the safety of the public.

Despite the increasing popularity of low-cost sensors, there remain some gaps in the understanding of their performance under real-world conditions, as well as compared to regulatory monitors with high accuracy, but also high cost and maintenance requirements. In this paper, we report on the performance and the linear calibration of readings from 12 commercial low-cost sensors co-located at a regulatory air quality monitoring site in Dallas, Texas, for 18 continuous measurement months. Commercial AQY1 sensors were used, and their reported readings of O(3), NO(2), PM(2.5), and PM(10) were assessed against a regulatory monitor. We assessed how well the raw and calibrated AQY1 readings matched the regulatory monitor and whether meteorology impacted performance. We found that each sensors response was different. Overall, the sensors performed best for O(3) (R(2) = 0.36C0.97) and worst for NO(2) (0.00C0.58), showing a potential impact of meteorological factors, with an effect of temperature on O(3) and relative humidity on PM. Calibration seemed to improve the accuracy, but not in all cases or for all performance metrics (e.g., precision versus bias), and it was limited to a linear calibration in this study. Our data showed that it is critical for users to regularly calibrate low-cost sensors and monitor data once they are installed, as sensors may not be operating properly, which may result in the loss of large amounts of data. We also recommend that co-location should be as exact as possible, minimizing the distance between sensors and regulatory monitors, and that the sampling orientation is similar. There were important deviations between the AQY1 and regulatory monitors readings, which in small part depended on meteorology, hindering the ability of the low-costs sensors to present air quality accurately. However, categorizing air pollution levels, using for example the Air Quality Index framework, rather than reporting absolute readings, may be a more suitable approach. In addition, more sophisticated calibration methods, including accounting for individual sensor performance, may further improve performance. This work adds to the literature by assessing the performance of low-cost sensors over one of the longest durations reported to date.","output":"Evaluating the Performance of Low-Cost Air Quality Monitors in Dallas, Texas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Currently, the United States has the largest number of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths globally.

Background For doctoral students, the process of designing, implementing, and writing a culminating project is a key part of the learning experience. These projects typically require students to direct their own learning and to manage setbacks, obstacles, and challenges as they arise. During the COVID-19 pandemic, doctoral students around the globe had to undertake this key learning experience in the context of a global crisis. Methodology During August and September 2020, 235 doctoral students from around the world completed an online questionnaire consisting of demographic questions and three open-ended questions about their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis involved several cycles of In Vivo Coding of the data, which yielded codes, categories, and eventually themes. At each stage, the researchers collaborated to generate the codes, and the categories and themes arose through several rounds of discussion. Contribution Our study adds to the small body of knowledge on doctoral students experiences from around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic by identifying categories of experience through qualitative, open-ended survey questions. The study highlights doctoral students challenges and how these were either exacerbated or mitigated by pandemic-induced changes. Findings Our survey respondents described impacts on their culminating projects progress in five major categories: research design, access to resources, workload, mental health, and finances.

We find that, as vaccination rates increase, the proportion of transmission driven by the unvaccinated population decreases, such that most community spread is driven by vaccine-breakthrough infections once vaccine coverage exceeds 55% (omicron) or 80% (delta), points which shift lower as vaccine effectiveness wanes. Thus, we show that as vaccination rates increase, the transmission reductions associated with unvaccinated-only screening decline, identifying three distinct categories of impact on infections and hospitalizations.

The stress and anxiety levels of respondents were also investigated. The survey obtained 1053 respondents. Additionally, environmental noise levels were measured over 24-h at two locations and compared with results before the pandemic. The results clearly exhibit that environmental noise levels and annoyance due to the noise levels dropped significantly. The annoyance drop was larger in previously noisier environments than previously tranquil locations. Noise annoyance due to neighbor noise did not change significantly; however, noise annoyance due to one's own dwelling increased. The results also confirmed an overall increase in dwelling satisfactions indicating a correlation between dwelling satisfaction and lower environmental noise levels. Although the results confirmed that noise annoyance was positively correlated with stress and anxiety levels, the change of annoyance between before and during lockdown was shown to be independent from the stress and anxiety level.","output":"Noise annoyance during COVID-19 lockdown: A research of public opinion before and during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research, we explore and theorize on the potential of hospital outpatient rehabilitation waiting areas to respond and contribute to the health literacy needs of consumers.

This is particularly relevant in tumor model in which autophagy has been demonstrated to have an important impact on tumor behavior. In one hand, autophagy limits tumor transformation of precancerous cells in early stage, and in the other hand, it favors the survival, proliferation, metastasis, and resistance to antitumor therapies in more advanced tumors. This catabolic machinery can be induced by an important variety of extra- and intracellular stimuli. For instance, viral infection has often been associated to autophagic modulation, and the role of autophagy in virus replication differs according to the virus studied. In the context of tumor development, virus-modulated autophagy can have an important impact on tumor cells fate. Extensive analyses have shed light on the molecular and/or functional complex mechanisms by which virus-modulated autophagy influences precancerous or tumor cell development.

We aimed to estimate the use of masks during protests and analyze the temporal relationship of protests to COVID-19 epidemiology.Methods: Twelve cities which had BLM protests and met inclusion criteria were selected. Two reviewers screened 496 protest images for mask use, with high inter-rater reliability. Protest intensity, use of tear gas, government control measures and testing rates were estimated for each city. A correlation analysis was conducted to assess the potential effect of mask use and other measures, adjusting for testing rates, on COVID-19 epidemiology four weeks (two incubation periods) post-protests.Findings: Mask use ranged from 69-96% across protests. There was no increase in incidence of COVID-19 post-protest in 11 of the 12 cities studied. After adjusting for testing rates, only Miami, which involved use of tear gas and had high protest intensity, showed a clear increase in COVID-19 after one incubation period post-protest. No significant correlation was found between incidence and protest factors.Interpretation: Despite the concerns that protests may increase COVID-19 transmission, protests in most cities studied did not increase COVID-19 incidence, and most protesters wore masks. The absence of an epidemic surge within two incubation periods of a protest is indicative that the protests did not have a major influence on epidemic activity, except in Miami.

The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis and development of pulmonary edema. However, some recent studies have demonstrated surprisingly that TNF can also promote alveolar fluid reabsorption in vivo and in vitro. This protective effect of the cytokine is mediated by the lectin-like domain of the cytokine, which is spatially distinct from the TNF receptor binding sites.

Rapid change occurred due to government-imposed physical distancing regulations from March 2020 that increasingly restricted anatomy laboratory teaching practices. Anatomy educators in both these countries were mobilized to adjust their teaching approaches. This study on anatomy education disruption at pandemic onset within Australia and New Zealand adopts a social constructivist lens. The research question was \\"What are the perceived disruptions and changes made to anatomy education in Australia and New Zealand during the initial period of the Covid-19 pandemic, as reflected on by anatomy educators?.\\" Thematic analysis to elucidate \\"the what and why\\" of anatomy education was applied to these reflections.

The analysis revealed loss of integrated \\"hands-on\\" experiences, and impacts on workload, traditional roles, students, pedagogy, and anatomists' personal educational philosophies. The key opportunities recognized for anatomy education included: enabling synchronous teaching across remote sites, expanding offerings into the remote learning space, and embracing new pedagogies. In managing anatomy education's transition in response to the pandemic, six critical elements were identified: community care, clear communications, clarified expectations, constructive alignment, community of practice, ability to compromise, and adapt and continuity planning.

However, the multi-factor models usually require too many parameters to be calibrated efficiently and they do not lead to an analytic pricing formula. The double Heston model is one of them. The approach of this paper for this difficulty is to rescale the double Heston model to reduce the number of the model parameters and obtain a closed form analytic solution formula for variance swaps explicitly. We show that the rescaled double Heston model is as effective as the original double Heston model in terms of fitting to the VIX market data in a stable condition and yet the computing time is much less than that under the double Heston model.

Multidimensional prognostic index (MPI) is a frailty assessment tool widely used for stratifying prognosis in older people, but data regarding inpatients, affected by COVID-19, are not available. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether MPI can predict in-hospital mortality and the admission to intensive care unit (ICU) in older inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this longitudinal, Italian, multi-center study, older patients with COVID-19 were included. MPI was calculated using eight different domains typical of comprehensive geriatric assessment and categorized in three groups (MPI 1 &#8804; 0.33, MPI 2 0.34-0.66, MPI 3 > 0.66). A multivariable Cox's regression analysis was used reporting the results as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: 227 older patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled (mean age: 80.5 years, 59% females). Inpatients in the MPI 3 were subjected less frequently than those in the MPI 1 to non-invasive ventilation (NIV). In the multivariable analysis, people in MPI 3 experienced a higher risk of in hospital mortality (HR = 6.30, 95%CI: 1.44-27.61), compared to MPI 1. The accuracy of MPI in predicting in hospital mortality was good (Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.68-0.83). People in MPI 3 experienced a significant longer length of stay (LOS) in hospital compared to other participants. No association between MPI and ICU admission was found. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty- as assessed by high MPI score - was associated with a significant higher risk of in-hospital mortality, longer LOS, and lower use NIV, whilst the association with ICU admission was not significant.

Conditions used for cell isolation and expansion should meet strict quality and safety requirements. This is particularly true for the growth medium used for MSC isolation and expansion. Basal growth media used for MSC expansion are supplemented with multiple nutrients and growth factors. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) has long been the gold standard medium supplement for laboratory-scale MSC culture. However, FBS has a poorly characterized composition and poses risk factors, as it may be a source of xenogenic antigens and zoonotic infections. FBS has therefore become undesirable as a growth medium supplement for isolating and expanding MSCs for human therapy protocols. In recent years, human blood materials, and most particularly lysates and releasates of platelet concentrates have emerged as efficient medium supplements for isolating and expanding MSCs from various origins.

We present the modes of production of allogeneic and autologous platelet concentrates, measures taken to ensure optimal pathogen safety profiles, and methods of preparing PLs for MSC expansion.

RTCs were isolated from EAV-infected cells, and their activity was studied using a newly developed in vitro assay for viral RNA synthesis, which reproduced the synthesis of both viral genome and subgenomic mRNAs. A detailed characterization of this system and its reaction products is described. RTCs isolated from cytoplasmic extracts by differential centrifugation were inactive unless supplemented with a cytosolic host protein factor, which, according to subsequent size fractionation analysis, has a molecular mass in the range of 59-70 kDa.

Its main means of transmission is from person to person through respiratory droplets. It presents as a febrile condition with respiratory symptoms and high transmissibility rate. There is no vaccine, so the clinical suspicion and immediate isolation of the patient are essential Objective: The purpose of this work is to report the first confirmed case of COVID-19 disease in Crdoba (Argentina), highlighting telemedicine as a novel form of outpatient management. Methodology: We describe the first confirmed case of COVID-19 disease in Crdoba (Argentina), which presented in a patient without comorbidities in good clinical condition, and therefore ambulatory management using telemedicine was decided, which was satisfactory. Results: Outpatient management using telemedicine turned out to be optimal, avoiding the use of beds and the transmission of the virus within the hospital through management at home. Conclusion: Outpatient management of selected patients avoids virus transmission within the hospital and saturation of beds. Telemedicine is an effective and novel strategy for this situation.","output":"Enfermedad covid-19.

A multidimensional point cloud is an unstructured array of single, irregular points in a spatial 3D coordinate system plus time stamp. If geospatial reference points are available, a point cloud is geo-referenced. Geo-referenced point clouds contain a high-precision reference dataset. Point clouds can be utilised in a variety of applications. They are particularly suitable for the representation of surfaces, structures, terrain and objects. Point clouds are used here to generate a virtual 3D city model representing the complex, granular cityscape of Jerusalem and its centre, the Old City. The generation of point clouds is based on two data acquisition methods: active data capture by laser scanning and passive data collection by photogrammetric methods. In our case, very high-resolution stereo imagery in visible light and near infrared bands have been systematically acquired an aerial flight campaign. The spatio-temporal data gathered necessitate further processing to extract the geographical reference and semantic features required in a specific resolution and scale. An insight is given into the processing of an unstructured point cloud to extract and classify the 3D urban fabric and reconstruct its objects. Eventually, customised, precise and up-to-date geographical datasets can be made available for a defined region at a defined resolution and scale.","output":"Constructing Geo-Referenced Virtual City Models from Point Cloud Primitives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread globally in pandemic proportions. Accumulative evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the digestive system, the so-called fecal-oral route of transmission, and may induce several gastrointestinal manifestations. MEDLINE? and Embase databases were extensively searched for major clinical manifestations of gastrointestinal involvement in children and adolescents with COVID-19 reported in medical literature, and for nutritional therapy-related data. Findings and recommendations were pragmatically described to facilitate overall pediatric approach. A total of 196 studies addressing gastrointestinal or nutritional aspects associated with the global COVID-19 pandemic were found. Of these, only 17 focused specifically on pediatric patients with regard to aforementioned gastrointestinal or nutritional aspects. Most articles were descriptive and six addressed guidelines, established protocols, or expert opinions. Children and adolescents with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, should be seriously suspected of COVID-19. Gastrointestinal signs and symptoms may occur in 3% to 79% of children, adolescents and adults with COVID-19, and are more common in severe cases. These include diarrhea (2% to 50%), anorexia (40% to 50%), vomiting (4% to 67%), nausea (1% to 30%), abdominal pain (2% to 6%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (4% to 14%). Patients with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic liver disease are not at greater risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 relative to the general population. Nutritional support plays an important role in treatment of pediatric patients, particularly those with severe or critical forms of the disease. The digestive system may be a potential route of COVID-19 transmission. Further research is needed to determine whether the fecal-oral route may be involved in viral spread. Nutritional therapy is vital to prevent malnutrition and sarcopenia in severe cases.","output":"Gastrointestinal manifestations and nutritional therapy during COVID-19 pandemic: a practical guide for pediatricians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 might not have severely threatened young children's physical health;however, it has had profound impacts on their sound development and mental health that could have long-lasting effects on their lives.

To consider practice change clinicians must identify relevant information and develop a contextual framework. Too much attention to information irrelevant to ones practice results in wasted resources. Too little results in care gaps. A small group of primary care clinicians in a large health system sought to address the problem of vetting new information and providing peer reviewed context. This was done by engaging colleagues across the system though a primary care learning collaborative. METHODS: The collaborative was a grass roots initiative between community and academic-based clinicians. They invited all the systems primary care clinicians to participate. They selected new recommendations or guidelines and used surveys as the principal communication instrument. Surveys shared practice experience and also invited members to give narrative feedback regarding their acceptance of variation in care relate to the topic. A description of the collaborative along with its development, processes, and evolution are discussed. Process changes to address needs during the COVID-19 pandemic including expanded information sharing was necessary. RESULTS: Collaborative membership reached across 5 states and included family medicine, internal medicine, and pediatrics. Members found involvement with the collaborative useful. Less variation in care was thought important for public health crises: the COVID pandemic and opioid epidemic. Greater practice variation was thought acceptable for adherence to multispecialty guidelines, such as diabetes, lipid management, and adult ADHD care. Process changes during the pandemic resulted in more communications between members to avoid practice gaps. CONCLUSION: An internet-based learning collaborative in a health system had good engagement from its members. Using novel methods, it was able to provide members with feedback related to the importance of new practice recommendations as perceived by their peers. Greater standardization was thought necessary when adopting measures to address public health crisis, and less necessary when addressing multispecialty guidelines. By employing a learning collaborative, this group was able to keep members interested and engaged.

However, its a semi-invasive, time consuming, and chronic therapy with variable adherence. There are still no specific guideline recommendations for the management of patients on lipid apheresis. The purpose of this review is to discuss the clinical indications and major drawbacks of lipid apheresis in the light of recent evidence. RECENT FINDINGS: Lipoprotein apheresis should be initiated at early ages and performed frequently to receive the expected cardiovascular benefits. However, in clinical practice, most patients experience ineffective apheresis and fail to reach lipid targets. This real-world failure is due to several factors including late diagnosis, delayed referral, and improper frequency of procedures. All these denote that awareness is still low among physicians. Another important factor is the semi-invasive, time consuming nature of the apheresis, leading to high refusal and low adherence rates. Moreover, apheresis decreases quality of life and increases the risk of depression. Mental status is also deteriorated in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia on lipid apheresis. New effective lipid lowering agents are underway with promising cardiovascular results. SUMMARY: To overcome the drawbacks, a structured approach, including standardized protocols for lipoprotein apheresis with regular cardiovascular follow-up is warranted. New effective lipid lowering agents with documented cardiovascular benefit, should be integrated into the treatment algorithms of patients on lipoprotein apheresis.","output":"LDL Apheresis and Lp (a) Apheresis: A Clinicians Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The stress and anxiety resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has lead to a significant increase in escapist media-based coping.

While mounting evidence has emphasized the benefits of increasing MVPA, little is focused on the effect of SB on health. Therefore, this review discusses the pathophysiological effects of SB and the potential physiological benefits of reducing/breaking up SB at the levels below the current guidelines for PA.

METHODS A mixed-methods online survey evaluating the videos was completed by 43 family carers who care for children with gastrostomies and 33 healthcare professionals (community-based nurses [n = 16], paediatricians [n = 6], dieticians [n = 6], hospital-based nurses [n = 4], paediatric surgeon [n = 1]) from the United Kingdom. Participants watched a sample of videos, rated statements on the videos and reflected on how the videos could be best used in practice. RESULTS Both family carers and healthcare professionals perceived the video library as a valuable resource for parents and strongly supported the use of videos in practice. All healthcare professionals and 98% (n = 42) of family carers agreed they would recommend the videos to other families. Family carers found the videos empowering and easy to follow and valued the mixture of healthcare professionals and families featured in the videos.

Yet, there is a distinct lack of evidence to support the use of this technique. In this study, we aim to collect and evaluate the clinical evidence, in order to provide a basis for the efficacy and safety of music intervention in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with mental disorders. Methods: : We plan to search a range of electronic databases from inception to the May 2021, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP). All randomized controlled trials featuring music intervention to treat mental disorders such as anxiety, depression, or sleep disorders, for patients with COVID-19, will be included. The primary outcomes will be quantitative scores for anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder.

Using an orthopaedic elective surgery model, we aimed to answer the following: (1) What is the expected recovery time until the health-care system is back to nearly full capacity for performing elective surgery? (2) What will be the expected backlog of elective surgery over time? (3) How should health care change to address the backlog? METHODS: A Monte Carlo stochastic simulation-based analysis was performed to forecast the post-pandemic volume of elective, inpatient total joint arthroplasty and spinal fusion surgical cases. The cumulative backlog was calculated and analyzed. We tested model assumptions with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Assuming that elective orthopaedic surgery resumes in June 2020, it will take 7, 12, and 16 months-in optimistic, ambivalent, and pessimistic scenarios, respectively-until the health-care system can perform 90% of the expected pre-pandemic forecasted volume of surgery. In the optimistic scenario, there will be a cumulative backlog of >1 million surgical cases at 2 years after the end of elective-surgery deferment.

The study of differentially expressed genes in case-control cohorts of patients is often the first step in understanding the details of the cells dysregulation. A further level of analysis is introduced by noticing that genes are organized in functional modules (often called pathways), thus their action and their dysregulation may be better understood by the identification of the modules most affected by the disease (aka disease modules, or active subnetworks). We describe how an algorithm based on the Core&Peel method developed originally for detecting protein complexes in PPI networks, can be adapted to detect disease modules in co-expression networks of genes. We first validate Core&Peel for the easier general task of functional module detection by comparison with 42 methods participating in the Disease Module Identification DREAM challenge of 2019. Next, we use four specific disease test cases (colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis), four state-of-the-art algorithms (ModuleDiscoverer, Degas, KeyPathwayMiner and ClustEx), and several pathway databases to validate the proposed algorithm. Core&Peel is the only method able to find significant associations of the predicted disease module with known validated relevant pathways for all four diseases. Moreover for the two cancer data sets, Core&Peel detects further nine relevant pathways enriched in the predicted disease module, not discovered by the other methods used in the comparative analysis. Finally we apply Core&Peel, along with other methods, to explore the transcriptional response of human cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, at a modular level, aiming at finding supporting evidence for drug repositioning efforts.","output":"Finding disease modules for cancer and COVID-19 in gene co-expression networks with the Core&Peel method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People who use drugs including people who inject drugs (PWUD/ID), sex workers (SWs) and men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk of HIV and viral hepatitis infection. Limited epidemiological data on the infections exists in key populations (KPs) in South Africa. We investigated the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV and selected risk factors among these KPs to inform effective responses. METHODS: We used convenience sampling to recruit a targeted 3500 KPs accessing HIV-related health services across Cape Town (SWs, MSM, PWUD/ID), Durban (SWs, PWUD/ID), Pietermaritzburg (SWs), Mthatha (SWs), Port Elizabeth (SWs), Johannesburg (MSM) and Pretoria (MSM and PWUD/ID) into a cross-sectional survey. An interviewer questionnaire to assess socio-demographic characteristics, drug use and sexual risk practices, was administered. HBV surface antigen (HBsAg); HCV antibody, viral load and genotype, and HIV antibody, was tested. RESULTS: Among the 3439 people included in the study (1528 SWs, 746 MSM, 1165 PWUD/ID) the median age was 29 years, most participants were black African (60%), and 24% reported homelessness. 82% reported substance use in the last month, including alcohol (46%) and heroin (33%). 75% were sexually active in the previous month, with condom use at last sex at 74%.

The loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrated that ATF3 positively regulated tert-butyl hydroperoxide- (TBHP-) induced nucleus pulposus cell (NPC) FAoptosis, ROS production, inflammatory response, and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Furthermore, silencing ATF3 ameliorated the progression of IDD in vivo, whereas its overexpression showed the opposite phenotype. Bioinformatics analysis and molecular experiments corroborated that ATF3 is a direct target of miR-874-3p, suggesting that the upregulation of ATF3 in IDD might be caused at least in part due to the downregulation of miR-874-3p in IDD, thereby relieving the inhibition of ATF3 by miR-874-3p. The findings revealed that ATF3 has the potential to be used as a promising therapeutic target against IDD.","output":"Silencing ATF3 Might Delay TBHP-Induced Intervertebral Disc Degeneration by Repressing NPC Ferroptosis, Apoptosis, and ECM Degradation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On the 11 (th) of March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a global pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Data regarding the immunogenicity of anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 messenger RNA (anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA) vaccines in dialysis patients were published recently. We assessed the immunogenicity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in dialysis patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred-nine patients on hemodialysis (n = 85) or peritoneal dialysis (n = 24) have received two injections of 30-g doses of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), that were administered intramuscularly 28 days apart. Those who were still seronegative after the second dose were given a third dose one month later. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were tested before and after vaccination. RESULTS: Ninety-one out of the 102 patients who had at least a one-month follow-up after the second (n = 97) or the third (n = 5) vaccine doses had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroconversion rate was 88.7% (86 out of 97 patients) among SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patients at the initiation of vaccination. Receiving immunosuppressive therapy was an independent predictive factor for non-response to vaccination. CONCLUSION: Due to high immunogenicity and safety of mRNA vaccines, we strongly recommend prioritizing a two-doses vaccination of dialysis patients. A third dose can be required in non-responders to two doses. When possible, patients waiting for a kidney transplantation, should be offered the vaccine before transplantation.","output":"High immunogenicity of a messenger RNA based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in chronic dialysis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobial agents have become an essential tool in controlling the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and guidelines on their use have been issued by various public health agencies. Through its Emerging Viral Pathogen Guidance for Antimicrobial Pesticides, the US Environmental Protection Agency has approved numerous surface disinfectant products for use against SARS-CoV-2. Despite their widespread use and range of associated health hazards, the majority of active ingredients in antimicrobial products, such as surface disinfectants, lack established occupational exposure limits (OELs) to assist occupational health professionals in characterizing risks from exposures to these chemicals. Based on established approaches from various organizations, a framework for deriving OELs specific to antimicrobial agents was developed that relies on a weight-of-evidence evaluation of the available data. This framework involves (1) a screening-level toxicological assessment based on a review of the existing literature and recommendations, (2) identification of the critical adverse effect(s) and dose-response relationship(s), (3) identification of alternative health-based exposure limits (HBELs), (4) derivation of potential OELs based on identified points of departure and uncertainty factors and/or modification of existing alternative HBELs, and (5) selection of an appropriate OEL. To demonstrate the use of this framework, a case study is described for selection of an OEL for a disinfectant product containing quaternary ammonium compounds (quats). Three potential OELs were derived for this product based on irritation toxicity data, developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) data, and modification of an existing HBEL. The final selected OEL for the quats-containing product was 0.1 mg/m3, derived from modification of an existing HBEL. This value represented the lowest resulting value of the three approaches, and thus, was considered protective of irritation and potential DART.","output":"Setting occupational exposure limits for antimicrobial agents: A case study based on a quaternary ammonium compound-based disinfectant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 presentation may include a profound increase in cytokines and associated pneumonia, rapidly progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This so-called cytokine storm often leads to refractory edema, respiratory arrest, and death. At present, anti-IL-6, antiviral therapy, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin among others are being investigated as potential treatments for COVID-19. As the disease etiology and precise therapeutic interventions are still not definitively defined, we wanted to review the roles that complement and the contact system may have in either the treatment or pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: We searched the recent literature (PubMed) on complement and coronavirus; contact system and coronavirus; bradykinin and coronavirus; and angiotensin receptor and coronavirus. The manuscript complies with ethics guidelines and was deemed exempt from institutional review board approval according to Human Subjects Protection Office guidelines. RESULTS: Mouse models are available for the study of coronavirus and complement. Although complement is effective in protecting against many viruses, it does not seem to be protective against coronavirus. C3 knockout mice infected with SARS-CoV had less lung disease than wild-type mice, suggesting that complement may play a role in coronavirus pathogenesis. Some evidence suggests that the observed pulmonary edema may be bradykinin-induced and could be the reason that corticosteroids, antihistamines, and other traditional interventions for edema are not effective. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and studies thus far have not concluded a benefit or risk associated with the use of either ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Activation of complement and the contact system, through generation of bradykinin, may play a role in the SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary edema, and our search suggests that further work is necessary to confirm our suspicions.","output":"A Review: Does Complement or the Contact System Have a Role in Protection or Pathogenesis of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cloning and sequencing of anEco RI-Pst I fragment derived from the replicative form of a canine parvovirus (CPV) vaccine strain are reported.

The overarching goal of this study is to conduct an empirical analysis to quantify the impact of shared e-scooters on bus ridership using Louisville, Kentucky, as a case study conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. To assess if shared e-scooters decrease or increase bus ridership, this study evaluated more than half a million shared e-scooters trips, and estimated several daily, weekly, and monthly fixed effects regression models of route level bus ridership. The results of the preferred fixed effect regression models indicate that shared e-scooters do not have a significant impact on local bus ridership. However, the model results suggest that shared e-scooters could potentially complement express bus routes as they serve the first/last mile of a trip, but further research on express routes is recommended.

METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from 2335 adults weighted to be representative of the NYC population. We measured exposures to lifetime interpersonal racial discrimination in nine domains using a modified version of the Experiences of Discrimination scale.

RESULTS: Overall, 47% [95% CI 44.5, 50.3] of respondents reported having experienced racial discrimination in at least one domain. In the overall population, significant associations with racial discrimination were noted in adjusted models for poor physical health, poor mental health, and limitations by poor physical and mental health. Among those exposed to racial discrimination, the risk of experiencing poor mental health was lower among those who had contact with family or friends outside their household at least once a week, compared with those who had less frequent social contact.

However, some chickens are resistant to the disease. This study aimed at evaluating the mechanisms behind HPAIV disease resistance. Chickens of different breeds were challenged with H7N1 HPAIV or clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 HPAIV, euthanized at 3 days post-inoculation (dpi), and classified as resistant or susceptible depending on the following criteria: chickens that presented i) clinical signs, ii) histopathological lesions, and iii) presence of HPAIV antigen in tissues were classified as susceptible, while chickens lacking all these criteria were classified as resistant. Once classified, we performed RNA-Seq from lung and spleen samples in order to compare the transcriptomic signatures between resistant and susceptible chickens. We identified minor transcriptomic changes in resistant chickens in contrast with huge alterations observed in susceptible chickens. Interestingly, six differentially expressed genes were downregulated in resistant birds and upregulated in susceptible birds. Some of these genes belong to the NF-kappa B and/or mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Among these six genes, the serine protease-encoding gene PLAU was of particular interest, being the most significantly downregulated gene in resistant chickens. Expression levels of this protease were further validated by RT-qPCR in a larger number of experimentally infected chickens. Furthermore, HPAIV quasi-species populations were constructed using 3 dpi oral swabs. No substantial changes were found in the viral segments that interact with the innate immune response and with the host cell receptors, reinforcing the role of the immune system of the host in the clinical outcome. Altogether, our results suggest that an early inactivation of important host genes could prevent an exaggerated immune response and/or viral replication, conferring resistance to HPAIV in chickens.","output":"Dual Host and Pathogen RNA-Seq Analysis Unravels Chicken Genes Potentially Involved in Resistance to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS The use of neoadjuvant long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCRT), shorter distal safety margins (DSMs) and stapled or intersphincteric resections has increased sphincter preservation rates.

RESULTS: Of the 1248 inpatients included, 487 (39%) experienced AKI (51% stage 1, 13% stage 2, and 36% stage 3). The weekly AKI incidence rate gradually increased to peak at week 5 (3.12 cases/100 patient-days), before reducing to its nadir (0.83 cases/100 patient-days) at the end the study period (week 10). Among AKI survivors, 84.0% had recovered renal function to pre-admission levels before discharge and none required on-going renal replacement therapy (RRT). Pre-existing renal impairment [odds ratio (OR) 3.05, 95%CI 2.24C4,18; p < 0.0001], and inpatient diuretic use (OR 1.79, 95%CI 1.27C2.53; p < 0.005) were independently associated with a higher risk for AKI. AKI was a strong predictor of 30-day mortality with an increasing risk across AKI stages [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.59 (95%CI 1.19C2.13) for stage 1; p < 0.005, 2.71(95%CI 1.82C4.05); p < 0.001for stage 2 and 2.99 (95%CI 2.17C4.11); p < 0.001for stage 3].

Its metabolites, specifically retinoic acid (RA), are crucial for cell differentiation, including adipogenesis. Retinol binding protein 7 (Rbp7) is under the control of PPAR?3, the master regulator of adipogenesis. However, the role of RBP7 in adipogenesis is unclear. Our study showed that Rbp7 was abundantly expressed in white and brown mouse adipose tissues and had a higher expression in adipocytes than in stromal vascular fraction. Rbp7 overexpression promoted 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation with increased triglyceride accumulation and up-regulation of Ppar?3, Fabp4, C/ebp, and AdipoQ. Rbp7 deficient adipocytes had opposite effects of the overexpression, which were rescued by RA supplementation. Indirect assessment of relative nuclear RA levels using RAR response element (RARE)-Luc reporter assay demonstrated that Rbp7 overexpression significantly increased RARE-Luc reporter activity. Rbp7 overexpression significantly increased expression of Raldh1, responsible for RA production, and up-regulation of Lrat and Cyp26a1, involved in retinol storage and RA catabolism, respectively, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Rbp7 deficient adipocytes had opposite effects of the overexpression of those genes involved in retinol metabolism. These data suggest that RBP7 increases transcriptional activity of RARE that may induce negative feedback responses via regulation of the gene expression for retinol homeostasis. Our data indicate critical RBP7 functions in adipocytes: regulation of transcriptional activity of RARE and adipocytes differentiation, potentially providing a new target for obesity therapy.","output":"Retinol Binding Protein 7 Promotes Adipogenesis in vitro and Regulates Expression of Genes Involved in Retinol Metabolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This reflective piece, written by a woman with an eating disorder aims to identify the impact of COVID-19 on persons living with eating disorders and provide a social justice approach as a resolution The author identifies that eating disorder behaviors may be the only coping tool available for many persons with eating disorders during this time of uncertainty While she acknowledges the risks associated with eating disorder behaviors, she identifies that this time of uncertainty may be a time to embrace harm-reduction in approaching the health and wellness of persons with eating disorders","output":"COVID19, the pandemic which may exemplify a need for harm-reduction approaches to eating disorders: a reflection from a person living with an eating disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is overwhelming global healthcare delivery systems due to the exponential spike in cases requiring specialty tests, facilities and equipment, including complex, precision devices like ventilators.

These options vary considerably in the theoretical approaches and techniques applied, their intensity and duration, settings, the person/s delivering supports and the training they require. Early interventions are a significant contributor to total autism-related costs in Western countries, but only in the last 10-20 years has there been adequate outcome data to enable the comparison of different interventions' cost-effectiveness. This protocol describes a scoping review to better understand what economic evaluations have been completed in this field, and the methods used to date. METHODS We will systematically search the following databases from their inception to 2021 for eligible studies: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Econlit, PEDE, NHS EED and HTA. Full economic evaluations of any types of early intervention for children with autism prior to school entry will be included. Two reviewers will screen the studies, extract the data and assess the study quality using established checklists. The risk of bias will be assessed using the extended CHEC-list for all studies and, additionally, the Philips checklist for modelled studies. Quality of reporting will be assessed using the CHEERS checklist. A narrative synthesis will be completed to collate the findings, describe the methods used and identify which interventions have been researched from an economic perspective. DISCUSSION This review will provide researchers, policymakers and service providers with current information about the economic evidence for early interventions for young children with autism and point to priorities for further research. It will inform future economic evaluations by highlighting the gaps or inconsistencies in the methods used to date. Limitations of the review will be acknowledged and discussed.

They can crystallize into ice, NaCl, or NaCl  2H2O depending on the temperature-concentration conditions. These crystallization transitions have important implications in geology, cryopreservation, or atmospheric science. Computer simulations can help understand the crystallization of these solids, which requires a detailed knowledge of the equilibrium phase diagram. We use molecular simulations in which we put at contact the solution with the solid of interest to determine points of the solid-solution coexistence lines. We follow two different approaches, one in which we narrow down the melting temperature for a given concentration and the other in which we equilibrate the concentration for a given temperature, obtaining consistent results. The phase diagram thus calculated for the selected model (TIP4P/2005 for water molecules and Joung-Cheatham for the ions) correctly predicts coexistence between the solution and ice. We were only able to determine NaCl  2H2O-solution coexistence points at higher temperatures and concentrations than in the experiment, so we could not establish a direct comparison in this case. On the other hand, the model underestimates the concentration of the solution in equilibrium with the NaCl solid. Our results, alongside other literature evidence, seem to indicate that ion-ion interactions are too strong in the model. Our work is a good starting point for the improvement of the potential model and for the study of the nucleation kinetics of the solid phases involved in the phase diagram.","output":"Phase diagram of the NaCl-water system from computer simulations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study objective assessed the energy demand and economic cost of two hospital-based COVID-19 infection control interventions: negative pressure (NP) treatment rooms and xenon pulsed ultraviolet (XP-UV) equipment.

The NP intervention was applied to 11, 22, and 44 rooms for small, medium, and large hospitals, while the XP-UV equipment was used eight, nine, and ten hours a day. For small, medium, and large hospitals, the annum kWh for NP rooms were 116,700 kWh, 332,530 kWh, 795,675 kWh, which correspond to annum energy costs of $11,845 ($1,077/room), $33,752 ($1,534/room), and $80,761 ($1,836/room). For XP-UV, the annum-kilowatt-hours (and costs) were 438 ($45), 493 ($50), and 548 ($56) for small, medium, and large hospitals. While energy efficiencies may be expected for the large hospital, the hospital contained more energy-intensive use rooms (ICUs) which resulted in higher operational and energy costs.

Aldose reductase (ALR2) is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of sorbitol in the metabolism of glucose via polyols in diabetic patients and leads to a group of diabetic complications: cataracts, retinopathies, neuropathies, and nephropathies. Introduction: Inhibitors of this enzyme are therapeutic targets for the prophylaxis and treatment of these conditions. The aim of this work was to identify flavonoids isolated from medicinal plants, fruits, and vegetables as potential inhibitors of ALR2. Methods: In this study, using the MATLAB numerical computation system and the molecular descriptors implemented in the DRAGON software, a regression tree was developed, with an R-2 of 0.953 and adequate parameters for its fit. Results: The model was validated to take into account internal and external validation procedures. Besides, the applicability domain was determined to guarantee the reliability of the predictions. Due to its good predictive power (R-ext(2) = 0.949), the model was used to predict the inhibition of ALR2 by flavonoids reported in dietary sources. The most promising flavonoids are Myricetin and Tricin (pIC(50) predicted = 7.296), which are within the application domain and meet drug-like properties for oral administration. Conclusion: Finally, we can conclude that the proposed tools are useful for the rapid and economical identification of flavonoid-based potential drug candidates against ALR2 in diabetic complications.","output":"Computational Modeling of Aldose Reductase Inhibitory Activity of Flavonoids Derivatives for Diabetic Complications Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Emergency departments (ED) globally are addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with varying degrees of success.

METHODS: We electronically surveyed EMERGE and non-EMERGE EDs from April 3CJune 1, 2020 on ED capacity, pandemic preparedness plans, triage methods, staffing, supplies, and communication practices. The survey was available in English, Mandarin Chinese, and Spanish to optimize participation. We analyzed survey responses using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 74/129 (57%) EDs from 28 countries in all six World Health Organization global regions responded. Most EDs were in Asia (49%), followed by North America (28%), and Europe (14%). Nearly all EDs (97%) developed and implemented protocols for screening, testing, and treating patients with suspected COVID-19 infections. Sixty percent responded that provider staffing/back-up plans were ineffective.

As a key component of the interaction between hosts and parasites, it has crucial implications for the fitness of both. Here, we review the transmission dynamics of Gyrodactylus species, which are monogenean ectoparasites of teleost fishes and a prominent model for studies of parasite transmission. Particularly, we focus on the most studied hostCparasite system within this genus: guppies, Poecilia reticulata, and G. turnbulli/G. bullatarudis. Through an integrative literature examination, we identify the main variables affecting Gyrodactylus spread between hosts, and the potential factors that enhance their transmission. Previous research indicates that Gyrodactylids spread when their current conditions are unsuitable. Transmission depends on abiotic factors like temperature, and biotic variables such as gyrodactylid biology, host heterogeneity, and their interaction. Variation in the degree of social contact between hosts and sexes might also result in distinct dynamics. Our review highlights a lack of mathematical models that could help predict the dynamics of gyrodactylids, and there is also a bias to study only a few species. Future research may usefully focus on how gyrodactylid reproductive traits and host heterogeneity promote transmission and should incorporate the feedbacks between host behaviour and parasite transmission.","output":"Transmission dynamics of ectoparasitic gyrodactylids (Platyhelminthes, Monogenea): An integrative review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the value of measuring the tubule diameter during microdissection testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE) in predicting outcomes in patients with Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS).

Patients were classified into two groups on the basis of the diameter of seminiferous tubules measured against 5/0 surgical suture (100 m or <100 m). RESULTS The sperm retrieval rate (SRR) in men with a tubule diameter 100 m was significantly lower than that in those with <100 m (3.1% vs. 25.0%). The SRR from the contralateral testis in men with a tubule diameter 100 m was lower than that in those with <100 m (0% vs. 14.3%). Men with a tubule diameter 100 m had a significantly larger testis and lower follicle-stimulating hormone levels than did men with <100 m (8.1  2.4 vs. 5.31.8 mL, 19.9  9.7 vs. 25.9  7.1 mIU/mL, respectively).

We explored whether such upper airway variations in salt and water balance might alter respiratory droplet generation and potentially contribute to observed impacts of airway hydration on respiratory disease. In a randomized 4-arm study of 21 healthy human subjects we found that the breathing of humid air, the wearing of cotton masks, and the delivery of (sodium, calcium, and magnesium chloride) salt droplets sized to deposit in the nose, trachea, and main bronchi similarly reduce the exhalation of respiratory droplets by approximately 50% (P < 0.05) within 10 minutes following hydration.

The InGenius platform was compared to routine in-house NAT that was validated according to the national reference. RESULTS: Of 128 randomly selected patients, 58 (45%) tested positive and 55 (43%) tested negative in both platforms. Sensitivity of the InGenius platform was 100% (95% confidence interval 94-100). In the remaining 15 (12%) cases E and RdRp genes were not detected in both platforms but the nucleoprotein (N) gene was tested positive by the InGenius platform. All solitary N gene positive cases were confirmed by a N-gene specific in-house validated NAT, and most of these patients could also be considered positive based on other recently available COVID-19 positive respiratory samples or highly suspected radiological findings.

This pandemic has had a significant impact on patients with chronic diseases. Among patients with demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD), concerns remain about the potential impact of COVID-19 on these patients given their treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. In this study, we review the existing literature investigating the impact of disease-modifying therapies(DMT) on COVID-19 risks in this group of patients. METHOD: For this systematic review, we searched PubMed from January 1, 2020, to December 3, 2020. The following keywords were used: COVID-19 AND Multiple Sclerosis OR Neuromyelitis Optica. Articles evaluating COVID-19 in patients with demyelinating diseases of CNS were included. This study evaluates the different aspects of the DMTs in these patients during the COVID-19 era. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 262 articles were found. After eliminating duplicates and unrelated research papers, a total of 84 articles met the final inclusion criteria in our study. Overall, the experiences of 2493 MS patients and 37 NMOSD patients with COVID-19 were included in this review. Among them, 46(1.8%) MS patients died(the global death-to-case ratio of Covid-19 was reported about 2.1%). Among DMTs, Rituximab had the highest mortality rate (4%). Despite controversies, especially concerning anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapies, a relation between DMT-use and COVID-19 disease- course was not found in many studies. This observation reinforces the recommendation of not stopping current DMTs. Other variables such as age, higher expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores, cardiac comorbidities, and obesity were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. Despite the risks of infection, most patients were willing to continue their DMT during the pandemic because of more significant concern about the risk of relapse or worsening MS symptoms. After the infection, an immune response's attenuation was seen in the patients on Fingolimod and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. This may be a critical finding in future vaccinations.","output":"COVID-19 and Disease-Modifying Therapies in Patients with Demyelinating Diseases of the Central Nervous System: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones has expanded in the last decade, as their technology has become more sophisticated, and costs have decreased.

The use of drone technology in emergency medicine is especially promising given the need for a rapid response to enhance patient outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to describe some of the main current and expanding applications of drone technology in emergency medicine and to describe challenges and future opportunities. Current applications being studied include delivery of defibrillators in response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, blood and blood products in response to trauma, and rescue medications. Drones are also being studied and actively used in emergency response to search and rescue operations as well as disaster and mass casualty events.

METHODS: Consecutive newly diagnosed LC pts referred to 25 Italian Oncology Departments between March and December 2020 were included. Access rate and temporal intervals between date of symptoms onset and diagnostic and therapeutic services were compared to the same period in 2019. Differences between the two years were analyzed using chi-square test for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. RESULTS: A slight reduction (-6.9%) in newly diagnosed LC cases was observed in 2020 compared with 2019 (1523 vs 1637, p=0.09). Newly LC pts in 2020 were more likely to be diagnosed with stage IV disease (p<0.01) and to be current smokers (p<0.01). The drop in terms of new diagnoses was greater in the lockdown period (percentage drop -12% vs -3.2%) compared to the other months included.

Although call centers can facilitate such communication, no published reports describing their outcomes exist. In advance of the expected COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, the Israel Center for Disease Control established a call center dedicated to queries from healthcare professionals. METHODS: The call center operated from February 5, 2020 (week 6) to May 14, 2020 (week 20). Data on calls received, including date and time, caller characteristics, questions and responses were recorded in a database designed for this purpose. The volume, sources and content of queries were analyzed. RESULTS: In 15 weeks of operation, the call center responded to 6623 calls. The daily number of calls ranged from 1 to 371 (mean 79.8, median 40), peaking on week 12, 2 weeks prior to a peak in new COVID-19 cases. Callers were predominantly physicians (62.4%), nurses (18.7%) and administrators (4.4%). Most worked in primary care clinics (74.2%) or hospitals (8.7%). Among physicians, 42.3% were family physicians or internists, and 10.0% were pediatricians. The issues most commonly addressed were home quarantine (21.6%), criteria for suspected cases (20.6%), and SARS-CoV2 testing (14.1%). Twenty-five percent of questions involved requests for clarifications of MOH guidelines regarding travel restrictions, clinic management, triage of symptomatic patients, routine medical and dental care, recommended precautions for health care workers with preexisting medical conditions, and other matters. A total of 119 queries were not resolved on the basis of existing guidelines and were referred to MOH headquarters. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a call center established to serve the needs of healthcare providers seeking guidance on COVID-19 management, and to facilitate communication of providers concerns to the central health authority. Our work indicates that a central call center for healthcare providers can facilitate the development, implementation and amendment of guidelines and should be an integral element of the early response to public health emergencies. Real-time analysis of the call data may reveal important trends requiring prompt attention.

METHODS: This study compared the data on knee and hip arthroplasty procedures from 2 hospitals (primary and revision) conducted in two periods: the period of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland (from 4 March 2020 to 15 October 2020) and the corresponding period prior to the pandemic (from 4 March 2019 to 15 October 2019). We compared the epidemiological data, demographic data, and hospital stay duration data from these two periods. RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrated that the total number of hip arthroplasties conducted in 2020 decreased by 26% in comparison with 2019. In the case of knee arthroplasties, the total number of procedures in the evaluated period in 2020 decreased by 44%. Our study also showed that the mean time of hospital stay for orthopedic patients following hip or knee arthroplasty was 22.87% shorter. The female-to-male patient ratio decreased between the analyzed periods, and this was 22.96% lower during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic in these two hospitals in Poland led to reduced numbers of hip and knee replacement procedures, shorter hospital stays, and a decreased female-to-male patient ratio.

Hematologic and cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19 causes thromboembolic events across multiple organs which mainly manifest as venous thromboembolism, and rarely, peripheral arterial thromboembolic events. In-situ thrombosis of a healthy, non-atherosclerotic native artery is rare, and COVID-19 has been reported to be a cause of this phenomenon. We aimed to report our institutional experience with COVID-19 patients who developed acute limb ischemia (ALI) during hospitalization or after discharge. METHODS: This was a single-center cross-sectional study. Records of all patients &#8805;18 years of age admitted to a tertiary center with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection between September 1 and December 31, 2020 were retrospectively examined. Data regarding patient demographics, co-morbidities and outcomes were collected. Patients were followed-up during index hospitalization and for 30 days postdischarge. Acute limb ischemia was diagnosed by means of duplex ultrasound and computed tomography angiography in the presence of a clinical suspicion. RESULTS: A total of 681 consecutive patients (38.5% women) were hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period. Median age was 63 years (IQR, 52-74). In-hospital mortality occurred in 94 (13.8%) patients. Ninety (13.2%) patients required intensive care unit admission at some point of their hospital stay. Six (0.9%) patients (one woman) with a median age of 62 years experienced ALI (IQR, 59-64.3). All patients were receiving low molecular weight heparin when they developed ALI. The median of duration between COVID-19 diagnosis and ALI symptom onset was 13 days (IQR, 11.3-14). Three patients underwent emergent surgical thrombectomy combined with systemic anticoagulation, and 3 received systemic anticoagulation alone. Two patients with ALI did not survive to hospital discharge. Among survivors, 1 patient underwent bilateral major amputations, and another underwent a minor amputation within 1 month of hospital discharge. Symptoms of ALI completely resolved in 2 patients without sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a multisystemic disorder with involvement of hematologic and cardiovascular systems. Despite widespread use of thromboprophylaxis, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of ALI, and subsequent limb loss or even death.","output":"Acute Limb Ischemia in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Covid-19 causes a wide range of symptoms in patients, ranging from mild manifestations to severe disease and death. This study assessed the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and associated factors of Covid-19 patients using primary data from confirmed cases in South Central Ethiopia. METHODS: We employed a facility-based, cross-sectional study design and conducted the study at the Bokoji Hospital Covid-19 treatment centre. A structured questionnaire and the EQ-5D-3L scale were used to collect the data for analysis. The HRQOL results measured by the EQ-5D-3L tool were converted to a health state utility (HSU) using the Zimbabwe tariff. The average health utility index and HSUCvisual analogue scale across diverse sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were compared using the MannCWhitney U test or KruskalCWallis test. We employed a multiple linear regression to examine factors associated with HSU values simultaneously. The data were analysed using STATA version 15. RESULTS: The overall mean HSU score from the EQ-5D was 0.688 (SD: 0.285), and the median was 0.787 (IQR 0.596, 0.833). The mean HSU from the visual analogue scale score was 0.69 (SD: 0.129), with a median of 0.70 (IQR 0.60, 0.80). Those who received dexamethasone and intranasal oxygen supplement, those with comorbidity, those older than 55 years and those with a hospital stay of more than 15 days had significantly lower HSU scores than their counterparts (p < .001). CONCLUSION: Covid-19 substantially impaired the HRQOL of patients in Ethiopia, especially among elderly patients and those with comorbidity. Therefore, clinical follow-up and psychological treatment should be encouraged for these groups. Moreover, the health utility values from this study can be used to evaluate quality adjusted life years for future cost-effectiveness analyses of prevention and treatment interventions against Covid-19.","output":"Evaluation of health-related quality of life of Covid-19 patients: a hospital-based study in South Central Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims The presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and high levels of viral RNA in the stool suggest active Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication within enterocytes.

Infection in humans results in a variety of outcomes ranging from asymptomatic cases to the disease COVID-19, which can have significant morbidity and mortality, with over two million confirmed deaths worldwide as of January 2021. Over a year into the pandemic, sequencing analysis has shown that variants of SARS-CoV-2 are being selected as the virus continues to circulate widely within the human population. The predominant drivers of genetic variation within SARS-CoV-2 are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) caused by polymerase error, potential host factor driven RNA modification, and insertion/deletions (indels) resulting from the discontinuous nature of viral RNA synthesis. While many mutations represent neutral genetic drift or have quickly died out, a subset may be affecting viral traits such as transmissibility, pathogenicity, host range, and antigenicity of the virus. In this review, we summarise the current extent of genetic change in SARS-CoV-2, particularly recently emerging variants of concern, and consider the phenotypic consequences of this viral evolution that may impact the future trajectory of the pandemic.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 one year on: evidence for ongoing viral adaptation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the present study is to investigate the incidence, characteristics and outcomes of patients who were readmitted to hospital emergency departments or required re\\\\hospitalisation following an index hospitalisation with a diagnosis of COVID\\\\19.

We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in patients with cancer. METHODS: For this prospective observational study, we recruited patients with cancer and healthy controls (mostly health-care workers) from three London hospitals between Dec 8, 2020, and Feb 18, 2021. Participants who were vaccinated between Dec 8 and Dec 29, 2020, received two 30 g doses of BNT162b2 administered intramuscularly 21 days apart; patients vaccinated after this date received only one 30 g dose with a planned follow-up boost at 12 weeks. Blood samples were taken before vaccination and at 3 weeks and 5 weeks after the first vaccination. Where possible, serial nasopharyngeal real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) swab tests were done every 10 days or in cases of symptomatic COVID-19. The coprimary endpoints were seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in patients with cancer following the first vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine and the effect of vaccine boosting after 21 days on seroconversion. All participants with available data were included in the safety and immunogenicity analyses. Ongoing follow-up is underway for further blood sampling after the delayed (12-week) vaccine boost. This study is registered with the NHS Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales (REC ID 20/HRA/2031). FINDINGS: 151 patients with cancer (95 patients with solid cancer and 56 patients with haematological cancer) and 54 healthy controls were enrolled. For this interim data analysis of the safety and immunogenicity of vaccinated patients with cancer, samples and data obtained up to March 19, 2021, were analysed. After exclusion of 17 patients who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (detected by either antibody seroconversion or a positive rRT-PCR COVID-19 swab test) from the immunogenicity analysis, the proportion of positive anti-S IgG titres at approximately 21 days following a single vaccine inoculum across the three cohorts were 32 (94%; 95% CI 81-98) of 34 healthy controls; 21 (38%; 26-51) of 56 patients with solid cancer, and eight (18%; 10-32) of 44 patients with haematological cancer. 16 healthy controls, 25 patients with solid cancer, and six patients with haematological cancer received a second dose on day 21. Of the patients with available blood samples 2 weeks following a 21-day vaccine boost, and excluding 17 participants with evidence of previous natural SARS-CoV-2 exposure, 18 (95%; 95% CI 75-99) of 19 patients with solid cancer, 12 (100%; 76-100) of 12 healthy controls, and three (60%; 23-88) of five patients with haematological cancers were seropositive, compared with ten (30%; 17-47) of 33, 18 (86%; 65-95) of 21, and four (11%; 4-25) of 36, respectively, who did not receive a boost. The vaccine was well tolerated; no toxicities were reported in 75 (54%) of 140 patients with cancer following the first dose of BNT162b2, and in 22 (71%) of 31 patients with cancer following the second dose. Similarly, no toxicities were reported in 15 (38%) of 40 healthy controls after the first dose and in five (31%) of 16 after the second dose. Injection-site pain within 7 days following the first dose was the most commonly reported local reaction (23 [35%] of 65 patients with cancer; 12 [48%] of 25 healthy controls). No vaccine-related deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: In patients with cancer, one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine yields poor efficacy. Immunogenicity increased significantly in patients with solid cancer within 2 weeks of a vaccine boost at day 21 after the first dose. These data support prioritisation of patients with cancer for an early (day 21) second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine.

Consultation-liaison psychiatrists are actively involved in managing these patients and should familiarize themselves with how the virus and its proposed treatments can affect psychotropic management. The only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug to treat COVID-19 is remdesivir, and other off-label medications used include chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, convalescent plasma therapy, azithromycin, vitamin C, corticosteroids, interferon, and colchicine. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the major safety considerations relevant to clinicians who prescribe psychotropics to patients with COVID-19, both related to the illness and its proposed treatments. METHODS: In this targeted review, we performed structured literature searches in PubMed to identify articles describing the impacts of COVID-19 on different organ systems, the neuropsychiatric adverse effects of treatments, and any potential drug interactions with psychotropics. The articles most relevant to this one were included. RESULTS: COVID-19 impacts multiple organ systems, including gastrointestinal, renal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunological, and hematological systems. This may lead to pharmacokinetic changes that impact psychotropic medications and increase sensitivity to psychotropic-related adverse effects. In addition, several proposed treatments for COVID-19 have neuropsychiatric effects and potential interactions with commonly used psychotropics. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the need to adjust existing psychotropics or avoid using certain medications in some patients with COVID-19. They should also be familiar with neuropsychiatric effects of medications being used to treat this disease.

COVID-19 infected case records and meteorological data in four cities (Wuhan, Beijing, Urumqi and Dalian) in China were collected. Then, the best-fitting model of COVID-19 infected cases was selected from four statistic models (Gaussian, logistic, lognormal distribution and allometric models), and the relationship between meteorological factors and COVID-19 infected cases was analyzed using multiple stepwise regression and Pearson correlation. The results showed that the lognormal distribution model was well adapted to describing the change of COVID-19 infected cases compared with other models (R(2) > 0.78; p-values < 0.001). Under the condition of implementing community-based pandemic prevention and control, relationship between COVID-19 infected cases and meteorological factors differed among the four cities. Temperature and relative humidity were mainly the driving factors on COVID-19 transmission, but their relations obviously varied with season and geographical location. In summer, the increase in relative humidity and the decrease in maximum temperature facilitate COVID-19 transmission in arid inland cities, while at this point the decrease in relative humidity is good for the spread of COVID-19 in coastal cities.

METHODS: From a public database, we randomly chose a small supervised dataset with 400 OCT images (100 choroidal neovascularization, 100 diabetic macular edema, 100 drusen, and 100 normal) and assigned all other OCT images to unsupervised dataset (107,912 images without labeling). We adopted a semi-supervised GAN and a supervised deep learning (DL) model for automatically detecting retinal disorders from OCT images. The performance of the 2 models was compared in 3 testing datasets with different OCT devices. The evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: The local validation dataset included 1000 images with 250 from each category. The independent clinical dataset included 366 OCT images using Cirrus OCT Shanghai Shibei Hospital and 511 OCT images using RTVue OCT from Xinhua Hospital respectively. The semi-supervised GANs classifier achieved better accuracy than supervised DL model (0.91 vs 0.86 for local cell validation dataset, 0.91 vs 0.86 in the Shanghai Shibei Hospital testing dataset, and 0.93 vs 0.92 in Xinhua Hospital testing dataset). For detecting urgent referrals (choroidal neovascularization and diabetic macular edema) from nonurgent referrals (drusen and normal) on OCT images, the semi-supervised GANs classifier also achieved better area under the receiver operating characteristic curves than supervised DL model (0.99 vs 0.97, 0.97 vs 0.96, and 0.99 vs 0.99, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A semi-supervised GAN can achieve better performance than that of a supervised DL model when the labeled dataset is limited.

Thirty-three telephone interviews of 1 h each were conducted with 21 board-certified chaplains to examine these and related issues. Respondents reported how they help staff, often creating, on their own, innovative kinds of practices that appear to take the form of rituals. These rituals vary in audience (physicians, nurses and/or other staff, with or without patients or families), form (from open-ended to structured), formality (from formal to informal), timing (at hospital discharge, time of death or after death), duration (from a few minutes to longer), frequency (from once to several times or ongoing), content (expressing and/or reframing feelings and experiences), and activities (e.g., talking, eating and/or making commemorative objects). Such rituals can help staff cope with death, grief, and other stresses. Challenges arise, including hospital leaders wariness, resistance or lack of support, and staff time constraints, making briefer sessions more practical.

One of the consequences of this policy is a significant change in electricity consumption patterns. Since load forecasting models rely on calendar or meteorological information and are trained on historical data, they fail to capture the significant break caused by the lockdown and have exhibited poor performances since the beginning of the pandemic. This makes the scheduling of the electricity production challenging, and has a high cost for both electricity producers and grid operators. In this paper we introduce adaptive generalized additive models using Kalman filters and fine-tuning to adjust to new electricity consumption patterns. Additionally, knowledge from the lockdown in Italy is transferred to anticipate the change of behavior in France. The proposed methods are applied to forecast the electricity demand during the French lockdown period, where they demonstrate their ability to significantly reduce prediction errors compared to traditional models. Finally expert aggregation is used to leverage the specificities of each predictions and enhance results even further.","output":"Adaptive Methods for Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting During COVID-19 Lockdown in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the current COVID-19 outbreak, a total of 112 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains sampled from China and 12 other countries with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 9 February 2020 were analyzed. We performed phylogenetic, split network, likelihood-mapping, model comparison, and phylodynamic analyses of the genomes. Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis with the best-fitting combination models, we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 to be 12 November 2019 (95 % BCI: 11 October 2019 and 09 December 2019) and 9.90  10-4 substitutions per site per year (95 % BCI: 6.29  10-4-1.35  10-3), respectively.

METHODS: The ELISA was based on serum IgG reactivity to a 46-kDa protein derived from the recombinant SARS-CoV2 nucleoprotein. Assay sensitivity was assessed using serum samples from 134 COVID-19 confirmed cases obtained > 15 days after symptom onset. Specificity was determined by testing sera from 94 healthy controls. Cross-reactivity was evaluated with sera from 96 individuals with previous dengue or zika virus-confirmed infections, with 44 sera from individuals with confirmed infections to other respiratory viruses or with bacterial and fungal infections that cause pneumonia and with 40 sera negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein by commercial ELISA kits. RESULTS: The majority of subjects were male and &#8805; 60 years old. Assay sensitivity was 90.3 % (95 % confidence interval 84.1 %-94.2 %) and specificity was 97.9 % (92.6 %-99.4 %).

MethodsWe collected COVID-19 and mental health-related tweets from the UK between March 5, 2020 and January 31, 2021 through the Twitter Streaming API. We conducted topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to examine discussions about mental health concerns. Deep learning algorithms including Face++ were used to infer the demographic characteristics (age and gender) of Twitter users who expressed mental health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. ResultsWe showed a positive correlation between COVID-19-related mental health concerns on Twitter and the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Geographic analysis showed that populated urban areas have a higher proportion of Twitter users with mental health concerns compared to England as a whole. Topic modeling showed that general concerns, COVID-19 skeptics, and Death toll were the top topics discussed in mental health-related tweets. Demographic analysis showed that middle-aged and older adults might be more likely to suffer from mental health issues or express their mental health concerns on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS Forty-one consecutive neonates and infants undergoing bypass were monitored with right + left cerebral and renal NIRS. Near-infrared spectroscopy and lactate were measured at 20 time points, from baseline 1 day preoperatively, during bypass and modified ultrafiltration (MUF; 10 minutes), until 24 hours postoperatively. Adverse events were extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)/death, prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) or length of hospital stay. RESULTS Perioperative mean renal NIRS remained higher than baseline (n = 41) as did cerebral NIRS in all undergoing biventricular repair. During bypass (n = 41), mean right and left cerebral NIRS were equal. During MUF, cerebral and renal NIRS values increased (P < .001). Cerebral NIRS and lactate inversely correlated during the first six postoperative hours. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation /death occurred in four patients, correlating with cerebral and renal NIRS below 45% (P = .030) and 40% (P = .019) at anytime, respectively, and with mean lactate levels >9.3 mmol/L in the first postoperative 24 hours (P < .001). Among survivors, renal NIRS below 30% at any time predicted a longer ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS At bypass conclusion, 10 minutes of MUF does not adversely affect cerebral or renal NIRS. Left and right cerebral NIRS are equal, so that biparietal cerebral NIRS monitoring is probably not warranted. Perioperative cerebral and renal NIRS readings, respectively, below 45% and 40% correlate with ECMO/death and renal NIRS below 30% with prolonged ICU stay.

BACKGROUND Regulatory authorities for accreditation in North America have included nontechnical skills such as communication and teamwork in the competencies to be acquired by surgical residents before graduation. Concrete recommendations regarding the training and assessment of these competencies, however, are lacking. METHODS Nonrandomized, single-blinded study using an interrupted time-series design. Eleven senior surgical residents were observed during routine cases in the operating room (OR) at baseline and post-training. The Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) rating system was used. Observers were trained in NOTSS and blinded to the study purpose. Independent of the blinded observations, a surgeon educator conducted intraoperative observations, which served as the basis for the structured debriefing and feedback intervention. The intervention was administered to participants after a set of (blinded) baseline observations had been completed. Primary outcome was nontechnical performance in the OR as measured by the NOTSS system. Secondary outcome was perceived utility as assessed by a post-training questionnaire. RESULTS Twelve senior trainees were recruited, 11 completed the study. Average NOTSS scores improved significantly from 3.2 (SD 0.37) at baseline to 3.5 (SD 0.43) post-training [t(10) = -2.55, P = 0.29].

However, it is unclear which CS patients would most benefit from long term ICM monitoring. This study aims to determine the risk factors in patients that would confer maximum benefit from ICM placement following CS. METHODS: A Columbia University Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved retrospective analysis of medical records of 125 patients with CS followed by implantation of ICM was evaluated. Univariable and multivariable time-to-event analyses were performed on demographics, hours of activity and variability (HRV), stroke location, thrombosis etiology, and CHA(2)DS(2) ? VASc score. The primary outcome was presence of ICM-detected AF defined as AF lasting at least 2 min. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five patients (mean 67.6 years  2.4 years, 60% male) were followed for at least 3 months. Twenty-two patients (18%) were found to have clinically verified detected AF; median of time to detection was 95 days. Upon univariable demographic analysis followed by multivariable Cox regression analysis, individuals with age 75 or older (HR: 3.987, p = 0.0046) or LVEF 40% and lower (HR: 3.056, p = 0.0213) had significantly higher risk of AF. Diabetics also had a lower AF detection in multivariable analysis (HR: 0.128, p = 0.0466). CONCLUSIONS: Age 75 or older and LVEF 40% were the factors on multivariable analysis that predicted AF detection. Diabetes is a possible significant factor which should be evaluated further.

The UK government announced three national lockdowns to control the spread of the coronavirus and prevent the NHS from getting overburdened with COVID-19 related attendances. Two of the most significant peaks in terms of COVID-19 related hospitalizations and COVID-19 related deaths were in Summer 2020 (corresponding to lockdown 1, which was in effect from 26th March to 26th May 2020) and early 2021 (corresponding to lockdown 3, which was in effect 6th January to 8th March 2021). During this time, a significant proportion of NHS resources was being diverted towards the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Measures were being taken to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations and reduce patient contact. These included but were not limited to measures to reduce attendances to Emergency departments, introducing telemedicine clinics, and pausing elective services. Our hospital is a Major Trauma Centre providing Tertiary Pelvic trauma service to the Greater Manchester area and the North West of England. We conducted this retrospective comparative study to compare the trends in presentation and Management of Pelvic trauma and identify trends in how these changed throughout the pandemic. We want to share these insights with our readers. Methodology We conducted a retrospective comparative study by comparing two cohorts of patients, patients presenting to the Pelvic Trauma service during Lockdown 1 and Lockdown 3 in the UK, named Group A and Group B, respectively. Data on patient demographics, injuries, and their management was identified from the Electronic Patient Record System. The data analysis was carried out with the aid of Stata/IC version 16.1. using descriptive Statistics. Results Group A contained 19 patients, with a mean age of 66.9 years. Group B contained 23 patients with a mean age of 67.4 years. There was no statistically significant difference in these patients' population demographics, injury patterns, and management (operative vs conservative). However, there was an absolute reduction in the complication rate from Group A to Group B of 17.2% (26.3% vs 9.1%). The higher complication rate during Lockdown 1 can be explained by conservatively managing Pelvic and Acetabular Fractures that would have been eligible for fixation, had COVID-19 not been a factor. Conclusions Within the limitations of our study, it appears that operatively managing a carefully selected cohort of acute Pelvic Trauma patients with proper precautions was safe and effective. It is unclear whether there was an added benefit to having a higher threshold to operate and adopting the watch-and-wait policy in Lockdown 1.

Unlike the mammalian basal mRNA decay enzymes, which largely target mRNA from the 5 and 3 end, viruses instead use endonucleases that cleave their targets internally. This is hypothesized to more rapidly inactivate mRNA while maintaining selective power, potentially though the use of a targeting motif(s). Yet, how mRNA endonuclease specificity is achieved in mammalian cells remains largely unresolved. Here, we reveal key features underlying the biochemical mechanism of target recognition and cleavage by the SOX endonuclease encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Using purified KSHV SOX protein, we reconstituted the cleavage reaction in vitro and reveal that SOX displays robust, sequence-specific RNA binding to residues proximal to the cleavage site, which must be presented in a particular structural context. The strength of SOX binding dictates cleavage efficiency, providing an explanation for the breadth of mRNA susceptibility observed in cells. Importantly, we establish that cleavage site specificity does not require additional cellular cofactors, as had been previously proposed. Thus, viral endonucleases may use a combination of RNA sequence and structure to capture a broad set of mRNA targets while still preserving selectivity.","output":"Site specific target binding controls RNA cleavage efficiency by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus endonuclease SOX"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast (PSCCB) is a rare clinical classification of breast tumors. Little is known about its clinicopathological features, prognosis and potential therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the breast. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed patients diagnosed with PSCCB in our center. All pathological slides were reviewed by an experienced pathologist to confirm the diagnosis. Furthermore, we searched the public database for patients with SCC of the breast. Then, we analyzed the clinicopathological features, treatment methods and patient outcomes. RESULTS We identified 14 patients with primary SCC of the breast in our center. Additionally, 739 patients with SCC of the breast from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database were diagnosed between 1975 and 2016. Only 453 patients who underwent surgery were included in this study. Patients from the SEER database had a more advanced tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage than patients from our center. The median overall survival (OS) of all patients was 104 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 87.2-120.8 months), and the 5-year OS was 60.8% (95% CI, 56.1%-65.5%). Most of the patients (58%) tested negative for hormonal receptor expression. Multivariate analysis showed that PORT was an independent prognostic factor for OS.

An effective vaccination regime against RV can substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of virus-like particles formed by RV VP2 and VP6 (VLP2/6), as well as that of recombinant adenovirus expressing RV VP6 (rAd), in eliciting protective immunities against RV. However, the efficacy of such prime-boost strategy, which incorporates VLP and rAd in inducing protective immunities against RV, has not been addressed. We assessed the immune effects of different regimens in mice, including rAd prime-VLP2/6 boost (rAd+VLP), VLP2/6 prime-rAd boost (VLP+rAd), rAd alone, and VLP alone. RESULTS: Mice immunized with the VLP+rAd regimen elicit stronger humoral, mucosal, and cellular immune responses than those immunized with other regimens. RV challenging experiments showed that the highest reduction (92.9%) in viral shedding was achieved in the VLP+rAd group when compared with rAd+VLP (25%), VLP alone (75%), or rAd alone (40%) treatment groups. The reduction in RV shedding in mice correlated with fecal IgG (r = 0.95773, P = 0.04227) and IgA (r = 0.96137, P = 0.038663).

Our study demonstrates that UVGI light irradiance varies significantly on different respirator angles and propose a method to decontaminate several masks at once ensuring appropriate dosage in shaded zones. An UVGI irradiator was built with internal dimensions of 69.5  55  33 cm with three 15 W UV lamps. Inside, a grating of 58  41  15 cm was placed to hold the masks. Two different flat fold respirator models were used to assess irradiance, four of model Aura 9322 3 M of dimensions 17  9  4 cm (tri-fold), and two of model SAFE 231FFP3NR (bi-fold) with dimensions 17  6  5 cm. An STN-SilverNova spectrometer was employed to verify wavelength spectrum and surface irradiance. A simulation was performed to find the irradiance pattern inside the box and the six masks placed inside. These simulations were carried out using the software DIALUX EVO 8.2. The data obtained reveal that the irradiance received inside the manufactured UVGI-irradiator depends not only on the distance between the lamps' plane and the base of the respirators but also on the orientation and shape of the masks. This point becomes relevant to assure that all the respirators inside the chamber receive the correct dosage. Irradiance over FFR surfaces depend on several factors such as distance and angle of incidence of the light source. Careful irradiance measurement and simulation can ensure reliable dosage in the whole mask surface, balancing overexposure.

Spreading of diseases has been studied extensively under the paradigm of Susceptible - Infected - Recovered - Deceased (SIRD) dynamics. Various game-theoretic approaches have also addressed disease spread, many of which consider S, I, R, and D as strategies rather than as states. Remarkably, most studies from the above approaches do not account for the distinction between the symptomatic or asymptomatic aspect of the disease. It is well-known that precautionary measures like washing hands, wearing masks and social distancing significantly mitigate the spread of many contagious diseases. Herein, we consider the adoption of such precautions as strategies and treat S, I, R, and D as states. We also attempt to capture the differences in epidemic spreading arising from symptomatic and asymptomatic diseases on various network topologies. Through extensive computer simulations, we examine that the cost of maintaining precautionary measures as well as the extent of mass testing in a population affects the final fraction of socially responsible individuals. We observe that the lack of mass testing could potentially lead to a pandemic in case of asymptomatic diseases. Network topology also seems to play an important role. We further observe that the final fraction of proactive individuals depends on the initial fraction of both infected as well as proactive individuals. Additionally, edge density can significantly influence the overall outcome. Our findings are in broad agreement with the lessons learnt from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Mass testing and proactiveness affect epidemic spreading"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic of 2003 and the influenza pandemic of 2009, many countries instituted border measures as a means of stopping or slowing the spread of disease. The measures, usually consisting of a combination of border entry/exit screening, quarantine, isolation, and communications, were resource intensive, and modeling and observational studies indicate that border screening is not effective at detecting infectious persons. Moreover, border screening has high opportunity costs, financially and in terms of the use of scarce public health staff resources during a time of high need. We discuss the border-screening experiences with SARS and influenza and propose an approach to decision-making for future pandemics. We conclude that outbreak-associated communications for travelers at border entry points, together with effective communication with clinicians and more effective disease control measures in the community, may be a more effective approach to the international control of communicable diseases.","output":"Evaluation of Border Entry Screening for Infectious Diseases in Humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study aims to understand the detrimental effects of COVID-19 pandemic on employee job insecurity and its downstream outcomes, as well as how organizations could help alleviate such harmful effects.

We also identified important organization adaptive practices responding to COVID-19 based on a preliminary interview study, and examined its role in mitigating the undesired effects of COVID-19 event strength. Results from a two-wave lagged survey study indicated that employees' perceived COVID-19 event novelty and disruption (but not criticality) were positively related to their job insecurity, which in turn was positively related to their emotional exhaustion, organizational deviance, and saving behavior.

However, alteplase also increases the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage; we aimed to determine the proportional and absolute effects of alteplase on the risks of intracerebral haemorrhage, mortality, and functional impairment in different types of patients. METHODS We used individual patient data from the Stroke Thrombolysis Trialists' (STT) meta-analysis of randomised trials of alteplase versus placebo (or untreated control) in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. We prespecified assessment of three classifications of intracerebral haemorrhage: type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage within 7 days; Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke Monitoring Study's (SITS-MOST) haemorrhage within 24-36 h (type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage with a deterioration of at least 4 points on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]); and fatal intracerebral haemorrhage within 7 days. We used logistic regression, stratified by trial, to model the log odds of intracerebral haemorrhage on allocation to alteplase, treatment delay, age, and stroke severity. We did exploratory analyses to assess mortality after intracerebral haemorrhage and examine the absolute risks of intracerebral haemorrhage in the context of functional outcome at 90-180 days. FINDINGS Data were available from 6756 participants in the nine trials of intravenous alteplase versus control. Alteplase increased the odds of type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage (occurring in 231 [68%] of 3391 patients allocated alteplase vs 44 [13%] of 3365 patients allocated control; odds ratio [OR] 555 [95% CI 401-770]; absolute excess 55% [46-64]); of SITS-MOST haemorrhage (124 [37%] of 3391 vs 19 [06%] of 3365; OR 667 [411-1084]; absolute excess 31% [24-38]); and of fatal intracerebral haemorrhage (91 [27%] of 3391 vs 13 [04%] of 3365; OR 714 [398-1279]; absolute excess 23% [17-29]). However defined, the proportional increase in intracerebral haemorrhage was similar irrespective of treatment delay, age, or baseline stroke severity, but the absolute excess risk of intracerebral haemorrhage increased with increasing stroke severity: for SITS-MOST intracerebral haemorrhage the absolute excess risk ranged from 15% (08-26%) for strokes with NIHSS 0-4 to 37% (21-63%) for NIHSS 22 or more (p=00101). For patients treated within 45 h, the absolute increase in the proportion (68% [40% to 95%]) achieving a modified Rankin Scale of 0 or 1 (excellent outcome) exceeded the absolute increase in risk of fatal intracerebral haemorrhage (22% [15% to 30%]) and the increased risk of any death within 90 days (09% [-14% to 32%]). INTERPRETATION Among patients given alteplase, the net outcome is predicted both by time to treatment (with faster time increasing the proportion achieving an excellent outcome) and stroke severity (with a more severe stroke increasing the absolute risk of intracerebral haemorrhage). Although, within 45 h of stroke, the probability of achieving an excellent outcome with alteplase treatment exceeds the risk of death, early treatment is especially important for patients with severe stroke.

We analysed donor turnout during the COVID-19 period descriptively and using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 7122 people that responded to the survey, 1205 (169%) blood donors were identified, with 338% donating during the first 4-5 months of the COVID-19 period. We observed that around half of donors donated less than normal. The vast majority of donors that did donate made a special effort to do so in response to COVID-19. The majority of donors were also not aware of their blood being tested for COVID-19 antibodies. Although the perceived risk of infection among all respondents whilst donating blood was relatively low, those who anticipated a high risk of infection were much less likely to donate (OR = 0540; P-value = 0006). Furthermore, those that were adherent to COVID guidelines were also less likely to donate (OR = 0583; P-value = 0000). DISCUSSION: We suggest that blood collection services consider specialist campaigns that focus on the altruistic motivation of donors during the crisis and that they continue to communicate the additional safety measures in place with the aim of reducing the fear of infection whilst donating blood.","output":"Blood donation in times of crisis: Early insight into the impact of COVID-19 on blood donors and their motivation to donate across European countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules play important roles in many biological processes including gene expression and regulation, their secondary structures have been the focus of many recent studies.

Second, our objective was to assess the way shipping alliances have impacted the ranking of these ports during COVID-19. As a result, this exceptional crisis has not been a catalyst of a new port hierarchy while it has revealed contrasting situations with poor and good crisis resilience for ports meaning that some were downgraded, and others maintained their ranking.

As there is no effective therapy or vaccine yet, rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures such as isolation and quarantine remains the most effective tool to control the outbreak. When an asymptomatic individual with COVID-19 exposure is being quarantined, it is necessary to perform temperature and symptom surveillance. As such surveillance is intermittent in nature and highly dependent on self-discipline, it has limited effectiveness. Advances in biosensor technologies made it possible to continuously monitor physiological parameters using wearable biosensors with a variety of form factors. OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of using wearable biosensors to continuously monitor multidimensional physiological parameters for early detection of COVID-19 clinical progression. METHOD: This randomised controlled open-labelled trial will involve 200-1000 asymptomatic subjects with close COVID-19 contact under mandatory quarantine at designated facilities in Hong Kong. Subjects will be randomised to receive a remote monitoring strategy (intervention group) or standard strategy (control group) in a 1:1 ratio during the 14 day-quarantine period. In addition to fever and symptom surveillance in the control group, subjects in the intervention group will wear wearable biosensors on their arms to continuously monitor skin temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation and daily activities. These physiological parameters will be transferred in real time to a smartphone application called Biovitals Sentinel.

A key question is whether the landscape of clinical research has also changed. Methods In a retrospective cohort study, we examined the association of the COVID-19 outbreak with new clinical trial activations. Trial data for all interventional and observational oncology, cardiovascular, and mental health studies from January, 2015 through September, 2020 were obtained from clinicaltrials.gov. An interrupted time-series analysis with Poisson regression was used. Results We examined 62,252 trial activations. During the initial COVID-19 outbreak (February, 2020 through May, 2020), model-estimated monthly trial activations for U.S.-based studies were only 57% of the expected estimate had the pandemic not occurred (relative risk = 0.57, 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.61, p<.001). For non-U.S.-based studies, the impact of the pandemic was less dramatic (relative risk = 0.77, 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.82, p<.001), resulting in an overall 27% reduction in the relative risk of new trial activations for U.S.-based trials compared to non-U.S.-based trials (relative risk ratio = 0.73, 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.81, p<.001). Although a rebound occurred in the initial reopening phase (June, 2020 through September, 2020), the rebound was weaker for U.S.-based studies compared to non-U.S. based studies (relative risk ratio = 0.87, 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.95, p<.001). ConclusionsThese findings are consistent with the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths during the initial phase of the pandemic in the U.S. Reduced activation of cancer clinical trials will likely slow the pace of clinical research and new drug discovery, with long-term negative consequences for cancer patients.

PATIENTS: All hospitalized pediatric patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 as of May 4, 2020, were included. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received therapies including hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, tocilizumab, and convalescent serum and were managed according to an institutional algorithm based on evidence available at the time of presentation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 407 children tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 at our hospital, 24 were positive, and 19 required hospitalization. Seven (36.8%) were critically ill in ICU, and four (21%) required mechanical ventilation. Hospitalized children were predominantly male (14, 74%) and African-American or Hispanic (14, 74%), with a bimodal distribution of ages among young children less than or equal to 2 years old (8, 42%) and older adolescents ages 15C18 (6, 32%). Five of seven (71.4%) of critically ill patients were African-American (n = 3) or Hispanic (n = 2).

An open-ended questionnaire in the form of a Discourse Completion Task (DCT) is used to elicit responses from the participants. Besides, a focus group interview is conducted to support the data analysis. The data are coded based on Limberg's (2009) model of impoliteness and threat responses to figure out the strategies used by the learners. Blum-Kulka, House, and Kasper's (1989) taxonomy of mitigators is adapted to analyze the mitigators. Overall, the findings reveal that the preferred responses surpass those which indicate dispreference by the learners. They tend to use face-saving acts when they comply with the threatener's demand and opt for face-threatening acts when they reject that demand indirectly. Moreover, these learners use mitigators to attenuate the illocutionary force of their responses. Finally, this study provides some recommendations and pedagogical implications.","output":"Impoliteness and Threat Responses in an Iraqi-Kurdish EFL Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Yangtze River Delta white goat, hypermethylation of CMTM3 leads to a decreased expression level in high quality brush hair. However, the regulation of CMTM3 expression and its function in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the regulation of CMTM3 expression, function, and molecular mechanism in HFSCs. The re-expression of CMTM3 significantly suppressed the proliferation of HFSCs by inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis. Moreover, the downregulation of CMTM3 promoted HFSC proliferation. Treatment with sh_CMTM3 and incubation in a DHT culture medium had the most significant growth-promoting effect. It was hypothesized that transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in samples would enable the identification of unique protein-coding and non-coding genes that may help uncover the role of CMTM3. Multiple genes and pathways were involved in this process, including 168 common DEGs, such as CXCL8 and E-selectin, which is reportedly involved in multiple regulatory pathways. These results indicated that CMTM3 can function as HFSCs through the induction of a G1 cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis by mediating crosstalk between several pathways and transcription factors.

DG is strictly connected with Disgust Sensitivity and plays a key role in the development and maintenance of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Previous studies investigated how DG affects responses to hypothetical moral dilemmas, however how DG and Disgust Sensitivity interact modulating moral behavior is still unknown. METHODS: STUDY 1. 46 healthy participants performed an ecological paradigm in which people can spontaneously decide to lie to obtain a reward (egoistic lie) or give it away (altruistic lie) after three emotional inductions: DG, AG or neutral. Furthermore, OCD traits, Morality, Guilt Propensity and Disgust Sensitivity were assessed by means of questionnaires. STUDY 2. 27 participants from the original sample were retested during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy to ascertain whether the pandemic modified traits related to morality, disgust, guilt or OCD symptoms and whether these changes modulated moral behavior (measured by a task in which cheating was associated to higher pay-offs). RESULTS: STUDY 1. Compared to the neutral, after the DG induction participants produced less altruistic and more egoistic lies. This effect was stronger in participants with high Disgust Sensitivity. STUDY 2. During the COVID-19 lockdown participants became more sensitive to the Authority pillar of the Moral Foundations and more sensitive to Disgust: this increment in deontological morality affected (im) moral behavior depending on changes in Disgust Sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that people with high Disgust Sensitivity are more affected by deontological inductions which translate to higher immorality, supposedly by lowering their moral self-image. These results might have important clinical implications as they suggest that addressing Disgust Sensitivity in therapy, might also decrease the effect of guilt on patients behavior.","output":"Deontological Guilt and Disgust Sensitivity Modulate Moral Behaviour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sound production in the blackmouth croaker (Atrobucca nibe) was characterized using acoustic, morphological, and histochemical methods.

People with chronic kidney disease and hypertension are at very high risk of renal outcomes, including progression to end-stage renal disease, and, even more importantly, cardiovascular outcomes. Hence, blood pressure control is crucial in reducing the human and socio-economic burden of renal and cardiovascular outcomes in those patients. However, current guidelines from hypertension and renal societies have issued different and sometimes conflicting recommendations, which risk confusing clinicians and potentially contributing to a less effective prevention of renal and cardiovascular outcomes. In this review, we critically appraise existing evidence and key international guidelines, and we finally formulate our own opinion that clinicians should aim for a blood pressure target lower than 130/80 in all patients with chronic kidney disease and hypertension, unless they are frail or with multiple comorbidities. We also advocate for an even more ambitious systolic blood pressure target lower than 120 mmHg in younger patients with a lower burden of comorbidities, to minimise their risk of renal and cardiovascular events during their lifetime.","output":"Tight Blood Pressure Control in Chronic Kidney Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sleep quality is known to have a considerable impact on human health.

DESIGN Case-control study. SETTING Large district general hospital. PARTICIPANTS 60 patients aged 17-50 admitted to hospital over a year with acute asthma, matched with two controls: patients with stable asthma recruited from the outpatient department and patients admitted to hospital with non-respiratory conditions (inpatient controls). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Atopic status (skin testing and total and specific IgE), presence of common respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria (polymerase chain reaction), dust samples from homes, and exposure to allergens (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): Der p 1, Fel d 1, Can f 1, and Bla g 2). RESULTS Viruses were detected in 31 of 177 patients. The difference in the frequency of viruses detected between the groups was significant (admitted with asthma 26%, stable asthma 18%, inpatient controls 9%; P=0.04). A significantly higher proportion of patients admitted with asthma (66%) were sensitised and exposed to either mite, cat, or dog allergen than patients with stable asthma (37%) and inpatient controls (15%; P<0.001). Being sensitised and exposed to allergens was an independent associate of the group admitted to hospital (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 5.4; P=0.05), whereas the combination of sensitisation, high exposure to one or more allergens, and viral detection considerably increased the risk of being admitted with asthma (8.4, 2.1 to 32.8; P=0.002).

Conventional serological diagnosis requires an invasive sample (plasma or serum) and a well-equipped laboratory. To circumvent those limitations, blood samples dried on filter paper (DBS) or Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) could be a practical alternative to reference protocol for serological screening in epidemiological studies. We evaluated the usefulness of dried blood sampling and a rapid diagnostic test (Trypanosoma Detect?) for the detection of antibodies against T. cruzi for their use in community-based screening. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 162 stored paired whole-blood and serum samples from Latin American migrants and 25 negative-control blood samples were included. Diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease was performed in serum according to WHO algorithms. Blood samples were retrospectively collected as dried spots and then analyzed using two different serological techniques, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (E-CLIA). Whole-blood samples were also used to evaluate a rapid diagnostic test based on immunochromatography. A better correlation with conventional serum was observed in dried blood elutes using E-CLIA than ELISA (97% vs. 77% sensitivity, respectively). Both assays reported 100% specificity. The median cut-off index values of E-CLIA for dried blood were significantly lower than those for serum (138.1 vs. 243.3, P<0.05). The Trypanosoma Detect? test presented a sensitivity and specificity of 89.6% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of antibodies against T. cruzi in dried blood samples shows a higher sensitivity when using E-CLIA compared with ELISA. Trypanosoma Detect? is easier to use but has a lower sensitivity. Hence, we propose a sequential strategy based on performing the rapid test first, and a negative result will be confirmed by DBS-ECLIA for use in community Chagas disease screening programs.","output":"Analytical Evaluation of Dried Blood Spot and Rapid Diagnostic Test as a New Strategy for Serological Community Screening for Chronic Chagas Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 patients is a growing problem.

Control of the COVID-19 epidemic has become a crucial issue around the globe, but there are limited studies that investigate the global trend of the COVID-19 pandemic together with each country's policy measures. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop an online artificial intelligence (AI) system to analyze the dynamic trend of the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitate forecasting and predictive modeling, and produce a heat map visualization of policy measures in 171 countries. METHODS: The COVID-19 Pandemic AI System (CPAIS) integrated two data sets: the data set from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker from the Blavatnik School of Government, which is maintained by the University of Oxford, and the data set from the COVID-19 Data Repository, which was established by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. This study utilized four statistical and deep learning techniques for forecasting: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), feedforward neural network (FNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM). With regard to 1-year records (ie, whole time series data), records from the last 14 days served as the validation set to evaluate the performance of the forecast, whereas earlier records served as the training set. RESULTS: A total of 171 countries that featured in both databases were included in the online system. The CPAIS was developed to explore variations, trends, and forecasts related to the COVID-19 pandemic across several counties. For instance, the number of confirmed monthly cases in the United States reached a local peak in July 2020 and another peak of 6,368,591 in December 2020. A dynamic heat map with policy measures depicts changes in COVID-19 measures for each country. A total of 19 measures were embedded within the three sections presented on the website, and only 4 of the 19 measures were continuous measures related to financial support or investment. Deep learning models were used to enable COVID-19 forecasting; the performances of ARIMA, FNN, and the MLP neural network were not stable because their forecast accuracy was only better than LSTM for a few countries. LSTM demonstrated the best forecast accuracy for Canada, as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were 2272.551, 1501.248, and 0.2723075, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: The CPAIS collects and summarizes information about the COVID-19 pandemic and offers data visualization and deep learning-based prediction. It might be a useful reference for predicting a serious outbreak or epidemic.

In this way, people can come together and close a transaction that will serve all of their goals, at least well enough. <br><br>Rather than focusing on litigating pathological transactions, students are asked to approach the materials in the book and accompanying supplement from a planning and forward-looking perspective. Using forms in the supplement and materials in the notes following the readings, the students are challenged to consider how deals would have come out differently if alternative documents had been used. They are also asked how they would have altered the presented documents to get a better result for clients. <br><br>The book underscores that command of fundamental legal principles, an understanding of the influence of changes in the economic, business, social, and technological contexts, and a transactional mindset are essential for mastery of the field of real estate law.","output":"Preface: Gerald Korngold and Paul Goldstein, Real Estate Transactions: Cases and Materials on Land Transfer, Development and Finance (7th Ed. 2021)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently prevalent in most countries around the world.

This study included patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent chest CT imaging between February and October 2020 in Japan, a non-endemic area. For each chest CT, the CO-RADS scores, determined by consensus among three experienced chest radiologists, were used as the gold standard. Images from 412 patients were used to train the model, whereas images from 83 patients were tested to obtain AI-based CO-RADS scores for each image. Six independent raters (one medical student, two residents, and three board-certified radiologists) evaluated the test images. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and weighted kappa values were calculated to determine the inter-rater agreement with the gold standard. The mean ICC and weighted kappa were 0.754 and 0.752 for the medical student and residents (taken together), 0.851 and 0.850 for the diagnostic radiologists, and 0.913 and 0.912 for AI, respectively.

As a designated hospital, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital has received over 700 COVID-19 patients. With the COVID-19 becoming a pandemic all over the world, we aim to share our epidemiological and clinical findings with the global community. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we studied 340 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, including 310 discharged cases and 30 death cases. We analyzed their demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data and implemented our findings into an interactive, free access web application. Findings Baseline T lymphocyte Subsets differed significantly between the discharged cases and the death cases in two-sample t-tests: Total T cells (p < 2.2e-16), Helper T cells (p < 2.2e-16), Suppressor T cells (p = 1.8-14), and TH/TS (Helper/Suppressor ratio, p = 0.0066). Multivariate logistic regression model with death or discharge as the outcome resulted in the following significant predictors: age (OR 1.05, p 0.04), underlying disease status (OR 3.42, p 0.02), Helper T cells on the log scale (OR 0.22, p 0.00), and TH/TS on the log scale (OR 4.80, p 0.00). The McFadden pseudo R-squared for the logistic regression model is 0.35, suggesting the model has a fair predictive power. Interpretation While age and underlying diseases are known risk factors for poor prognosis, patients with a less damaged immune system at the time of hospitalization had higher chance of recovery. Close monitoring of the T lymphocyte subsets might provide valuable information of the patients condition change during the treatment process.

Zone 1 supraceliac aortic occlusion improves coronary and cerebral blood flow. It is unknown if Zone 3 occlusion distal to the renal arteries offers a similar physiologic benefit while maintaining blood flow to organs above the point of occlusion. METHODS: Fifteen swine were anesthetized, instrumented, and placed into ventricular fibrillation. Mechanical CPR was immediately initiated. After 5 min of CPR, Zone 1 REBOA, Zone 3 REBOA, or no intervention (control) was initiated. Hemodynamic variables were continuously recorded for 30 min. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups before REBOA deployment. Once REBOA was deployed, Zone 1 animals had statistically greater diastolic blood pressure compared to control (median [IQR]: 19.9 mmHg [9.5C20.5] vs 3.9 mmHg [2.4C4.8], p = .006). There were no differences in diastolic blood pressure between Zone 1 and Zone 3 (8.6 mmHg [5.1C13.1], p = .10) or between Zone 3 and control (p = .10). There were no significant differences in systolic blood pressure, cerebral blood flow, or time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) between groups. CONCLUSION: In our swine model of cardiac arrest, Zone 1 REBOA improved diastolic blood pressure when compared to control. Zone 3 does not offer a hemodynamic benefit when compared to no occlusion. Unlike prior studies, immediate use of REBOA after arrest did not result in an increase in ROSC rate, suggesting REBOA may be more beneficial in patients with prolonged no-flow time.

The Kyrgyzstan InterSectional Stigma (KISS) Injection Drug Use Cohort is the first study designed to assess the impact of drug use, methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and HIV stigma experiences among people who inject drugs (PWID) on HIV prevention service utilization. METHODS: Adult PWID were recruited from Bishkek city and the surrounding rural Chuy Oblast region in northern Kyrgyzstan via modified time location sampling and snowball sampling. All participants completed a baseline rapid HIV test and interviewer-administered survey. A subsample of participants were prospectively followed for three months and surveyed to establish retention rates for future work in the region. Internal reliability of three parallel stigma measures (drug use, MMT, HIV) was evaluated. Descriptive statistics characterize baseline experiences across these three stigma types and HIV prevention service utilization, and assess differences in these experiences by urbanicity. RESULTS: The KISS cohort (N = 279, 50.5% Bishkek, 49.5% Chuy Oblast) was mostly male (75.3%), ethnically Russian (53.8%), median age was 40 years old (IQR 35C46). Of the 204 eligible participants, 84.9% were surveyed at month 3. At baseline, 23.6% had a seropositive rapid HIV test. HIV prevention service utilization did not differ by urbanicity. Overall, we found 65.9% ever utilized syringe service programs in the past 6 months, 8.2% were utilizing MMT, and 60.8% met HIV testing guidelines. No participants reported PrEP use, but 18.5% had heard of PrEP. On average participants reported moderate levels of drug use (mean [M] = 3.25;  = 0.80), MMT (M = 3.24;  = 0.80), and HIV stigma (M = 2.94;  = 0.80). Anticipated drug use stigma from healthcare workers and internalized drug use stigma were significantly higher among PWID from Bishkek (p < 0.05), while internalized HIV stigma among PWID living with HIV was significantly greater among PWID from Chuy Oblast (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The KISS cohort documents moderate levels of HIV-related intersectional stigma and suboptimal engagement in HIV prevention services among PWID in Kyrgyzstan. Future work will aim identify priority stigma reduction intervention targets to optimize HIV prevention efforts in the region.

Here, we present the first structure of a prokaryotic EndoU toxin in complex with its cognate immunity protein. The contact-dependent growth inhibition toxin CdiA-CT(STECO31) from Escherichia coli STEC_O31 adopts the eukaryotic EndoU fold and shares greatest structural homology with the nuclease domain of coronavirus Nsp15. The toxin contains a canonical His-His-Lys catalytic triad in the same arrangement as eukaryotic EndoU domains, but lacks the uridylate-specific ribonuclease activity that characterizes the superfamily. Comparative sequence analysis indicates that bacterial EndoU domains segregate into at least three major clades based on structural variations in the N-terminal subdomain. Representative EndoU nucleases from clades I and II degrade tRNA molecules with little specificity. In contrast, CdiA-CT(STECO31) and other clade III toxins are specific anticodon nucleases that cleave tRNA(Glu) between nucleotides C37 and m(2)A38.

The key elements of high quality primary care are first-contact access, continuity, comprehensiveness, coordination, and person-centredness. In Kenya, there is paucity of information on the performance of these key elements and such information is needed to improve service delivery. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the quality of primary care performance in private sector facilities in Nairobi, Kenya. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study using an adapted Primary Care Assessment Tool for the Kenyan context and surveyed 412 systematically sampled primary care users, from 13 PC clinics. Data were analysed to measure 11 domains of primary care performance and two aggregated primary care scores using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. RESULTS: Mean primary care score was 2.64 (SD=0.23) and the mean expanded primary care score was 2.68 (SD=0.19), implying an overall low performance. The domains of first contact-utilisation, coordination (information system), family-centredness and cultural competence had mean scores of >3.0 (acceptable to good performance). The domains of first contact-access, coordination, comprehensiveness (provided and available), ongoing care and community-orientation had mean scores of < 3.0 (poor performance). Older respondents (p=0.05) and those with higher affiliation to the clinics (p=0.01) were more likely to rate primary care as acceptable to good. CONCLUSION: These primary care clinics in Nairobi showed gaps in performance. Performance was rated as acceptable-to-good for first-contact utilisation, the information systems, family-centredness and cultural competence. However, patients rated low performance related to first-contact access, ongoing care, coordination of care, comprehensiveness of services, community orientation and availability of a complete primary health care team. Performance could be improved by deploying family physicians, increasing the scope of practice to become more comprehensive, incentivising use of these PC clinics rather than the tertiary hospital, improving access after-hours and marketing the use of the clinics to the practice population.","output":"The quality of primary care performance in private sector facilities in Nairobi, Kenya: a cross-sectional descriptive survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyzed the plasma levels of interferons and cytokines, and the expression of interferon-stimulated genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity.

Here, we characterized the impact of pathogen-derived TLR2/4 ligands (peptidoglycan (PGN)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) on the immune crosstalk of sperm with the bovine endometrial epithelium. The real-time PCR analysis showed that the presence of low levels of PGN, but not LPS, blocked the sperm-induced inflammatory responses in bovine endometrial epithelial cells (BEECs) in vitro. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that PGN prevented the sperm-induced phosphorylation of JNK in BEECs. Activation or blockade of the TLR2 system in the endometrial epithelium verified that TLR2 signaling acts as a commonly-shared pathway for PGN and sperm recognition. The impairment of endometrial sperm recognition, induced by PGN, subsequently inhibited sperm phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Moreover, using an ex vivo endometrial explant that more closely resembles those in vivo conditions, showed that sperm provoked a mild and reversible endometrial tissue injury and triggered PMN recruitment into uterine glands, while PGN inhibited these events. Of note, PGN markedly increased the sperm attachment to uterine glands, and relatively so in the surface epithelium. However, addition of the anti-CD44 antibody into a PGN-sperm-explant co-culture completely blocked sperm attachment into glands and surface epithelia, indicating that the CD44 adhesion molecule is involved in the PGN-triggered sperm attachment to the endometrial epithelium. Together, these findings demonstrate that, the presence of PGN residues disrupts sperm immune recognition and prevents the physiological inflammation induced by sperm in the endometrial epithelium via the MyD88-dependent pathway of TLR2 signaling, possibly leading to impairment of uterine clearance and subsequent embryo receptivity.","output":"Peptidoglycan Switches Off the TLR2-Mediated Sperm Recognition and Triggers Sperm Localization in the Bovine Endometrium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rural women are highly prevalent to depression, where spouse-related factors, including extramarital affairs and poverty, intensify its likelihood of occurrence. However, women engaged with a Money-Saving Group (MSG) are financially self-dependent, which can reduce the risk of depression suffering. Despite this, there is less study among this cohort, which led us to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of depression among the Ugandan women involved in MSG. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in Uganda among rural married or cohabiting women aged 18 to 45 years engaged in MSG. The survey was carried out within a total of 153 participants (33.3  6.7 years) in April 2021. Information related to socio-demographic of the participants, their spouse characteristics, and depression were collected. RESULTS: About 65.4% of the participants had depressive symptoms (based on the cutoff 10/27 at the PHQ-9). But, 8.15 times (CI: 2.83C23.44, p<0.001) and 16.69 times (CI: 4.85C57.39, p<0.001), higher risk of depression were observed, if the participants spouses were using an addictive substance and had been involved in an extramarital relationship, respectively. Similarly, there was an increased likelihood of depression when the participant or spouse was unemployed. CONCLUSION: This study observed a higher prevalence of depression, which suggests paying attention to this cohort. Thus, there should be routine screening for depression among married women involved in MSG at lower-level health facilities in rural settings, especially those with spouses engaged in substance use, having an extramarital relationship, and being unemployed.","output":"Depression in Ugandan Rural Women Involved in a Money Saving Group: The Role of Spouses Unemployment, Extramarital Relationship, and Substance Use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Type I interferons (IFNs) inhibit regulatory T\\\\cell (Treg) expansion and activation, making them beneficial in antiviral responses, but detrimental in autoimmune diseases.

METHODS: ISG15 expression and Treg dynamics were analysed in vitro and ex vivo from patients with chronic hepatitis C, with lupus and ISG15 deficiency. RESULTS: ISG15 is expressed at high levels in human Tregs, renders them refractory to the IFN\\\\STAT1 signal, and protects them from IFN\\\\driven contraction. In vitro, Tregs from healthy controls upregulate ISG15 upon activation to higher levels than conventional CD4 T cells, and ISG15\\\\silenced Tregs are more susceptible to IFN\\\\induced contraction.

In vivo, in patients with chronic hepatitis C, 2 days after starting pegIFN/ribavirin therapy, a stronger ISG15 inducibility correlates with a milder Treg depletion. Ex vivo, in systemic lupus erythematosus patients, higher levels of ISG15 are associated to reduced STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IFN, and also to increased frequencies of Tregs, characterising active disease.

METHODS: People with and without PD participating in the online study Fox Insight (FI) were invited to complete a survey between April 23 and May 23, 2020. Among people reporting COVID-19 diagnoses, we compared symptoms and outcomes in people with and without PD. Among people not reporting COVID-19, we assessed access to healthcare and services and PD symptoms. RESULTS: 7,209/9,762 active FI users responded (approximately 74% response rate), 5,429 people with PD and 1,452 without PD. COVID-19 diagnoses were reported by 51 people with and 26 without PD. Complications were more frequent in people with longer PD duration. People with PD and COVID-19 experienced new or worsening motor (63%) and nonmotor (75%) symptoms. People with PD not diagnosed with COVID-19 reported disrupted medical care (64%), exercise (21%), and social activities (57%), and worsened motor (43%) and non-motor (52%) symptoms.

Epistemic vices have been defined as character traits that interfere with acquiring, maintaining, and transmitting knowledge. Examples of epistemic vice are gullibility and indifference to knowledge. It has been hypothesized that epistemically vicious people are especially susceptible to misinformation and conspiracy theories. We conducted one exploratory and one confirmatory observational survey study on Amazon Mechanical Turk among people living in the United States (total N = 1737). We show that two psychological traits underlie the range of epistemic vices that we investigated: indifference to truth and rigidity. Indifference manifests itself in a lack of motivation to find the truth. Rigidity manifests itself in being insensitive to evidence. We develop a scale to measure epistemic vice with the subscales indifference and rigidity. The Epistemic Vice Scale is internally consistent; has good convergent, divergent, and discriminant validity; and is strongly associated with the endorsement of misinformation and conspiracy theories. Epistemic vice explains additional variance in the endorsement of misinformation and conspiracy theories over and above demographic and related psychological concepts and shows medium to large effect sizes across outcome measures. We demonstrate that epistemic vice differs from existing psychological constructs, and show that the scale can explain individual differences in dealing with misinformation and conspiracy theories.

Furthermore, we provide a methodological overview of two essential machine learning (ML) classification methods, in the context of textual analytics, and compare their effectiveness in classifying Coronavirus Tweets of varying lengths. We observe a strong classification accuracy of 91% for short Tweets, with the Na\\"ive Bayes method. We also observe that the logistic regression classification method provides a reasonable accuracy of 74% with shorter Tweets, and both methods showed relatively weaker performance for longer Tweets. This research provides insights into Coronavirus fear sentiment progression, and outlines associated methods, implications, limitations and opportunities.","output":"COVID-19 Public Sentiment Insights and MachineLearning for Tweets Classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Environmental conditions in food and medical fields enable the bacteria to attach and grow on surfaces leading to resistant bacterial biofilm formation. Indeed, the first step in biofilm formation is the bacterial irreversible adhesion. Controlling and inhibiting this adhesion is a passive approach to fight against biofilm development. This strategy is an interesting path in the inhibition of biofilm formation since it targets the first step of biofilm development. Those pathogenic structures are responsible for several foodborne diseases and nosocomial infections. Therefore, to face this public health threat, researchers employed cold plasma technologies in coating development. In this review, the different factors influencing the bacterial adhesion to a substrate are outlined. The goal is to present the passive coating strategies aiming to prevent biofilm formation via cold plasma treatments, highlighting antiadhesive elaborated surfaces. General aspects of surface treatment, including physico-chemical modification and application of cold plasma technologies, were also presented. KEY POINTS: ? Factors surrounding pathogenic bacteria influence biofilm development. ? Controlling bacterial adhesion prevents biofilm formation. ?

Clinically meaningful data, such as overall survival (OS) and quality of life, are often only presented in subsequent publications. We examined if the clinical benefit of cancer drugs, as measured by the European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS), improves post-European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval as more data emerges. METHODS: Cancer drug indications approved by the EMA from January 2006 to December 2016 were reviewed and trials cited for efficacy were identified. Primary and subsequent publications (up to December 2019) of scorable trials were included. Changes in benefit over time were measured using ESMO-MCBS thresholds for non-curative (&#8805;4 for substantial, =3 for intermediate and &#8804;2 for low benefit) and curative intent (A or B for major benefit) scoring. RESULTS: Fifty-five non-curative and two curative intent trials were included. At approval, 29.1% of non-curative trials were substantial, 45.5% intermediate and 25.5% low benefit. For curative intent trials, one displayed major benefit and one displayed no major benefit. We identified 82 subsequent publications for reassessment. A change in ESMO-MCBS classification was seen in 34.5% of non-curative trials (11 raised and 8 lowered). At 3-year reassessment, 36.4% of non-curative trials were substantial, 34.5% intermediate and 29.1% low benefit. Both curative trials showed no major benefit at reassessment. CONCLUSION: As over a third of trials changed classification, in either direction, reassessing the ESMO-MCBS score of approved cancer drugs may help to inform patients and ensure ongoing relevance of regulatory and reimbursement decisions.","output":"Assessing the benefit of cancer drugs approved by the European Medicines Agency using the European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale over time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first discovered, there have been questions surrounding the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and more recently the COVID-19 vaccine, on mens health and fertility.

Decades of research in social sciences have offered complementary insights into how such transformations might occur. However, these insights largely remain disjunct and of limited scope, such that strategies for solving global environmental challenges remain elusive. There is a need to integrate approaches focusing on individuals and social structures to understand how individual actions influence and are in turn influenced by social structures and norms. In this paper, we synthesize a range of insights across different schools of thought and integrate them in a novel framework for transformative social change. Our framework explains the relationships among individual behaviors, collective actions, and social structures and helps change agents guide societal transitions toward environmental sustainability. We apply this framework to the global wildlife tradewhich presents several distinct challenges of human actions, especially amidst the Covid-19 pandemicand identify pathways toward transformative change. One key distinction we make is between different individual actions that comprise the practice itself (e.g., buying wildlife products; private action) and those that push for a broader system change in practice (e.g., signaling (dis)approval for wildlife consumption; social-signaling action, and campaigning for policies that end unsustainable wildlife trade; system-changing action). In general, transformative change will require an integrative approach that includes both structural reforms and all three classes of individual action.","output":"An integrative framework for transformative social change: a case in global wildlife trade"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The recent emergence of viral pneumonia was caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2), which has spread to many countries and threated the global public health.

We employed bioinformatics technologies to measure the nucleotide compositions, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), the codon adaptation index (CAI), and other indices. Our results reflected that there were some similarities of codon usage bias between SARS-Cov-2 and its natural reservoirs, suggesting that SARS-Cov-2 was tended to evolve its codon usage which was comparable to that of its hosts. Additionally, various degree of adaptation to the SARS-Cov-2 host and vector were estimated, even different genes have different codon adaptation to their reservoirs. We further suggested that SARS-Cov-2 isolates were evolving at a rapid substitution rate under their translation selection pressure of their hosts.

Currently, data are limited and evidence to guide management of heart transplant recipients with COVID-19 is sparse. In this case report, we provide a summary of the current literature as well as an in-depth analysis of our clinical decision-making. CASE SUMMARY: A 67-year-old female who underwent cardiac transplantation 1 year prior was found to have acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Her immunosuppressant medications were modulated with discontinuation of mycophenolate and titration of tacrolimus troughs with a goal of 6C10 ng/dL. She was administered supportive treatment including convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone, in addition to antibiotic treatment that resulted in resolution of her symptoms within a matter of days despite her precarious disposition. DISCUSSION: This case demonstrates that it can be safe and efficacious to modulate immunosuppressant medications in cardiac transplant recipients in accordance with recommendations made by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation. This case additionally demonstrates that aspects of the current literature regarding the management of COVID-19 can be safely extrapolated to cardiac transplant recipients. Providing supportive care with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and convalescent plasma as indicated can be beneficial in cardiac transplant recipients; although, the current literature regarding convalescent plasma and remdesivir is conflicting.","output":"Cardiac transplant recipient with COVID-19 induced acute hypoxic respiratory failure: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dabigatran is a newer oral anticoagulant, indicated for chronic atrial fibrillation anticoagulation.

A national decline in procedures performed by hospitalists has prompted questions about their procedural competency. Additionally, though simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) has been shown to be effective among trainees whether this approach has enduring benefits for independent practitioners who already have experience is unknown. We aimed to assess the baseline procedural skill of hospitalists already credentialed to perform procedures. We hypothesised that simulation-based training of hospitalists would result in durable skill gains after several months. DESIGN Prospective cohort study with pretraining and post-training measurements. SETTING Single, large, urban academic medical centre in the USA. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-two out of 38 eligible participants defined as hospitalists working on teaching services where they would supervise trainees performing procedures. INTERVENTIONS One-on-one, 60 min SBML of lumbar puncture (LP) and abdominal paracentesis (AP). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Our primary outcome was the percentage of hospitalists obtaining minimum passing scores (MPS) on LP and AP checklists; our secondary outcomes were average checklist scores and self-reported confidence. RESULTS At baseline, only 16% hospitalists met or exceeded the MPS for LP and 32% for AP. Immediately after SBML, 100% of hospitalists reached this threshold. Reassessment an average of 7 months later revealed that only 40% of hospitalists achieved the MPS. Confidence increased initially after training but declined over time. CONCLUSIONS Hospitalists may be performing invasive bedside procedures without demonstration of adequate skill. A single evidence-based training intervention was insufficient to sustain skills for the majority of hospitalists over a short period of time. More stringent practices for certifying hospitalists who perform risky procedures are warranted, as well as mechanisms to support skill maintenance, such as periodic simulation-based training and assessment.","output":"Cohort study of hospitalists' procedural skills: baseline competence and durability after simulation-based training."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the actual pandemic context, cancer patients are at additional risk, and protocols are always changing.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the oral health knowledge of elementary school teachers and to assess their attitude towards oral health education and its implementation in the elementary school curriculum. MATERIALS AND METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among 1200 teachers working in government elementary schools. Data were collected through a structured, self-administered questionnaire consisting of teachers' demographic data and their responses to knowledge and attitude questions. RESULTS A total of 1031 teachers participated in this study, with a response rate of 86%. About two-thirds (66%) of the participants demonstrated high oral health knowledge. Participants' educational level was statistically significantly associated with their oral health knowledge. Almost all the participants (90%) agreed that oral health education should be included in the elementary school curriculum. More than two-thirds of the participants (74%) showed willingness to participate in online courses to promote oral health among elementary school children. CONCLUSION Considering their oral health knowledge, positive attitude, ?teaching experience, and the fact that they have the potential to reach a large number of children and establish consistency and continuity in providing educational instructions, elementary school teachers should be encouraged to become involved in promoting oral health to elementary school children as a part of the teaching system.

Goals of implementation were to consolidate in-person prenatal screening, surveillance, and examinations into fewer in-person visits while maintaining patient access to ongoing antenatal care and subspecialty consultations via telehealth virtual visits. The rationale for this change was to minimize patient travel and thus risk for COVID-19 exposure. Because a large portion of obstetric patients had underlying medical or fetal conditions placing them at increased risk for adverse outcomes, prenatal care telehealth regimens were tailored for increased surveillance and/or counseling. Based on the incorporation of telehealth into prenatal care for high-risk patients, specific recommendations are made for the following conditions, clinical scenarios, and services: (1) hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and chronic hypertension; (2) pregestational and gestational diabetes mellitus; (3) maternal cardiovascular disease; (4) maternal neurologic conditions; (5) history of preterm birth and poor obstetrical history including prior stillbirth; (6) fetal conditions such as intrauterine growth restriction, congenital anomalies, and multiple gestations including monochorionic placentation; (7) genetic counseling; (8) mental health services; (9) obstetric anesthesia consultations; and (10) postpartum care. While telehealth virtual visits do not fully replace in-person encounters during prenatal care, they do offer a means of reducing potential patient and provider exposure to COVID-19 while providing consolidated in-person testing and services.

Our study aims to investigate if low Vitamin D levels correlate with increased risk of COVID-19 infection, thereby representing a modifiable risk factor for COVID-19 infection.MethodA retrospective observational study was conducted on 3198 health care workers of a Greater London District General Hospital, who had undergone testing for 25-OH Vitamin D levels and COVID-19 antibody in June 2020. In accordance with NICE guidelines, Vitamin D deficiency was defined as less than 25 nmol/L, insufficiency as 25C50 nmol/L, and those with levels over 50 nmol/L were used as control comparisons. Evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Regression analysis was performed to determine independent significance, accounting for age and gender.Results3191 participants were included in this study, with age ranging from 19C78 years (mean 42.9) of which 78.2% were female. Both age and gender were not independently associated with positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. 1997 (62.6%) participants had Vitamin D levels within the normal range, 899 (28.2%) participants had insufficient levels and 302 (9.4%) had Vitamin D deficiency.

We hypothesized that differential ICU burden might be explained by increased testing volumes, as well as the shift in mean case age from older to younger. We constructed a negative binomial regression model using only three covariates, at a 2-week lag: log10(weekly cases); log10(weekly deaths); and mean weekly case age. This model reproduced observed ICU admission volumes, and demonstrated good preliminary predictive validity. Furthermore, when admissions were used in combination with ICU length of stay, our modeled estimates demonstrated excellent convergent validity with ICU occupancy data reported by the Canadian Institute for Health Information. Our approach needs external validation in other settings and at larger and smaller geographic scales, but appears to be a useful short-term forecasting tool for ICU resource demand; we also demonstrate that the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not meaningfully changed in Ontario between the first and second waves, but the demographics of those infected, and the fraction of cases identified, have.","output":"Simple Accurate Regression-Based Forecasting of Intensive Care Unit Admissions due to COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High-grade poorly differentiated sarcomas of unknown primary origin constitute a rare entity and are characterised by wide histopathological diversity and atypical presentations.

SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and by contact. We speculated that precautions against droplet and contact transmission should be the proper way to preserve ward from COVID-19. The essence of our protocol involves: triage outside of the ward, identification of risk zones, traffic control, surveillance of all the involved subjects. Whoever attends the ward must follow the general risk prevention and mitigation measures.

The newly emerged strain of HCoV, the SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the recent global pandemic that has already caused the death of hundreds of thousands of people due to the lack of effective therapeutic options. Methods: In this study, immunoinformatics methods were used to design epitope-based polyvalent vaccines which are expected to be effective against four different pathogenic strains of HCoV i.e., HCoV-OC43, HCoV-SARS, HCoV-MERS, and SARS-CoV-2. Results: The constructed vaccines contained highly antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, conserved, and non-homologous T-cell and B-cell epitopes from all the four viral strains. Therefore, they should be able to provide strong protection against all these strains. Protein-protein docking was performed to predict the best vaccine construct. Later, the MD simulation and immune simulation of the best vaccine construct also predicted satisfactory results. Finally, in silico cloning was performed to develop a higher expression strategy of the vaccine. Conclusion: If satisfactory results are achieved in numerous in vivo and in vitro studies, then the vaccines designed in this study might be effective as preventative measures against the selected HCoV strains.","output":"Immunoinformatics-guided Designing and In Silico Analysis of Epitope-based Polyvalent Vaccines against Multiple Strains of Human Coronavirus (HCoVs)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of COVID\\\\19, law enforcement personnel need to be aware of important facts about the spread of the virus so that they can help keep community spaces safe.

Material and Objectives: Primary Objective: To study the proportion of non-adherence to treatment in patients with type 2 DM and factors responsible for it. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To correlate the degree of glycemic control, presence of target organ damage and metabolic derangements with non-adherence to medication. METHODS: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on 100 patients of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Proportion of drug coverage (PDC) over the last 1 month was used to assess adherence. A questionnaire was used to collect information for variable factors responsible for non-adherence. The percentage of non-adherence and factors contributing were analyzed. OBSERVATION AND RESULTS: Out of 100 patients with T2 DM (M:F:: 35:65); 56 patients had good (>80%) adherence, 13 patients had moderate (50-80%) adherence and 31 patients had poor (<50%) adherence to medication. Following factors were assessed for non-adherence; Amongst Drug-related factors; cost (43%;p<0.001), non-availability of drugs (39%;p<0.001) and long-term use of drugs (3%;p=0.017) were significantly associated with non-adherence to medication.None of the Insulin-related factors i.e. phobia (13.04%;p=0.441), negative impact (13.04%;p=0.441), less flexibility (60.86%;p=0.595), don't know the way of taking insulin (52.17%;p=0.983) and others (17.39%,p=0.67) were significantly associated with non-adherence.Amongst social factors:- Function(12%;p=0.881), no support (27%;p=0.005), patient not well (23%;p=0.004), travelling (42%,p=0.158) and illness in family (5%;p=0.658). No support from family and patient not well were significantly associated with non-adherence.None of the disease-related (duration, poor perception & unawareness) and psychological factors (forgetfulness & willful default) were significantly associated with non-adherence.Miscellaneous factors:- Frequency of visits (20%,p=0.034), lack of communication (53%,p<0.001) and SMBG related issues (74%,p=0.029) were significantly associated with non-adherence. Others factors like distance, covid-related and alternate therapy were not significantly associated with non-adherence. Patients with good adherence had significantly lower HbA1c (p=0.044).Patients with good adherence had lesser prevalence of target organ damage but it was not significantly associated with non-adherence except nephropathy (66%;p=0.039). Also, association of medication adherence with metabolic complications was found to be insignificant. CONCLUSION: Non-adherence to medication in patients with Type 2 DM is significantly associated with cost of medication, non-availability of medication, long-term use, no support from family, patient not well, frequency of visits, lack of communication and SMBG related issues.

In lung cancer, mRNA levels of HSPA5 were 253-fold increase than that of ACE2. Meanwhile, in both malignant tumors and matched normal samples across almost all cancer types, mRNA levels of HSPA5 were much higher than those of ACE2. Higher expression of HSPA5 significantly decreased patient overall survival (OS) in 7 types of cancers.

RECENT FINDINGS In the acute-care setting, critical illness polyneuropathy and critical illness myopathy are important causes of acute paralysis in critically ill comatose patients, and may cause inappropriately pessimistic prognoses. Duration of weaning from artificial ventilation is 2 to 7 times greater in patients with critical illness polyneuropathy than in patients without critical illness polyneuropathy. After intensive care unit and hospital discharge, many patients diagnosed with critical illness polyneuropathy or critical illness myopathy are reported to complain of profound muscle weakness. Chronic disability was a common finding among them. Complete functional recovery with patients regaining the ability to breathe spontaneously and to walk independently was reported in 180 of 263 patients (68.4%); severe disability with tetraparesis, tetraplegia, or paraplegia was reported in 74 patients (28.1%). Persisting milder disabilities were common even in patients with complete functional recovery, and included reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes, stocking and glove sensory loss, muscle atrophy, painful hyperesthesia, and foot drop. An association of critical illness polyneuropathy and critical illness myopathy with increased intensive care unit and hospital mortality has been demonstrated only in selected intensive care unit populations; data are insufficient to demonstrate any association with long-term mortality. SUMMARY Intensive care unit-acquired critical illness polyneuropathy and critical illness myopathy influence the evaluation of acutely ill comatose patients and may instigate unreasonably pessimistic prognosis.

Contact tracing has become an important surveillance measure to control COVID-19 in the United States, and mobile health interventions have found increased prominence in this space. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the use and usability of MyCOVIDKey, a mobile-based web app to assist COVID-19 contact tracing efforts, during the 6-week pilot period. METHODS: A 6-week study was conducted on the Vanderbilt University campus in Nashville, Tennessee. The study participants, consisting primarily of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty in the Chemistry Department at Vanderbilt University, were asked to use the MyCOVIDKey web app during the course of the study period. Paradata were collected as users engaged with the MyCOVIDKey web app. At the end of the study, all participants were asked to report on their user experience in a survey, and the results were analyzed in the context of the user paradata. RESULTS: During the pilot period, 45 users enrolled in MyCOVIDKey. An analysis of their enrollment suggests that initial recruiting efforts were effective; however, participant recruitment and engagement efforts at the midpoint of the study were less effective. App use paralleled the number of users, indicating that incentives were useful for recruiting new users to sign up but did not result in users attempting to artificially inflate their use as a result of prize offers. Times to completion of key tasks were low, indicating that the main features of the app could be used quickly. Of the 45 users, 30 provided feedback through a postpilot survey, with 26 (58%) completing it in its entirety. The MyCOVIDKey app as a whole was rated 70.0 on the System Usability Scale, indicating that it performed above the accepted threshold for usability. When the key-in and self-assessment features were examined on their own, it was found that they individually crossed the same thresholds for acceptable usability but that the key-in feature had a higher margin for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The MyCOVIDKey app was found overall to be a useful tool for COVID-19 contact tracing in a university setting. Most users suggested simple-to-implement improvements, such as replacing the web app framework with a native app format or changing the placement of the scanner within the app workflow. After these updates, this tool could be readily deployed and easily adapted to other settings across the country.

Patients' epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics, along with their treatment information, were collected from the medical history system. The occurrence of AKI was compared between the severe and critical patients, and between patients with or without a history of CKD. The diagnostic criteria for AKI included an increase in the serum creatinine level to &#8805;1.5-fold the level at baseline within 7 days according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Renal outcomes were defined as AKI or non-AKI. RESULTS: Four patients (4.2%) developed AKI, all of whom were in the critically ill group, and 3 (75%) of whom died. Out of the 90 severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients without CKD, 3 (3.3%) patients developed AKI; out of the 6 patients with CKD, 1 (16.7%) patient developed AKI. Age, disease severity, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 were correlated with AKI onset in severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients, while lymphocyte count and estimated glomerular filtration rate at admission were inversely related to the development of AKI. CONCLUSIONS: Only 3.3% of severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients without CKD in our research cohort developed AKI. Critically ill patients may be more susceptible to AKI than severely ill patients.","output":"A survey on acute kidney injury in severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients without chronic kidney disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: As part of the special issue on 'Women in Science', this review offers a perspective on past and ongoing work in the field of normal (non-cancer) tissue radiation biology, highlighting the work of many of the leading contributors to this field of research. We discuss some of the hypotheses that have guided investigations, with a focus on some of the critical organs considered dose-limiting with respect to radiation therapy, and speculate on where the field needs to go in the future.Conclusions: The scope of work that makes up normal tissue radiation biology has and continues to play a pivotal role in the radiation sciences, ensuring the most effective application of radiation in imaging and therapy, as well as contributing to radiation protection efforts. However, despite the proven historical value of preclinical findings, recent decades have seen clinical practice move ahead with altered fractionation scheduling based on empirical observations, with little to no (or even negative) supporting scientific data. Given our current appreciation of the complexity of normal tissue radiation responses and their temporal variability, with tissue- and/or organ-specific mechanisms that include intra-, inter- and extracellular messaging, as well as contributions from systemic compartments, such as the immune system, the need to maintain a positive therapeutic ratio has never been more urgent. Importantly, mitigation and treatment strategies, whether for the clinic, emergency use following accidental or deliberate releases, or reducing occupational risk, will likely require multi-targeted approaches that involve both local and systemic intervention.From our personal perspective as five 'Women in Science', we would like to acknowledge and applaud the role that many female scientists have played in this field.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Parameters describing global and regional LV function were evaluated in 50 subjects using a two-dimensional (2D) steady-state free precession (SSFP) and pre- and postcontrast 3D k-t BLAST techniques. Data analyses included contrast-to-noise ratio analyses, and statistical evaluations included Bland-Altman, Cohen's kappa and analysis of variance techniques. RESULTS Bland-Altman analyses revealed that the ejection fraction computed using the 3D k-t BLAST sequences before (bias+/-2S.D., 2.2+/-8.8) and after contrast administration (bias+/-2S.D., 2.7+/-7.6 mol) was comparable to the 2D SSFP technique. Similar agreement was noted for other global LV parameters. The myocardium-to-blood contrast in the apical slices was better in the 3D k-t BLAST sequence after contrast administration than before. Cohen's kappa values demonstrated good agreement between the sequences for evaluating regional wall motion. CONCLUSIONS 3D k-t BLAST can yield global and regional LV functional parameters comparable to those of the 2D SSFP technique in substantially shorter scan times.

One explanation for this discrepancy is that lockdowns have left victims of domestic violence trapped in-home with their perpetrators, limiting their ability to safely report incidents to the police. To overcome this measurement problem, we propose a model-based algorithm for measuring temporal variation in domestic violence incidence using internet search activity and make precise the conditions under which this measure yields less biased estimates of domestic violence problem during periods of crisis than commonly used police-recorded crime measures. Analysing the COVID-19 lockdown in Greater London, we find a 40% increase in our internet search-based domestic violence index at the peak occurring 3?6 weeks into the lockdown, -seven to eight times larger than the increase in police-recorded crimes and much closer to the increase in helpline calls reported by victim support charities. Applying the same methodology to Los Angeles, we find strikingly similar results.

In this study, the interaction of theaflavin monogallate, a polyphenolic component of black tea, with camel milk lactoferrin was studied using various biophysical and computational techniques. Fluorescence quenching at different temperatures suggests that theaflavin monogallate interacted with lactoferrin by forming a non-fluorescent complex, i.e., static quenching. Theaflavin monogallate shows a significant affinity towards lactoferrin with a binding constant of 10(4)C10(5) M(?1) at different temperatures. ANS binding shows that the binding of polyphenol resulted in the burial of hydrophobic domains of lactoferrin. Moreover, thermodynamic parameters (H, S and G) suggested that the interaction between protein and polyphenol was entropically favored and spontaneous. Circular dichroism confirmed there was no alteration in the secondary structure of lactoferrin. The energy transfer efficiency (FRET) from lactoferrin to theaflavin was found to be approximately 50%, with a distance between protein and polyphenol of 2.44 nm. Molecular docking shows that the binding energy of lactoferrinCtheaflavin monogallate interaction was ?9.7 kcal mol(?1). Theaflavin monogallate was bound at the central cavity of lactoferrin and formed hydrogen bonds with Gln89, Tyr192, Lys301, Ser303, Gln87, and Val250 of lactoferrin.

Despite their uniformity, these measures may be differentially valuable for different countries. METHODS: We use a compartmental epidemiological model to project the spread of COVID-19 across policy scenarios in high- and low-income countries. We embed estimates of the welfare value of disease avoidance into the epidemiological projections to estimate the return to more stringent lockdown policies. RESULTS: Social distancing measures that 'flatten the curve' of the disease provide immense welfare value in upper-income countries. However, social distancing policies deliver significantly less value in lower-income countries that have younger populations, which are less vulnerable to COVID-19. Equally important, social distancing mandates a trade-off between disease risk and economic activity. Poorer people are less able to make those economic sacrifices. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological and welfare value of social distancing is smaller in lower-income countries and such policies may exact a heavy toll on the poorest and most vulnerable. Workers in the informal sector often lack the resources and social protections that enable them to isolate themselves until the virus passes. By limiting these households' ability to earn a living, social distancing can lead to an increase in hunger, deprivation, and related mortality and morbidity.","output":"The benefits and costs of social distancing in high- and low-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phosphoramidates composed of an amino acid and a nucleotide analog are critical metabolites of prodrugs, such as remdesivir.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Three surgeons with previous experience in LESS performed 12 nephrectomies in six pigs. In all procedures, a multichannel access device (X-CONE) and a 5-mm extra-long telescope were used. Four sets of prebent instruments with different profiles (S-portal) were tested: Standard (one straight scissors and one curved grasper), Cuschieri, Carus, and Leroy set (each of them consisting of two curved instruments with different configurations). Assessment was performed based on both objective (procedure time; time to manage the pedicle; time to free kidney) and subjective parameters (entry/exit of instruments; triangulation; dissection up/down; dissection lateral; retraction; interdependence). The subjective assessment tool used was a Likert type scale (1 = easy to 5 = prohibitive). The access device was assessed by using objective (time to complete insertion of device after skin incision) and subjective (significant air leakage, movement constraint) parameters. RESULTS Time to insertion of the X-CONE was <1 minute in all the cases. Surgeons reported significant insufflant leakage in 58% of cases. The procedure was completed in 10/12 (83%) cases. Mean operative time was 8.3  4.2 minutes, being lower for the Carus group (4.5 min) and higher for the standard group (13 min).

Critically ill cases of COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failures. However, no effective drugs have been available till now, leading to more than 300,000 deaths up to 29 April 2020. Here, we present a critically ill case utilizing umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCB-MSCs). CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old man was admitted, with the diagnosis of COVID-19, ARDS, type-2 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, renal insufficiency, and hypertension. His clinical condition continually developed to be life-threatening even receiving various treatment options including antiviral therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Between 28 February and 8 March 2020, the patient was given 5-time intravenous infusions of UCB-MSCs. His hematological and biochemical indexes, including lymphocytes and renal function improved. Pulmonary static compliance increased significantly and PaO2/FiO2 ratio maintained stable. On March 10, he received lung transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Our current findings suggested that UCB-MSCs therapy may show some positive effect in treating critical COVID-19 to some extent, for its delaying deterioration of the disease and efficacy in respiratory and renal function, though limited.","output":"Umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells in treating a critically ill COVID-19 patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Recently, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) was widely used in the perioperative management of gastric cancer. The study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ERAS in single-incision laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (SIDG). MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 90 patients who received laparoscopic gastric cancer resection were divided into 3 groups: group A (n=30), underwent traditional multiport laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with conventional perioperative management; group B (n=30) underwent traditional multiport laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with ERAS concept; and group C (n=30), underwent SIDG with ERAS concept. Clinical data and gut function were assessed in 3 groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in terms of postoperative complication, number of resected lymph nodes and blood loss among 3 groups. However, operation time was longer (P=0.003) and treatment cost was higher (P<0.001) in group C than that in group A and B. Group C had faster recovery of bowel function (P<0.001), shorter postoperative hospital stay (P=0.002), and less postoperative complication (P=0.044) than those in group A. There were no significant differences in terms of recovery of bowel function and postoperative hospital stay between group C and B (all P>0.05). The white blood cell counts were lower than group A and B (all P<0.05) and C-reactive protein in group C were lower than group A (P<0.05) and B (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that SIDG with ERAS may be a feasible and safe procedure for early gastric cancer because it provides a favorable cosmetic result while not compromising postoperative complications, number of resected lymph nodes, and blood loss.","output":"Application of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery in Single-incision Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the health systems of many countries worldwide. Several studies have suggested that the pandemic affects not only physical health but also all aspects of society. A lot of information has been reported about the disease since the beginning of the outbreak. For that reason, it is essential to investigate the attitudes and level of knowledge and awareness that different populations had regarding COVID-19 during the critical period of the outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the knowledge and awareness of and attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic among different populations in Central China during the critical period of the outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in Central China from February to March 2020. The study participants included three different populations: medical workers, students, and those with other occupations. In this study, a questionnaire was designed to collect information on the following four aspects: sociodemographic information, knowledge related to COVID-19, awareness of COVID-19, and attitude toward COVID-19. The chi-square test and Fisher test were used for comparison among groups. The level of significance was set at P<.05. RESULTS: This study enrolled a total of 508 participants. Among them, there were 380 students (74.8%), 39 medical workers (7.7%), and 89 people with other occupations (17.5%). Most of the participants were female (n=272, 53.5%), lived in rural areas (n=258, 50.8%), and were single (n=423, 86.9%). The majority of the respondents had attended college (n=454, 89.4%). Most of the participants said they had heard about COVID-19 by January, and most of them looked for information on social media (Sina Weibo, 84.7%), and WeChat and QQ groups (74.2%). The participants showed an adequate level of knowledge about COVID-19 with no significant differences among the groups. However, medical workers demonstrated a slightly advanced knowledge in their responses to professional questions such as the potential susceptible population, possible host, treatment of COVID-19, and disease category. A higher proportion of medical workers (71.8%) and those in the other occupations group (52.8%) were highly concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 43% of the participants stated that the lockdown of their village/city had a significant impact on their lives. Nevertheless, the majority of respondents had an overall optimistic attitude toward the control of the disease (92.1% of students [n=350], 94.9% of medical workers [n=37], and 92.3% of those in other occupations [n=83]). CONCLUSIONS: All three groups reported an adequate background knowledge about COVID-19 but medical workers showed a slightly advanced knowledge in their responses to professional questions. Most of the participants were highly concerned about COVID-19 during the critical period of the outbreak. The majority of respondents declared that the village/city lockdown policy had a significant impact on their daily life but most of them held an optimistic attitude toward the control of COVID-19.","output":"Knowledge, Awareness, and Attitudes Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Different Populations in Central China: Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantitatively describing the time course of the SARS-CoV-2 infection within an infected individual is important for understanding the current global pandemic and possible ways to combat it.

Therefore, it is likely that individuals with chronic diseases may worry during this pandemic to the detriment of their mental health. This study compares the mental health of Bangladeshi adults affected by chronic disease to a healthy, matched control group during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A matched case-control analysis was performed with data collected from 395 respondents with chronic diseases and 395 controls matched for age, gender, and residence. Inclusion criteria for cases were respondents who self-reported having asthma, cardiovascular disease symptoms and/or diabetes. Respondents were recruited using an online survey, which included the DASS-21 measure to assess symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Chi-square test, t-test, Fisher's exact test and a conditional logistic regression were performed to examine associations among variables. RESULTS The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms and the level of stress were significantly higher among cases (59%; 71.6%; 73.7%, respectively) than among controls (25.6%; 31.1%; 43.3%, respectively). Chi-square and t-test showed significant associations and differences between having chronic diseases and mental health outcomes. A conditional logistic regression showed that respondents with asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease symptoms, or any combination of these diseases had higher odds of exhibiting symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression than healthy individuals. CONCLUSION These results underscore a subpopulation vulnerable to mental health consequences during this pandemic and indicate the need for additional mental health resources to be available to those with chronic diseases.","output":"Mental Health Outcomes of Adults with Comorbidity and Chronic Diseases during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Matched Case-Control Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent times, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a growing concern which has taken the world by surprise.

It mainly attacks people's respiratory system. Many patients with severe COVID-19 require a ventilator to support breathing, and their lung function is often impaired to varying degrees after ventilator weaning. Acupuncture has been reported to improve respiratory function, but there is no evidence that it can improve respiratory function in ventilator users with COVID-19 after they are removed from the machine. The protocol of the systematic review and meta-analysis will clarify safety and effectiveness of acupuncture on respiratory rehabilitation after weaning from the ventilator during the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: We will search PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, Wanfang Database, Clinical Trials and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. Relevant English language and Chinese language literature will be included. A combination of subject words and free text words will be applied in the searches. The complete process will include study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and meta-analyses.

For cotton cellulose, cross-linking with PVA more than doubled the water uptake, up to 7.3 g/g. A significant enhancement was also obtained in the case of pulps, up to 9.6 g/g, and in the case of paper, to 11.9 g/g.

Moreover, we identified the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) as the potential target gene of miR-4485, and showed that reduction of TLR-4 induced by miR-4485 suppresses osteoblastic differentiation in vitro. Taken together, our findings highlight that up-regulation of miR-4485 is responsible for the suppression of osteogenic differentiation in COVID-19 patients, and TLR-4 is the potential target through which miR-4485 acts, providing a promising target for pro-fracture-healing and anti-osteoporosis therapy in COVID-19 patients.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-induced Overexpression of miR-4485 Suppresses Osteogenic Differentiation and Impairs Fracture Healing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Iran is the country in Western Asia most impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak.

Large-scale spread within China and internationally led the World Health Organization to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30(th) January 2020. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 virus infection include asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory symptoms, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure, and even death. There are no antivirals of proven clinical efficacy in coronavirus infections. Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue, has inhibitory effects on animal and human highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, in in vitro and in vivo experiments. It is also inhibitory against the COVID-19 virus in vitro. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in adult patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: The protocol is prepared in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines. This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. Adults ( 18 years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 virus infection, severe pneumonia signs or symptoms, and radiologically confirmed severe pneumonia are randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenously administered remdesivir or placebo for 10 days. The primary endpoint is time to clinical improvement (censored at day 28), defined as the time (in days) from randomization of study treatment (remdesivir or placebo) until a decline of two categories on a six-category ordinal scale of clinical status (1 = discharged; 6 = death) or live discharge from hospital. One interim analysis for efficacy and futility will be conducted once half of the total number of events required has been observed. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial in COVID-19. Enrolment began in sites in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 6(th) February 2020.

METHODS This large retrospective study compared the beneficial effects of perioperative infusion of DEX with propofol on the postoperative outcome after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. We reviewed patients' medical notes at Luoyang Central Hospital from 1st January 2012 to 31st December 2019. All continuous variables, if normally distributed, were presented as mean  SD; Otherwise, the non-normally distributed data and categorical data were presented as median (25-75 IQR) or number (percentage). The Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square test were used to evaluate the difference of variables between the DEX and propofol groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on the main related and differential factors in the perioperative period. RESULTS A total of 1388 patients were included in the study; of those, 557 patients received propofol infusion, and 831 patients received dexmedetomidine. DEX significantly reduced postoperative pulmonary complications compared with propofol, 7.82% vs 13.29%; P < 0.01, respectively. When compared with propofol, DEX significantly shortened the duration of mechanical lung ventilation, 18 (13,25) hours vs 21 (16,37) hours; P < 0.001, the length of stay in the intensive care unit, 51 (42,90) vs 59 (46,94.5) hours; P = 0.001 and hospital stay, 20 (17,24) vs 22 (17,28) days; P < 0.001, respectively. The incidences of postoperative wound dehiscence and infection were significantly reduced with DEX compared with propofol groups, 2.53% vs 6.64%; P < 0.001, respectively. Interestingly, patients receiving DEX had significantly shorter surgical time compared to propofol; 275 (240,310) vs 280 (250,320) minutes respectively (P = 0.005) and less estimated blood loss (P = 0.001).

We did not administer immunosuppressive drugs, such as high-dose corticosteroids or cyclophosphamide, because of the patient's condition. Following the last ICH, the patient died on the 90th day after symptom onset. An autopsy was performed. Histologically, abundant A? deposits were observed within the leptomeningeal and cortical arteries. Further dense-cored amyloid plaques were observed in the cortical samples. Our findings that ICH occurred initially three times in the left hemispheres and later five times in the right hemispheres were considered immune-mediated effects on vascular function. Further, superficial hemosiderosis in the left frontal lobe occurred before the first three ICH events, and hyperintensity of the white matter on MRI was identified in the right parietal lobe, a typical finding of CAA-ri.

Although great strides have been made in our understanding of the virusChost interactions in herbaceous model plants, the mechanisms underlying symptom development are poorly understood in perennial fruit crops. Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) causes variable symptoms in most vineyards worldwide. To better understand GFLV-grapevine interactions in relation to symptom development, field and greenhouse trials were conducted with a grapevine genotype that exhibits distinct symptoms in response to a severe and a mild strain of GFLV. After validation of the infection status of the experimental vines by high-throughput sequencing, the transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles in plants infected with the two viral strains were tested and compared by RNA-Seq and LC-MS, respectively, in the differentiating grapevine genotype. In vines infected with the severe GFLV strain, 1023 genes, among which some are implicated in the regulation of the hypersensitive-type response, were specifically deregulated, and a higher accumulation of resveratrol and phytohormones was observed. Interestingly, some experimental vines restricted the virus to the rootstock and remained symptomless. Our results suggest that GFLV induces a strain- and cultivar-specific defense reaction similar to a hypersensitive reaction. This type of defense leads to a severe stunting phenotype in some grapevines, whereas others are resistant. This work is the first evidence of a hypersensitive-like reaction in grapevine during virus infection.","output":"Severe Stunting Symptoms upon Nepovirus Infection Are Reminiscent of a Chronic Hypersensitive-like Response in a Perennial Woody Fruit Crop"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics, treatment strategies and prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with concurrent renal disease.

Recent postmortem investigations reveal renal involvement in COVID-19, and case reports describe collapsing glomerulopathy in African American patients with COVID-19. However, there is limited data regarding IgA nephropathy in the setting of COVID-19. Case presentation: In the present case, we report a 65-year old Chinese woman who presented with macroscopic hematuria, worsening proteinuria and decreased renal function after COVID-19 infection. She received a renal biopsy during COVID-19 infection. The renal biopsy revealed IgA nephropathy without any evidence for SARS-Cov-2.

These are not completely understood, but presumably, provide a clue to find ways to mitigate epidemics until strategies leading to its eradication become available. We describe an iteractive monitoring tool available in the internet. It enables inspection of the dynamic state of the epidemic in 187 countries using trajectories that visualize the transmission and removal rates of the epidemic and in this way bridge epi-curve tracking with modelling approaches. Examples were provided which characterize state of epidemic in different regions of the world in terms of fast and slow growing and decaying regimes and estimate associated rate factors. The basic spread of the disease is associated with transmission between two individuals every two-three days on the average. Non-pharmaceutical interventions decrease this value to up to ten days, whereas complete lock down measures are required to stop the epidemic. Comparison of trajectories revealed marked differences between the countries regarding efficiency of measures taken against the epidemic. Trajectories also reveal marked country-specific recovery and death rate dynamics. The results presented refer to the pandemic state in May to July 2020 and can serve as working instruction for timely monitoring using the interactive monitoring tool as a sort of seismometer for the evaluation of the state of epidemic, e.g., the possible effect of measures taken in both, lock-down and lock-up directions.

DATA SOURCES: For the purpose of collecting potentially eligible articles, we searched for articles in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and CNKI databases up to February 2017, using the following key words: corticosteroid, osteonecrosis of the femoral head, risk factors, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. STUDY SELECTION: Articles on relationships between corticosteroid and ONFH were selected for this review. Articles on the diagnosis, prognosis, and intervention of earlier-stage ONFH were also reviewed. RESULTS: The incidence of corticosteroid-induced ONFH was associated with high doses of corticosteroids, and underlying diseases in certain predisposed individuals mainly occurred in the first 3 months of corticosteroid prescription. The enhanced awareness and minimized exposure to the established risk factors and earlier definitive diagnosis are essential for the success of joint preservation. When following up patients with ONFH, treatment should be started if necessary. Surgical treatment yielded better results than conservative therapy in earlier-stage ONFH. The ideal purpose of earlier intervention and treatment is permanent preservation of the femoral head without physical restrictions in daily living. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should enhance their precaution awareness of corticosteroid-induced ONFH. For high-risk patients, regular follow-up is very important in the 1(st) year after high-dose prescription of corticosteroids.

We aimed to evaluate the psychological distress associated with work-related experiences among medical professionals and supporting staff during the pandemic outbreak. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between April and May 2020, employing a self-administered on-line questionnaire that included the collection of socio-demographic and professional status information, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and a subscale of the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) for empathy. A total of 364 professionals of the county-coordinated area responded. Descriptive statistics summarized the findings and a mediation model was analyzed, applying the causal step strategy. The specific direct and causal mediation effects were estimated with the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap sampling method. RESULTS: Anxiety, burnout, stress, resilience, and empathy proved to be significantly associated with both the professional category (ie, consultant, specialty doctor, trainee doctor, senior nurse, trainee nurse or other) and the perceived professional support (the nonparametric multivariate permutation test resulted in p=0.048 and p<0.001, respectively).

The major objective of the study was to analyze poverty of different countries of the world. Total 24 articles were downloaded from the net and read again and again and finally draw the conclusion and result. The result indicates that poverty is measure at different angle in the world but mostly human index are used for poverty measurement where life expectancy, education and per capita income is measured for poverty estimation. The World Bank say that if a person daily consumption is less than 1.90 dollar then he is considered poor. While some time poverty is measured in objective and subjective form. In objective form different variables are taken but in subjective form only feeling of the person is consider for poverty measurement. Similarly in absolute form the basic necessity of life is considered while in relative form only the median of the country income is counted and then the number is counted below the poverty line and divided by total population and percent poverty is estimated. Most recent estimates, in 2015, 10 percent of the worlds population or 734 million people lived on less than $1.90 a day. Thats down from nearly 36 percent or 1.9 billion people in 1990. However, due to the COVID-19 crisis as well as the oil price drop, this trend probably will reverse in 2020. World development report told that in 1990, forty three percent people lived below poverty line. An estimated 1.9 billion people lived in poverty in 1990, and that number fell to 1.2 billion in 2010. At present 9 percent in 2020 means an estimated 690 million people would be still living in extreme poverty. If reached, the world would have 510 million fewer people living in poverty in 2020, compared to a decade earlier. That would be the equivalent of half of the population of the continent of Africa, or more than double the population of Indonesia. Different record of the world measures the poverty at different angle. Now multidimensional factors are used for poverty measurement in the world. There education, literacy, income, food, house and clothes are countable item in poverty measurement. The Qatar per capita income in the world is 132,886 dollars and on the top while the Brundi per capita income is 727 dollars and below among 192 countries of the world. Taiwan has the lowest poverty rate worldwide C only 1.5 percent of Taiwans population lives in poverty, followed by Malaysia at 3.8 percent, Ireland at 5.5 percent, Austria at 6.2 percent, then Thailand and France at 7.8 percent, Switzerland at 7.9 percent, Canada at 9.4 percent, the Netherlands at 10.5 percent, and Saudi Arabia at 12.7 percent. The top ten poorest countries of the world are Mozambique, Liberia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Chad, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Niger. Poverty is a very serious evil in the world which decreases the economic growth of the world. The poor countries of the world everything is weak and because of this they mostly depend on rich countries of the world. Their saving, expenditure and income level are weak. These countries try for development while they never achieve their objectives. The World Bank and IMF have applied the strategy to reduce the poverty in the world and they have launched many programs for the reduction of poverty. Among these programs Million Development Goal program is the well known program which has played great role in the reduction of poverty. Now the world trend in poverty has decreased which was high in the past but due to covid-2019 again the poverty trend of the world was b raised. In different country the situation is different. The poverty in Pakistan was increased to 5 percent and it will be reached to 40%. The poverty is mostly link with economic growth in the world. In 2020 the economic growth of Pakistan is possible 2.4%, so it is very smallest growth in the world and because of this the poverty rate will be increased in 2020. China play great role in poverty reduction and now a day only few people are poor in this country China's poverty reduction performance has been even more striking. Between 1981 and 2004, the fraction of the population consuming below this poverty line fell from 65 percent to 10 percent, and the absolute number of poor fell from 652 million to 135 million, a decline of over half a billion people. The poverty trend in Afghanistan is also high. There the urban poverty is less than the rural area. Among provinces, Badghis, Nooristan, Kunduz, Zabul and Samangan are among the poorest regions, and Kabul, Panjsher, Kapisa, Logar and Pakitlka are the least poor. Herat houses the largest number of multidimensional poor people followed by Nangarhar, Kandahar, Kunduz and Faryab. Kabul is the least poor, but still, 4.5% of all poor people -nearly one out of 20 C live in Kabul.The measurement techniques of poverty are still confused in the world. If we simply consider a nation's gross domestic product (GDP)the sum total of all goods and services produced by a country during one year, then we would have to conclude that the richest nations are exactly the ones with the largest GDP: United States, China, Japan, and Germany. But how could the economies, for example, of San Marino or Luxembourg ever match that of such powerhouses when they are no more than tiny dots on the world map?. The main causes of poverty of the world are inequality and marginalization, conflict, hunger, malnutrition, and stunting, poor healthcare systems, little or no access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene, climate change, lack of education, poor public works and infrastructure, lack of government support, lack of reserves. On the basis of problems the study recommends that to improve the education system of the world;Infrastructure should be developed where is poverty;Hunger, malnutrition and stunting should be controlled;Health care system should be developed for poverty elevation;Clean water, Sanitation and good hygiene system should be provided to community of the world;School system should be developed;Government support should be provided in the time of emergency;Inequality and marginalization should be removed in the world;Free conflict world zone should be established;Livelihood source should be multiplied in the world.","output":"Analysis of Poverty of Different Countries of the World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its emergence from Wuhan at the end of last year, the novel coronavirus has spread to almost every country of the earth posing a significant challenge to healthcare systems everywhere This article presents a practical model adopted in light of the WHO guidelines which was used by our team to set up the facility and care for the 69 COVID-19 prisoners within the prison itself In addition to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 the healthcare team also had to overcome the challenge of the unique nature of the setup The purpose of this article is to describe our response to help providers tasked with caring for prisoners especially in lower socio-economic countries","output":"Setting up a COVID-19 care facility at a prison: An experience from Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a growing need for spatial privacy considerations in the many geo-spatial technologies that have been created as solutions for COVID-19-related issues.

Also, the proteins of viral replication hubs were related with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection in the risk individual. Additionally, the hub proteins were closely linked with other viral infection, including MERS and HCoVs which suggest similar infection pattern in SARS-CoV-2. We identified five interconnecting cascades between hubs of both networks that show the preparation of optimal environment in the host for viral replication process upon receptor attachment.

However, epidemiologic reports have suggested that nearly all highly severe or fatal adenoviral diseases in children are associated with HAdV-7 rather than HAdV-3. Here, we conduct in-depth investigations to confirm and extend these findings through a comprehensive series of assays in vitro and in vivo as well as clinical correlates. METHODS: A total of 8248 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were collected from hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections in Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from June 2009 to May 2015. Among 289 samples that tested positive for HAdVs, clinical data of 258 cases of HAdV-3 (127) and HAdV-7 (131) infections were analyzed. All HAdV-positive samples were classified by sequencing the hexon and fiber genes, and compared with clinical data and virological assays. We also performed in vitro assays of virus quantification, viral growth kinetics, competitive fitness, cytotoxicity and C3a assay of the two strains. Mouse adenovirus model was used to evaluate acute inflammatory responses. RESULTS: Clinical characteristics revealed that HAdV-7 infection caused more severe pneumonia, toxic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, longer mean hospitalization, significantly lower white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts, compared to those of HAdV-3. In cell culture, HAdV-7 replicated at a higher level than HAdV-3, and viral fitness showed significant differences as well. HAdV-7 also exhibited higher C3a production and cytotoxic effects, and HAdV-7-infected mice showed aggravated pathology and higher pulmonary virus loads, compared to HAdV-3-infected mice. Macrophages in BALF remained markedly high during infection, with concomitant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-1, IFN-, and IL-6), compared HAdV-3 infection. CONCLUSIONS: These results document that HAdV-7 replicates more robustly than HAdV-3, and promotes an exacerbated cytokine response, causing a more severe airway inflammation. The findings merit further mechanistic studies that offer the pediatricians an informed decision to proceed with early diagnosis and treatment of HAdV-7 infection.","output":"Human adenovirus type 7 infection causes a more severe disease than type 3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION This paper describes adverse events (AEs) temporally associated to the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccine observed in a reference center in S?o Paulo, Brazil, during a 2010 mass vaccination campaign.

Even before the pandemic, the rate of food insecurity in the United States was unusually high compared to other rich democracies, and rates have not improved substantially over the last 25 years. What explains the lack of progress in addressing food insecurity? This article maps out an overview of the experiences, causes, and consequences of food insecurity in the United States. We demonstrate that racism is a fundamental cause of food insecurity, both because racism contributes to racial disparities in income and wealth, and because racism is linked to food insecurity independent of poverty and socioeconomic status. For example, people of color are more likely to experience racial discrimination, which is associated with food insecurity, and to live in states where stricter regulations and harsher punishments are tied to social assistance programs, including food assistance programs. Because racism is a fundamental cause of food insecurity, eliminating it requires going beyond just eliminating poverty. Instead, the fundamental cause must be tackled directly: racism itself, which is built into the structure of American society and entrenched in its institutions. ? 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","output":"The structural roots of food insecurity: How racism is a fundamental cause of food insecurity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Psychiatric impact of COVID-19 is still explored and previous data suggest potential long-term risks of anxiety, depression and PTSD related to COVID-19 1,2,3. We aimed to explore the predictive value of risk factors during hospitalization for COVID-19 for anxiety, depression and PTSD and at three months because they could differ over these two time points. Methods: We performed a screening of mental suffering in hospitalized patients for COVID-19, as well as specialized care and three months longitudinal follow-up. We evaluated the prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD in survivors who benefited from early detection and treatment, during hospitalization for COVID-19 (T0) and three months after (T1) and assessed possible risk factors in adults surviving COVID-19 between the 30th March and the 1st of July 2020. Univariate and multivariate regressive linear model have been built to assess the factors associated with the post-traumatic stress disorder scale 5 (PCL5) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at T0, and T1. For the univariate model of HADS and post-traumatic stress disorder scale 5 (PCL5) at T1, we also included HADS and PCL5 at T0. We used STATA 15 for the statistical analyses. Results: A total of 364 patients were hospitalized between the 30th of March and 1st of July 2020 and of these, 109 patients were screened at T0 and 61 of these were reassessed at T1. During hospitalization, we found 44.9% pathological score on PDEQ, 14.6% with a score of PCL5 > 31 and three months after hospitalization, 10.6% of PCL5 score >31. Finally, PDEQ score at T0 was positively correlated to PCL5 score at T1 (=0.26, p=0.01) and that was confirmed in multivariate analysis (=0.04, p=0.02 for the log of PCL5 per point on the PDEQ). Female gender was associated with higher HADS-Depression score during hospitalization in both univariate and multivariate regression models (=0.58 for the log of HADS-D, p=0.019, data not shown, available upon request). Age  65 years old was associated with lower HADS-Depression at T0 (p=0.027) only in the univariate analysis. Psychiatric follow-up recorded at 1 month following hospitalization was associated with higher HADS-Anxiety score at T1 (=0.52, p=0.028) only in the multivariate analysis. In univariate analysis, PDEQ, HADS-Anxiety, HADS-Depression and PCL5 scores during hospitalization were correlated with PCL5 score at T1. Patients requiring an ICU stay, compared to those who did not, had significantly higher PDEQ score during hospitalization (24.1 versus 15.6, p = 0.0014), but a lower HADS-A score three months after hospitalization (5.3 vs 2.3, p=0.01) and a lower HADS-D score at T0 (5.4 vs 2.6, p=0.01). In the multivariate analysis using the log of the outcomes, ICU stay was associated with a lower PCL5 at T1 (=-1.24, p=0.012), a lower HADS-A at T1 (=-0.77, p=0.019), and lower HADS-D at T0 (=-1.03, p=0.004), and T1 (-1.06, p=0.023).

To our knowledge, there are no studies exploring experiences after second-degree tear. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the experiences of a second-degree vaginal tear regarding aspects of the recovery and need for healthcare and rehabilitation. METHODS Individual semi-structured interviews were performed and analysed with a qualitative, inductive descriptive approach. RESULTS A group of 18 women with a second-degree vaginal tear after delivery were included. Four main categories with associated subcategories were found: (1) feeling uncertainty, with subcategories: not knowing what is normal, concern, confusion and uncertainty regarding pelvic floor muscle training; (2) feeling of security, with subcategories: I have no/I can handle the symptoms, trust in the healthcare system and I have sufficient knowledge; (3) not prioritizing myself, with the subcategories: I cannot find time and others have bigger problems; (4) lack of trust in healthcare providers, with the subcategories: feeling forgotten, not being taken seriously, distrust of the competence of the healthcare providers and resignation. CONCLUSION Women who suffer from a second-degree vaginal tear after pregnancy can feel safe when needs are met but uncertainty is also common when available healthcare and information are perceived as insufficient.

Lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) are bioactive phospholipids elevated in inflammation. The aim of this study was to test whether LPA inhibits GLP-1 secretion in vitro and in vivo. GLUTag L-cells were treated with various LPA species, with or without LPA receptor (LPAR) antagonists, and media GLP-1 levels, cellular cyclic AMP and calcium ion concentrations, and DPP4 activity levels were analyzed. Mice were injected with LPA, with or without LPAR antagonists, and serum GLP-1 and DPP4 activity were measured. GLUTag GLP-1 secretion was decreased ~70-90% by various LPAs. GLUTag expression of Lpar1, 2, and 3 was orders of magnitude higher than Lpar4, 5, and 6, implicating the former group in this effect. In agreement, inhibition of GLP-1 secretion was reversed by the LPAR1/3 antagonist Ki16425, the LPAR1 antagonists AM095 and AM966, or the LPAR2 antagonist LPA2-antagonist 1. We hypothesized involvement of Gi-mediated LPAR activity, and found that intracellular cyclic AMP and calcium ion concentrations were decreased by LPA, but restored by Ki16425. Mouse LPA injection caused an ~50% fall in circulating GLP-1, although only LPAR1 or LPAR1/3 antagonists, but not LPAR2 antagonism, prevented this. GLUTag L-cell and mouse serum DPP4 activity was unchanged by LPA or LPAR antagonists. LPA therefore impairs GLP-1 secretion in vitro and in vivo through Gi-coupled LPAR1/3 signaling, providing a new mechanism linking inflammation with impaired GSIS.","output":"Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Secretion Is Inhibited by Lysophosphatidic Acid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection by SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 may elicit uncontrolled and damaging inflammatory responses.

Antibody kinetics during the acute phase are well studied, whereas the long-term kinetics are yet to be determined, with contradictory results from the studies to date. Here, we present a longitudinal analysis of the serological responses to a SARS-CoV-2 infection following convalescence and the association with post-COVID syndrome (PCS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 237 serum samples were prospectively collected from 61 participants who had had a SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was confirmed using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). For each participant, anti-nucleocapsid (N) and anti-spike subunit 1 receptor binding domain (RBD/S1) immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were regularly determined over a period of 8 months. COVID-19-associated symptoms were assessed using a standardized questionnaire at study entry and again after 6 months. RESULTS: Antibodies were detectable in 56 of the 61 participants. No substantial decline in anti-SARS-CoV-2 pan-Ig levels was observed for the duration of the follow-up period. Antibody levels correlated positively with the disease severity, body mass index, fever, and smoking status. It was found that 46.8% of the participants suffered from PCS, with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions being the most commonly reported symptoms. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate stable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and thus may indicate a long-lasting immunity. The results are in line with recently published data and provide further insight concerning asymptomatic to mildly-affected patients, the association with clinical features, and the frequency of PCS.","output":"Longitudinal assessment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics and clinical features following convalescence from a COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dromedary, or one-humped, camels Camelus dromedarius are an almost exclusively domesticated species that are common in arid areas as both beasts of burden and production animals for meat and milk. Currently, there are approximately 30 million dromedary camels, with highest numbers in Africa and the Middle East. The hardiness of camels in arid regions has made humans more dependent on them, especially as a stable protein source. Camels also carry and may transmit disease-causing agents to humans and other animals. The ability for camels to act as a point source or vector for disease is a concern due to increasing human demands for meat, lack of biosafety and biosecurity protocols in many regions, and a growth in the interface with wildlife as camel herds become sympatric with non-domestic species. We conducted a literature review of camel-borne zoonotic diseases and found that the majority of publications (65%) focused on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), brucellosis, Echinococcus granulosus, and Rift Valley fever. The high fatality from MERS outbreaks during 2012C2016 elicited an immediate response from the research community as demonstrated by a surge of MERS-related publications. However, we contend that other camel-borne diseases such as Yersinia pestis, Coxiella burnetii, and CrimeanCCongo hemorrhagic fever are just as important to include in surveillance efforts. Camel populations, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are increasing exponentially in response to prolonged droughts, and thus, the risk of zoonoses increases as well.

Many COVID-19 vaccines have been developed, including CoronaVac vaccines by Sinovac. Health care workers, along with medical clerkship students are the priority to receive the vaccine. However, the Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) of the CoronaVac remains unclear. This study aims to describe and analyze the adverse events following immunization (AEFI) of COVID-19 vaccination in medical students in clerkship programs. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a questionnaire to assess AEFI after CoronaVac vaccination among medical clerkship students. A Chi-Square test with 95 % of CI was used to determine whether gender correlated with symptoms of AEFI. RESULT: We identified 144 medical clerkship students. The most common AEFI of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations was localized pain in the injection site during the first dose with 25 (45 %) reports and the booster dose with 34 (67 %) reports. Then followed by malaise, the first dose with 20 (36 %) reports and the booster dose with 21 (41 %) reports. Other symptoms like headache, fever, shivering, sleepiness, nausea, dysphagia, and cold were also reported.

Effective treatment approaches for this post-COVID syndrome (PCS) are crucially needed. Methods: : Three previously healthy females (ages 34, 39, and 38) who contracted COVID-19 in Spring 2020 and subsequently developed PCS received monitored aerobic exercise combined with supplemental oxygen beginning seven or eight months following acute-illness. Pre- and post-treatment exercise tolerance was tested using the Bensen treadmill protocol. Treatment consisted of 22 sessions of graduated treadmill exercise during which 6 liters of continuous oxygen was delivered via nasal canula. Findings: All patients demonstrated ~54% improvement in exercise tolerance, improvement in heart rate and systolic blood pressure response during exercise, and remission or improvement of symptoms, including cough, dyspnea on exertion, laryngeal inflammation, chest discomfort, fatigue, and/or post-exertional malaise. Interpretation: We show that measured, monitored exercise combined with supplemental oxygen improved lingering symptoms in three female PCS patients. Supplemental oxygen may reduce post-exercise inflammation, therefore providing the benefits of exercise while reducing the likelihood of PCS symptom exacerbation. Due to the variable nature of PCS, it is crucial to individualize treatment protocols and to continually evaluate and modify each protocol based upon individual patient response.

First unconstrained methods are revisited and they are shown to correspond to the application of a linear filter followed by a nonlinear estimate of the effective reproduction number after a change-of-coordinates. Unconstrained methods often fail to keep the estimated variables within their physical range and can lead to unreliable estimates that require aggressively smoothing the raw data. In order to overcome these shortcomings a constrained estimation method is proposed that keeps the model variables within pre-specified boundaries and can also promote smoothness of the estimates. Constrained estimation can be directly applied to raw data without the need of pre-smoothing and the associated loss of information and additional lag. It can also be easily extended to handle additional information, such as the number of infected individuals. The resulting problem is cast as a convex quadratic optimization problem with linear and convex quadratic constraints. It is also shown that both unconstrained and constrained methods when applied to death data are independent of the fatality rate.

We used quantitative pedigree-based (Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction or ABLUP) and genomic-based (Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction or GBLUP) approaches to examine the heritability estimates associated with water stress tolerance in P. radiata. Tree seedling growth traits, foliar carbon isotope composition (13C), and dark-adapted chlorophyll fluorescence (Y) were monitored before, during and after 10 months of water stress. Height growth showed a constant and moderate heritability level, while the heritability estimate for diameter growth and 13C decreased with water stress. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence exhibited low heritability after 5 and 10 months of water stress. The GBLUP approach provided less breeding value accuracy than ABLUP, however, the relative selection efficiency of GBLUP was greater compared with ABLUP selection techniques. Although there was no significant relationship directly between 13C and Y, the genetic correlations were significant and stronger for GBLUP. The positive genetic correlations between 13C and tree biomass traits under water stress indicated that intraspecific variation in 13C was likely driven by differences in the genotype's photosynthetic capacity. The results show that foliar 13C can predict P. radiata genotype tolerance to water stress using ABLUP and GBLUP approaches and that such approaches can provide a faster screening and selection of drought-tolerant genotypes for forestry breeding programs.","output":"Genetic Variation in Drought-Tolerance Traits and Their Relationships to Growth in Pinus radiata D.

However, the current practice in TB therapeutics trials is to use composite binary outcomes, which in the absence of standardization may inflate false positive and negative errors in evaluating regimens. The lack of standardization of outcomes is a barrier to the identification of highly efficacious regimens and the introduction of innovative methodologies METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of trials designed to advance new pulmonary TB drugs or regimens for regulatory approval and inform practice guidelines. Trials were primarily identified from the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP). Only trials that collected post-treatment follow-up data and enrolled at least 100 patients were included. Protocols and Statistical Analysis Plans (SAP) for eligible trials from 1995 to the present were obtained from trial investigators. Details of outcome data, both explicit and implied, were abstracted and organized into three broad categories: favorable, unfavorable, and not assessable. Within these categories, individual trial definitions were recorded and collated, and areas of broad consensus and disagreement were identified and described. RESULTS: From 2205 trials in any way related to TB, 51 were selected for protocol and SAP review, from which 31 were both eligible and had accessible documentation. Within the three designated categories, we found broad consensus in the definitions of favorable and unfavorable outcomes, although specific details were not always provided, and when explicitly addressed, were heterogeneous. Favorable outcomes were handled the most consistently but were widely variable with respect to specification. In some cases, the same events were defined differently by different protocols, particularly in distinguishing unfavorable from not assessable events. Death was often interpreted as conditional on cause. Patients who did not complete the study because of withdrawal or loss to follow-up presented a particular challenge to consistent interpretation and analytic treatment of outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In a review of 31 clinical trials, we found that outcome definitions were heterogeneous, highlighting the need to establish clearer specification and a move towards universal standardization of outcomes across pulmonary TB trials.

In response to anticipated availability of a vaccine, the Detroit Health Department developed plans for a drive-through mass vaccination site to help distribute the vaccine to the citys population. We describe the Detroit City Mass Vaccination Site and its methods of recruitment, enrollment, site selection, and logistics. Discussion: Initial recruitment for vaccination was through traditional media means as well as the city of Detroits website. Interested individuals were instructed to call a dedicated scheduling line in addition to separate numbers for general inquiries and SMS based inquiries for vaccination sites. Individuals were provided appointments on the hour for both doses at the appropriate interval during the initial conversation. Methods: The TCF Conference Center was selected due to its central location, vicinity to the citys vaccine storage site, capacity for large number of vehicles, protection from the elements, and availability. As vehicles arrived for appointments, they went through multiple checkpoints for confirmation of appointment and consent for treatment. Detroit police traffic control units aided with traffic-flow and vehicles were queued into two floors with a total of 27 lanes. On-site pharmacy was responsible for drawing, preparation, and delivery of vaccine doses to each lane. Once vehicles were confirmed for appointment and consent reviewed the vaccine was administered and vehicles remained in line for an observation period. Vaccine administration was documented on a CDC Vaccination Card and consent form was delivered to data entry workers from the Detroit Health Department for entry into the Michigan Care Improvement Registry (MCIR). On-site EMS supervisor, EMS teams, and an on-site physician and were available for medical response. After observation, vehicles were directed by security for egress. Results: To date, the TCF Center Mass Vaccination site accounts for over 220,000 doses administered with 62.0% of those doses given to individuals identifying as Black/African American, 31.9% identify as White and 6.0% identifying as another race. Conclusion: As vaccination studies showed promise for efficacy, the City of Detroit developed and implemented a mass vaccination site to help to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the city. Multiple public and private partners assisted in the effort. While only a piece of the necessary response, to date we have provided in excess of 250,000 doses of vaccine and this model has proven effective at providing mass vaccination while the population remains vaccine limited.","output":"366 Detroit City Mass Vaccination Site Template"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In 2017, The Respectful and Equitable Access to Comprehensive Healthcare (REACH) Program at Mount Sinai Hospital became a registered Opioid Overdose Prevention Program (OOPP) and received funding from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to develop a program to provide overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) training to at risk population and bystanders. We report on the programmatic quality improvement initiatives conducted. Methods: From April 2017 to December 2020, the REACH OOPP conducted 290 opioid overdose reversal trainings, throughout the Mount Sinai Health System and in multiple other community settings. OEND training was at times offered alone and in other settings alongside Hepatitis C Virus point of care testing. Additionally, a train the trainer model was implemented whereby medical students and nurses at outpatient clinics were trained to train others. Results: There were 4235 naloxone kits distributed to 3,906 participants. The training venues included hospital settings (patients and medical staff), public events, substance use programs, educational facilities, homeless prevention programs, faith-based organizations, alternative to incarceration programs, and community-based organizations. We implemented two types of training. During outreach sessions, we utilized one-on-one personalized sessions to train bystanders. When training clinic staff in the train the trainer model we utilized a standardized didactic presentation with slides. The two top reasons participants reported for being trained were Just in case I see someone overdose (59.3%) and I'm worried that someone I know will overdose OR that I will overdose (20.2%). Conclusion: The REACH program at Mount Sinai Hospital developed an effective model to train community bystanders and health care staff by leveraging administrative support and building on broader programmatic initiatives to promote drug user health and stigma-free care for people who use drugs. Hospitals do not currently mandate staff training or keeping naloxone stocked at inpatient units or outpatients clinics posing a challenge when implementing an OEND program in this setting. A recommended policy change needed to decrease overdose deaths is for hospitals to be required to implement systematic naloxone education and access for all health care personal and at risk patients.","output":"Community Case Study of Naloxone Distribution by Hospital-Based Harm Reduction Program for People Who Use Drugs in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The covid-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented professional and personal challenges for the oncology community. Under the auspices of the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists, we conducted an online national survey to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the medical oncology community in Canada. Methods: An English-language multiple-choice survey, including questions about demographics, covid-19 risk, use of personal protective equipment (ppe), personal challenges, and chemotherapy management was distributed to Canadian medical oncologists. The survey was open from 30 March to 4 April 2020, and attracted 159 responses. Results: More than 70% of medical oncologists expressed moderate-to-extreme concern about personally contracting covid-19 and about family members or patients (or both) contracting covid-19 from them. Despite that high level of concern, considerable variability in the use of ppe in direct cancer care was reported at the time of this survey, with 33% of respondents indicating no routine ppe use at their institutions and 69% indicating uncertainty about access to adequate ppe. Of the respondents, 54% were experiencing feelings of nervousness or anxiety on most days, and 52% were having feelings of depression or hopelessness on at least some days. Concern about aging parents or family and individual wellness represented the top personal challenges identified. The management of cancer patients has been affected, with adoption of telemedicine reported by 82% of respondents, and cessation of clinical trial accrual reported by 54%.

No effective approaches are found as yet for the therapy and epidemiological control of this new virus. For this purpose, we searched the literature in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, and MeSH, from all years of study until 23rd of October 2020, for articles and abstracts describing SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, pneumonia, clinical trials, drug, treatment, and medicine. AREAS COVERED The present study aimed to comprehensively overview of the current literature on effective anti- SARS-CoV-2 drugs. EXPERT OPINION Since the beginning of this pandemic disease, many studies have been conducted to find effective drugs to prevent COVID-19, because there are no specific drugs for the treatment of this disease. Most of these drugs with the antiviral potential effect toward COVID-19 are already used as the treatment of other infectious diseases. Some drugs that show the promising therapeutic potential in the initial clinical studies include remdesivir as an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and favipiravir as an inhibitor of virus replication. Currently, remdesivir received the FDA authorizes to use as an experimental drug for emergency use in COVID-19 patients.","output":"An effective drug against COVID-19: reality or dream?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Treatment of hip fractures during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed unique challenges for the management of COVID-19-infected patients and the maintenance of standards of care. The primary endpoint of this study is to compare the mortality rate at 1 month after surgery in symptomatic COVID-positive patients with that of asymptomatic patients. A secondary endpoint of the study is to evaluate, in the two groups of patients, mortality at 1 month on the basis of type of fracture and type of surgical treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this retrospective multicentre study, we reviewed the medical records of patients hospitalised for proximal femur fracture at 14 hospitals in Northern Italy. Two groups were formed: COVID-19-positive patients (C+ group) presented symptoms, had a positive swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and received treatment for COVID-19; COVID-19-negative patients (C? group) were asymptomatic and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The two groups were compared for differences in time to surgery, survival rate and complications rate. The follow-up period was 1 month. RESULTS: Of the 1390 patients admitted for acute care for any reason, 477 had a proximal femur fracture; 53 were C+ but only 12/53 were diagnosed as such at admission. The mean age was > 80 years, and the mean American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score was 3 in both groups. There was no substantial difference in time to surgery (on average, 2.3 days for the C+ group and 2.8 for the C? group). As expected, a higher mortality rate was recorded for the C+ group but not associated with the type of hip fracture or treatment. No correlation was found between early treatment (< 48 h to surgery) and better outcome in the C+ group. CONCLUSIONS: Hip fracture in COVID-19-positive patients accounted for 11% of the total. On average, the time to surgery was > 48 h, which reflects the difficulty of maintaining normal workflow during a medical emergency such as the present pandemic and notwithstanding the suspension of non-urgent procedures. Hip fracture was associated with a higher 30-day mortality rate in COVID-19-positive patients than in COVID-19-negative patients. This fact should be considered when communicating with patients and/or their family. Our data suggest no substantial difference in hip fracture management between patients with or without COVID-19 infection. In this sample, the COVID-19-positive patients were generally asymptomatic at admission; therefore, routine screening is recommended.

How individuals and populations cope with extreme climatic events will influence their capacity to adapt and persist. Here, we analyzed how drought impacted eastern grey kangaroo populations by focusing on their body condition, demography, activity rates at water points, and the likelihood of parasitic infections. We found that body condition was lower as environmental conditions became more extreme and that fewer males in the population were observed. The proportion of juveniles within the population increased as more favorable conditions returned. Kangaroos with poor body conditions were more likely to become hosts to ticks, while higher parasite egg burdens in scats occurred in autumn. Our study has shown that the impacts eastern grey kangaroos face during climatic events such as drought can be severe and may have long-term consequences. ABSTRACT: Extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods are expected to become more intense and severe under climate change, especially in the southern and eastern parts of Australia. We aimed to quantify the relationship between body condition scores (BCS), demography, activity rate, and parasitic infections of eastern grey kangaroos on a large conservation property under different climate extremes by employing camera traps established at artificial water points (AWPs). The survey period included a severe drought, broken by a significant flooding event. Climatic and environmental conditions were documented using remotely sensed indices of moisture availability and vegetation productivity. These conditions were found to affect all health and population parameters measured. BCS, juvenile proportions, and sex ratios were most correlated with 6-month lags in climatic conditions, while the activity rate of kangaroos at AWPs was most correlated with vegetation productivity. Ticks were mostly found on individuals with a poorer BCS, while the concentration of parasitic eggs in feces was higher in autumn than in spring. Our study offers a glimpse into some of the environmental drivers of eastern grey kangaroo populations and their health, information that may become increasingly important in todays climate. It further emphasizes the importance of this knowledge for wildlife conservation efforts appropriate to managing the impact of climate change alongside other threats.","output":"The Impacts of Drought on the Health and Demography of Eastern Grey Kangaroos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNSTRUCTURED: In March 2020, WHO has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic has affected various public health functions and essential services in different ways and magnitude. Although all countries have witnessed the effect of COVID-19, the impact differed based on many different factors including the integrity and resiliency of the countries' health systems. This paper presents opinions and expectations of the authors about the anticipated changes in the future of public health at the global, regional, and national levels. The viewpoint is based on the current efforts and challenges that various stakeholders have carried out to control COVID-19, and the contribution from the literature on the future of public health. Numerous agencies and actors are involved in the fight against COVID-19 with variations in their effectiveness. The public health services showed weaknesses in most of the countries, in addition to the lack of adequate curative medicine settings. The pandemic highlighted the need for better governance and stronger and more resilient health systems and capacities. COVID-19 experience has also emphasized the importance of coordination and collaboration among the countries and stakeholders. The COVID-19 pandemic might lead to a wide discussion to improve international and national approaches to prepare for and respond to similar events in terms of preparedness and response mechanisms, and tools. Public health will not be the same as before COVID-19. New health priorities, approaches, and new agenda will be on the table of the global platforms and initiatives.

A before-after study was performed to evaluate the effect of addition of corticosteroids to our institution's COVID-19 treatment protocol on hospital mortality. A total of 257 patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis were included in this study between 3 March 2020 and 14 April 2020. As corticosteroids were widely used after 27 March 2020, two periods were considered for the purposes of this study: the 'before' period from 3-20 March 2020 (n = 85); and the 'after' period from 26 March-14 April 2020 (n = 172).

They would aim to protect globally against pandemic influenza viruses that have not yet evolved. Thus they differ from seasonal vaccines to influenza virus, which are updated annually in spring to incorporate the latest circulating viruses, and are then produced and delivered before the peak influenza season starts in late fall and winter. The efficacy of seasonal vaccines is linked to their ability to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies, which provide subtype-specific protection against influenza A viruses. If pandemic vaccines were designed to resemble current vaccines in terms of composition and mode of action, they would have to be developed, tested, and mass-produced after the onset of a pandemic, once the causative virus had been identified. The logistic problems of generating a pandemic vaccine from scratch, conducting preclinical testing, and producing billions of doses within a few months for global distribution are enormous and may well be insurmountable. Alternatively, the scientific community could step up efforts to generate a universal vaccine against influenza A viruses that provides broadly cross-reactive protection through the induction of antibodies or T cells to conserved regions of the virus.","output":"Pandemic Influenza Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundCOVID-19 is overwhelming health systems universally.

RESULTS No significant differences in dissection time, total procedure time, or size of the created preperitoneal space were found between the groups. Balloons in group B had a significantly higher internal pressure compared to balloons in group C. None of the balloons ruptured during the experiment. Three animals in group C had balloon-related peritoneal lacerations. Despite a higher individual device cost, group B had a lower procedure cost over the entire experiment.

A nucleotide sequence alignment showed that the whole genome of CHN-JS-2017 is 97.4%C99.6% identical to other PDCoV strains. The pathogenicity of the CHN-JS-2017 strain was investigated in orally inoculated five-day-old piglets; the piglets developed acute, watery diarrhea, but all recovered and survived. CHN-JS-2017 infection-induced microscopic lesions were observed, and viral antigens were detected mainly by immunohistochemical staining in the small intestine.

Risk prediction models were established using backward stepwise variable selection and likelihood ratio tests and were internally validated using split-sample methods. RESULTS The overall incidence of pneumothorax was 30.2% (77/255). ICC insertion was required for 8.32% (21/255) of all procedures. The significant independent risk factors for pneumothorax were lesions not in contact with pleura (P < 0.001), a shorter skin-to-pleura distance (P = 0.01), the needle crossing a fissure (P = 0.004) and emphysema (P = 0.01); those for ICC insertion for pneumothorax were a needle through emphysema (P < 0.001) and lesions in the upper lobe (P = 0.017). AUC of the predictive models for pneumothorax and ICC insertion were 0.800 (95% CI: 0.745-0.856) and 0.859 (95% CI: 0.779-0.939) respectively. Upon internal validation, AUC of the testing sets of pneumothorax and ICC insertion were 0.769 and 0.822 on average respectively. CONCLUSION The complication rates of pneumothorax and ICC insertion after CT-guided lung biopsy at our institution are comparable to results from previously reported studies.

Given shared vulnerability to these public health crises, it is critical to understand how COVID-19 impacts substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and recovery among people with these characteristics. The current study examined COVID-19's perceived impact on treatment factors and psychosocial outcomes by sociodemographic vulnerability. Patients receiving SUD treatment with a history of opioid misuse were recruited. Participants completed self-report questionnaires regarding the impact of COVID-19 on treatment indicators and mood and substance use symptoms. Most participants reported that COVID-19 decreased their treatment access and quality. There were no sociodemographic differences in treatment factors. Those with high sociodemographic vulnerability reported greater pandemic-related increases in depression and demonstrated greater mood symptoms. Post-hoc analyses demonstrated that unmet basic needs were significantly associated with lower treatment access and quality, greater mood symptoms, and higher substance use. Findings suggest pandemic-related stressors and barriers affected those across the sociodemographic spectrum. Treatment systems must address socioeconomic barriers to care exacerbated by the pandemic and bolster integrated treatment options for opioid use and mood disorders.","output":"Opioid Use Disorder and COVID-19: Treatment and Recovery Factors among Vulnerable Populations at the Intersection of Two U.S. Epidemics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Physical activity (PA) favourably affects various health outcomes in cancer survivors, but little is known about how to implement a PA programme in primary care.

This study aimed to access the impact of COVID-19 worry on the mental health of the economically active population (EAP) in a province of China. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey study was conducted during an outbreak of COVID-19 in Guangdong, China. The survey used the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to evaluate participants' mental health status and was completed by 1,584 of the 1,708 participants (a response rate of 92.74%). Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models were used to identify the correlation between COVID-19 worry and mental health. RESULTS: Approximately 42.05% of participants reported that they were very worried or extremely worried about the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 worry was negatively correlated with mental health (p < 0.01) and exhibited a stronger influence on the mental health of participants who were male, younger (aged 16C45), or unemployed than on the mental health of participants who were women, older (aged over 45), or employed. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that COVID-19 worry has generated new inequalities in mental health among the EAP of China.

Emergence of COVID-19 put added pressure on caregivers. AIMS The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological health of Iranian caregivers of children with CP and associated risks during a lockdown period. METHODS Using online snowball sampling, 160 caregivers of children with CP participated in this web-based cross-sectional study. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), Caregiver Difficulties Scale (CDS), and a demographic questionnaire were administered. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was applied to identify risk factors related to caregiver psychological health. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS Mental health problems were prevalent; (depression = 45.0% and anxiety = 40.6%). Significant correlations were found between CDS and HADS-Anxiety (r = 0.472, P < 0.001), HADS-depression (r = 0.513, P < 0.001), and perceived stress (PSS) related to COVID-19 (r = 0.425, P < 0.001). After controlling for demographic and clinical variables, burden (CDS) was found to significantly predict caregiver anxiety, depression and stress. Furthermore, several demographic characteristics (being married, low educational level and low income) were significantly related to high HADS Anxiety scores. For depression, only having a physical problem was significantly related to HADS among demographic variables. No significant correlations were found between PSS-4 and demographic variables. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS During COVID-19 outbreak, the mental health of caregivers of children with CP is affected by multiple factors such as burden of care and demographic characteristics.

Biomarkers that indicate the clinical efficacy of RNS-ideally before device implantation-are critically needed, but challenges include the intrinsic heterogeneity of the RNS patient population and variability in clinical management across epilepsy centers. The aim of this study is to use a multicenter dataset to evaluate a candidate biomarker from intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings that predicts clinical outcome with subsequent RNS therapy. METHODS We assembled a federated dataset of iEEG recordings, collected prior to RNS implantation, from a retrospective cohort of 30 patients across three major epilepsy centers. Using ictal iEEG recordings, each center independently calculated network synchronizability, a candidate biomarker indicating the susceptibility of epileptic brain networks to RNS therapy. RESULTS Ictal measures of synchronizability in the high- band (95-105 Hz) significantly distinguish between good and poor RNS responders after at least 3 years of therapy under the current RNS therapy guidelines (area under the curve = .83). Additionally, ictal high- synchronizability is inversely associated with the degree of therapeutic response. SIGNIFICANCE This study provides a proof-of-concept roadmap for collaborative biomarker evaluation in federated data, where practical considerations impede full data sharing across centers. Our results suggest that network synchronizability can help predict therapeutic response to RNS therapy.

We established 3 cohorts of patients with severely uncontrolled diabetes and 3 cohorts of patients with severely uncontrolled hypertension using 2017, 2018, and 2019 data, then followed each cohort through the subsequent 15 months. For the diabetes cohorts, we generated quarterly counts of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) tests. For the hypertension cohorts, we generated monthly counts of blood pressure measurements. Finally, we assessed telehealth use among the 2019 diabetes and hypertension cohorts from January 2020 through March 2021.

Formulating an optimal distribution strategy under social and economic constraints is challenging. Optimal distribution is additionally constrained by the potential emergence of vaccine resistance. Analogous to chronic low-dose antibiotic exposure, recently inoculated individuals who are not yet immune play an outsized role in the emergence of resistance. Classical epidemiological modelling is well suited to explore how the behavior of the inoculated population impacts the total number of infections over the entirety of an epidemic. METHODS: A deterministic model of epidemic evolution is analyzed, with 7 compartments defined by their relationship to the emergence of vaccine-resistant mutants and representing three susceptible populations, three infected populations, and one recovered population. This minimally computationally intensive design enables simulation of epidemics across a broad parameter space. The results are used to identify conditions minimizing the cumulative number of infections. RESULTS: When an escape variant is only modestly less infectious than the originating strain within a na?ve population, there exists an optimal rate of vaccine distribution. Exceeding this rate increases the cumulative number of infections due to vaccine escape. Analysis of the model also demonstrates that inoculated individuals play a major role in the mitigation or exacerbation of vaccine-resistant outbreaks. Modulating the rate of host-host contact for the inoculated population by less than an order of magnitude can alter the cumulative number of infections by more than 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Mathematical modeling shows that optimization of the vaccination rate and limiting post-vaccination contacts can affect the course of an epidemic.

TIR significantly increased from the first (62%, SD 18%) to the second (65%, SD 16%) virtual visit (P=.02); this increase was more marked among patients using the traditional meter (n=11; baseline TIR=55%, SD 17% and follow-up TIR=66%, SD 13%; P=.01) than among those using CGM, and in those with a baseline GMI of &#8805;7.5% (n=46; baseline TIR=45%, SD 15% and follow-up TIR=53%, SD 18%; P<.001) than in those with a GMI of <7.5% (n=120; baseline TIR=68%, SD 15% and follow-up TIR=69%, SD 15%; P=.98). The only variable independently associated with TIR was the change of ongoing therapy. The unstandardized beta coefficient (B) and 95% CI were 5 (95% CI 0.7-8.0) (P=.02). The type of glucose monitoring device and insulin delivery systems did not influence glucometric parameters. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the structured virtual visits help maintain and improve glycemic control in situations where in-person visits are not feasible.","output":"Teleassistance for Patients With Type 1 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results of a Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (COVID-19) infection was reported in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread, becoming a global health emergency.

OBJECTIVE: The study aims to investigate and correlate the levels of anxiety, insomnia and Body Mass Index among nurses directly involved in the care of patients in the intensive care units with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHOD: An observatory study was conducted assessing and correlating the anxiety and insomnia levels and BMI values of each nurse before (until December 2019) and during (until May 2020) the pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 291 Italian nurses joined the study. There are no statistically significant differences between female nurses and male nurses for both groups of participants with or without anxiety (p=0.655). Female nurses with mild, moderate and severe insomnia levels were statistically more numerous than male nurses (p=0.025). For the same BMI differences, the levels of anxiety and insomnia were statistically significant between them (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Nurses engaged in the treatment of the most serious patients with Covid-19 are subjected to very high levels of stress due to the nature of the nursing job, shifting, poor rest, anxiety due to health emergency period and weight gain.","output":"Anxiety, Insomnia and Body Mass Index scores in Italian nurses engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Respiratory infections after HCT lead to significant morbidity, mortality, and health care costs due to pulmonary complications. In up to a third of patients following allogeneic HCT, infection can progress from an upper to a lower respiratory tract infection. Without vaccines or effective therapeutics for most viruses, very little can be done beyond supportive care. Objectives There is a need to identify risk factors for virus acquisition in HCT recipients in order to develop and implement better preventative interventions. Methods In a prospective study, 471 HCT patients enrolled between 2005 and 2010 underwent weekly PCR-based surveillance for RSV, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1-4, influenza A and B, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and adenovirus. Detailed weekly surveys were collected from subjects for up to 1 year post-transplant on symptoms and exposures to children under 10 years or sick contacts (within 3 feet for more than 1 hour total in the past week). We performed multivariable Cox regression analysis to identify risk factors associated with the time to first positive respiratory viral detection by PCR (asymptomatic and symptomatic) within the first 100 days HCT. Results In this cohort, 211 patients (45%) acquired a respiratory virus in the first 100 days after transplant. Of those infected, 88 (42%) were symptomatic with at least 2 respiratory symptoms. We found significantly higher risk of acquiring any respiratory viral infection for patients with underlying chronic leukemia compared with other hematologic malignancies [hazard ratio (HR) 1.79 (1.16 C 2.77)], exposure to children under or over 4 years [HR 1.84 (1.36 C 2.48)], exposure to contacts with cold symptoms [HR 1.47 (1.02 C 2.12)], exposure to systemic steroids [HR 1.49 (1.07 C 2.08)], and absolute monocyte counts < 100/L [HR 1.81 (1.12 C 2.94)]. Age, age of child exposure, gender, smoking history, season, conditioning regimen, donor relationship, cell source, presence of acute GVHD, albumin level, total IgG level, lymphocyte counts, and neutrophil counts were not associated with risk for acquisition. We also analyzed the association of these same variables with the time to first positive respiratory viral detection with symptomatic respiratory disease. We found that exposure to children [HR 1.56 (1.03 C 2.35)] and exposure to steroids [HR 1.59 (1.01 C 2.52)] remained associated with acquisition of symptomatic respiratory viral infection. Conclusions These data support the contribution of both exposure and immunologic determinants to the risk of respiratory viral acquisition with and without development of symptoms. Although many infections were asymptomatic, patients receiving steroids and those in close proximity to children may benefit from closer monitoring and counseling in the early post-transplant period.","output":"Early Respiratory Viral Acquisition after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus Corona merupakan bagian dari keluarga virus yang menyebabkan penyakit mulai dari flu hingga penyakit yang lebih berat.

The World Health Organization (WHO) named this virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the name of the disease Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans causes symptoms of acute respiratory distress. Current evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs primarily from person to person through direct indirect or close contact with an infected person through infected secretions. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection are through regular hand washing practicing coughing and sneezing etiquette avoiding direct contact. In addition to the suggestions above the government also recommends implementing the 4M Slogan to break the chain of the spread of COVID-19 namely by wearing masks washing hands maintaining distance and avoiding crowds. Based on the results of observations it was found that public knowledge about how to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is still low and the community lacks discipline in implementing health protocols. This community service aims to increase knowledge and skills regarding how to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 through the application of the 4M health protocol. The activity was carried out in Pegayut Village Ogan Ilir Regency in December 2020 which was attended by 35 people. The training begins with preparation distribution of leaflets explanation of the material using the question and answers lecture method demonstration and evaluation. The results in this community service were an increase in the knowledge of the village community about how to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 through the application of the 4M health protocol. The output achieved was an increase in public knowledge about how to avoid the transmission of COVID-19 and skills to wear masks and wash hands properly.

The main organ affected in this infection is the lung and the virus uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the target cells. In this context, a controversy raised regarding the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAAS) blockers, as these drugs might increase ACE2 expression in some tissues and potentially increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is specially concerning in diabetic patients as diabetes is a risk factor for COVID-19. METHODS: 12-week old diabetic mice (db/db) were treated with ramipril, or vehicle control for 8 weeks. Non-diabetic db/m mice were included as controls. ACE2 expression and activity were studied in lung, kidney and heart of these animals. RESULTS: Kidney ACE2 activity was increased in the db/db mice as compared to the db/m (143.2%  23 vs 100%  22.3% %, p=0.004), whereas ramipril had no significant effect. In the lung, no differences were found in ACE2 when comparing db/db mice to db/m and Ramipril also had no significant effect. In the heart, diabetes decreased ACE2 activity (83%  16.8%, vs 100%  23.1% p=0.02), and ramipril increased ACE2 significantly (83%  16.8% vs 98.2%  15%, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: In a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, ramipril had no significant effect on ACE2 activity in either kidneys or in the lungs. Therefore, it is unlikely that RAAS blockers or at least angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection through increasing ACE2.","output":"EFFECT OF RAMIPRIL ON KIDNEY, LUNG AND HEART ACE2 IN A DIABETIC MICE MODEL."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, coarse-grained (CG) models for two different sets of ionic liquids were developed from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) reference systems, expanding their system size and time duration capabilities.

The dynamics of each system were corrected using the probability distribution function-based coarse-grained molecular dynamics (PDF-based CGMD) method. The structure and dynamics of each system were proven to match reference system data at two temperature scales. CG models and force fields for these liquids were developed to exemplify a general purpose methodology for producing MD results of ionic liquids and other fluids with accurate structural as well as dynamic properties. As an application, developed ionic liquids CG models were then applied to study vacuum-interface interaction. Density profile results of vacuum-interface exposure show significant deviation from bulk behavior. At the interface, multilayer ordering of ionic liquids is predicted to be similar to those observed from an experimental work. This ordering is intensified by decreasing temperature and use of the PDF-based CGMD method as opposed to conventional CG methods.","output":"Coarse-Grained Dynamically Accurate Simulations of Ionic Liquids: [pyr14][TFSI] and [EMIM][BF4]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Technologies have been extensively implemented to provide health care services for all types of clinical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. While several reviews have been conducted regarding technologies used during the COVID-19 pandemic, they were limited by focusing either on a specific technology (or features) or proposed rather than implemented technologies. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide an overview of technologies, as reported in the literature, implemented during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) Extension for Scoping Reviews. Studies were retrieved by searching 8 electronic databases, checking the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews (backward reference list checking), and checking studies that cited included studies (forward reference list checking). The search terms were chosen based on the target intervention (ie, technologies) and the target disease (ie, COVID-19). We included English publications that focused on technologies or digital tools implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide health-related services regardless of target health condition, user, or setting. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of studies and extracted data from eligible papers. We used a narrative approach to synthesize extracted data. RESULTS: Of 7374 retrieved papers, 126 were deemed eligible. Telemedicine was the most common type of technology (107/126, 84.9%) implemented in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the most common mode of telemedicine was synchronous (100/108, 92.6%). The most common purpose of the technologies was providing consultation (75/126, 59.5%), followed by following up with patients (45/126, 35.7%), and monitoring their health status (22/126, 17.4%). Zoom (22/126, 17.5%) and WhatsApp (12/126, 9.5%) were the most commonly used videoconferencing and social media platforms, respectively. Both health care professionals and health consumers were the most common target users (103/126, 81.7%). The health condition most frequently targeted was COVID-19 (38/126, 30.2%), followed by any physical health conditions (21/126, 16.7%), and mental health conditions (13/126, 10.3%). Technologies were web-based in 84.1% of the studies (106/126). Technologies could be used through 11 modes, and the most common were mobile apps (86/126, 68.3%), desktop apps (73/126, 57.9%), telephone calls (49/126, 38.9%), and websites (45/126, 35.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Technologies played a crucial role in mitigating the challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We did not find papers describing the implementation of other technologies (eg, contact-tracing apps, drones, blockchain) during the first wave. Furthermore, technologies in this review were used for other purposes (eg, drugs and vaccines discovery, social distancing, and immunity passport). Future research on studies on these technologies and purposes is recommended, and further reviews are required to investigate technologies implemented in subsequent waves of the pandemic.","output":"Overview of Technologies Implemented During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted almost every part of human life worldwide, posing a massive threat to human health. The lack of time for new drug discovery and the urgent need for rapid disease control to reduce mortality have led to a search for quick and effective alternatives to novel therapeutics, for example drug repurposing. To identify potentially repurposable drugs, we employed a systematic approach to mine candidates from U.S. FDA-approved drugs and preclinical small-molecule compounds by integrating gene expression perturbation data for chemicals from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures project with a publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from patients with mild and severe COVID-19 (GEO: GSE145926, public data available and accessed on 22 April 2020). We identified 281 FDA-approved drugs that have the potential to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, 16 of which are currently undergoing clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy against COVID-19. We experimentally tested and demonstrated the inhibitory effects of tyrphostin-AG-1478 and brefeldin-a, two chemical inhibitors of glycosylation (a post-translational modification) on the replication of the single-stranded ribonucleic acid (ssRNA) virus influenza A virus as well as on the transcription and translation of host cell cytokines and their regulators (IFNs and ISGs).

We obtain the existence and stability criteria for the equilibrium points. We observe that when the reproduction number is less than unity, the disease-free equilibrium always exists and is locally asymptotically stable. The multiple endemic equilibrium points can exist independent of the basic reproduction number, and the system may experience bistability. We find that the system can encounter backward or forward bifurcation at [Formula: see text] , where the contact rate [Formula: see text] is the bifurcation parameter. Therefore, the disease-free equilibrium may not be globally stable. We deduce the criteria for the presence of Hopf bifurcation where the parameter [Formula: see text] acts as the bifurcation parameter and the system is a neutrally stable center. We also observe with the aid of a numerical example that a slight perturbation disrupts the neutral stability and the trajectories become either converging or diverging from the equilibrium point. Numerical simulation is performed with the help of MATLAB to justify the findings. We study the effect of nonlinearity of immunity function and the treatment rate on the dynamics of the disease spread. We find that when both are linear, the reproduction number is the same, but the system has a unique endemic equilibrium point that exists for reproduction number greater than unity. We find that there is neither backward bifurcation nor Hopf bifurcation. We also observe that the saturation in treatment enlarges the domain of backward bifurcation making disease eradication an extremely difficult task. The endemic equilibria in the case of saturated treatment may exist far more to the left of the bifurcation parameter [Formula: see text] . Hence, the nonlinearity of immunity function and treatment function affects the dynamics of an SEIS model highly; therefore, one must be precautious to choose an appropriate function for both while modeling.","output":"Dynamical analysis of SEIS model with nonlinear innate immunity and saturated treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study of human-specific infectious agents has been hindered by the lack of optimal small animal models.

A gradual return to exercise under the guidance of a specialised medical team to achieve the pre-infection fitness level is of utmost importance. Individualised exercise programmes must be initiated at low intensity which could be gradually made more rigorous based on the pertinent metabolic equivalent. Thus, there is a clear need for clinical recommendations before athletes may return to exercise after COVID-19 infection.","output":"Safe Return to Exercise after COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this research was to detect the principal reasons for condemnation of poultry carcasses in two slaughterhouses (A and B); located in the southeastern region of the State of Gois, Brazil.

Our objective was to evaluate mental health symptoms and identify associated determinants among cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS We used nationally representative data of 10,760 US adults from the COVID-19 Impact Survey. We defined cancer survivors as adults with a self-reported diagnosis of cancer (n = 854, 7.6%). We estimated associations of mental health symptoms among cancer survivors using multinomial logistic regression. We estimated determinants of reporting at least one mental health symptom 3-7 times in the 7 days before survey administration among cancer survivors using multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS Cancer survivors were more likely to report feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.90); depressed (aOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.09); lonely (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.91); and hopeless (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.06) 3-7 days per week in the last 7 days when compared with adults without cancer. Among cancer survivors, adults of age 30-44 years (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.95), females (aPR, 1.55, 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.13), adults without a high school degree (aPR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.05 to 3.04), and adults with limited social interaction (aPR, 1.40, 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.95) were more likely to report at least one mental health-related symptom in the last 7 days (3-7 days/week). CONCLUSION Cancer survivors are reporting mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly young adults, adults without a high school degree, women, and survivors with limited social support.","output":"Evaluating Mental Health-Related Symptoms Among Cancer Survivors During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Analysis of the COVID Impact Survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to identify and isolate the secondary metabolites of Zingiber officinale using GC-MS, preparative TLC, and LC-MS/MS methods, to evaluate the inhibitory potency on SARS-CoV-2 3 chymotrypsin-like protease enzyme, as well as to study the molecular interaction and stability by using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. GC-MS analysis suggested for the isolation of terpenoids compounds as major compounds on methanol extract of pseudostems and rhizomes. Isolation and LC-MS/MS analysis identified 5-hydro-7, 8, 2-trimethoxyflavanone (9), (E)-hexadecyl-ferulate (1), isocyperol (2), N-isobutyl-(2E,4E)-octadecadienamide (3), and nootkatone (4) from the rhizome extract, as well as from the leaves extract with the absence of 9. Three known steroid compounds, i.e., spinasterone (7), spinasterol (8), and 24-methylcholesta-7-en-3-on (6), were further identified from the pseudostem extract. Molecular docking showed that steroids compounds 7, 8, and 6 have lower predictive binding energies (MMGBSA) than other metabolites with binding energy of ?87.91, ?78.11, and ?68.80 kcal/mole, respectively. Further characterization on the single isolated compound by NMR showed that 6 was identified and possessed 75% inhibitory activity on SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease enzyme that was slightly different with the positive control GC376 (77%).

RECENT FINDINGS Advanced molecular diagnostics have identified HRVs as pathogens frequently causing wheezing illnesses in infants and young children. Wheezing during HRV infection in early life identifies children at particularly high-risk of asthma development. Plausible mechanisms by which HRV could cause airway damage, promote airway remodeling, and lead to asthma development have recently been identified. SUMMARY HRV is a significant source of morbidity in infants and young children. The present review identifies mechanisms by which HRV lower respiratory tract infection, particularly in a susceptible host, could promote the development of childhood asthma. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the link between HRV wheezing in early childhood and subsequent asthma development, with the critical goal of identifying novel therapeutic and prevention strategies for both early childhood wheezing and asthma.","output":"The role of rhinovirus infections in the development of early childhood asthma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Excessive inflammation triggered by a hitherto undescribed mechanism is a hallmark of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and is associated with enhanced pathogenicity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: Complement hyperactivation promotes lung injury and was observed in patients suffering from Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, we investigated the very first interactions of primary human airway epithelial cells on exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of complement component 3 (C3)-mediated effects. METHODS: For this, we used highly differentiated primary human 3-dimensional tissue models infected with SARS-CoV-2 patient isolates. On infection, viral load, viral infectivity, intracellular complement activation, inflammatory mechanisms, and tissue destruction were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, high content screening, plaque assays, luminex analyses, and transepithelial electrical resistance measurements. RESULTS: Here, we show that primary normal human bronchial and small airway epithelial cells respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection by an inflated local C3 mobilization. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in exaggerated intracellular complement activation and destruction of the epithelial integrity in monolayer cultures of primary human airway cells and highly differentiated, pseudostratified, mucus-producing, ciliated respiratory tissue models. SARS-CoV-2-infected 3-dimensional cultures secreted significantly higher levels of C3a and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, IL-1&#945;, and RANTES. CONCLUSIONS: Crucially, we illustrate here for the first time that targeting the anaphylotoxin receptors C3a receptor and C5a receptor in nonimmune respiratory cells can prevent intrinsic lung inflammation and tissue damage. This opens up the exciting possibility in the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"C5aR inhibition of nonimmune cells suppresses inflammation and maintains epithelial integrity in SARS-CoV-2-infected primary human airway epithelia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapidly spreading COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 not only brought many countries in the world to a state of health crisis, but also increasingly drove economic and social crisis.

Three innovative surgical approaches based on selection criteria are presented for enhanced and more predictable wound healing and posterior hairline cosmesis. Methods \\"Bat excision\\" and secondary intention healing are shown for 2 of 37 representative patients and confined to the area between the occipital protuberance superiorly and posterior hairline inferiorly. Lesions with 3 cm vertical width were required to be in the lower one-half portion of this zone.

It was also suitable for breaches of the 2 horizontal lines defined above but generally located in the nuchal area. Debridement of premature epithelizing granulation tissue is shown in 2 additional patients. Results Use of these procedures with debridement in selected patients allowed fine control over the hairline shape and resulted in narrower scars. The mean maximum sagittal width of excised lesions was 5.4 cm. Excised lesion width 6.5 cm was highly predictive of >2.5 cm wide scar (P = 0.001).

Alternatives such as serological diagnosis and maintenance of HPVs in culture are neither clinically useful nor consistently feasible. Novel HPV isolates have traditionally been described as types. The analysis of specific HPV types is of medical importance, because HPV types typically induce type-specific lesions, i.e. they may be specific for cutaneous or mucosal epithelia, or give rise to benign warts or malignant carcinomas. Recently, it was formally decided that papillomaviruses are a virus family separate from the polyomaviruses. Within the papillomavirus family, closely or remotely related types form species or genera. These formal agreements were important as they brought the taxonomy of papillomaviruses in line with that of other viruses, bacteria and higher organisms, although their impact on medical practice and terminology used in clinical studies is limited. Notably, however, HPV types that are closely related (i.e. form species) are associated with similar lesions. Confusion of the terms type and subtype should be avoided, as the latter term refers to some specific but rare taxonomic assemblages. In contrast to many RNA viruses, HPV types evolve very slowly, and diverged since the origin of humans only by about 2%. These divergent isolates are called variants. HPVs evolved together with humankind and Homo sapiens was never without HPVs, and consequently never without warts and cervical cancer. Variants of the same HPV type may have different pathogenicity and may account for part of the worldwide disparities in the occurrence of genital cancers.","output":"The clinical importance of the nomenclature, evolution and taxonomy of human papillomaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Common laboratory parameters are crucial in aiding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case detection. This study aimed to determine the differences between laboratory parameters in (1) COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and (2) severe versus non-severe COVID-19 cases. METHODS: Studies were collected until March 2020, and retrieved parameters include leukocyte, neutrophil, thrombocyte, and lymphocyte counts in addition to C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and D-dimer levels. In the presence of heterogeneity, the random-effect model (REM) was used instead of the fixed-effect model (FEM). RESULTS: Seven studies in the first analysis showed significantly lower leukocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts in COVID-19 pneumonia (SMD=-0.42, 95%CI -0.60 to -0.25, p<0.00001, SMD=-0.23, 95%CI -0.41 to -0.06, p=0.01, SMD=-0.54, 95%CI -0.91 to -0.16, p=0.0005) compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Twenty-six studies in the second analysis showed significantly lower lymphocyte and thrombocyte counts (SMD=-0.56, 95%CI -0.71 to -0.40, p<0.0001, SMD=-0.32, 95%CI -0.49 to -0.15, p=0.0002) and significantly higher leukocyte, neutrophil, D-dimer, and CRP (SMD=0.31, 95%CI 0.07-0.56, p=0.01; SMD=0.44, 95%CI 0.24-0.64, p<0.0001; SMD=0.53, 95%CI 0.31-0.75, p<0.00001; SMD=0.97, 95%CI 0.70-1.24, p<0.00001) in severe COVID-19 compared to non-severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, thrombocyte count is key in both diagnosis and prognosis. Low leukocyte and neutrophil counts are markers of COVID-19 infection, but contrastingly higher counts indicate progressive COVID-19. And although lymphocyte, D-dimer and CRP levels did not demonstrate diagnostic value, all indicate severity of COVID-19.
