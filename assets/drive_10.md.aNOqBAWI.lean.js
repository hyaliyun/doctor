Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed for a five-week period from 20 March 2020 and the same time period in 2019. The primary outcome was mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19 infection, perioperative pulmonary complications, time to theatre, type of anaesthesia, operation, grade of surgeon, fracture type, postoperative intensive care admission, venous thromboembolism, dislocation, infection rates, and length of stay. Results: In all, 76 patients with hip fractures were identified in each group. All patients had 30-day follow-up. There was no difference in age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification or residence at time of injury. However, three in each group were not fit for surgery. No significant difference was found in 30-day mortality; ten patients (13%) in 2019 and 11 patients (14%) in 2020 (p = 0.341). In the 2020 cohort, ten patients tested positive for COVID-19, two (20%) of whom died. There was no significant increase in postoperative pulmonary complications. Median time to theatre was 20 hours (interquartile range (IQR) 16 to 25) in 2019 versus 23 hours (IQR 18 to 30) in 2020 (p = 0.130). Regional anaesthesia increased from 24 (33%) cases in 2019 to 46 (63%) cases in 2020, but ten (14%) required conversion to general anaesthesia. In both groups, 53 (70%) operations were done by trainees. Hemiarthroplasty for 31 B type fractures was the most common operation. No significant difference was found for intensive care admission or 30-day venous thromboembolism, dislocation or infection, or length of stay. Conclusion: Little information exists on mortality and complications after hip fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent FDA clearance of molecular-based multiplex panels represents the beginning of a new era for the diagnosis of respiratory infections. The ability to test for multiple pathogens simultaneously, accompanied by the increasing availability of molecular-based assays for newly recognized respiratory pathogens will likely have a major impact on patient care, drug development, and public health epidemiology.

The goal is to develop a more harmonized approach to data, with potential to improve clinical trial conduct through enhanced data quality collected at reduced cost and inconvenience for patients. On completion of the original LY.12 randomized clinical trial in lymphoma (NCT00078949), participants were invited to enrol in the Long-term Innovative Follow-up Extension (LIFE) component. Those consenting to do so provided comprehensive identifying information to facilitate linkage with their administrative data. We prospectively designed a global assessment of this innovative approach to clinical trial follow-up including rates of REB approval and patient consent. The pre-specified benchmark for patient acceptability was 80%. Of 16 REBs who reviewed the research protocol, 14 (89%) provided approval; two in Quebec declined due to small patient numbers. Of 140 patients invited to participate, 115 (82%, 95% CI 76 to 88%) from across 9 Canadian provinces provided consent and their full name, date of birth, health insurance number and postal code to facilitate linkage with their administrative data for long-term follow-up. Linkage of clinical trial and administrative data is feasible and acceptable. Further collaborative work including many stakeholders is required to develop an optimized secure approach to research.

Based on the previous literature and need of the hour, molecular docking was performed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of major pomegranate peel polyphenols against COVID-19. Among the 44 studied compounds, 37 polyphenols show interaction with the catalytic dyad of the Mpro protease and 18 polyphenols have a higher binding affinity than that of the Mpro protease inhibitor (N3), indicating their high probability of binding at ACE2: SARS-CoV-2 interface. Furthermore, several polyphenols studied in this work are found to have higher binding affinity as compared to those of hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, nelfinavir, and curcumin, some of which have been earlier tested against COVID-19. Further, molecular dynamics simulations (200 ns) for Mpro-polyphenols including pelargonidin3-glucoside, quercetin3-O-rhamnoside, cyanidin3-glucoside and punicalin revealed highly stable complexes with less conformational fluctuations and similar degree of compactness. Estimation of total number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and binding free energy confirmed the stability of these Mpro-polyphenol complexes over Mpro-curcumin complex. Based on the greater binding affinity of polyphenols of pomegranate peel towards Mpro as compared to that of curcumin, pomegranate peel may be considered in any herbal medicinal formulation or may be incorporated into daily diets for prevention of COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the full adaptation of the discipline of geriatrics to a web-based learning tool, of two activities that were developed including the current COVID-19 to illustrate some of the main concepts of geriatric medicine. METHODS: The course was fully adapted to the open-source course management system called MOODLE. The first activity was a COVID-19 clinical case discussion, whose main objective was to include COVID-19 in the content of our course, illustrating some of the main concepts of geriatrics. The second activity was a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) experience, done via videoconference, which also assessed the impact of social distancing measures on the health of older adults. RESULTS: A total of 43 medical students performed both activities, and 95% of the students considered the inclusion of the COVID-19 into the discipline of geriatrics useful, 88% approved the practical experience of CGA, and 84% felt that they contributed to the health of the interviewees after contact. CONCLUSION: Adapting our discipline to a web-based learning tool, while including the current COVID-19 in our course content and a practical experience of CGA via videoconference was possible and approved by students.

Although few children had positive rapid influenza assay results and the morbidity of disease in the community appeared to be minimal for the majority of children, anxiety about pandemic influenza drove a large number of ED visits, necessitating an increase in surge capacity. Surge capacity was augmented both through utilization of existing institutional resources and by creating a novel area in which to treat patients with potential airborne pathogens. Infection control procedures and patient safety were also maximized through patient cohorting and adaptation of social distancing measures to the ED setting. CONCLUSION: The mobile pediatric emergency response team and screening and triage algorithms were able to safely and effectively identify a group of low-acuity patients who could be rapidly evaluated and discharged, alleviating ED volume and potentially preventing transmission of H1N1 influenza.","output":"Outside the Box and Into Thick Air: Implementation of an Exterior Mobile Pediatric Emergency Response Team for North American H1N1 (Swine) Influenza Virus in Houston, Texas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Oculoplastics is a predominantly visual specialty and many of the pathologies can be diagnosed based on external appearance. An image-based eyelid lesion management service was piloted to reduce the number of patients who would require outpatient clinic review. The aim of this study was to determine its accuracy and feasibility, both as a hospital-based and community optometrist-based service. If successful, the service was envisaged to significantly reduce the number of patients that require face-to-face (F2F) review, in accordance with current post-COVID-19 principles of social distancing. METHODS: Patients with lid lesions attending an oculoplastics clinic were assessed by consultant oculoplastic surgeons in an F2F consultation (Arm A). The lesions were photographed by a professional clinical photographer (Arm B) and by an optometrist with a handheld digital camera (Arm C). These images were reviewed by independent consultants masked to the outcome of the F2F clinical encounter. Data were collected prospectively including patient demographics, diagnosis, suspicion of malignancy and management. The image-based clinic results were compared to the F2F clinic results. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were included. Clinical diagnoses were compared for intra-observer variability and substantial agreement was demonstrated between gold-standard F2F clinic visit (Arm A) and Arm B (?? = 0.708) and C (?? = 0.776). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of discharge and all cases of malignancy were either identified or flagged for F2F review in the image-based arms.

In this study, we aimed to illustrate the psychological distress of the general population and evaluate the factors affecting it. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from 29th to 31st March 2020 in South Khorasan province, affected later than other parts of the country. We included sociodemographic questions, Hospital Anxiety, and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire, and questions addressing various symptoms and diseases. Most questions had multiple choices to select from and some were open questions. Univariate and multivariate analysis in SPSS software was used to find significant relationships. Results A total of 844 responses were collected, of which 788 records were included in the analysis. The mean age of responders was 36.6110.97 (age range: 18-88) and 484 (61.4%) of them were females. The mean scores in the anxiety and depression subscale of the HADS questionnaire were 7.013.68 and 6.723.71 respectively. Experiencing cardiovascular and COVID-19 related symptoms was significantly associated with a higher number of individuals having abnormal anxiety and depression results (p<0.001). Widowed individuals, females, and those experiencing the above-stated symptoms showed a significant association with increased anxiety and depression in multivariate analysis.

Consequently, the current study was conducted to evaluate the frequency, demographic characteristics, underlying conditions, and etiologic agents of fungal and bacterial co-infections of the respiratory tract among ICU patients with COVID-19 in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May to October 2020, sputa and endotracheal aspirates were collected from ICU patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who also were suspected of bacterial and/or fungal co-infections according to inclusion criteria. The etiologic agents of bacterial co-infections were identified using the Vitek 2 identification method. For fungal identification, all samples were analyzed by direct microscopy using KOH 10% and culture. Furthermore, all isolates were subjected to sequencing method. RESULTS: A total of 73 lung specimens were obtained from patients who met the inclusion criteria. Of these, in 15 cases (20.54%) fungal and/or bacterial co-infections were confirmed. Males were more infected (73.33%) and all of them were between 49 and 79 years. Candida albicans (n = 8, 61.53%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 5, 38.46%) were the most frequent etiologic agents related to fungal and bacterial co-infections, respectively. Pneumonia (n = 15, 100%) and diabetes mellitus (n = 8, 53.33%) were documented as the most prevalent underlying conditions. In the current study, 3 out of 15 patients (20%) died.

Mental health consequences of the lockdown however are unknown. In addition, illness perceptions and relevant strategies to cope with the stress of the epidemic may have played a role in complying with the restrictions. We conducted a survey of the Greek population with the aim to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression during the lockdown, the emotional impact of the epidemic, and the effect of coping strategies and illness perceptions in mental health. METHODS: Adult persons were invited during the peak of the lockdown period through social media. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the PHQ-9 and GAD-2 scales, respectively. Coping strategies were assessed with selected items of the Brief COPE questionnaire, while illness beliefs were assessed with items from the revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R). RESULTS: A total of 3379 individuals took part. A strong emotional impact of the epidemic was more often in women and in those with severe financial difficulties. Levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms were high but similar to past assessments. Participants showed high levels of personal control and used more often positive strategies to cope with the stress of the epidemic. Depressive symptoms were higher in the younger, in students, in those with a stronger emotional impact, in those isolated due to symptoms, and those overexposed to media for COVID-19-related news. Lower levels of depression were seen in those using positive coping strategies and showing high levels of personal and treatment control.

The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to get transmitted during the asymptomatic phase, and its high infectivity have led to the rapid transmission of COVID-19 beyond geographic regions facilitated by international travel, leading to a pandemic. To guide effective control and interventions, primary data is required urgently, globally, including from low- and middle-income countries where documentation of cardiovascular manifestations and risk factors in people hospitalized with COVID-19 is limited. Objectives: This study aims to describe the cardiovascular manifestations and cardiovascular risk factors in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: We propose to conduct an observational cohort study involving 5000 patients recruited from hospitals in low-, middle- and high-income countries. Eligible adult COVID-19 patients will be recruited from the participating hospitals and followed-up until 30 days post admission. The outcomes will be reported at discharge and includes the need of ICU admission, need of ventilator, death (with cause), major adverse cardiovascular events, neurological outcomes, acute renal failure, and pulmonary outcomes. Conclusion: Given the enormous burden posed by COVID-19 and the associated severe prognostic implication of CVD involvement, this study will provide useful insights on the risk factors for severe disease, clinical presentation, and outcomes of various cardiovascular manifestations in COVID-19 patients particularly from low and middle income countries from where the data remain scant.","output":"The World Heart Federation Global Study on COVID-19 and Cardiovascular Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of 5G and artificial intelligence technologies have brought novel ideas to the prevention, control, and diagnosis of disease.

Four men from 2 unrelated families were admitted to the ICUs of 4 hospitals in the Netherlands between March 23 and April 12, 2020. The final date of follow-up was May 16, 2020. Available family members were included for genetic variant segregation analysis and as controls for functional experiments. Exposure Severe COVID-19. Main Outcome and Measures Results of rapid clinical whole-exome sequencing, performed to identify a potential monogenic cause. Subsequently, basic genetic and immunological tests were performed in primary immune cells isolated from the patients and family members to characterize any immune defects. Results The 4 male patients had a mean age of 26 years (range, 21-32), with no history of major chronic disease. They were previously well before developing respiratory insufficiency due to severe COVID-19, requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The mean duration of ventilatory support was 10 days (range, 9-11); the mean duration of ICU stay was 13 days (range, 10-16). One patient died. Rapid clinical whole-exome sequencing of the patients and segregation in available family members identified loss-of-function variants of the X-chromosomal TLR7. In members of family 1, a maternally inherited 4-nucleotide deletion was identified (c.2129_2132del; p.[Gln710Argfs*18]); the affected members of family 2 carried a missense variant (c.2383G>T; p.[Val795Phe]). In primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patients, downstream type I interferon (IFN) signaling was transcriptionally downregulated, as measured by significantly decreased mRNA expression of IRF7, IFNB1, and ISG15 on stimulation with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod as compared with family members and controls. The production of IFN-, a type II IFN, was decreased in patients in response to stimulation with imiquimod. Conclusions and Relevance In this case series of 4 young male patients with severe COVID-19, rare putative loss-of-function variants of X-chromosomal TLR7 were identified that were associated with impaired type I and II IFN responses.

Compared with HIV-PJP, non-HIV PJP is more likely to develop rapidly into respiratory failure, with difficult diagnosis and high mortality. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 46-year-old male with membranous nephropathy was treated with oral corticosteroids and tacrolimus. He was admitted to our hospital for fever and dyspnea which developed 4 days ago. Laboratory data revealed that leukocytes were 10.99  10(9)/L, neutrophils 87.7%, lymphocytes 9.6%, C-reactive protein 252.92 mg/L, New coronavirus nucleic acid detection negative. CT scan of chest revealed ground-glass opacity in both lungs. He was admitted to the respiratory department of our hospital, and then transferred to ICU because of his critical condition. DIAGNOSIS: High throughput gene detection of pathogenic microorganisms in alveolar lavage fluid showed that the detection sequence of Pneumocystis yersiniae increased significantly. The serum HIV-antibody was negative. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed as non-HIV PJP. INTERVENTIONS: After admission, the patient was assisted by noninvasive ventilator and treated with compound trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SMX-TMP) and caspofungin. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and then underwent endotracheal intubation and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) combined with prone position ventilation until the lung lesion improved.

Despite substantial ramp-up in test volume, access to SARS-CoV-2 testing remains limited, heterogeneous, and insufficient to control spread. METHODS: We compared SARS-CoV-2 testing rates across geographic regions, over time, and by demographic characteristics (i.e., age and racial/ethnic groups) in Illinois during March through December 2020. We compared age-matched case fatality ratios and infection fatality ratios through time to estimate the fraction of SARS-CoV-2 infections that have been detected through diagnostic testing. RESULTS: By the end of 2020, initial geographic differences in testing rates had closed substantially. Case fatality ratios were higher in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latino populations in Illinois relative to non-Hispanic White populations, suggesting that tests were insufficient to accurately capture the true burden of COVID-19 disease in the minority populations during the initial epidemic wave. While testing disparities decreased during 2020, Hispanic/Latino populations consistently remained the least tested at 1.87 tests per 1000 population per day compared with 2.58 and 2.87 for non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White populations, respectively, at the end of 2020. Despite a large expansion in testing since the beginning of the first wave of the epidemic, we estimated that over half (50C80%) of all SARS-CoV-2 infections were not detected by diagnostic testing and continued to evade surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic methods for identifying relatively under-tested geographic regions and demographic groups may enable policymakers to regularly monitor and evaluate the shifting landscape of diagnostic testing, allowing officials to prioritize allocation of testing resources to reduce disparities in COVID-19 burden and eventually reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Different groups of scientists have foreseen different scenarios, such as the second wave or that Manaus could escape such a wave by having reached herd immunity. Here we test five hypotheses that explain the second wave of COVID-19 in Manaus: 1) The greater transmissibility of the Amazonian (gamma or P.1) variant is responsible for the second wave; 2) SARS-CoV-2 infection levels during the first wave were overestimated by those foreseeing herd immunity, and the population remained below this threshold when the second wave began at the beginning of December 2020; 3) Antibodies acquired from infection by one lineage do not confer immunity against other lineages; 4) Loss of immunity has generated a feedback phenomenon among infected people, which could generate future waves, and 5) A combination of the foregoing hypotheses. We also evaluated the possibility of a third wave in Manaus despite advances in vaccination, the new wave being due to the introduction of the delta variant in the region and the loss of immunity from natural contact with the virus. We developed a multi-strain SEIRS (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed-Susceptible) model and fed it with data for Manaus on mobility, COVID-19 hospitalizations, numbers of cases and deaths. Our model contemplated the current vaccination rates for all vaccines applied in Manaus and the individual protection rates already known for each vaccine. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 gamma (P.1) strain that originated in the Amazon region is not the cause of the second wave of COVID-19 in Manaus, but rather this strain originated during the second wave and became predominant in January 2021. Our multi-strain SEIRS model indicates that neither the doubled transmission rate of the gamma variant nor the loss of immunity alone is sufficient to explain the sudden rise of hospitalizations in late December 2020. Our results also indicate that the most plausible explanation for the current second wave is a SARS-CoV-2 infection level at around 50% of the population in early December 2020, together with loss of population immunity and early relaxation of restrictive measures. The most-plausible model indicates that contact with one strain does not provide protection against other strains and that the gamma variant has a transmissibility rate twice that of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. Our model also shows that, despite the advance of vaccination, and even if future vaccination advances at a steady pace, the introduction of the delta variant or other new variants could cause a new wave of COVID-19.","output":"Dynamics of COVID-19 in Amazonia: A history of government denialism and the risk of a third wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telehospice has been recognized as a way to meet the needs of hospice patients and their caregivers.

Tracheostomy has been avoided due to increased risk of aerosolization especially during tracheal dilation resulting in increased risk for personnel infection. We describe our novel protocol to prevent exposure during percutaneous tracheostomy.Methods: Patients with COVID-19, on mechanical ventilation requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation were evaluated for bed-side percutaneous tracheostomy. The procedure was performed under bronchoscopic guidance and using a disposable bronchoscope. The scope was secured in position 1 cm from the end of the endotracheal tube with tape at the insertion site to allow the bronchoscopist to withdraw the ETT/bronchoscope en-bloc to the appropriate location in the trachea for adequate visualization during the procedure. Once the puncture point was identified, an expiratory pause was performed during which the trachea was punctured, a guide wire was placed, the anterior wall was dilated, and a tracheostomy was advanced and placed in the trachea. The time of the expiratory pause, any desaturation, complication and personnel conversion were measured.Results: A total of 18 percutaneous tracheostomies were performed. The total time of the expiratory pause, tracheal puncture to tracheostomy placement was thirty seconds to sixty seconds. There was no evidence of desaturation during the procedure, and there were no cases of staff conversion to positive COVID-19 status up to 14 days post procedure.Conclusions: we conclude that expiratory pause during percutaneous tracheostomy is safe, and importantly, may play significant role in decreasing aerosolization and staff exposure in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure.","output":"Safety and efficacy of a novel percutaneous tracheostomy protocol adapted to patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a global pandemic. Healthcare workers' (HCWs) role in patient management is predisposing and can serve as means of hospitals and community transmission. This study evaluated HCWs' knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 in Nigeria. METHODS: we carried out a cross-sectional survey among HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria from March to June 2020. The study assessed 346 HCWs for Knowledge, attitude, and practice by using an online (Google form) self-administered questionnaire, based on a convinience sampling technique Data were retrieved and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Chi-Square and one-way ANOVA were used to measure association and difference among demographic variables. The relationship between knowledge, attitude, and practice was measured using Spearman's rho correlation test. RESULTS: the mean knowledge score of the HCWs was 7.1 on a scale of 0C8. The correct overall rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 88.75%. Knowledge was gained mainly from television (35.0%) and social media (35.0%). The mean attitude score on a scale of 0C6 was 5.31  0.39. Most (92.5%) participants were confident that Nigerian medical scientists would win the war against COVID-19. The majority (92.2%) of the respondents thought that SARS-CoV-2 was not a biological weapon. About 1 out of 5 respondents held that faith healing or prayer is the only cure for COVID-19. A vast majority of the HCWs were taking precautionary measures such as avoiding crowded places (94.2%), washing of hands (96.0%), and the use of personal protective equipment (91.6%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, only 3 out of 5 HCWs used a face mask when leaving home. There was a significant (p = 0.046) positive correlation (0.584) between knowledge and attitude. CONCLUSION: our results showed that HCWs in Nigeria had excellent knowledge and possessed a positive attitude and good practice towards COVID-19. However; there were areas where poor knowledge, negative attitudes and unacceptable practices were observed.

METHODS: An online survey collected information on socio-demographic data and additional information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, sleep quality, sleep disorders, generalized anxiety symptoms, psychological distress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology related to COVID-19 were assessed. RESULTS: This study included 2291 respondents. The results revealed that 57.1% of participants reported poor sleep quality, 32.1% high anxiety, 41.8% high distress, and 7.6% reported PTSD symptomatology linked to COVID-19. Youth and women, those uncertain regarding possible COVID-19 infection, and greater fear of direct contact with those infected by COVID-19 had an increased risk of developing sleep disturbances, as well as higher levels of anxiety and distress.

In addition to preventing water and electrolyte loss, the SC as a permeability barrier prevents the entry of harmful irritants, allergens, and microorganisms into the skin. Disruption of the epidermal barrier leads to skin that is irritated, more reactive, and more sensitive than normal skin.

It has been assumed that these fascinating effects are associated with a homogeneous ferromagnetic (FM) layer possessing a single type of magnetic phase. However, we obtained phase separation within the FM layer of a Ni80Fe20/Bi2Se3 heterostructure. This phase separation was caused by the diffusion of Ni into Bi2Se3, forming a ternary magnetic phase of Ni:Bi2Se3. The inward diffusion of Ni led to the formation of an FeSe phase outward, transforming the original Ni80Fe20/Bi2Se3 into a sandwich structure comprising FeSe/Ni:Bi2Se3/Bi2Se3 with dual-phase magnetic characteristics similar to that driven by the proximity effect. Such a phenomenon might have been overlooked in previous studies with a strong focus on the proximity effect. X-ray magnetic spectroscopy revealed that FeSe and Ni:Bi2Se3 possess horizontal and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, respectively. The overall magnetic order of the heterostructure can be easily tuned by adjusting the thickness of the Bi2Se3 as it compromises the magnetic orders of the two magnetic phases.

However, the model strain, Streptomyces coelicolor, escapes this general rule and produces actinorhoddin (ACT), a polyketide antibiotic, even more abundantly in phosphate proficiency than in phosphate limitation. ACT was shown to bear \\"anti-oxidant\\" properties suggesting that its biosynthesis is triggered by oxidative stress. Interestingly, Streptomyces lividans, a strain closely related to S. coelicolor, does not produce ACT in any phosphate condition whereas its pptA/sco4144 mutant produces ACT but only in phosphate limitation. In order to define the potentially common features of the ACT producing strains, these three strains were grown in condition of low and high phosphate availability, and a comparative quantitative analysis of their proteomes was carried out. The abundance of proteins of numerous pathways differed greatly between S. coelicolor and the S. lividans strains, especially those of central carbon metabolism and respiration. S. coelicolor is characterized by the high abundance of the complex I of the respiratory chain thought to generate reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and by a weak glycolytic activity causing a low carbon flux through the Pentose Phosphate Pathway resulting into the low generation of NADPH, a co-factor of thioredoxin reductases necessary to combat oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is thus predicted to be high in S. coelicolor. In contrast, the S. lividans strains had rather similar proteins abundance for most pathways except for the transhydrogenases SCO7622-23, involved in the conversion of NADPH into NADH. The poor abundance of these enzymes in the pptA mutant suggested a deficit in NADPH. Indeed, PptA is an accessory protein forcing polyphosphate into a conformation allowing their efficient use by various enzymes taking polyphosphate as a donor of phosphate and energy, including the ATP/Polyphosphate-dependent NAD kinase SCO1781. In phosphate limitation, this enzyme would mainly use polyphosphate to phosphorylate NAD into NADP, but this phosphorylation would be inefficient in the pptA mutant resulting in low NADP(H) levels and thus high oxidative stress. Altogether, our results indicated that high oxidative stress is the common feature triggering ACT biosynthesis in S. coelicolor and in the pptA mutant of S. lividans.","output":"A Proteomic Analysis Indicates That Oxidative Stress Is the Common Feature Triggering Antibiotic Production in Streptomyces coelicolor and in the pptA Mutant of Streptomyces lividans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thermoregulation is a homeostatic mechanism that is disrupted in some neurological diseases.

Intriguingly, phyloproteome analysis indicate that Nsp2:R218C, Nsp2:D268-(deletion), Spike:D614G, Nsp12:P323L, Nsp2:A192V, ORF3a protein:Q57H, N protein:R203K and N protein:G204R/L, Spike:A222V, ORF10 protein:V30L and N protein:A220V are moderate or high recurring and clade decisive mutations, leading to 6 primary clades during the early stage of pandemic. Most interestingly, the human evolved delta variant having a combination of 26 (clade decisive) mutations defines the seventh clade and transmits to non-human hosts across the globe without exhibiting any country-specific mutation(s). Nonetheless, Spike:D614G and Nsp12:P323L together with (i)N protein:R203K,N protein:G204R/L,Spike:V70-, Spike:H69-, Nsp12:T739I, and Nsp1:M85-, (ii)Nsp2:A192V, Nsp3:D178Y, (iii)Nsp2:T85I, N protein:P67S and ORF3a protein:Q57H and (iv)Spike:A222V, ORF10 protein:V30L, N protein:A220V and Spike:F486I are specific to Denmark, Netherlands, USA and Latvia respectively and, (v)Nsp2:D268- and Nsp13:R292C that are devoid of Spike:D614G and Nsp12:P323L is specific to Netherlands. SARS-CoV-2 variants consisting of these mutations are also seen in the human SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the same country. Independent country-specific SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution further indicates distinct epidemiological dynamics during zooanthroponotic and zoonotic transmissions. Thus, the results presented here indicate the need for the surveillance of viral evolution in non-human hosts also during the future pandemic.","output":"Geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 amino acids mutations and the concomitant evolution of seven distinct clades in non-human hosts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveTo assess the changes in cardiac hospitalisations, acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) during COVID-19 isolation compared with prior time periods in an area of low COVID-19 disease incidence.MethodsReview of all cardiology admissions, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requiring urgent catheter laboratory activation and OOHCA. The 10-week period of government-imposed social isolation (23 MarchC31 May 2020) was compared with the same period in 2018, 2019 and a 10-week period prior to social isolation (6 JanuaryC15 March 2020).

To combat this pandemic, different strategies need to be tailored and implemented in countries with different situations. First, in countries with an ongoing explosion of the outbreak (i.e. the USA, Spain, and Italy), strategies suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) which have been proven useful in China should be adopted for implementation. Secondly, countries in the regions that are still at the early stages of the outbreak (i.e., the Africa region, where many countries have only found imported cases) should further strengthen travel restrictions to reduce the risk of imported cases as well as the risk of developing local transmission. Furthermore, countries that have achieved great success in COVID control (i.e. China, South Korea, and Singapore) should continue implement the successful strategies and further roll-out strengthened new strategies to prevent new imported cases. In addition, surveillance on the genomic changes of SARS-CoV-2 is in need in all countries as some studies have found multiple mutants of SARS-CoV-2, although the impact of the mutation on the infectivity and lethality of the virus was still unclear.","output":"Differentiating COVID-19 Response Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While it is hard to predict what will have happened by the time of the conference, this round table will be tightly templated and coordinated.

We used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cultured in the presence of autologous serum to test the impact of complement activation and inhibition on cytokine release, testing the effects of liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome), zymosan and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as immune activators and heat inactivation of serum, EDTA and mini-factor H (mfH) as complement inhibitors.

This revived a much needed debate over the privacy issues associated with online proctoring of exams, while the validity and fairness of unproctored exams were increasingly questioned. With a randomized control trial, we estimate the effectiveness of prior warnings as a means of discouraging academic dishonesty in exams. We use original, non-intrusive technologies to surreptitiously identify cheating in a series of unproctored assignments and send a targeted warning to half of the students who were identified as cheaters. We then compare their cheating behavior on the final exam with the behavior of the group of unwarned cheaters. The warning proves effective but does not completely eliminate cheating, as some students cheating strategies become more sophisticated following issuance of the warnings. We conclude that switching traditional exams to online mode should be accompanied by proctoring.

Serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections are important to understand the immune response in patients and to obtain epidemiological data about the number of infected people, especially to identify asymptomatic persons not aware of a past infection. METHODS: We recombinantly produced SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N)-protein in Escherichia coli. We used the purified protein to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. This ELISA method was optimized and validated with serum samples collected from 113 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections including hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 1500 control sera mostly collected before 2015 with different clinical background. RESULTS: The optimized N-protein-ELISA provided a sensitivity of 89.7% (n = 68) for samples collected from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and mild to severe symptoms more than 14 days after symptom onset or a positive PCR test. The antibody levels remained low for serum samples collected in the first six days (n = 23) and increased in the second week (n = 22) post symptom onset or PCR confirmation. At this early phase, the ELISA provided a sensitivity of 39.1% and 86.4%, respectively, reflecting the time of an IgG immune response against pathogens. The assay specificity was 99.3% (n = 1500; 95% CI 0.995C0.999). Serum samples from persons with confirmed antibody titers against human immunodeficiency viruses 1/2, parvovirus B19, hepatitis A/B virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus were tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the N-protein-based ELISA developed here is well suited for the sensitive and specific serological detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in human serum for symptomatic infections. It may also prove useful to identify previous SARS-CoV-2 infections in vaccinated people, as all currently approved vaccines rely on the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-) protein.

There is currently no Irish national guideline for GBS screening, and protocols vary across maternity units. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at induction or labour onset informs triage for antibiotic prophylaxis; however, there are human and infrastructural resource requirements to enable widespread implementation. AIM: Our aim was to identify current standard practices for GBS prevention in Irish obstetric and neonatal services and to utilise this data to inform the need for, and potential impact of implementation of, a national guideline. METHODS: A questionnaire on GBS screening, management and existing resources was completed by an informed staff member from each of the 19 Irish maternity units, including questions regarding timing and method of screening, antibiotic usage, and neonatal management. RESULTS: One unit (5.2%) performs routine GBS screening at 35C37 weeks of gestation. Twelve units (63%) screen for GBS following spontaneous rupture of membranes (SROM) after 37 weeks, of which two (17%) perform PCR and ten (83%) culture testing. Seventeen units (89.3%) have access to a GeneXpert PCR machine, and of these, two (11.7%) use the machine for rapid GBS testing. Two units screen patients for GBS at either the start of labour or induction of labour. Four units (21%) use the neonatal early onset sepsis (EOS) calculator. Sixteen units (84%) do not treat asymptomatic infants born to GBS-positive mothers.

Methods Sepsis patients were divided into the SAKI group and non-SAKI group. Arterial blood lactate was collected at 0 h (before treatment), 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, and 8 h (after treatment), and the LCR was calculated. The physiological parameters and laboratory test results were used to calculate the APACHE II score and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of LCR, APACHE II score and SOFA score for predicting patients with SAKI were drawn. Two single indicators with high areas under the curves (AUCs) were selected to calculate the joint probability through regression analysis, and the prediction efficiency corresponding to each curve was analyzed. Results There were significant differences in LCR between different groups and time periods (Fgroup=17.44, Pgroup 0.0001, Ftime =11.71, Ptime =0.0014). After 8 h of treatment, there was a significant difference in the overall compliance rate between the 2 groups (P<0.0001). In addition, after 24 h of treatment, the APACHE II score in the SAKI group was significantly higher than that in the non-SAKI group (P=0.0007), and SOFA score was also significantly higher than that in the non-SAKI group (P=0.0001). ROC curve showed that the 0-8 h LCR and APACHE II scores had a high predictive performance for the acute kidney injury (AKI) occurrence in sepsis patients, and AUCs were 0.7637 and 0.7517, respectively, while the combined AUC of the 2 indicators was 0.7975.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 57 active, public library Twitter accounts were used for data collection and analysis. The tweets examined were a combination of original tweets (n = 1,465) and retweets (n = 516) posted from other Twitter accounts on the public libraries Twitter feeds. A content analysis scheme was developed to analyse topical aspects of the tweets. Findings: The most frequent tweets were about library events, programmes and activities. However, there was a relatively low focus on sharing community information and addressing information related to the pandemic. The study suggests that public libraries could use Twitter to provide library resources and services to their patrons, whilst also acting as a virtual community centre safely keeping patrons engaged in the face of a global pandemic. By doing so, Twitter could be used as an integral part of promoting the mission of public libraries. Research limitations/implications: The study examined a limited number of public libraries Twitter posts. Whilst the study carried out a random sampling of 10% of public libraries from the five states that had the highest COVID-19 cases in the month of April 2020, the study only examined tweets of 57 public libraries being active in posting. Thus, the findings of the study are not for generalizing. Practical implications: The content scheme includes content types regarding library services and community information. The content category scheme is general to reflect themes of content during a normal time and any emergency. Thus, this framework could be helpful for the content development of public libraries in planning social media use.

Clinicopathological data were collected, including postoperative complications, re-admission and re-operation. The data were compared to published national standards. RESULTS Median age was 52 years (range 37-74). Thirty-two patients (68%) had an SSM and 15 (32%) had an NSM. Two patients (4%) had risk-reducing mastectomies and 45 had treatment for invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Mean tumour size was 33.3mm (range 7-85mm). Forty-two (89%) patients went home on the day of surgery. No patients required re-operation in the first 48 hours. The median postoperative follow-up time was 11.4 months (range 1.8-22.7 months). During the first 90-day postoperative period, eight patients (17%) developed superficial skin necrosis, five patients (10.6%) developed postoperative infections and five patients (10.6%) suffered an implant loss. Eight patients (17%) were readmitted for re-operation. Compared to UK national standards set in the iBRA study, our cohort has demonstrated comparable postoperative infection, implant loss and re-operation and re-admission rates.

METHODS: Data on the cases and deaths from COVID-19, by sex and age group, were extracted from the national official agencies from Denmark, England, Israel, Italy, Spain, Canada and Mexico. Age-specific CFRs were computed for males and females separately. The ratio of the male to female CFRs were computed and meta-analytic methods were used to obtained pooled estimates of the male to female ratio of the CFRs over the seven countries, for all age-groups. Meta-regression and sensitivity analysis were conducted to evaluate the age and country contribution to differences. RESULTS: The CFRs were consistently higher in males at all ages. The pooled M:F CFR ratios were 1.71, 1.88, 2.11, 2.11, 1.84, 1.78 and 1.49, for ages 20C29, 30C39, 40C49, 50C59, 60C69, 70C79, 80+ respectively.

Sex differences in the incidence and mortality have been found in many infectious diseases. For COVID-19, factors such as sex differences in the prevalence of underlying diseases may play a part in the CFR differences. However, the consistently greater case-fatality rates in males at all ages suggests that sex-related factors impact on the natural history of the disease.

From the common sense of individual tests, the idea of mixing multiple samples seems taboo, however in fact many samples can be tested with a smaller number of tests by the method. As a retired researcher of mathematical engineering, the author was deeply interested in the idea and absorbed in the mathematical formulation and intensive analysis of the method. Later, he found that the original basic equation was already proposed in the old (1943) treatise [1] and so many related research works have been done and available as materials on the web [2], although many of those seem to be based on qualitative or intuitive analysis. In that sense, some of the analysis here seems to be already known in the field, but some results might be novel, such as boundary conditions, derivation of limit values, estimation of infection rate and adaptive optimization scheme of pool test, strict extension to multi-stage pool test, and explicit derivation of asymptotic approximate solutions of optimal pooling number and achieved efficiency measure, etc. In any case, he decided to put it together here as a material rather than a formal treatise, hoping that the results here would be useful for deeper mathematical insights into and better understanding of the pool inspection, and also in its actual practice.","output":"Some Mathematics for the Method of Pooled PCR Test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, a 74-year-old man affected by end-stage renal disease and on peritoneal dialysis was referred to an emergency room in Modena, Northern Italy, due to fever and respiratory symptoms. After ruling out COVID-19 infection, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation was confirmed and he was thus transferred to the nephrology division. Physical examination and blood tests revealed a positive fluid balance and insufficient correction of the uraemic syndrome, although peritoneal dialysis prescription was maximised. After discussion with the patient and his family, the staff decided to start hybrid dialysis, consisting of once-weekly in-hospital haemodialysis and home peritoneal dialysis for the remaining days. He was discharged at the end of the antibiotic course, after an internal jugular vein central venous catheter placement and the first haemodialysis session. This strategy allowed improvement of depuration parameters and avoidance of frequent access to the hospital, which is crucial in limiting exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in an endemic setting.","output":"Hybrid dialysis: a promising strategy to reduce hospital access during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering the widespread use of mobile and voice search, answer passage retrieval for non-factoid questions plays a critical role in modern information retrieval systems.

On completion of the original LY.12 randomized clinical trial in lymphoma (NCT00078949), participants were invited to enrol in the Long-term Innovative Follow-up Extension (LIFE) component. Those consenting to do so provided comprehensive identifying information to facilitate linkage with their administrative data. We prospectively designed a global assessment of this innovative approach to clinical trial follow-up including rates of REB approval and patient consent. The pre-specified benchmark for patient acceptability was 80%. Of 16 REBs who reviewed the research protocol, 14 (89%) provided approval; two in Quebec declined due to small patient numbers.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of butyrate produced by gut microbiota on hepatic gluconeogenesis in late-pregnancy sows. A total of 240 primiparous sows in late pregnancy were tested for blood glucose using a glucose meter before feeding and grouped according to their blood glucose level as follows: 0-3.0 mmol L-1 (low blood glucose group, LG group) and 3.1-5.0 mmol L-1 (normal blood glucose group, NG group). Colonic SCFAs and microbiota, SCFAs in the portal vein and liver, and acetylation and phosphorylation levels in the liver samples were analyzed. Hepatocytes from pregnant sows were examined for the effect of butyrate on hepatic glucose gluconeogenesis. In vivo experiments showed that the reproductive performance, serum glucose metabolism index, colonic butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria decreased in the LG group compared with the NG group. Correlation analysis found a positive correlation among colonic butyrate, butyrate-producing bacteria and the serum glucose metabolism index. Moreover, the hepatic cAMP concentration, PKA activity, GCN5 phosphorylation, and the expression of G6P and PEPCK were decreased and PGC1- acetylation was increased in the LG group compared with the NG group. In vitro, sodium butyrate significantly stimulated the cAMP concentration, PKA activity, GCN5 phosphorylation, and the expression of G6P and PEPCK and inhibited PGC-1 acetylation in the LG group of hepatocytes from late-pregnancy sows. Interestingly, another in vivo experiment showed that dietary 1-kestose, a natural regulator of gut bacteria, significantly increased butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria, and improved the reproductive performance and serum glucose metabolism index in late-pregnancy sows. Taken together, we found that targeting gut microbiota-derived butyrate could improve hepatic gluconeogenesis through the cAMP-PKA-GCN5 pathway in late-pregnancy sows.","output":"Targeting gut microbiota-derived butyrate improves hepatic gluconeogenesis through the cAMP-PKA-GCN5 pathway in late pregnant sows"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine the impact of COVID-19 on market structure in the U.S. Specifically, we analyze the impact of both the COVID-19-induced market uncertainty period as well as the suspension of the NYSE floor on trading dynamics such as market fragmentation, algorithmic trading, and hidden liquidity in the market.

Considering the relevance of present circumstances, we explored perceptions and attitudes of community members towards their mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using a purposive sampling approach, at two communities of Karachi, Pakistan. PARTICIPANTS: In-depth interviews were conducted with community members including, young adults, middle-aged adults and older adults of both genders. Study data were analysed manually using the thematic analysis technique. PRIMARY OUTCOME: The primary outcome is assessing community perception towards their mental well-being amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 27 in-depth interviews were conducted, between May and June 2020. Three overarching themes were identified: (1) impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the general communities; (2) current coping mechanisms to adapt to the new reality and (3) recommendations to address the mental health of communities. Generally, community members underwent increased anxiety and fear due to the contagious nature of the virus. Alongside, social, financial and religious repercussions of the pandemic have also heightened psychological distress among community members. However, community members were able to point out some of the coping mechanisms such as getting closer to God, connecting with family, participating in mental health sessions and resetting lives by indulging in diverse activities. Simultaneously, they also recommended the need for remote mental health services for elders and continuous efforts by the government to address the mental health needs of the community.

Using a geodesic Wasserstein metric, we analyse discrepancies between the density functions of new case counts on any given day, incorporating the geographic spread of cases. First, we apply this to identify the periods during which the changes in the geographic distribution of COVID-19 were most profound. The greatest shift occurred between May and June of 2020, when COVID-19 shifted from mostly dominating the Northeastern states to a wider distribution across the country. We support our findings with a new measure of the extent of geodesic variance of a distribution, demonstrating that the geographic imprint of COVID-19 was most concentrated in May 2020. Next, we investigate whether the epidemic exhibited meaningful patterns of spatial reversion, where similar geographic distributions return later. We identify broad similarity between the spread of COVID-19 across the US between the second and third waves, and to a lesser extent, the reemergence of the first wave's Northeastern dominance closer to the present day. This methodology could provide new insights for analysts to monitor the dynamical spread of epidemics and enable regional policymakers to protect their localities.

In the early days of the pandemic, US president Donald J Trump has endorsed the use of unproven therapies. Subsequently, a death attributed to the wrongful ingestion of a chloroquine-containing compound occurred. OBJECTIVE: We investigated Donald J Trump's speeches and Twitter posts, as well as Google searches and Amazon purchases, and television airtime for mentions of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir. METHODS: Twitter sourcing was catalogued with Factba.se, and analytics data, both past and present, were analyzed with Tweet Binder to assess average analytics data on key metrics. Donald J Trump's time spent discussing unverified treatments on the United States' 5 largest TV stations was catalogued with the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone, and his speech transcripts were obtained from White House briefings. Google searches and shopping trends were analyzed with Google Trends. Amazon purchases were assessed using Helium 10 software. RESULTS: From March 1 to April 30, 2020, Donald J Trump made 11 tweets about unproven therapies and mentioned these therapies 65 times in White House briefings, especially touting hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. These tweets had an impression reach of 300% above Donald J Trump's average. Following these tweets, at least 2% of airtime on conservative networks for treatment modalities like azithromycin and continuous mentions of such treatments were observed on stations like Fox News. Google searches and purchases increased following his first press conference on March 19, 2020, and increased again following his tweets on March 21, 2020. The same is true for medications on Amazon, with purchases for medicine substitutes, such as hydroxychloroquine, increasing by 200%.

METHODS: We conducted an open-label, phase 3 trial (NCT04252664) involving hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, evidence of pulmonary infiltrates, and oxygen saturation >94% on room air. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive up to 5d or 10d of RDV with standard of care (SoC), or SoC alone; patients could be discharged prior to completing per-protocol assigned treatment duration. RDV was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on d1, 100 mg daily thereafter. Patients were evaluated daily while hospitalized, and via telephone if discharged. The primary endpoint was clinical status on d11 assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale. Results regarding the primary endpoint are expected to be published before IDWeek 2020; we plan to present d28 results at the meeting. RESULTS: In total, 584 patients underwent randomization and started their assigned treatment (191, 5d RDV; 193, 10d RDV; 200, SoC). By d11, 3 2 point improvement on the ordinal scale occurred in 70% of patients in the 5d arm, 65% in the 10d arm, and 61% in the SoC arm. Patients in the 5d RDV arm were significantly more likely to have an improvement in clinical status than those receiving SoC (odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09C2.48; P=0.017); OR of improvement for the 10d RDV arm compared to SoC was 1.31 (95% CI, 0.88C1.95]; p=0.183). This improvement in the 5-day arm over the SOC arm was noted from d6 through d11. We observed a peak of discharges corresponding with the assigned treatment duration of RDV, with increased discharges at d6 in the 5-day arm and at d11 in the 10-day arm.

TBI patients suffer short- and long-term behavioral, cognitive, and emotional impairments, including difficulties in concentration, memory loss, and depression. Research shows that CE application can mitigate cognitive and behavioral impairments in animal models for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, whose pathophysiology is similar to that of TBI. This study builds on prior research by showing similar results in TBI mice models. After drinking CE for a week, mice were injured using our 70-g weight drop TBI device. For 2 weeks thereafter, the mice continued drinking CE alongside standard lab nutrition. Subsequently, the mice underwent behavioral tests to assess their memory, motor activity, and anxiety. The mice brains were harvested for immunohistochemistry staining to evaluate overall neuronal survival. Our results show that CE consumption almost completely mitigates memory impairment and decreases neuronal loss after TBI. Mice that did not consume CE demonstrated impaired memory. Our results also show that CE consumption attenuated neuronal loss in the temporal cortex and the dentate gyrus. Mice that did not consume CE suffered a significant neuronal loss. There were no significant differences in anxiety levels and motor activity between all groups. These findings show a new therapeutic approach to improve cognitive function and decrease memory loss after TBI.","output":"Orally Administered Cinnamon Extract Attenuates Cognitive and Neuronal Deficits Following Traumatic Brain Injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses but can lead to more severe and diffusive diseases.

This analysis compared the safety of deutetrabenazine during titration versus maintenance. METHODS: Safety was assessed during titration versus maintenance using integrated data from two 12-week placebo-controlled studies (ARM-TD and AIM-TD) and the open-label extension study. Rates were compared for overall and serious adverse events (AEs), AEs leading to discontinuation, treatment-related AEs, common AEs (&#8805;4%), and specific AEs (parkinsonism, suicidal ideation, akathisia, restlessness). RESULTS: In titration versus maintenance, AE rates with placebo (n=130) were: overall, 43.1% vs 25.4%; serious, 4.6% vs 2.3%; leading to discontinuation, 3.1% vs 0; treatment-related, 26.9% vs 10.0%. For placebo, common AEs during titration were somnolence, headache, nausea, fatigue, and dry mouth; none occurred during maintenance. In titration versus maintenance, AE rates in fixed-dose deutetrabenazine 12-36 mg (n=216) were: overall, 33.3-38.9% vs 22.2-29.2%; serious, 2.8-6.9% vs 0-1.4%; leading to discontinuation, 2.8-5.6% vs 0; treatment-related, 8.3-16.7% vs 8.3-13.9%. For fixed-dose deutetrabenazine, common AEs during titration were headache, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, depression, hypertension, and dry mouth; headache was the only common AE during maintenance. In titration versus maintenance, AE rates with flexible-dose deutetrabenazine (n=168) were: overall, 49.4% vs 32.7%; serious, 3.6% vs 2.4%; leading to discontinuation, 2.4% vs 0.6%. For flexible-dose deutetrabenazine, the only common AE during titration was somnolence; none occurred during maintenance. Rates of parkinsonism, suicidal ideation, akathisia, and restlessness were low and comparable in titration and maintenance.

The resource theory of volunteering posits that volunteerism depends on human, social, and cultural capital. Benefits of volunteering have been documented at the micro-, meso-, and macrolevels, positively affecting individual older people as well as their local communities and society at large. Taking a process-oriented theoretical approach, this study focused on the mesolevel factor of the environment with the purpose of determining the relationship between perceived neighborhood safety and volunteerism over the course of a decade and the extent to which this relationship differs by gender and race. Longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study in the United States of America between 2008 and 2018 were used (N = 72,319 adults 60 years and older). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) with robust standard errors were employed while controlling for a number of covariates. A third of the sample volunteered in the past year (33%). The probability of volunteering among older adults who rated their perceived neighborhood safety as excellent was greater compared with those who rated their perceived neighborhood safety as fair/poor after controlling for all other model covariates (ME: 0.03, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.05). Among males rating their perceived neighborhood safety as excellent, the probability of volunteering was higher (ME: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.07).

He was diagnosed as a case of anti acetyl choline receptor antibody positive thymomatous myasthenia gravis. The patient was posted for video assisted thoracoscopic excision of thymoma. The procedure was uneventful and patient was discharged with improvement in myasthenic symptoms. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of WHO Type A Spindle cell thymoma. DISCUSSION: SARS CoV19 infection is associated with an array of autoimmune disorders due to various proposed phenomenon including molecular mimicry and loss of immune tolerance. Post infectious thymomatous myasthenia gravis is extremely uncommon, and can be managed with open, minimally invasive or robotic approach.

We assessed the personal experience of COVID-19, the Spirituality, Religiosity, Meaning trough Purpose in Life-10 test, and Posttraumatic Growth (Community Post-Traumatic Growth Scale). Results showed significant differences for all measures of growth, with higher values in women. Sex and direct impact of COVID-19 accounted for 4.4% of the variance of growth. The different dimensions of meaning contribute differently to growth. Only religiosity was associated with total growth when meaning was included in the model. This same pattern of results is obtained in models predicting interpersonal and social growth. However, in predicting personal growth, it is spirituality that predicts this type of growth once meaning has been previously controlled for, while religiosity fails to reach a statistically significant level. Our results reflect the interest in maintaining the distinction between spirituality and religiosity, their different roles in traumatic growth and the different dimensions on which each has an effect.

Three HEs recorded before the shutdown began were related to accumulated primary pollutants and secondary aerosol formation under unfavorable dispersion conditions. The common \\"business as usual\\" emissions from local primary sources in this highly polluted area exceeded the wintertime atmospheric diffusive capacity to disperse them. Thus, an intensive haze formed under these adverse meteorological conditions such as in the first HE, with coal combustion to be the predominant source. Positive responses to the shutdown measures were demonstrated by reduced contributions from traffic and dust during the final two HEs that overlapped the Spring and Lantern Festivals, respectively. Local meteorological dispersion during the Spring Festival was the poorest among the five HEs. Increased residential burning plus fireworks emissions contributed to the elevated PM2.5 with the potential of enhancing the HEs.

The aim of the current study is to examine which urban park attributes influence the preferences of park users, in order to offer recommendations regarding how urban parks of quality can be designed. To elicit the preferences of park visitors we designed an online stated-choice experiment. Seven park attributes, in particular the number and composition of trees and the presence of benches, side paths, a playground, litter, and flowers, were manipulated in a virtual park. In an online stated-choice task, videos of these park alternatives were presented and the preferences of 697 participants were measured. It is found that especially the number of trees and the presence of flowerbeds, particularly with a diversity of flowers, influenced participants preferences. The presence of many benches and a playground were valued as well, but to a lesser extent. The presence of litter was found to be less troublesome than expected. Alternatives with all trees placed in one cluster were disliked. Moreover, significant standard deviations were found for the presence of side paths, a playground, and the absence of litter, which indicates that preference heterogeneity for these attributes exist. In a latent class analysis, two groups were identified, namely a Nature-loving group, who mainly valued the trees and the flowers, and an Amenity-appreciating group, who valued almost all attributes. It can be concluded that natural elements and a variety of flower species are important in an urban park, while facilities are evaluated differently by different groups of people. These findings may support park designers and policymakers in decision-making.

Previous studies have shown that BZD use could impair users' cognition, significantly affecting their quality of life. Past research has shown that higher education might play a protective role in the process of cognitive decline. Very few studies had examined the cognitive effects of BZD on highly educated older adults. The study aimed to explore how cognitive functions would be affected by benzodiazepines among highly educated older adults. Method: 140 older adults with an average education period of 14.8 years were included in this study. The subjects were divided into three separate groups, the long-term BZD users (180 days), short-term BZD users (<180 days), and non-users. Demographics and cognitive assessments for the three groups were analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA), the chi-squared test, and the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). To examine the association between BZD use and cognition a multiple linear aggression approach was used. Result: All three groups were significantly different from each other when looking at executive functioning in the Trail Making Test B (TMT-B). Compared to the control group, short-term BZD users showed significant defects in TMT-B time (p = 0.002) and TMT-B errors (p < 0.001); long-term BZD users showed significant defect on TMT-B time (p = 0.041). Compared to short-term BZD users, long-term BZD users showed significant merit on TMT-B errors (p = 0.001). No significant differences were found in other cognitive tasks that reflected general cognition, verbal memory, language fluency, and visual memory. After adjusting for demographic, increased BZD use over time was positively associated with scores for the revised Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (r = 0.377, p = 0.012). Conclusion: BZD use may be significantly associated with worse executive functioning in highly educated older adults. However, there is no association between the duration of BZD use and increased cognitive deficits in highly educated older adults. This study identified future experimental directions including potential longitudinal studies, within-subject studies comparing mood disorder patients' cognitive performance before and after onset of BZD use, and between-subject studies that directly compare BZD's effect on subjects with the same baseline of cognitive functioning.","output":"Is the Long-Term Use of Benzodiazepines Associated With Worse Cognition Performance in Highly Educated Older Adults?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Decision-making in the timing of tracheostomy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has centered on the intersection of long-standing debates on the benefits of early vs late tracheostomy, assumptions about timelines of infectivity of the novel coronavirus, and concern over risk to surgeons performing tracheostomy. Multiple consensus guidelines recommend avoiding or delaying tracheostomy, without evidence to indicate anticipated improvement in outcomes as a result. Objective To assess outcomes from early tracheostomy in the airway management of patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. Design, Setting, and Participants A retrospective medical record review was completed of 148 patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation at a single tertiary-care medical center in New York City from March 1 to May 7, 2020. Interventions Open or percutaneous tracheostomy. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were time from symptom onset to (1) endotracheal intubation, (2) tracheostomy; time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy; time from tracheostomy to (1) tracheostomy tube downsizing, (2) decannulation; total time on mechanical ventilation; and total length of stay. Results Participants included 148 patients, 120 men and 28 women, with an overall mean (SD) age of 58.1 (15.8) years. Mean (SD; median) time from symptom onset to intubation was 10.57 (6.58; 9) days; from symptom onset to tracheostomy, 22.76 (8.84; 21) days; and from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy, 12.23 (6.82; 12) days. The mean (SD; median) time to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation was 33.49 (18.82; 27) days; from tracheostomy to first downsize, 23.02 (13.76; 19) days; and from tracheostomy to decannulation, 30.16 (16.00; 26) days. The mean (SD; median) length of stay for all patients was 51.29 (23.66; 45) days. Timing of tracheostomy was significantly associated with length of stay: median length of stay was 40 days in those who underwent early tracheostomy (within 10 days of endotracheal intubation) and 49 days in those who underwent late tracheostomy (median difference, -8; 95% CI, -15 to -1). In a competing risks model with death as the competing risk, the late tracheostomy group was 16% less likely to discontinue mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.28). Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study from the first 2 months of the pandemic in New York City provides an opportunity to reconsider guidelines for tracheostomy for patients with COVID-19. Findings demonstrated noninferiority of early tracheostomy and challenges recommendations to categorically delay or avoid tracheostomy in this patient population. When aligned with emerging evidence about the timeline of infectivity of the novel coronavirus, this approach may optimize outcomes from tracheostomy while keeping clinicians safe.","output":"Early Outcomes From Early Tracheostomy for Patients With COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nurses are acknowledged for their care and expertise on the front line of pandemics over the last century.

However, for patients with severe viral pneumonia, the corticosteroid treatment is highly controversial. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review is to systematically evaluate the effect and potential mechanism of corticosteroid administration in pandemic viral pneumonia. SOURCES: We comprehensively searched all manuscripts on corticosteroids therapy for influenza, SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia from the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases. CONTENT: We systematic summarized the effects of corticosteroids therapy for pandemic viral pneumonia and the potential mechanism of corticosteroid worked in COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS: Observational studies showed that corticosteroid treatment was associated with increased mortality and nosocomial infections for influenza and delay virus clearance for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Limited data on corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19 were reported. Corticosteroids were used in about a fifth of patients (670/2995, 22.4%). Although clinical observational studies reported the improvement in symptoms and oxygenation for the severe COVID-19 patients received corticosteroids therapy, case fatality rate in the corticosteroid group was significantly higher than that in the non-corticosteroid group (69/443, 15.6% vs 56/1310, 4.3%). Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to receive corticosteroid therapy (201/382, 52.6% vs 201/1310, 15.3%). Although there is no evidence of corticosteroid therapy reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients, some improvements in clinical symptoms and oxygenation were reported in some clinical observational studies. Excessive inflammatory response and lymphopenia might be critical factors associated with disease severity and mortality of COVID-19. Sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials with rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria and standardized dose and duration of corticosteroids are needed to verify the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid therapy.","output":"Corticosteroid administration for viral pneumonia: COVID-19 and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On the occasion of the sixth edition of the Casablanca Arbitration Days, some leading arbitration practitioners from the Middle Fast and North Africa (MENA) region and further afield convened to discuss an important and topical issue: 'is arbitration helping or hindering the protection of the environment and public health?'. This conference examined the various areas where arbitration and the protection of the environment and public health interface. First, from a substantive view point, it is clear that environmental issues have become prevalent in commercial arbitration and that the latter has proven to be well suited to resolve such issues. Secondly, while some steps have already been taken in this respect, the climate change crisis requires the international arbitration community to change its ways and arbitrate in a much more environmentally friendly way. Thirdly, amidst the progressive emergence of environmental issues in investment arbitration and the responses that have already been provided by investment treaty arbitral tribunals, numerous uncertainties remain in respect of the way in which environmental issues should be treated. There is no doubt that environmental issues will give rise to intense debates before investment tribunals (and courts) and in legal literature in the near fusture. Finally, in addition to the protection of the environment, the arbitration community has already begun addressing (and, we would submit, successfully so) the substantive and procedural issues related to the protection of public health, in particular as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic.

In this study, we focused on the time course of transcriptional changes in freshly isolated human PBMCs 4, 8, 24 and 48 h after onset of stimulation with the active vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)). Taking all four time points together, 662 target genes were identified and segregated either by time of differential gene expression into 179 primary and 483 secondary targets or by driver of expression change into 293 direct and 369 indirect targets. The latter classification revealed that more than 50% of target genes were primarily driven by the cells' response to ex vivo exposure than by the nuclear hormone and largely explained its down-regulatory effect. Functional analysis indicated vitamin Ds role in the suppression of the inflammatory and adaptive immune response by down-regulating ten major histocompatibility complex class II genes, five alarmins of the S100 calcium binding protein A family and by affecting six chemokines of the C-X-C motif ligand family.

However, neurotoxicity is difficult to predict in the emergency department (ED) and only a few parameters are known to be useful to indicate development of neurotoxicity. Determination of a systemic inflammation parameter such as the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), is a rapid and simple method which was found to be a prognostic marker in various clinical conditions such as sepsis, cardiac disorders, stroke, and cancer. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether the NLR might predict neurotoxicity and be used at ED to detect neurotoxicity induced following glufosinate ammonium poisoning in admitted patients. This retrospective observational study collected data from consecutive patients diagnosed with acute glufosinate ammonium poisoning between January 2005 and December 2020. The primary outcome was development of neurotoxicity following acute glufosinate ammonium poisoning. Out of the 72 patients selected 44 patients (61.1%) exhibited neurotoxic symptoms. Neurotoxicity appeared with an approximate latent period of 12 hr. The NLR was significantly higher in the group displaying neurotoxicity. Multivariable analysis showed that the NLR was significant in predicting neurotoxicity. The NLR was independently associated with neurotoxicity initiated by glufosinate ammonium. Therefore, the use of the NLR might help clinically to readily and rapidly predict development of neurotoxicity associated with glufosinate ammonium at the ED.","output":"Prognostic value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in the diagnosis of neurotoxicity after glufosinate ammonium poisoning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: As antibiotics are generally not recommended for the treatment of acute sore throat, the availability of clinically efficacious, over\\\\the\\\\counter (OTC) treatment alternatives is becoming increasingly important. This study was designed to determine the analgesic properties of amylmetacresol and 2,4\\\\dichlorobenzyl alcohol (AMC/DCBA) throat lozenges (Strepsils(?)) in the relief of acute sore throat caused by upper respiratory tract infections. Methods: Patients (n = 310) were randomly assigned to receive AMC/DCBA throat lozenges (n = 155) or non\\\\medicated placebo lozenges (n = 155). After baseline assessments, patients completed three rating assessments at 10 timepoints from 5 to 20 min after first dose. Subsequent lozenges were taken as required, and assessments were made at the end of Day 1, 24 h after first dose, and at the end of Days 2 and 3. Analgesic properties were assessed by comparing severity of throat soreness and sore throat relief ratings. Difficulty in swallowing and functional impairment scores were also assessed. Results: Amylmetacresol/DCBA throat lozenges reduced throat soreness at 5 min after first dose, which persisted for 2 h and was significantly different vs. non\\\\medicated lozenges at all assessment timepoints for the duration of the 3\\\\day study. Similar significant effects were observed with sore throat relief, easing of difficulty with swallowing and functional impairment scores. There were no differences in adverse events reported between treatment groups. Conclusion: Amylmetacresol/DCBA throat lozenges provide rapid analgesic effects that last for 2 h, providing ongoing relief long after the lozenge has dissolved. The superior analgesic effects and improvements in functional impairment scores observed with AMC/DCBA throat lozenges translate into pain relief benefits that are clinically meaningful and are thus a suitable OTC treatment option for patients in the self\\\\management of acute sore throat.","output":"Rapid relief of acute sore throat with AMC/DCBA throat lozenges: randomised controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To observe lipid profiles and their alterations in hospitalized patients with COVID\\\\19 pneumonia (NCP) and evaluate the value of lipids for the prediction of the length of hospital stay (LOS), a total of 248 patients aged 18 years or older were enrolled in this retrospective study.

Although the essential factors known for AM development have been identified, currently an optimal in vitro culture system that can be used for studying the development and functions of AMs is still lacking. In this study, we report the development of an optimized culture system for generating AM-like cells from adult mouse bone marrow and fetal liver cells on in vitro culture in the presence of a combination of GM-CSF, TGF-, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR-) agonist rosiglitazone. These AM-like cells expressed typical AM surface markers sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin-F (Siglec-F), CD11c, and F4/80, and AM-specific genes, including carbonic anhydrase 4 (Car4), placenta-expressed transcript 1 (Plet1), eosinophil-associated RNase A family member 1 (Ear1), cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor A-like effector c (Cidec), and cytokeratin 19 (Krt19). Similar to primary AMs, the AM-like cells expressed alternative macrophage activation signature genes and self-renewal genes. Moreover, this culture system could be used for expansion of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid-derived AMs in vitro. The AM-like cells generated from bone marrow resembled the expanded bronchoalveolar lavage fluid-derived AMs in inflammatory responses and phagocytic activity. More importantly, these AM-like cells could be obtained in sufficient numbers that allowed genetic manipulation and functional analysis in vitro.

Data from the biennial national physician census surveys from 1996 to 2016 were analyzed. It involved all physicians in Japan. As the primary and secondary outcome measures, temporal trends in the number and percentages of physicians were estimated and logistic regression was used to analyze physicians opening clinics. Results Recently, the rate of increase in the number of clinical physicians in Japan has been decelerating, and the proportion of older clinical physicians has been increasing. Specifically, the number of clinical physicians increased in the first decade, from 81,888 in 1996 to 95,213 in 2006, but decreased in the second decade to 102,453 in 2016. Apparently, clinical physicians were aging: the number of clinical physicians aged 39 years or younger decreased by 48%, while those aged between 55 and 69 years increased by 91%.

AIM We used the needle grasper in SILC to hang and manipulate the gallbladder. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-five patients (43 female, 22 male) who underwent SILC between December 2013 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively for patient demographics, duration of operation, laparotomy or conventional laparoscopy necessity, drain use, complications, and hospital stay periods. To place the SILC port (Covidien, Inc.), the needle grasper was inserted at the right upper abdominal quadrant without an incision to hang and manipulate the gall-bladder. RESULTS The mean age was 47.9 13.068 years; the mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.94 3.913 kg/m2. ASA scores were 1, 2, and 3. Two patients with high BMI with additional trocar use were excluded. The operations were completed without any additional trocar in 59 patients. The mean operation time was 89 22.41 min. Eighteen patients required a drain; all were discharged after drain removal. One patient needed re-hospitalization and percutaneous drainage and was discharged on the 9th day. Fifty-three patients were discharged on the 1st post-operative day. Eleven patients with drains were discharged on the 2nd day, and 1 was discharged on the 7th day. The mean hospital stay period was 1.26 0.815 days.

Among compounds proposed to fight the SARS-CoV-2-related disease (COVID-19), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), already effective in Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), have been proposed on the basis of their antiviral action already demonstrated against SARS-CoV-1. Very few cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Ph+ ALL and in CML Italian cohorts; authors suggested that this low rate of infections might depend on the use of TKIs, but the biological causes of this phenomenon remain unknown. In this study, the CML model was used to test if TKIs would sustain or not the viral replication and if they could damage patient immunity. Firstly, the infection and replication rate of torquetenovirus (TTV), whose load is inversely proportional to the host immunological control, have been measured in CML patients receiving nilotinib. A very low percentage of subjects were infected at baseline, and TTV did not replicate or at least showed a low replication rate during the follow-up, with a mean load comparable to the measured one in healthy subjects. Then, after gene expression profiling experiments, we found that several antiviral genes, such as CD28 and IFN gamma, were upregulated, while genes with proviral action, such as ARG-1, CEACAM1, and FUT4, were less expressed during treatment with imatinib, thus demonstrating that TKIs are not detrimental from the immunological point of view. To sum up, our data could offer some biological explanations to the low COVID-19 occurrence in Ph+ ALL and CML patients and sustain the use of TKIs in COVID-19, as already proposed by several international ongoing studies.","output":"Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Play an Antiviral Action in Patients Affected by Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: A Possible Model Supporting Their Use in the Fight Against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Peritoneal metastases from colon and rectal cancer presents a new target for a regional approach to treatment.

RESULTS A cohort of 73 patients with peritoneal metastases and lymph node metastases but no liver metastases provided the information. All patients had a complete cytoreduction. Left-sided primary cancer and a complete or near complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) indicated improved survival. Tumor progression within the abdominal incision, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) >10, peritoneal cancer index >9 and peritoneal metastases present in the abdominopelvic regions 6 and 11 carried an especially guarded prognosis. CONCLUSIONS Reduced survival occurred with a right-sided or rectal primary cancer, a CEA >10, tumor cell entrapment, and involvement of abdominopelvic regions 6 and 11. Effective NAC showed a favorable outcome.","output":"Revised prognostic indicators for treatment of lymph node positive colorectal peritoneal metastases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Este artculo y video disponibles en el OJS de la Revista describe los procedimientos para la recoleccin de hisopos respiratorios que garantizan la bioseguridad y el diagnstico de COVID-19 en adultos y ni?os.","output":"Let's guarantee the quality of respiratory samples to diagnose COVID-19/ Garanticemos la calidad de las muestras respiratorias para diagnosticar COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The spread of epidemics resulting in many deaths has been known since the dawn of civilization, for example, the typhus and smallpox epidemics and the plague. Early in the previous century there was an outbreak of the Spanish Flue and towards the end of the 60's, the AIDS epidemic (HIV). Since the start of the current century, several epidemics broke out and spread to various places around the world, for instance, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), the Avian Influenza and the Swine Influenza. In 2014 there was an outbreak of Ebola (Ebola virus disease) and in 2015 the Zika virus emerged and there were more. Epidemics cause havoc and impact all areas of life. Each epidemic takes an unfathomable price in lives. It is estimated, for example, that the AIDS epidemic took the lives of some 30 million people. The Corona virus (Covid-19) broke out in China, towards the end of 2019 and spread to most parts of the world. The implications of the outbreak are similar in many countries, among others, due to the uncertainty regarding the way the virus spreads, the appropriate treatment, the lack of vaccination and the high rate of deaths. Naturally, at such times physical protection is a top priority. However, coping with the implications to people's mental health is no less important and these may result in long-term negative impacts.","output":"[THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON MENTAL HEALTH - LITERATURE REVIEW]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Users play a critical role in the creation and propagation of fake news online by consuming and sharing articles with inaccurate information either intentionally or unintentionally. Fake news are written in a way to confuse readers and therefore understanding which articles contain fabricated information is very challenging for non-experts. Given the difficulty of the task, several fact checking websites have been developed to raise awareness about which articles contain fabricated information. As a result of those platforms, several users are interested to share posts that cite evidence with the aim to refute fake news and warn other users. These users are known as fact checkers. However, there are users who tend to share false information, who can be characterised as potential fake news spreaders. In this paper, we propose the CheckerOrSpreader model that can classify a user as a potential fact checker or a potential fake news spreader. Our model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and combines word embeddings with features that represent users personality traits and linguistic patterns used in their tweets. Experimental results show that leveraging linguistic patterns and personality traits can improve the performance in differentiating between checkers and spreaders.","output":"The Role of Personality and Linguistic Patterns in Discriminating Between Fake News Spreaders and Fact Checkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nurses are in the frontline and play an important role in the battle against the COrona VIrus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Sleep problems among health care workers are likely to increase due to the pandemic. However, it is conceivable that negative health outcomes related to the pandemic fluctuate with the infection rate waves of the pandemic. The present study aimed to investigate sleep patterns among Norwegian nurses, after the first wave, during a period with very low rates of COVID-19. METHODS: Data stemmed from the cohort study SUrvey of Shift work, Sleep and Health (SUSSH) among Norwegian nurses. A total of 1532 nurses responded one time to a questionnaire between June and September in 2020 including items about demographics and work, information about COVID-19 and quarantine, sleep patterns and changes in sleep patterns due to the pandemic. Descriptive statistics for all relevant variables were calculated and McNemar tests were used to compare categorical variables. RESULTS: The majority of nurses (84.2%) reported no change in sleep duration after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before, 11.9% reported less sleep, and 3.9% reported more sleep. Similarly, 82.4% of the nurses reported no change in their sleep quality, whereas 16.2% of the nurses reported poorer sleep quality after the first wave of the pandemic compared to before. The majority of nurses reported no change in their sleep schedule due to the pandemic, although 9.6% of the nurses reported to go to bed later and 9.0% woke up earlier than before the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Most existing literature exploring sleep among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic has been carried out during periods with high infection rates. In this study we aimed to investigate sleep patterns among Norwegian nurses following the first wave, during a period of low COVID-19 rates in Norway. Most of the nurses reported no change in neither sleep duration, sleep quality, bedtime, nor wake-up times compared to before the pandemic. Still, nearly 12% reported shorter sleep duration, and about 16% reported poorer sleep quality indicating that some nurses experienced worsening of their sleep following the pandemic.","output":"Sleep patterns among Norwegian nurses between the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a poor prognosis disease partly linked to diagnosis at an advanced stage. The quality of care management is a factor that needs to be explored, more specifically optimal organisation of first-line treatment. METHODS: A retrospective study, dealing with all patients diagnosed within the Rhone-Alpes region with initial diagnosis EOC in 2012, was performed. The aim was to describe the impact of multidisciplinary tumour boards (MTB) in the organisation of care and the consequence on the patient's outcomes. RESULTS: 271 EOC were analysed. 206 patients had an advanced EOC. Median progression-free survival (PFS) is 17.8 months (CI95%, 14.6-21.2) for AOC. 157 patients (57.9%) had a front-line surgery versus 114 patients (42.1%) interval debulking surgery. PFS for AOC patients with no residual disease is 24.3 months compared with 15.3 months for patients with residual disease (p = .01). No macroscopic residual disease is more frequent in the patients discussed before surgery in MTB compared with patients not submitted before surgery (73% vs. 56.2%, p < .001). CONCLUSION: These results highlight the heterogeneity of medical practices in terms of front-line surgery versus interval surgery, in the administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and in the setting of MTB discussion.","output":"Impact of multidisciplinary tumour board in the management of ovarian carcinoma in the first-line setting.

In the context of speech, when confronted with a degraded acoustic signal, congruent visual inputs promote comprehension. When this input is masked, speech comprehension consequently becomes more difficult. But it still remains inconclusive which levels of speech processing are affected under which circumstances by occluding the mouth area. To answer this question, we conducted an audiovisual (AV) multi-speaker experiment using naturalistic speech. In half of the trials, the target speaker wore a (surgical) face mask, while we measured the brain activity of normal hearing participants via magnetoencephalography (MEG). We additionally added a distractor speaker in half of the trials in order to create an ecologically difficult listening situation. A decoding model on the clear AV speech was trained and used to reconstruct crucial speech features in each condition. We found significant main effects of face masks on the reconstruction of acoustic features, such as the speech envelope and spectral speech features (i.e. pitch and formant frequencies), while reconstruction of higher level features of speech segmentation (phoneme and word onsets) were especially impaired through masks in difficult listening situations. As we used surgical face masks in our study, which only show mild effects on speech acoustics, we interpret our findings as the result of the missing visual input. Our findings extend previous behavioural results, by demonstrating the complex contextual effects of occluding relevant visual information on speech processing.","output":"Masking of the mouth area impairs reconstruction of acoustic speech features and higher-level segmentational features in the presence of a distractor speaker"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic affects non-COVID-19-related health services use due to shutdown measures and fears of potential coronavirus infection or fears of overwhelmed health systems. We aimed to explore the impact of the shutdown in spring 2020 on the intensity of health services use (consultation counts, chronic disease measurement counts) in Swiss general practice. Methods Based on electronic medical records from 278 general practitioners in Switzerland, we built two patient cohorts: (1) Jan-Jun 2019 (173,523 patients);(2) Jan-Jun 2020 (179,086 patients). We used linear regression analysis to model weekly consultation counts, as well as weekly blood pressure (BP) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement counts, per 100 patients. We calculated expected values in absence of a shutdown and compared them to actual observed values in 2020. The analyses were repeated for selected at-risk groups (patients with hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease) and different age groups (<60 years, 60-80 years, and >80 years). Results During the shutdown period (calendar weeks 13-19 in 2020), weekly consultation counts were lower than non-shutdown models predicted. Consultation rates reduced by 17.2% for the total population, 16.5% for patients with hypertension, 17.5% for patients with diabetes, and 17.6% for patients with cardiovascular disease. Between different age groups, consultation counts reduced by 15.7% for patients aged <60 years, 20.4% for patients aged 60-80 years, and 14.5% for patients aged >80 years. Weekly BP counts reduced by 35.3% in the total population and by 35.0% for patients with hypertension. Weekly HbA1c counts reduced by 33.2% in the total population and by 29.8% for patients with diabetes. P-values were <0.001 for all reported estimates. Conclusions We found a significant decrease in the intensity of health services use in Swiss general practice during the shutdown in spring 2020. Key messages We demonstrate that the intensity of health services use in general practice decreased during the first Swiss shutdown in spring 2020, overall and among patients with chronic conditions. It is crucial that health systems remain able to meet the non-COVID-19-related health care needs of patients during shutdowns, especially for patients with chronic conditions who require regular care.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the intensity of health services use in general practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 global pandemic has disrupted the lives of millions and forced countries to devise public health policies to reduce the pace of transmission. In the Middle East and North Africa, falling oil prices, disparities in wealth and public health infrastructure, and large refugee populations have significantly increased the COVID-19 disease burden. In light of these exacerbating factors, public health surveillance is particularly necessary to help leaders understand and implement effective disease control policies to reduce Sars-CoV-2 persistence and transmission. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics, in combination with traditional surveillance, for COVID-19 transmission that account for weekly shifts in the pandemic speed, acceleration, jerk and persistence, to better understand country risk for explosive growth and to better inform those who are managing the pandemic. Existing surveillance coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until an effective vaccine is developed. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 30 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We use an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in the Middle East and North Africa as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel data model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: The regression Wald statistic is significant (&#967;^2 (5)=859.5, P<.001). The Sargan test is not significant, failing to reject the validity of over identifying restrictions (&#967;^2 (294)= 16 P=.99). Countries with the highest cumulative caseload of the novel coronavirus include Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Israel with 530,380, 426,634, 342,202, and 303,109 cases respectively. Many of the smaller countries in MENA have higher infection rates than those countries with the highest caseloads. Oman has 33.3 new infections per 100,000 population while Bahrain has 12.1, Libya has 14, and Lebanon has 14.6. In order of most to least number of cumulative deaths since January 2020, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia have 30,375, 10,254, 6,120, and 5,185 respectively. Israel, Bahrain, Lebanon, and Oman had the highest rates of COVID-19 persistence which are the number of new infections statistically related to new infections 7 days ago. Bahrain had positive speed, acceleration and jerk signaling the potential for explosive growth. CONCLUSIONS: Static and dynamic public health surveillance metrics provide a more complete picture of pandemic progression across countries in MENA. Static measures capture data at a given point in time such as infection rates and death rates. By including speed, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence, public health officials may design policy with an eye to the future. Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Israel all demonstrated the highest rate of infections, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence rates prompting public health leaders to increase prevention efforts.","output":"Middle East and North Africa SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance: A Longitudinal Trend Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID?19 pandemic and associated public health measures have disrupted the lives of people around the world. It is already evident that the direct and indirect psychological and social effects of the COVID?19 pandemic are insidious and affect the mental health of young children and adolescents now and will in the future. The aim and objectives of this knowledge-synthesis study were to identify the impact of the pandemic on childrens and adolescents mental health and to evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions employed during previous and the current pandemic to promote childrens and adolescents mental health. Methodology: We conducted the systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included experimental randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, observational studies, and qualitative studies. Results: Of the 5828 articles that we retrieved, 18 articles met the inclusion criteria. We thematically analyzed them and put the major findings under the thematic areas of impact of the pandemic on childrens and adolescents mental health. These studies reported that pandemics cause stress, worry, helplessness, and social and risky behavioral problems among children and adolescents (e.g., substance abuse, suicide, relationship problems, academic issues, and absenteeism from work). Interventions such as art-based programs, support services, and clinician-led mental health and psychosocial services effectively decrease mental health issues among children and adolescents. Conclusion: Children and adolescents are more likely to experience high rates of depression and anxiety during and after a pandemic. It is critical that future researchers explore effective mental health strategies that are tailored to the needs of children and adolescents. Explorations of effective channels regarding the development and delivery of evidenced-based, age-appropriate services are vital to lessen the effects and improve long-term capacities for mental health services for children and adolescents. Key Practitioner Message: The COVID-19 pandemics physical restrictions and social distancing measures have affected each and every domain of life. Although the number of children and adolescents affected by the disease is small, the disease and the containment measures such as social distancing, school closure, and isolation have negatively impacted the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents. The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children and adolescents is of great concern. Anxiety, depression, disturbances in sleep and appetite, as well as impairment in social interactions are the most common presentations. It has been indicated that compared to adults, this pandemic may continue to have increased long term adverse consequences on childrens and adolescents mental health. As the pandemic continues, it is important to monitor the impact on childrens and adolescents mental health status and how to help them to improve their mental health outcomes in the time of the current or future pandemics.","output":"Mental Health of Children and Adolescents Amidst COVID-19 and Past Pandemics: A Rapid Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, wearing facemasks has become more important for healthcare workers.

PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Comments were collected from three Reddit online discussion boards dedicated to foster families (N = 11,830). METHODS: We used machine learning techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation, for topic modeling and textual analysis for qualitative coding of the Reddit comments. RESULTS: Results showed that three main topics had both significant quantitative and meaningful qualitative changes before and after COVID-19. There were significant increases in conversation about becoming a foster parent (F = 5.75, p = 0.02) and activities for foster children (F = 10.61, p = 0.001), whereas there was a significant decrease in discussing permanency (F = 9.46, p = 0.003) before and after the onset of COVID-19. Qualitative coding showed that regarding the topic of becoming a parent, excitement over approval of foster care license before COVID-19 shifted to foster families' increased anxieties about delays in their licensing cases after COVID-19. For permanency, content changed from the best interest of the child and reunifications before COVID-19 to concerns over family separations and permanency challenges after COVID-19. Regarding activities for foster children, content related to everyday activities before COVID-19 changed to specific activities foster children and families could do during lockdowns.

To use this algorithm for multiple-sequence evolutionary modelling, it would be useful to apply the EM algorithm to estimate not only the probability parameters of the stochastic grammar, but also the instantaneous mutation rates of the underlying evolutionary model (to facilitate the development of stochastic grammars based on phylogenetic trees, also known as Statistical Alignment). Recently, we showed how to do this for the point substitution component of the evolutionary process; here, we extend these results to the indel process. Results: We present an algorithm for maximum-likelihood estimation of insertion and deletion rates from multiple sequence alignments, using EM, under the single-residue indel model owing to Thorne, Kishino and Felsenstein (the TKF91 model). The algorithm converges extremely rapidly, gives accurate results on simulated data that are an improvement over parsimonious estimates (which are shown to underestimate the true indel rate), and gives plausible results on experimental data (coronavirus envelope domains). Owing to the algorithm's close similarity to the BaumCWelch algorithm for training hidden Markov models, it can be used in an unsupervised fashion to estimate rates for unaligned sequences, or estimate several sets of rates for sequences with heterogenous rates.

Our results suggest that higher cumulative doses and longer treatment durations of steroids are more likely to lead to the development of osteonecrosis in SARS patients. INTRODUCTION: The link between steroid treatment and the risk of osteonecrosis in SARS patients remains unknown. The present meta-analysis aimed to examine the dose-response association between steroid therapy and osteonecrosis incidence in SARS patients. The sex differences in the development of steroid-induced osteonecrosis were also examined. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, and WANFANG for studies that involved steroid therapy and reported osteonecrosis data in SARS patients. Two authors independently extracted the data from the individual studies, and the rate ratio (RR) of osteonecrosis was calculated using random-effect models. RESULTS: Ten studies with 1137 recovered SARS patients met the inclusion criteria. Close relationships between osteonecrosis incidence and both the cumulative dose and treatment duration of steroids were observed. The summary RR of osteonecrosis was 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30C1.89, p < 0.001) per 5.0 g increase in the cumulative dose of steroids and was 1.29 (95% CI 1.09C1.53, p = 0.003) for each 10-day increment of increase in treatment duration. The relationship was non-linear (p (non-linear) < 0.001 and p (non-linear) = 0.022). There were no significant differences in the risk of developing osteonecrosis between the male and female patients (RR 0.01, 95% CI ?0.03 to 0.06, p = 0.582). CONCLUSIONS: SARS patients who received higher cumulative doses and longer treatment durations of steroids were more likely to develop osteonecrosis, and there were no sex differences in this dose-dependent side effect. Our findings suggest that it is important to reduce osteonecrosis risk by modifying the cumulative dose and the treatment duration of steroids in SARS patients.

His work as an anatomist is preserved in two innovative books, the first designed to give a three-dimensional view of the nervous system in 1865, and the second ushering in anatomical illustration using photography and introducing micro-photography in 1873. Splitting his time between La Salptrire Hospital and the Ivry asylum, Luys presented brain physiology in his book Le cerveau et ses fonctions (the brain and its functions) to shine light on its disorders, as an introduction to his voluminous Trait clinique et pratique des maladies mentales (clinical and practical treatise on mental illnesses), which already showed the work of a fertile imagination attempting to connect mental illnesses with anatomical observations expressly interpreted.

With the help of a fervent believer in occultism, Grard Encausse, who, unbeknownst to him, manipulated the young women he ran his experiments on, Luys made the most extravagant observations, believing naively in his findings and proceeding without critical analysis. This story of a great scientist, slipping into irrational thinking by abandoning the benefits of doubt, is an opportunity to explore the mechanisms leading to this deviation, which is not without parallels with more recent deviations during the AIDS and Covid-19 pandemics.","output":"De la connaissance  la croyance ou lgarement de Jules Luys, un cheminement intellectuel toujours dactualit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Italy was the first country in Europe which imposed control measures of travel restrictions, quarantine and contact precautions to tackle the epidemic spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in all its regions While such efforts are still ongoing, uncertainties regarding SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and ascertainment of cases make it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of restrictions Here, we employed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) model to assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, working on the number of reported patients in intensive care unit (ICU) and deaths in Sicily (Italy), from 24 February to 13 April Overall, we obtained a good fit between estimated and reported data, with a fraction of unreported SARS-CoV-2 cases (18 4%;95%CI = 0&ndash;34 0%) before 10 March lockdown Interestingly, we estimated that transmission rate in the community was reduced by 32% (95%CI = 23&ndash;42%) after the first set of restrictions, and by 80% (95%CI = 70&ndash;89%) after those adopted on 23 March Thus, our estimates delineated the characteristics of SARS-CoV2 epidemic before restrictions taking into account unreported data Moreover, our findings suggested that transmission rates were reduced after the adoption of control measures However, we cannot evaluate whether part of this reduction might be attributable to other unmeasured factors, and hence further research and more accurate data are needed to understand the extent to which restrictions contributed to the epidemic control","output":"Modeling the Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Outbreak in Sicily, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has increased stress, fear, and anxiety for many people. At the same time, social isolation restrictions have disrupted most in-person mental health services. Many mental health providers are adapting to the crisis by utilizing telemental health. However, the literature is scant about how to most effectively utilize telemental health practices with refugee clients, many of whom do not speak English and require an interpreter, may have limited technological proficiency or access, and/or have additional case management needs and coordination as part of their treatment plan. The purpose of this study is to understand how mental health clinicians and case workers at a refugee-serving mental health clinic are successfully shifting their face-to-face practice to telemental health, the obstacles they encounter, and what resources they have found to be helpful. Two main themes emerged from the data: (1) refugee mental health providers display initiative and flexibility in their adaptation to telemental health and (2) providers reported numerous obstacles to effective telemental health, including client barriers, tech barriers, communication issues, and the challenge of reading nonverbal cues virtually. By better understanding telemental health when working with refugees, clinical social workers will be more effective in meeting the needs of a population with significant mental health needs and limited mental healthcare access.","output":"Telemental Health Use and Refugee Mental Health Providers Following COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of our study was to determine the changes in the smoking habits of active smokers hospitalized with Coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) We conducted a single-center, retrospective research on smokers hospitalized with Covid-19 between March 2020 and June 2020 A total of 105 patients were included in the study The age, gender, comorbidities, cigarette pack per year, PCR test results of the patients were recorded from the patient files Patients were approached by telephone and a questionnaire was applied to them to evaluate smoking habits following discharge A total of 105 patients participated in the study 42 (40 0%) were female and the mean age of the patients was 39 80  12 66 (width, 16-69) years Patients smoked 14 51 13 88 packs of cigarettes a year on average Of the patients, 13 33% quit smoking In our study, it was determined that after having Covid -19, 86 66% (n: 91) of the patients continued to smoke Of those who did not quit smoking, 53 8% stated that they reduced smoking compared to the past, 76 9% thought to quit smoking, and 48 4% said they needed professional support to quit smoking In addition, 38 5% of those who didn't quit smoking stated that they believed they were caught Covid-19 due to smoking Raising awareness that quitting smoking reduces the risks and complications of Covid-19 and activating new smoking cessation programs may help individuals to quit smoking during the pandemic [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Eastern Journal of Medicine is the property of Yuzuncu Yil University, Faculty of Medicine and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Evaluation of Changes in the Smoking Habits of Patients with Coronavirus Disease-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Covid-19 pandemic and accompanying recession, millions of low-wage workers have become increasingly vulnerable to exploitation. Limited scholarly attention, however, has been paid to the relationship between rising unemployment, labour standards violations, and government enforcement capacities during periods of economic recession. In this article, we begin to draw out these connections. First, we turn to the case of the Great Recession of 2008-2010 in the United States to examine the relationship between rising unemployment and minimum wage violations, using Current Population Survey (CPS) data to estimate minimum wage violation rates by industry and demographic group. We find that minimum wage violations rose in tandem with rising unemployment, and were shouldered by some groups of low-wage workers more than others, and that they were unexpectedly affected certain industries more than others. We then use an analysis of internal complaint data filed with the San Francisco Office of Labour Standards Enforcement (OLSE) to illustrate that even during non-recession periods, the number of complaints received by industry are in some cases wildly disproportionate to the estimated violation rates by industry. This underscores the shortcomings of the complaint-based enforcement model, which is by far the most common mode of workplace regulation in the United States. Finally, we discuss how this empirical evidence points to the importance of developing alternatives to complaint-based models of enforcement C in particular, strategic enforcement and co-enforcement C especially during periods of high unemployment. ? 2021 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","output":"Wage Theft in a Recession: Unemployment, Labour Violations, and Enforcement Strategies for Difficult Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has significantly disrupted normal activities globally.

Groups from China identified and sequenced the virus responsible for COVID-19, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and determined that it was a novel coronavirus sharing high sequence identity with bat- and pangolin-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, suggesting a zoonotic origin. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a broad range of vertebrates. The rapid release of the sequence of the virus has enabled the development of diagnostic tools. Additionally, serological tests can now identify individuals who have been infected. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a fatality rate of around 1-3%, which is commonly linked to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely resulting from uncontrolled immune activation, the so called \\"cytokine storm\\". Risk factors for mortality include advanced age, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Drug repurposing has been used to rapidly identify potential treatments for COVID-19, which could move quickly to phase III. Better knowledge of the virus and its enzymes will aid the development of more potent and specific direct-acting antivirals. In the long term, a vaccine to prevent infection is crucial; however, even if successful, it might not be available before 2021-22. To date, except for intravenous remdesivir and dexamethasone, which have modest effects in moderate to severe COVID-19, no strong clinical evidence supports the efficacy of any other drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

Accurate, timely, rapid, and nondestructive approaches to predict leaf photosynthetic traits from hyperspectral reflectance are urgently needed for high-throughput crop monitoring. Therefore, this study thoroughly evaluated the state-of-the-art physically-based radiative transfer models (RTMs), data-driven partial-least-squares regression (PLSR), and generalized PLSR (gPLSR) models to estimate leaf traits from leaf-clip hyperspectral reflectance, which was collected from maize (Zea mays L.) plots with diverse genotypes, growth stages, treatments of nitrogen fertilizers and ozone stresses in three growing seasons. Results show that leaf RTMs considering bidirectional effects can give accurate estimates of chlorophyll content (Pearson correlation r = 0.95), while gPLSR enabled retrieval of leaf nitrogen concentration (r = 0.85). Using PLSR with field measurements for training, the cross-validation indicates that Vmax can be well predicted from spectra (r = 0.81). The integration of chlorophyll content (strongly related to visible spectra) and nitrogen concentration (linked to shortwave infrared signals) can provide better predictions of Vmax (r = 0.71) than only using either chlorophyll or nitrogen individually.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The study included 56 patients on maintenance hemodialysis (dialysis group) and a control group composed of 95 health care workers. All participants had received two doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine. The serology testing was done using Quant II IgG anti-Spike severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) assay by Abbott a median of 30 days after receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. RESULTS: All subjects in the control group developed an antibody response compared with 96% (54 of 56) positive responders in the dialysis group. The IgG levels in the dialysis group (median, 2900; interquartile range, 1128-5651) were significantly lower than in the control group (median, 7401; interquartile range, 3687-15,471). A Mann-Whitney U test indicated that this difference was statistically significant (U=1238; P<0.001). There was a significant inverse correlation of age and IgG levels in both groups. The odds of being in the lower quartile were significantly higher for older individuals (odds ratio, 1.11 per year of age; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.20; P=0.004) and for the dialysis group compared with the control group (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 7.51; P=0.05).

Online communities, forums, and social media provide potential venues to search for relevant questions and answers, or post questions and seek answers from other members. However, due to the nature of such sites, there are always a limited number of relevant questions and responses to search from, and posted questions are rarely answered immediately. With the advancements in the field of natural language processing, particularly in the domain of language models, it has become possible to design chatbots that can automatically answer consumer questions. However, such models are rarely applied and evaluated in the healthcare domain, to meet the information needs with accurate and up-to-date healthcare data.

The safety and feasibility of ventilator sharing is unknown. METHODS: A single ventilator in pressure control mode was used with flow control valves to simultaneously ventilate two patients with different lung compliances. The system was first evaluated using high-fidelity human patient simulator mannequins and then tested for 1 h in two pairs of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure. Patients were matched on positive end-expiratory pressure, fractional inspired oxygen tension, and respiratory rate. Tidal volume and peak airway pressure (PMAX) were recorded from each patient using separate independent spirometers and arterial blood gas samples drawn at 0, 30, and 60 min. The authors assessed acid-base status, oxygenation, tidal volume, and PMAX for each patient. Stability was assessed by calculating the coefficient of variation. RESULTS: The valves performed as expected in simulation, providing a stable tidal volume of 400 ml each to two mannequins with compliance ratios varying from 20:20 to 20:90 ml/cm H2O. The system was then tested in two pairs of patients. Pair 1 was a 49-yr-old woman, ideal body weight 46 kg, and a 55-yr-old man, ideal body weight 64 kg, with lung compliance 27 ml/cm H2O versus 35 ml/cm H2O. The coefficient of variation for tidal volume was 0.2 to 1.7%, and for PMAX 0 to 1.1%. Pair 2 was a 32-yr-old man, ideal body weight 62 kg, and a 56-yr-old woman, ideal body weight 46 kg, with lung compliance 12 ml/cm H2O versus 21 ml/cm H2O. The coefficient of variation for tidal volume was 0.4 to 5.6%, and for PMAX 0 to 2.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Differential ventilation using a single ventilator is feasible.

To minimize the risk of being infected with Covid-19, older persons are recommended to self-isolate in their homes, while formal support such as respite care and day care centers are withdrawn. This study involved semi-structured interviews with 24 spouse carers of community-living PwDs, with the aim of describing their situation during the pandemic. The interviews were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. Results revealed that they commonly declined help because of the perceived risk of their spouse being infected with Covid-19 and thus also possibly causing their death. They described feelings of being trapped in their situation, as they experienced having no choice than take all responsibility for the care of their partner themselves, with cost of being unable to take necessary breaks. This was described as making an already strained situation almost unbearable, which led to conflicts with their partner. However, the spouses also described positive aspects due to strategic changes in health and social care provision to prevent the spread of the virus, such as greater staff continuity in home care services, and patient transportation service. These made the PwD less stressed and influenced their everyday life positively.

MATERIAL AND METHOD The data was collected in June 2020 through focus-group interviews with healthcare professionals and through an anonymous online survey of patients who had attended video consultations during a period of three weeks in June 2020. RESULTS The data from the focus-group interviews with seven rheumatologists and seven nurses were sorted into main thematic categories: patient, healthcare professional, consultation, and technology. The healthcare professionals felt that video consultations, with some exceptions, were appropriate in the follow-up of patients with rheumatic diseases, and especially for stable patients with no confounding issues. Of the 383 patients who were invited to participate, 139 (36 %) responded to the survey. The patients were largely satisfied with the video consultation, with a median score of 10 (quartiles 8-10) on a numerical rating scale from 0 to 10, however, 32 (27 %) patients considered the lack of clinical examination to be detrimental.

However, many nurses are using their personal digital devices, such as smartphones, while at work for personal and professional purposes. Despite the proliferation of smartphone use in the health care setting, there is limited research on the clinical use of these devices by nurses. It is unclear as to what extent and for what reasons nurses are using their personal smartphones to support their practice. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to understand the current breadth of research on nurses personal smartphone use in the workplace and to identify implications for research, practice, and education. METHODS: A scoping review using Arksey and OMalleys methodological framework was conducted, and the following databases were used in the literature search: CINAHL, PubMed, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Embase, MEDLINE, Nursing and Allied Health Database, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Reviews. Search terms used were Nurs* AND (personal digital technology OR smartphone OR cellphone OR mobile phone OR cellular phone). Inclusion criteria included research focused on nurses use of their own digital technologies, reported in English, and published between January 2010 and January 2020. Exclusion criteria were if the device or app was implemented for research purposes, if it was provided by the organization, if it focused on infection control, and if it was focused on nursing students or nursing education. RESULTS: A total of 22 out of 2606 articles met the inclusion criteria. Two main themes from the thematic analyses included personal smartphone use for patient care and implications of personal smartphone use. Nurses used their smartphones to locate information about medications, procedures, diagnoses, and laboratory tests. Downloaded apps were used by nurses to locate patient careCrelated information. Nurses reported improved communication among health team members and used their personal devices to communicate patient information via text messaging, calling, and picture and video functions. Nurses expressed insight into personal smartphone use and challenges related to distraction, information privacy, organizational policies, and patient perception. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses view personal smartphones as an efficient method to gather patient care information and to communicate with the health care team. This review highlights knowledge gaps regarding nurses personal device use and information safety, patient care outcomes, and communication practices. This scoping review facilitates critical reflection on patient care practices within the digital context. We infer that nurses use of their personal devices to communicate among the health care team may demonstrate a technological work-around meant to reconcile health system demands for cost-efficiency with efforts to provide quality patient care. The current breadth of research is focused on acute care, with little research focus in other practices settings.

Methods During first wave of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic (April 23 rd to June 24 th , 2020), the HCWs in the greater Stockholm region in Sweden were invited to a study of past or present SARS-CoV-2 infection. We develop a discrete time Markov model using a cohort of 9449 healthcare workers (HCWs) who had complete data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies as well as sick leave data for the calendar year 2020. The one-week and standardized longer term transition probabilities of sick leave and the ratios of the standardized probabilities for the baseline covariate distribution were compared with the referent period (an independent period when there were no SARS-CoV-2 infections) in relation to PCR results, serology results and gender. Results The one-week probabilities of transitioning from healthy to partial sick leave or full sick leave during the outbreak as compared to after the outbreak were highest for healthy HCWs testing positive for large amounts of virus (3.69, (95% confidence interval, CI: 2.44-5.59) and 6.67 (95% CI: 1.58-28.13), respectively). The proportion of all sick leaves attributed to COVID-19 during outbreak was at most 55% (95% CI: 50%-59%).

However, outcome data on breast cancer subgroups in the Finnish population is limited. This retrospective registry-based study aimed to assess patient characteristics and clinical outcomes of different breast cancer subgroups in early (EBC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in a real-life clinical setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 6977 adult female breast cancer patients diagnosed in Southwest Finland during 2005-2018. Patients were divided into four mutually exclusive groups: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+), triple negative, HER2-/hormone receptor positive (HR+), and HER2 and/or HR status unknown, and further into EBC and MBC patients. Real-world (rw) clinical outcomes: disease free survival (rwDFS), progression free survival (rwPFS), overall survival (OS) and distant recurrence-free interval (rwDRFI) were assessed. RESULTS: Within EBC 5-year survival was the highest 88% in HER2-/HR+, 85% in HER2+, and 75% in triple negative. The rwDFS varied significantly in EBC (5-year rwDFS HER2+, triple negative, HER2-/HR+: 80%, 71%, 87% respectively). In MBC median survival was 2 years for both HER2-/HR+ and HER2+, and markedly shorter for triple negative (0.8 years). Independent predictors of mortality were age (HR 1.1), other subgroups than HER2-/HR+ (HR 1.2-1.9), metastatic disease (HR 9.8), and other malignancies (HR 2.7). CONCLUSIONS: This registry-based study demonstrates significant differences in breast cancer outcomes on the subgroup level, as well as poorer outcomes compared to clinical trials, giving complementary insight on clinical characteristics in an unselected patient population. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTISE: This retrospective registry-based study assessed the clinical outcomes of different breast cancer subgroups in 6977 adult female breast cancer patients diagnosed in Southwest Finland during 2005-2018. Results demonstrated significant variation in the survival between subgroups in both EBC and MBC, as well as differences between unselected patients representing the standard of care and randomized clinical trials.

No studies have yet summarised the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. Methods: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. We synthesised a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 6.4%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%) and 9% (95% CI, 4%-14%) respectively. COPD patients were at a higher risk of more severe disease (risk of severity = 63%, (22/35) compared to patients without COPD 33.4% (409/1224) [calculated RR, 1.88 (95% CI, 1.4-2.4)]. This was associated with higher mortality (60%). Our results showed that 22% (31/139) of current smokers and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications. The calculated RR showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [95% CI: 1.03-2.04] to have severe complications compared to former and never smokers. Current smokers also had a higher mortality rate of 38.5%. Conclusion: Although COPD prevalence in COVID-19 cases was low in current reports, COVID-19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in COPD. Compared to former and never smokers, current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications and higher mortality rate.

As such, these data reflect the dynamic changes in electrical resistance that occur over time. Currently methodologies for assessing ECIS data rely on single point assessments of barrier function, such as the maximal drop in trans\\\\endothelial electrical resistance (TER(Max)). However, this approach ignores the myriad of changes in resistance that occur before and after the TER(Max) data point. Herein, we utilize polynomial curve fitting on experimentally generated ECIS data, thus allowing for comparing ECIS experiments by examining the mean polynomial coefficients between groups. We show that polynomial curves accurately fit a variety of ECIS data, and that concordance between TER(Max) and coefficient analysis varies by type of stimulus, suggesting that TER(Max) differences may not always correlate with a significant difference in the overall shape of the ECIS profile. Lastly, we identify factors that impact coefficient values obtained in our analyses, including the length of time devoted to baseline measurements before addition of stimuli.

Despite having an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with a proofreading activity, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are on the rise periodically. Some of the mutations in these variants, especially mutations on the spike protein, aid the virus in transmission, infectivity and host immune evasion. Further, these mutations also reduce the effectiveness of some of the current vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In the present study, using the available 984,769 SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences on the NCBI database from the end of 2019 till 28 July 2021, we have estimated the global prevalence of so-called adaptive mutations and mutations identified in the prolonged infections, in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Irrespective of the geographical region, in the case of the adaptive mutations, N501Y (48.38%) was found to be the dominant mutation followed by L452R (17.52%), T478K (14.31%), E484K (4.69%), S477N (3.29%), K417T (1.64%), N439K (0.7%) and S494P (0.7%). Other mutations were found to be less prevalent (less than 0.7%). Since the last two months, there has been a massive increase of L452R and T478K mutations (delta variant) in certain areas. In the case of prolonged infections mutations (long-term SARS-CoV-2 infections), V483A (0.009%) was found to be dominant followed by Q493R (0.009%), while other mutations were found in less than 0.007% of the studied sequences. The data obtained in this study will aid in the development of better infection control policies, thereby curbing the spread of this virus.","output":"Global Prevalence of Adaptive and Prolonged Infections Mutations in the Receptor-Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proceedings contain 329 papers The topics discussed include: a novel adeno associated virus (AAV) gene therapy (FLT180a) achieves normal FIX activity levels in severe hemophilia B (HB) patients (B-AMAZE study);thrombosis, bleeding, and the effect of anticoagulation on survival in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the United States;incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients discharged after COVID-19 hospitalization;higher incidence of thrombotic complications in hospitalized patients with SARS-COV-2 virus versus influenza virus infections;dipyridamole added to anticoagulant prophylaxis: decline in poor outcome of clinically severe ill COVID-2019 patients;clinical and computed tomography characteristics of COVID-19 associated acute pulmonary embolism: a different phenotype of thrombotic disease?;the prothrombotic imbalance between VWF and ADAMTS13 in COVID-19;and identification of a covid-19 subpopulation responsive to hydroxychloroquine using machine learning: the IDENTIFY trial","output":"ACTRIMS Forum 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Maternity care practices such as skin-to-skin care, rooming-in, and direct breastfeeding are recommended, but it is unclear if these practices increase the risk of clinically significant COVID-19 in newborns, and if disruption of these practices adversely affects breastfeeding. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 357 mothers and their infants <12 months who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Subjects came from an anonymous worldwide online survey between May 4 and September 30, 2020, who were recruited through social media, support groups, and health care providers. Using multivariable logistic regression, Fisher's exact test, and summary statistics, we assessed the association of skin-to-skin care, feeding, and rooming-in with SARS-CoV-2 outcomes, breastfeeding outcomes, and maternal distress. Results: Responses came from 31 countries. Among SARS-CoV-2+ mothers whose infection was 3 days of birth, 7.4% of their infants tested positive. We found a nonsignificant decrease in risk of hospitalization among neonates who roomed-in, directly breastfed, or experienced uninterrupted skin-to-skin care (p > 0.2 for each). Infants who did not directly breastfeed, experience skin-to-skin care, or who did not room-in within arms' reach, were significantly less likely to be exclusively breastfed in the first 3 months, adjusting for maternal symptoms (p  0.02 for each). Nearly 60% of mothers who experienced separation reported feeling \\"very distressed,\\" and 29% who tried to breastfeed were unable.

However, the detection of viruses in sewage is challenging and to date there is no standard method available which has been validated for the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2.

PEG-based concentration of viruses is a simple procedure which is not limited by the availability of expensive equipment and has reduced risk of disruption to consumable supply chains. The concentration and RNA extraction steps enable 900C1500 concentration of wastewater samples and sufficiently eliminates the majority of organic matter, which could inhibit the subsequent qRT-PCR assay. Due to the high variation in the physico-chemical properties of wastewater samples, we recommend the use of process control viruses to determine the efficiency of each step. This procedure enables the concentration and the extraction the DNA/RNA of different viruses and hence can be used for the surveillance of different viral targets for the comprehensive assessment of viral diseases in a community.","output":"Concentration and Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Wastewater Using Polyethylene Glycol-Based Concentration and qRT-PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As one of the most important imaging modalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) still faces relatively low sensitivity to monitor low-abundance molecules.

However, there are few methods to visualize complex mixtures in this field due to the difficulty in achieving favorable cages to capture the signal source, namely, (129)Xe atoms. Here, we proposed metalCorganic frameworks (MOFs) as tunable nanoporous hosts to provide suitable cavities for xenon. Due to the widely dispersed spectroscopic signals, (129)Xe in different MOFs was easily visualized by assigning each chemical shift to a specific color. The results illustrated that the pore size determined the exchange rate, and the geometric structure and elemental composition influenced the local charge experienced by xenon.

In particular, Chinese college students studying abroad in Korea (CSK) show changes in their dietary behavior after migration, and HMR consumption for meal substitution is also increasing. This study was conducted to compare the HMR consumption behaviors and HMR development needs of CSK, Chinese college students in China (CSC), and Korean college students in Korea (KSK). SUBJECTS/METHODS: The subjects were 570 college students (180 CSK, 200 CSC, and 190 KSK) who had experience of HMR consumption. Data were collected by face-to-face survey in 2019 and analyzed using SPSS 25.0. RESULTS: The majority of the subjects purchased HMR to saving time and preventing meal skipping. Average purchase price per HMR was about 5,000 won for the CSK and KSK, and about 3,000 won for the CSC. The most important attributes when selecting HMR for the CSK and CSC were hygiene, freshness, and taste in that order, while for the KSK were taste, price, and hygiene. Rice was preferred by the KSK while grilled and fried dishes were preferred by the CSK and CSC. In terms of development needs, dessert and meat-based side dishes were highest in all three groups. The preferred food materials for more than 50% of the subjects of all groups were beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, and squid, and spinach and Chinese cabbage in the CSK, and onion in the KSK. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows more effort is needed to develop the healthy customized HMR for college students studying in Korea and China, and that focuses are placed by CSK on hygiene and freshness, by CSC on meat side dishes, hygiene, and price, and by KSK on snacks (as meal substitutes), taste, and price.","output":"Comparison of consumption behaviors and development needs for the home meal replacement among Chinese college students studying abroad in Korea, Chinese college students in China, and Korean college students in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There are very few studies in search of an alternate and convenient diagnostic tool which can substitute nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2. In the study we analysed the comparison and agreement between the feasibility of using the saliva in comparison to NPS for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A total number of 74 patients were enrolled for this study. We analysed and compared the NPS and saliva specimen collected within 48 h after the symptom onset. We carried out real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), gene sequencing for the detection and determination SARS-CoV-2 specific genes. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to establish the isolation of viral RNA from saliva. We used Bland-Altman model to identify the agreement between two specimens. RESULTS: This study showed a lower cycle threshold (CT ) mean value for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 gene (mean 27.07; 95% CI, 25.62 to 28.52) in saliva methods than that of NPS (mean 28.24; 95% CI, 26.62 to 29.85) specimen although the difference is statistically non-significant (p>0.05). Bland-Altman analysis produced relatively smaller bias and high agreement between these two clinical specimens. Phylogenetic analysis with the RdRp and S gene confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva samples.

In particular, commercial and industrial activities had been limited globally with restricted air and surface traffic movements in response to social distancing and isolation. Both satellite remote sensing and ground-based monitoring were used to measure the change in the air quality. There was momentous decline in the averaged concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), carbon dioxide (CO(2)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), methane (CH(4)) and aerosols. Many cities across India, China and several major cities in Europe observed strong reductions in nitrogen dioxide levels dropping by around 40C50% owing to lockdowns. Similarly, concentrations of SO(2) in polluted areas in India, especially around large coal-fired power plants and industrial areas decreased by around 40% as evidenced by the comparative satellite mapping during April 2019 and April 2020. Recent advances in sensors on board various satellites played a significant role in real-time monitoring of emission regimes over various parts of the world.

On the other hand, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) acts as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, both NRP1 and ACE2 express in the kidney and are associated with various renal diseases, including renal carcinoma. Therefore, the expression profiles of NRP1 and ACE2 in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) patients from the various cancer databases were investigated along with their impact on patients survivability. In addition, coexpression analysis of genes involved in COVID-19, KIRC, and KIRP concerning NRP1 and ACE2 was performed. The results demonstrated that both t NRP1 and ACE2 expressions are upregulated in KIRC and KIRP compared to healthy conditions and are significantly correlated with the survivability rate of KIRC patients. A total of 128 COVID-19-associated genes are coexpressed, which are positively associated with NRP1 and ACE2 both in KIRC and KIRP. Therefore, it might be suggested that, along with the ACE2, high expression of the newly identified host factor NRP1 in renal carcinomas may play a vital role in the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and survivability of COVID-19 patients suffering from kidney cancers.

Among Black individuals, racism is likely one of those factors, suggesting the need to examine the consequences of racism and the resulting social structures that establish and perpetuate these racial disparities. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the health care experiences of Black veterans with CKD and identify and explore the racial discrimination encountered by this vulnerable population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study used semistructured interview guides to investigate the health care experiences of 36 Black veterans with CKD who received care at the Corporal Michael Crescenz Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from October 2018 to September 2019. Interview transcripts were analyzed using applied thematic analysis. RESULTS: Among 36 Black veterans with CKD who characterized racism in the context of their care at a Veterans Affairs medical center, the mean (SD) age was 66.0 (7.8) years; 35 participants (97.2%) were male, 1 participant (2.8%) was female, and 19 participants (52.8%) were married. The mean (SD) duration of military service was 8.0 (7.0) years. Overall, 15 participants (41.7%) were not dependent on dialysis, and hypertension was the most common comorbidity (9 participants [25.0%]). Veterans described the ways in which racism produced emotional and physical stress, including psychological symptoms (eg, anger and hurt) and physiological symptoms (eg, headaches). Veterans described a strong sense of distrust in the health care system coupled with a need to be hypervigilant during clinical encounters. When encountering racism, veterans described bottling up their feelings, which sometimes led to maladaptive behavior (eg, substance use). Veterans also described individual and collective positive strategies (eg, faith) for coping with the stress of racism. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, Black veterans with CKD experienced racism in the clinical setting that produced physical and emotional stress and a strong sense of distrust in the health care system. These findings highlight an important opportunity for education and training of health care professionals in the implementation of trauma-informed approaches to care as a means of addressing race-based stress and trauma.","output":"Perspectives on Racism in Health Care Among Black Veterans With Chronic Kidney Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cough is a common symptom of respiratory and lung diseases.

For the 89.1 to 112 Hz frequency band, we found an 8.4 dB increase in the daily minimum sound pressure level (SPL) in April 2020 compared to April 2019 due the presence of a large crane vessel stationed near the mooring site. For the period of August to October, we found an approximately 1.7 dB reduction in the same metric from 2019 to 2020. The most noticeable change in vessel composition was the dramatic decrease in the number and occurrence of pleasure craft in July 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. While this analysis looked at only a single PAM and a limited amount of data, we observed changes in sound levels in the frequency band known to be associated with shipping as well as changes in vessel traffic;we conclude that these observed changes may be related to pandemic restrictions.","output":"Changes in Underwater Noise and Vessel Traffic in the Approaches to Halifax Harbor, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Associations between different organisms have been extensively described in terrestrial and marine environments. These associations are involved in roles as diverse as nutrient exchanges, shelter or adaptation to adverse conditions. Ascidians are widely dispersed marine invertebrates associated to invasive behaviours. Studying their microbiomes has interested the scientific community, mainly due to its potential for bioactive compounds productione.g., ET-73 (trabectedin, Yondelis), an anticancer drug. However, these symbiotic interactions embrace several environmental and biological functions with high ecological relevance, inspiring diverse biotechnological applications. We thoroughly reviewed microbiome studies (microscopic to metagenomic approaches) of around 171 hosts, worldwide dispersed, occurring at different domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya), to illuminate the functions and bioactive potential of associated organisms in ascidians. Associations with Bacteria are the most prevalent, namely with Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Planctomycetes phyla. The microbiomes of ascidians belonging to Aplousobranchia order have been the most studied. The integration of worldwide studies characterizing ascidians microbiome composition revealed several functions including UV protection, bioaccumulation of heavy metals and defense against fouling or predators through production of natural products, chemical signals or competition.

Methods: We used panel data analysis to evaluate the effects of mandatory social distancing rules on social distancing. We obtained data on six different categories of mandatory restrictions implemented in Brazil, by date and state, from state government gazettes (dirios oficiais). We then defined a social distancing rules index (SDI) to measure the strictness of social distancing rules, assigning each a value of 2, 1, or 0 depending on whether restrictions were full, partial, or very limited/non-existent at every given time. A separate variable was defined for masking mandates. We tested whether the following variables were associated to social distancing: SDI, masking mandates, COVID-19 incidence, population socioeconomic status, and political orientation. Data is for each day between March 11th and November 10th, 2020 in the 27 Brazilian states (N = 6615). Findings: Social distancing increased when social distancing rules were stricter, and decreased when the use of face masks became mandatory. The effects of different types of restrictions varied: suspending in-person classes and gatherings, religious/sport/cultural activities had a greater effect than other types of restrictions. Also, the effect of social distancing rules on peoples behaviour decreased over time, especially when rules were stricter. Interpretation: Mandatory social distancing rules must be adopted to increase social distancing. Stricter rules have a higher impact, but result in decreased compliance over time.

We used the pcNS3-NS5B plasmid encoding five nonstructural HCV proteins and MSCs derived from mice bone marrow. Five groups of DBA mice were immunized with the plasmid and/or MSCs in a different order. Group 1 was injected with the plasmid twice at intervals of 3 weeks; Group 2 with the plasmid, and after 24 h with MSCs; Group 3 with MSCs followed by the plasmid the next day; Group 4 with only MSCs; and Group 5 with saline. When the MSCs were injected prior to DNA immunization, the cell immune response to HCV proteins assessed by the level of IFN- synthesis was markedly increased compared to DNA alone. In contrast, MSCs injected after DNA suppressed the immune response. Apparently, the high level of proinflammatory cytokines detected after DNA injection promotes the conversion of MSCs introduced later into the immunosuppressive MSC2. The low level of cytokines in mice before MSC administration promotes the high immunostimulatory activity of MSC1 in response to a DNA vaccine. Thus, when administered before DNA, MSCs are capable of exhibiting promising adjuvant properties.","output":"Mesenchymal Stem Cells Can Both Enhance and Inhibit the Cellular Response to DNA Immunization by Genes of Nonstructural Proteins of the Hepatitis C Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It seems inevitable that caring for patients in the high-stakes context of COVID-19 will take its toll on the mental health of nurses.","output":"How COVID-19 can affect nurses mental health and what to do about it"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1R,5S)-1-Hydroxy-3,6-dioxa-bicyclo[3.2.1]octan-2-one, available by an efficient catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose, has been applied as a chiral building block in the synthesis of seven new nucleoside analogues, with structural modifications on the nucleobase moiety and on the carboxyl- derived unit.

Objective: To estimate the percentage of the general population vaccinated against the COVID-19 and to investigate the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Methods: We conducted an online cross-sectional study in Greece during August 2021. We included individuals over 18 years of age. Independent variables included socio-demographic data of the participants and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and pandemic. Our outcome variable was COVID-19 vaccination status, measured through yes/no answers. Results: Most participants had been vaccinated against the COVID-19 (87.8%), while about half had been vaccinated against influenza (52.5%). Multivariate analysis identified that increased age and a higher level of education were associated with an increased likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination. Also, participants working in health services, participants without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and those with previous seasonal influenza vaccination history had a greater probability to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, increased self-perceived severity of COVID-19, knowledge regarding COVID-19, and trust in COVID-19 vaccines and scientists were associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake. On the other hand, the likelihood of vaccination was lower for participants who were more concerned about the side effects of COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: Understanding the factors affecting individuals decision to take a COVID-19 vaccine is essential to improve the COVID-19 vaccination coverage rate. Policymakers and scientists should scale up their efforts to increase the COVID-19 vaccination rate among specific population groups such as young people, people with a low level of education, people with negative attitudes towards vaccination, etc.","output":"Cross-sectional assessment of predictors for COVID-19 vaccine uptake: an online survey in Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the work presented here is to study the effectiveness of building air handling units (AHUs) in serving as high volume sampling devices for airborne bacteria and viruses. An HVAC test facility constructed according to ASHRAE Standard 52.2-1999 was used for the controlled loading of HVAC filter media with aerosolized bacteria and virus. Nonpathogenic Bacillus subtilis var. niger was chosen as a surrogate for Bacillus anthracis. Three animal viruses; transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), avian pneumovirus (APV), and fowlpox virus were chosen as surrogates for three human viruses; SARS coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and smallpox virus; respectively. These bacteria and viruses were nebulized in separate tests and injected into the test duct of the test facility upstream of a MERV 14 filter. SKC Biosamplers upstream and downstream of the test filter served as reference samplers. The collection efficiency of the filter media was calculated to be 96.5 +/- 1.5% for B. subtilis, however no collection efficiency was measured for the viruses as no live virus was ever recovered from the downstream samplers. Filter samples were cut from the test filter and eluted by hand-shaking. An extraction efficiency of 105 +/- 19% was calculated for B. subtilis. The viruses were extracted at much lower efficiencies (0.7-20%). Our results indicate that the airborne concentration of spore-forming bacteria in building AHUs may be determined by analyzing the material collected on HVAC filter media, however culture-based analytical techniques are impractical for virus recovery.

This paper aims to benchmark the context of the Lebanese pharmacy profession with the respective elements of the FIP DGs to optimise the previously suggested strategic plan. Methods: A group of pharmacy researchers with extensive academic, professional, and post-educational experience endeavoured to map the FIP DGs with the work produced in Lebanon, describing the current situation. The documents mapped were sought from published literature and white papers developed by academia and the Order of Pharmacists of Lebanon (OPL), the national pharmacists' association. Results: This study found that efforts are necessary to bridge the gap between the current situation of the pharmacy profession in Lebanon and optimal practice. In the short term, existing projects should be immediately implemented, e.g. pharmacy curricula reforms and accreditation, postgraduate training, recognising pharmacy specialities, organising the profession, and assessing advanced competencies. In parallel, related policies and regulations should be updated. Cultural changes, involving closer ties between education and practice, are required to reform the pharmacy profession. In the medium term, a national research strategy, including earlycareer scientists mentoring and assessment tools validation, is necessary. Digitalising the patient profile and medication safety reporting and updating the pharmacists' database through appropriate platforms are also essential steps toward modernising pharmacy. Conclusion: Authorities and stakeholders should combine and coordinate efforts to implement existing plans and develop necessary strategies for optimizing pharmacy education, workforce, practice, and research, which is expected to bridge the gap between the challenging current situation of the profession in Lebanon and its optimal future development, for the best of the pharmacist and the patient's health.","output":"Pharmacy education, workforce, practice, and sciences in Lebanon: Benchmarking with the FIP Development Goals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is an emerging surveillance tool that has been used to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by tracking SARS-CoV-2 RNA shed into wastewater.

A total of 222 WWTP and 192 neighborhood samples were collected from June 2020 to May 2021, encompassing the end of the first-wave (June 2020), the second-wave (November end to December, 2020) and the third-wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (mid-April to May, 2021). Flow-weighted 24-hour composite samples were processed to extract RNA that was then analyzed for two SARS-CoV-2-specific regions of the nucleocapsid gene, N1 and N2, using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Using this approach SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 98.06 % (406/414) of wastewater samples. SARS-CoV-2 RNA abundance was compared to clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases organized by the three-digit postal code of affected individuals primary residences, enabling correlation analysis at neighborhood, WWTP and city-wide scales. Strong correlations were observed between N1 & N2 gene signals in wastewater and new daily cases for WWTPs and neighborhoods. Similarly, when flow rates at Calgary's three WWTPs were used to normalize observed concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and combine them into a city-wide signal, this was strongly correlated with regionally diagnosed COVID-19 cases and clinical test percent positivity rate.

The electrocardiographic (ECG) changes which may occur during hospitalization for COVID-19 have not yet been comprehensively assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: . We examined 50 patients admitted to hospital with proven COVID-19 pneumonia. At entry, all patients underwent a detailed clinical examination, 12-lead ECG, laboratory tests and arterial blood gas test. ECG was also recorded at discharge and in case of worsening clinical conditions. RESULTS: . Mean age of patients was 64 years and 72% were men. At baseline, 30% of patients had ST-T abnormalities, and 33% had left ventricular hypertrophy. During hospitalization, 26% of patients developed new ECG abnormalities which included atrial fibrillation, ST-T changes, tachy-brady syndrome, and changes consistent with acute pericarditis. One patient was transferred to intensive care unit for massive pulmonary embolism with right bundle branch block, and another for non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Patients free of ECG changes during hospitalization were more likely to be treated with antiretrovirals (68% vs 15%, p = 0.001) and hydroxychloroquine (89% vs 62%, p = 0.026) versus those who developed ECG abnormalities after admission. Most measurable ECG features at discharge did not show significant changes from baseline (all p>0.05) except for a slightly decrease in Cornell voltages (136 vs 115 mm; p = 0.0001) and a modest increase in the PR interval. The majority (54%) of patients with ECG abnormalities had 2 prior consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs. ECG abnormalities were first detected after an average of about 30 days from symptoms' onset (range 12-51 days). CONCLUSIONS: .

Progressive NAFLD leads to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and ultimately causes cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and NASH is currently a frequent cause of liver transplantation. Oxidative stress is often contributed to the progression of NAFLD, and hence, antioxidants such as silymarin, silybin, or silibinin, pentoxifylline, resveratrol, and vitamins A, C, and E are used in clinical trials against NAFLD. Silymarin induces the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), a fatty acid sensor, which promotes the transcription of genes that are required for the enzymes involved in lipid oxidation in hepatocytes. Silybin inhibits sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and carbohydrate response element-binding protein to downregulate the expression of genes responsible for de novo lipogenesis by activating AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Pentoxifylline inhibits TNF- expression and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated inflammatory nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) activation. Thus, it prevents NAFLD to NASH progression. Resveratrol inhibits methylation at Nrf-2 promoters and NF-B activity via SIRT1 activation in NAFLD conditions. However, clinically, resveratrol has not shown promising beneficial effects. Vitamin C is beneficial in NAFLD patients. Vitamin E is not effectively regressing hepatic fibrosis. Hence, its combination with antifibrotic agents is used as an adjuvant to produce a synergistic antifibrotic effect. However, to date, none of these antioxidants have been used as a definite therapeutic agent in NAFLD patients. Further, these antioxidants should be studied in NAFLD patients with larger populations and multiple endpoints in the future.","output":"A Molecular Insight into the Role of Antioxidants in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused an important impact in our country and elective surgery has been postponed in most cases.

The interferon molecules produced from infected cells act through autocrine and paracrine signaling to turn host cells into an antiviral state. Although the molecular mechanisms of IFN signaling have been well characterized, how the interferon response collectively contribute to the regulation of host cells to stop or suppress viral infection during early infection remain unclear. Here, we use mathematical models to delineate the roles of the autocrine and the paracrine signaling, and show that their impacts on viral spread are dependent on how infection proceeds. In particular, we found that when infection is well-mixed, the paracrine signaling is not as effective; in contrast, when infection spreads in a spatial manner, a likely scenario during initial infection in tissue, the paracrine signaling can impede the spread of infection by decreasing the number of susceptible cells close to the site of infection. Furthermore, we argue that the interferon response can be seen as a parallel to population-level epidemic prevention strategies such as contact tracing or ring vaccination. Thus, our results here may have implications for the outbreak control at the population scale more broadly.","output":"Autocrine and paracrine interferon signaling as 'ring vaccination' and 'contact tracing' strategies to suppress virus infection in a host"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case talks about Vistara, an airline brand registered under the name of Tata Singapore Airlines (SIA) Airlines Limited, which started as a joint venture between Tata Sons and SIA Limited in 2013.

Design/methodology/approach: A mixed method approach based on sequential deductive triangulation analysis (QUAN?qual) is used. First, data gathered from the Chilean innovation survey is used to quantify the percentage of firms implementing open and social innovation simultaneously, and to assess their relative performance in relation to other types of innovative firms. Second, a qualitative multiple-case study analysis reveals the perceptions of senior managers regarding the applicability of this approach in terms of building resilience and strengthening future competitiveness in line with sustainable development goals. Findings: Social innovation is a relatively rare event (7.2% of firms in the sample). While social innovation occurs equally in monopolistic and perfectly competitive industries, the authors findings suggest that in order to adopt social and open innovation effectively, firms need to set entry barriers such as economies of scale. On the other hand, open innovation is a more common event (15.4% of firms in the sample), which correlates closely with absolute and relative performance indicators. Moreover, the results suggest that open innovation enables a greater understanding of societal needs, thus making social innovation more effective. Research limitations/implications: Theoretical developments coupled with descriptive and qualitative evidence reveal the innovative capabilities that up-and-coming enterprises may possess. The findings suggest that at times of far-reaching technological, social and political change, enterprises should share some of their knowledge and resources with wider society.

In response, China has taken a proactive step by issuing a legal decision to ban consumption of terrestrial wildlife. However, concerns have been raised and opponents of bans argue that well-regulated trade should be promoted instead. By analyzing China's legal framework and management system regulating wildlife trade, together with state and provincial-level wildlife-trade licenses and wildlife criminal cases, we argue that current wildlife trade regulations do not function as expected. This is due to outdated protected species lists, insufficient cross-sector collaboration, and weak restrictions and law enforcement on farming and trading of species. The lack of quarantine standards for wildlife and increased wildlife farming in recent years pose great risks for food safety and public health. In addition, wildlife consumption is neither required for subsistence nor an essential part of Chinese diets. All these facts make the ban necessary to provoke improvement in wildlife management, such as updating protected species lists, revising laws and changing consumption behaviors.

Data were analysed using generalised estimating equations. Results Self-reported average weight and body mass index (BMI) significantly increased from May-June to August-September (74.95kg to 75.33kg, 26.22kg/m2 to 26.36kg/m2, both p<0.001), and then significantly decreased to November-December (to 75.06kg, 26.27kg/m2, both p<0.01), comparable to May-June levels (p=0.274/0.204). However, there was great interindividual variation, with 37.0%/26.7% reporting an increase and 34.5%/26.3% reporting a decrease in weight/BMI greater than 0.5kg/0.5kg/m2, respectively from May-June to November-December. The average weight/BMI increase was 3.64kg (95% confidence interval: 3.32,3.97)/1.64kg/m2 (1.49,1.79), and the average weight/BMI decrease was 3.59kg (3.34,3.85)/1.53kg/m2 (1.42,1.63). In fully adjusted models, increase in weight/BMI across surveys was significantly negatively associated with initial BMI, and positively associated with monthly high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) snacks intake and alcohol consumption, and for BMI only, older age. However, associations were time-varying, such that lower initial BMI, higher HFSS snacks intake and high-risk alcohol consumption were associated with maintenance of increased weight/BMI from August-September to November-December.

METHODS: The research method was an Internet survey conducted among the main nephrologists of the subjects of the Russian Federation. Data were obtained from 82 out of 85 subjects of the Russian Federation. We evaluated the numerical changes in the population of patients treated with RRT from 01.01.2020 to 01.01.2021; the number of patients diagnosed COVID-19; total mortality and the proportion of deaths associated with COVID-19. The COVID-19 was diagnosed by a positive polymerase chain reaction, supplemented by lung CT results. RESULTS: The prevalence of COVID-19 among all 72,734 patients who were receiving different types of RRT was 13,585 (18.7%), which is significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the average in the Russian Federation. The prevalence of infection among patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD) and kidney transplantation (KT) was lower (12.6% and 11.6%, respectively) than among patients with hemodialysis (HD) (20.5%). This can be attributed to the self-isolation of patients with PD and KT, in contrast to patients on HD, which, on the contrary, increased the frequency of contacts between patients and medical staff. Among all patients observed during 2020, the average mortality rate was 22.1%, exceeding by 7.8% the average level of this indicator in 2018 (14.2%).

Methodology: An online Google-based questionnaire survey was distributed through various social media platforms after approval of the institutional review board to a total of 100 HCPs who were treating and managing COVID-positive patients. Results: Of 100 responses, 72% were concerned about the risk of infection to self and family, while 46% reported disruption of their daily activities at a personal level. At the institutional level, 17% were concerned about inadequate personal protective equipment-related challenges. 20% had inadequate knowledge and training about COVID. 16% of participants were anxious all the time, 11% feared all the time, and 12% had stress all the time while treating COVID patients. Connectedness and communication with family and friends, word of appreciation, music, and TV were few strategies to cope up with these challenges. Conclusion: There is a need to identify and address the concerns and challenges faced by HCPs and to develop a comprehensive strategy and guideline to provide a holistic care and to ensure their security in the workplace.","output":"Concerns of health-care professionals managing COVID patients under institutional isolation during COVID-19 Pandemic in India: A descriptive cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus 19 is a contagious disease that affects all most all countries of the world and puts the world in great challenge. Even though, there is a limited testing capacity in Africa the number of cases and deaths is progressively increased. This catastrophic case has a great impact in Africa unless preventive measures are effectively undertaken. In Ethiopia, the number of COVID-19 cases and death are increasing over time. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the level of community readiness for COVID-19 pandemic prevention and its associated factors in residents of Awi Zone, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 1524 study participants from July 28 to August 27, 2020. Data were collected using structured and pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaires. The collected data were entered into EPI data 4.6 versions and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 24.0. Those variables with P-value<0.25 were entered into multivariable analyses and those variables with P-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Finally, the findings of the result were explained using texts, figures, and tables. RESULTS: A total of 1423 participants have participated in the study. The finding revealed that the prevalence of knowledge, attitude, perception, and practice towards COVID-19 were found to be 76.6%, 68.4%, 68.5%, and 29% respectively. In final model, being a female [AOR=1.388 (95% CI: 1.050C1.834) P= 0.021], married respondents [AOR=3.116 (95% CI: 1.592C6.099) P= 0.001], Muslim religion followers [AOR=2.392 (95% CI:1.503C3.806) P=0.002], and able to read and write [AOR=1.986 (95% CI:1.311C3.006) P=0.002] were some of the variables significantly associated with the level of community readiness towards COVID-19 preventive measures. CONCLUSION: The study findings indicate that respondents level of community readiness for COVID-19 prevention was mainly affected by sex, marital status, religion, and educational status. The Health education programs aimed at mobilizing and improving COVID-19 related level of community readiness especially practice are urgently needed. Awareness creation programs on more targeted groups such as men, unmarried and those with low educational level and religious leaders should be teaching the believers by interacting with faith and science on the means of preventing the pandemic.","output":"Level of Community Readiness for the Prevention of COVID-19 Pandemic and Associated Factors Among Residents of Awi Zone, Ethiopia: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic COVID-19 is a health problem that is spread all over the world including Indonesia As 4 June 2020, Indonesia has reached 28,818 persons confirmed COVID-19, 1,721 deaths related to COVID-19 and 8 892 patients have recovered from the disease The amount of response and attention of the public regarding the COVID-19 case in Indonesia and the circulation of information in the community became the basis of interest in identifying and analyzing demography factors with general knowledge on COVID-19 Participants were 1,254 collected through online questionnaire distributed on social media platform, from February 5, 2020 to June 6, 2020 Data analyzed used Chi square test with significant 75%) Nonetheless, most misinformation was that COVID-19 killed everyone contracted to it, came from a biological weapon laboratory, and that covering mouth and nose with bare hand is considered as correct coughing ethic Characteristics that showed statistical significances were education, occupation, and educational/occupational background Although Indonesian governments already give the best effort to educate the public to stop the transmission, an extensive educational health campaign should be done to raise awareness in public about preventive knowledge and behavior of COVID-19 ? 2021, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan - Faculty of Publich Health All rights reserved","output":"Demography factors influencing indonesian general knowledge on covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tremendous increase in workload due to COVID\\\\19 pandemic has caused intense strain on laboratory service.

Coronaviruses generally cause mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections in humans, such as the common cold, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis (To et al., 2013; Berry et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2015). According to the Report of the World Health Organization (WHO)-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 (WHO, 2020), the case fatality rate of COVID-19 increases with age, while the rate among males is higher than that among females (4.7% and 2.8%, respectively). Since an effective vaccine and specific anti-viral drugs are still under development, passive immunization using the convalescent plasma (CP) of recovered COVID-19 donors may offer a suitable therapeutic strategy for severely ill patients in the meantime. So far, several studies have shown therapeutic efficacy of CP transfusion in treating COVID-19 cases. A pilot study first reported that transfusion of CP with neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was well tolerated and could potentially improve clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases (Chen et al., 2020). Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM are the most abundant and important antibodies in protecting the human body from viral attack (Arabi et al., 2015; Marano et al., 2016). Our study aimed to understand the aspects of plasma antibody titer levels in convalescent patients, as well as assessing the clinical characteristics of normal, severely ill, and critically ill patients, and thus provide a basis for guiding CP therapy. We also hoped to find indicators which could serve as a reference in predicting the progression of the disease.","output":"Clinical characteristics and plasma antibody titer of patients with COVID-19 in Zhejiang, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objective COVID-19 is a highly disseminating viral disease imparted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.

SMCs resident in the walls of airways or blood vessels are continuously exposed to dynamic mechanical forces due to breathing or pulsatile blood flow. However, the resulting effects of these forces on integrin dynamics and associated cell-matrix adhesion are not well understood. Here we present experimental results from atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments, designed to study the integrin response to external oscillatory loading of varying amplitudes applied to live aortic SMCs, together with theoretical results from a mathematical model. In the AFM experiments, a fibronectin-coated probe was used cyclically to indent and retract from the surface of the cell. We observed a transition between states of firm adhesion and of complete detachment as the amplitude of oscillatory loading increased, revealed by qualitative changes in the force timecourses. Interestingly, for some of the SMCs in the experiments, switching behaviour between the two adhesion states is observed during single timecourses at intermediate amplitudes. We obtain two qualitatively similar adhesion states in the mathematical model, where we simulate the cell, integrins and ECM as an evolving system of springs, incorporating local integrin binding dynamics. In the mathematical model, we observe a region of bistability where both the firm adhesion and detachment states can occur depending on the initial adhesion state. The differences are seen to be a result of mechanical cooperativity of integrins and cell deformation. Switching behaviour is a phenomenon associated with bistability in a stochastic system, and bistability in our deterministic mathematical model provides a potential physical explanation for the experimental results. Physiologically, bistability provides a means for transient mechanical stimuli to induce long-term changes in adhesion dynamics-and thereby the cells' ability to transmit force-and we propose further experiments for testing this hypothesis.","output":"Switching behaviour in vascular smooth muscle cell-matrix adhesion during oscillatory loading."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Featured ApplicationBased on data from multinational domain experts in the field of Industrial Maintenance, this study demonstrated the application cases and advantages of asymmetric VR set-up to address needs present in the industry.Virtual Reality (VR) is a critical emerging technology in industrial contexts, as it facilitates collaboration and supports the product development lifecycle.

Unlike bacteria and fungi, which produce distinct volatile metabolic signatures associated with innate differences in both primary and secondary metabolic processes, viruses are wholly reliant on the metabolic machinery of infected cells for replication and propagation. In the present study, the ability of volatile metabolites to discriminate between respiratory cells infected and uninfected with virus, in vitro, was investigated. Two important respiratory viruses, namely respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus (IAV), were evaluated. Data were analyzed using three different machine learning algorithms (random forest (RF), linear support vector machines (linear SVM), and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)), with volatile metabolites identified from a training set used to predict sample classifications in a validation set. The discriminatory performances of RF, linear SVM, and PLS-DA were comparable for the comparison of IAV-infected versus uninfected cells, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) between 0.78 and 0.82, while RF and linear SVM demonstrated superior performance in the classification of RSV-infected versus uninfected cells (AUROCs between 0.80 and 0.84) relative to PLS-DA (0.61). A subset of discriminatory features were assigned putative compound identifications, with an overabundance of hydrocarbons observed in both RSV- and IAV-infected cell cultures relative to uninfected controls.

Not every suspected case undergoes testing, because testing kits and other equipment are limited in many parts of the world. Yet populations increasingly use the internet to manage both home and work life during the pandemic, giving researchers mediated connections to millions of people sheltering in place. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of using an online news platform to recruit volunteers willing to report COVID-19like symptoms and behaviors. METHODS: An online epidemiologic survey captured COVID-19related symptoms and behaviors from individuals recruited through banner ads offered through Microsoft News. Respondents indicated whether they were experiencing symptoms, whether they received COVID-19 testing, and whether they traveled outside of their local area. RESULTS: A total of 87,322 respondents completed the survey across a 3-week span at the end of April 2020, with 54.3% of the responses from the United States and 32.0% from Japan. Of the total respondents, 19,631 (22.3%) reported at least one symptom associated with COVID-19. Nearly two-fifths of these respondents (39.1%) reported more than one COVID-19like symptom. Individuals who reported being tested for COVID-19 were significantly more likely to report symptoms (47.7% vs 21.5%; P<.001). Symptom reporting rates positively correlated with per capita COVID-19 testing rates (R(2)=0.26; P<.001). Respondents were geographically diverse, with all states and most ZIP Codes represented. More than half of the respondents from both countries were older than 50 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: News platforms can be used to quickly recruit study participants, enabling collection of infectious disease symptoms at scale and with populations that are older than those found through social media platforms.

In addition to decreasing spread of SARS-CoV2, these measures also impact the transmission of seasonal viral pathogens, which are common triggers of COPD exacerbations. Whether reduced viral prevalence mediates reduction in COPD exacerbation rates is unknown. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis of data from a large, multicenter healthcare system to assess admission trends associated with community viral prevalence and with initiation of COVID-19 pandemic control measures. We applied difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis to compare season-matched weekly frequency of hospital admissions for COPD before and after implementation of public health measures for COVID-19. Community viral prevalence was estimated using regional Center for Disease Control and Prevention test positivity data and correlated to COPD admissions. Results: Data involving 4,422 COPD admissions demonstrated a season-matched 53% decline in COPD admissions during COVID-19 pandemic, which correlated to community viral burden (r=0.73; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.78) and represented a 36% greater decline over admission frequencies observed in other medical conditions less affected by respiratory viral infections (IRR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.71, p<0.001). The post-COVID-19 decline in COPD admissions was most pronounced in patients with fewer comorbidities and without recurrent admissions.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined consecutive patients with lung cancer and confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (n=102) at a single center from March 12-May 6, 2020. Thresholds of severity were defined a priori as hospitalization, ICU/intubation/DNI (a composite metric of severe disease including ICU stay, intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation, and/or transition to do not intubate [DNI]), or death. Recovery was defined as >14 days from COVID-19 test and >3 days since symptom resolution. HLA alleles were inferred from MSK-IMPACT (n=46) and compared to controls with lung cancer and no known non-COVID-19 (n=5166). RESULTS: COVID-19 was severe in patients with lung cancer (62% hospitalized, 25% died). Although severe, COVID-19 accounted for a minority of overall lung cancer-deaths during the pandemic (11% overall). Determinants of COVID-19 severity were largely patient-specific features, including smoking status and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Odds ratios for severe COVID-19 2.9, 95% CI 1.07-9.44 comparing the median [23.5 pack-years] to never and 3.87, 95% CI 1.35-9.68, respectively). Cancer-specific features, including prior thoracic surgery/radiation and recent systemic therapies did not impact severity. HLA supertypes were generally similar in mild or severe cases of COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 controls. Most patients recovered from COVID-19, including 25% patients initially requiring intubation. Among hospitalized patients, hydroxychloroquine did not improve COVID-19 outcomes. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with high burden of severity in patients with lung cancer. Patient-specific features, rather than cancer-specific features or treatments, are the greatest determinants of severity.","output":"COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID(coronavirus disease)-19 pandemic is characterized by high infectivity, droplet transmission, and high viral load in the upper respiratory tract. Severe disease courses are associated with interstitial pneumonia and ventilated patients, in whom tracheotomy (TT)-a droplet- and aerosol-producing medical intervention-is regularly necessary. TT as a potential infection risk for medical staff is scarcely found in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify droplet exposure of the surgical team during TT, to better define the requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgical TT was performed in four non-infectious patients, during which the surgeon and his assistant both wore a surgical nasal mask with a transparent visor. After the procedure, the type, distribution, and number of droplets on the visor were determined macroscopically and microscopically. RESULTS: An average of 29 droplets were found on the middle third of the visor, 4 on the right third, and 13 on the left third, with an average droplet size of 571a?m (a?381a?m). The smallest droplets were 55a?m, the largest 1431a?m. An increase in the number of droplets was found with increased ventilation during the procedure. Blood droplets were more common than secretion droplets. CONCLUSION: Contamination of the visor with droplets was demonstrated. Especially in the case of TT in highly infectious patients, e.g., COVID-19 patients, the use of hooded headgear in combination with breathing apparatus with air purification and power supply is recommended to ensure best protection from infection for the surgeon and the surgical assistant.","output":"[Droplet exposure during tracheotomy : Case analysis and consequences with respect to COVID-19 patients]./ Tr?pfchenexposition bei Tracheotomie : Fallanalyse und Konsequenzen in Bezug auf COVID-19-Patienten"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fast, reliable and easy to handle methods are required to facilitate urgently needed point-of-care testing (POCT) in the current coronavirus pandemic. Life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread all over the world, infecting more than 33,500,000 people and killing over 1 million of them as of October 2020. Infected individuals without any symptoms might still transfer the virus to others underlining the extraordinary transmissibility of this new coronavirus. In order to identify early infections effectively, treat patients on time and control disease spreading, rapid, accurate and onsite testing methods are urgently required. RESULTS: Here we report the development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) based method to detect SARS-CoV-2 genes ORF8 and N directly from pharyngeal swab samples. The established reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay detects SARS-CoV-2 directly from pharyngeal swab samples without previous time-consuming and laborious RNA extraction. The assay is sensitive and highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 detection, showing no cross reactivity when tested on 20 other respiratory pathogens. The assay is 12 times faster and 10 times cheaper than routine reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction, depending on the assay used. CONCLUSION: The fast and easy to handle RT-LAMP assay amplifying specifically the genomic regions ORF8 and N of SARS-CoV-2 is ideally suited for POCT at e.g. railway stations, airports or hospitals.

We address this problem through a multiscale model that combines pedestrian dynamics with stochastic infection spread models. The pedestrian dynamics model is utilized to generate the trajectories of motion and contacts between infected and susceptible individuals. We incorporate this information into a stochastic infection dynamics model with infection probability and contact radius as primary inputs. This generic model is applicable for several directly transmitted diseases by varying the input parameters related to infectivity and transmission mechanisms. Through this multiscale framework, we estimate the aggregate numbers and probabilities of newly infected people for different winding queue configurations. We find that the queue configuration has a significant impact on disease spread for a range of infection radii and transmission probabilities. We quantify the effectiveness of wall separators in suppressing the disease spread compared to rope separators. Further, we find that configurations with short aisles lower the infection spread when rope separators are used.","output":"Multiscale model for the optimal design of pedestrian queues to mitigate infectious disease spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Information about the clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 at different ages is limited.

We further explored demographic, network, and linguistic characteristics of users who change their behavior compared with control groups. RESULTS: We found differences in the demographics, social networks, and linguistic patterns of 1567 individuals identified as changing or considering changing travel behavior in response to Zika as compared with a control sample of Twitter users. We found significant differences between geographic areas in the United States, significantly more discussion by women than men, and some evidence of differences in levels of exposure to Zika-related information.

Despite the heterogenous PHC structures and capacities across European countries, we identified three prevalent models of PHC delivery employed: (1) multi-disciplinary primary care teams coordinating with public health to deliver the emergency response and essential services; (2) PHC providers defining and identifying vulnerable populations for medical and social outreach; and (3) PHC providers employing digital solutions for remote triage, consultation, monitoring and prescriptions to avoid unnecessary contact. These were supported by government enablers such as increasing workforce numbers, managing demand through public-facing risk communications, and prioritising pandemic response efforts linked to vulnerable populations and digital solutions.

MCZ or FLZ (156 g/mL), and untreated biofilms were considered as controls. Anti-biofilm effects were evaluated by enumeration of colony-forming units (CFUs), composition of the extracellular matrix, lactic acid production, and structure and live/dead biofilm cells (confocal laser scanning microscopy-CLSM). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Fisher LSDs test ( = 0.05). IONPs-CS carrying MCZ or FLZ were the most effective treatments in reducing CFUs compared to either an antifungal agent alone for C. albicans and MCZ for C. glabrata. Significant reductions in mutans streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. were shown, though mainly for the MCZ nanocarrier. Antifungals and their nanocarriers also showed significantly higher proportions of dead cells compared to untreated biofilm by CLSM (p &lt; 0.001), and promoted significant reductions in lactic acid, while simultaneously showing increases in some components of the extracellular matrix.

This study is particularly interested in analyzing the role of attitudes, descriptive norms, protective behaviors toward COVID-19, travel frequency before the pandemic, and spatial and individual characteristics on activity-travel behavior changes in relation to information and communication technology (ICT) use. Data were obtained from 1062 respondents using a web-based questionnaire survey. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the complex relationships among variables. This study found that descriptive norms positively affected the frequency of travel during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On the contrary, teleshopping did not contribute to reducing out-of-home activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experience of ICT influenced a decline in travel frequency and ride-hailing use. Furthermore, although personal attributes insignificantly influenced activity-travel behavior change, these attributes directly affected ICT use. Meanwhile, people living outside of Java Island had a higher travel frequency during the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic than their counterparts.

As societies struggled to minimize infection, questions arose regarding the consequences for children. Initial research reported the urgent need for child protective services worldwide to adapt existing policies and practices to protect children from maltreatment during this time, which is the rationale for the current systematic literature review. This review examined studies published in peer-reviewed journals from March 2020 to October 2020 on child maltreatment (CM) in the context of COVID-19. Twenty-five manuscripts met the inclusion criteria and were predominantly from the United States, with three international studies. The majority of the studies included CM reports during COVID-19 based on official data. The results clearly demonstrated an increased risk for children alongside a worrisome international decrease in CM reports. Only two studies addressed interventions during the pandemic. The current review highlights that, along with the obligation of scholars to advance the protection of children during COVID-19, there is much that is unknown. Future studies should examine the impact of the pandemic on children and their surrounding systems as well as child protective services' responses, which face enormous challenges during a pandemic. An additional conclusion is that, since children were not identified as a health risk group during the pandemic, their protection rights may have been jeopardized. Furthermore, the variance identified in the policies of different countries pinpoints the urgent need to establish an international protocol for protecting children from maltreatment during COVID-19, a protocol that will hopefully be a basis for policymakers worldwide.","output":"Child Maltreatment During COVID-19: Key Conclusions and Future Directions Based on a Systematic Literature Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Adjudication of endpoints is a standard procedure in cardiovascular clinical trials. However, several studies indicate that the benefit of adjudication in estimating treatment effect may be limited. AIMS This post hoc analysis of SOCRATES (NCT01994720) compared the treatment effects and investigated the agreement of clinical event assessment by site investigators and independent adjudicators. METHODS SOCRATES compared ticagrelor and aspirin in 13,199 patients with acute minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack. The primary endpoint was stroke, myocardial infarction, or death. Stroke was the major component of the primary endpoint and a secondary endpoint. The endpoints were adjudicated by a blinded independent committee. We compared the treatment effect on the primary endpoint and stroke alone based on the investigators' and adjudicators' assessments, and investigated the agreement rate on the stroke endpoint and major hemorrhages. RESULTS The hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for ticagrelor versus aspirin therapy for the primary endpoint were 0.89 (0.78-1.01) when calculated on adjudicator-assessed events and 0.88 (0.78-1.00) for investigator-assessed events. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for stroke were 0.86 (0.75-0.99) based on the adjudicators' diagnoses and 0.85 (0.75-0.97) based on the investigators' diagnoses. The overall agreement between adjudicator- and investigator-diagnosed stroke was 91%, and for major hemorrhages was 88%.

Randomized controlled trials are the single best tool to identify effective treatments against this novel pathogen. OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of randomized controlled trials of treatments for COVID-19 in the United States launched in the first 9 months of the pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants We conducted a cross-sectional study of all completed or actively enrolling randomized, interventional, clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 in the United States registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov as of August 10, 2020. We excluded trials of vaccines and other interventions intended to prevent COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures We used descriptive statistics to characterize the clinical trials and the statistical power for the available studies. For the late-phase trials (i.e., phase 3 and 2/3 studies), we compared the geographic distribution of the clinical trials with the geographic distribution of people diagnosed with COVID-19. RESULTS: We identified 200 randomized controlled trials of treatments for people with COVID-19. Across all trials, 87 (43.5%) were single-center, 64 (32.0%) were unblinded, and 80 (40.0%) were sponsored by industry. The most common treatments included monoclonal antibodies (N=46 trials), small molecule immunomodulators (N=28), antiviral medications (N=24 trials), and hydroxychloroquine (N=20 trials). Of the 9 trials completed by August 2020, the median sample size was 450 (IQR 67C1113); of the 191 ongoing trials, the median planned sample size was 150 (IQR 60C400). Of the late-phase trials (N=54), the most common primary outcome was a severity scale (N=23, 42.6%), followed by a composite of mortality and ventilation (N=10, 18.5%), and mortality alone (N=6, 11.1%). Among these late-phase trials, all trials of antivirals, monoclonal antibodies, or chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine had a power of less than 25% to detect a 20% relative risk reduction in mortality. Had the individual trials for a given class of treatments instead formed a single trial, the power to detect that same reduction in mortality would have been greater than 98%. There was large variability in access to trials with the highest number of trials per capita in the Northeast and the lowest in the Midwest. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A large number of randomized trials were launched early in the pandemic to evaluate treatments for COVID-19. However, many trials were underpowered for important clinical endpoints and substantial geographic disparities were observed, highlighting the importance of improving national clinical trial infrastructure.

This paper describes the transition of such a course in one undergraduate program, assessment of this transition, and how this assessment has led to the design of the Fall 2020 online delivery format. In the spring, instruction was delivered online via asynchronous lectures and recorded video demonstrations, while raw data was provided to students to simulate specific laboratory techniques. Additionally, synchronous and asynchronous forms of student support were offered, including office hours and discussions. Student feedback was assessed via an end-of-semester survey designed specifically to analyze the students perceptions of the Spring 2020 transition to remote learning, as well as a comparison of Spring 2020 and Spring 2019 (when the course was taught in-person) student performance deliverables. Student performance was comparable to (or even better than) that in 2019. Students responded very positively to the transition, with most students agreeing or strongly agreeing that they had the resources needed to succeed (4.43 on a Likert scale), although on average, the students also found that the shift made learning more challenging, with increased effort required to engage with the material. Students especially found the recorded demonstration of laboratory techniques, asynchronous lectures, the learning management system chat feature, and virtual office hours useful. Many students felt that even with these resources, they still lost some of the experience that comes with in-person hands-on application, and some students found working in teams to be more challenging. While the overall approach implemented in the abrupt transition was effective in terms of student learning outcomes, engagement and immersion in a more realistic experience is a concern moving forward in Fall 2020.

CONCLUSION: This study highlights that the COVID-19 pandemic might have led to an increased rate of new-onset T1DM, T2DM, and DKA in children and adolescents compared to a similar time frame in the prior 2 years. The clinical phenotypes and outcomes in children with diabetes to COVID-19 infection may be distinct and therefore, future pediatric specific studies are needed to define the role of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, currently designated as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was reported recently.

In fact, many methods have been used to recognize COVID-19 infection including Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), X-ray scan, and Computed Tomography scan (CT- scan). In addition to the recognition of the COVID-19 infection, CT scans can provide more important information about the evolution of this disease and its severity. With the extensive number of COVID-19 infections, estimating the COVID-19 percentage can help the intensive care to free up the resuscitation beds for the critical cases and follow other protocol for less severity cases. In this paper, we introduce COVID-19 percentage estimation dataset from CT-scans, where the labeling process was accomplished by two expert radiologists. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of three Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures: ResneXt-50, Densenet-161, and Inception-v3. For the three CNN architectures, we use two loss functions: MSE and Dynamic Huber. In addition, two pretrained scenarios are investigated (ImageNet pretrained models and pretrained models using X-ray data). The evaluated approaches achieved promising results on the estimation of COVID-19 infection. Inception-v3 using Dynamic Huber loss function and pretrained models using X-ray data achieved the best performance for slice-level results: 0.9365, 5.10, and 9.25 for Pearson Correlation coefficient (PC), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), respectively. On the other hand, the same approach achieved 0.9603, 4.01, and 6.79 for [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , and [Formula: see text] , respectively, for subject-level results.

This study aims at investigating the behavioural and psychological effects of COVID\\\\19 and social isolation on the aging population. The TRIAD Assessment of Social Isolation and Cognition (TASIC) was developed to assess these effects on participants of observational trials. METHOD: Pre\\\\pandemic data including, demographical information, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Mini\\\\Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and a Social Support Questionnaire, were collected during in\\\\person visits and take\\\\home questionnaires. Following the onset of COVID\\\\19, TASIC was created to include additional COVID\\\\19 specific scales developed by Dr. Rosa\\\\Neto and Dr. King that include Knowledge of COVID\\\\19 scale, the Montreal Assessment of Stress related to COVID\\\\19 (MASC), as well as the Impact of Events Scale (IESR), the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire (PDEQ) for COVID\\\\19. Assessments were conducted via telephone interviews with TRIAD participants (n=292) and their informants (n=243) by eight trained research assistants from April through June 2020. All participants enrolled in previous TRIAD studies, deemed eligible through detailed screening criteria were contacted. RESULT: As a result of this study, and previous work done by the cohort, a culmination of information is available, with 90% of TRIAD participants having completed the COVID\\\\19 study also having plasma collected. 80% of participants from the COVID\\\\19 study have PET imaging using [(18)F]AZD4694 and [18F]MK6240 and MRI sequencing.

APPROACH European pandemic preparedness indicators were used to develop an assessment tool and procedure based on the 2005 global WHO checklist for pandemic preparedness. These were then applied to Member States of WHO's European Region, initially as part of structured national assessments conducted during short visits by external teams. LOCAL SETTING Countries in WHO's European Region. RELEVANT CHANGES From 2005 to 2008, 43 countries underwent a pandemic preparedness assessment that included a short external assessment visit by an expert team. These short visits developed into a longer self-assessment procedure involving an external team but \\"owned\\" by the countries, which identified gaps and developed plans for improving preparedness. The assessment tool and procedure became more sophisticated as national and local pandemic preparedness became more complex. The 2009 pandemic revealed new gaps in planning, surveillance communications and immunization. LESSONS LEARNT Structured national self-assessments with support from external teams allow individual countries to identify gaps in their pandemic preparedness plans and enable regional bodies to assess the regional and global resources that such plans require. The 2009 pandemic revealed additional problems with surveillance, pandemic severity estimates, the flexibility of the response, vaccination, involvement of health-care workers and communication. European national plans are being upgraded and global leadership is required to ensure that these plans are uniformly applied across the region.","output":"Developing pandemic preparedness in Europe in the 21st century: experience, evolution and next steps."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact upon older people. Frailty is being used to further refine the risk of poor outcomes in hospitalised older people. But studies to date on COVID related outcomes using frailty scales have reported inconsistent findings. We plan a retrospective cohort study using national data sources across England. The objectives are: 1. To determine if there is there an association between COVID-19 infection (virus identified), frailty risk (measured using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score - HFRS) and all-cause mortality. 2. To evaluate the association between HFRS in people with COVID-19 infection (virus identified), and the following secondary outcomes: hospital length of stay, critical care (entry to critical care, critical care length of stay and deaths in or following a critical care stay). 3. To determine if there is there an association between COVID-19 infection (virus identified), frailty risk (measured using the HFRS) and costs captured using Healthcare Resource Group tariffs. Methods This will be a retrospective cohort study using the NHS England Secondary Uses Service (SUS) electronic database, which records hospital activity and outcomes for all patients admitted to National Health Service hospitals in England. The analyses will use data relating to the index hospital presentation, this being the individuals first emergency presentation during the study period for which they received a COVID-19 test. The primary and secondary outcomes will be constructed for the index admission. The analyses will control for differences in individual characteristics, using a set of risk adjusters including frailty, age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, Charlson Comorbidity Index, number of previous admissions, number of (surgical) procedures, Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSCs) and COVID-19 status. Results Baseline characteristics will be reported using descriptive statistics. Mortality will be described using survival analysis, displayed as Kaplan Meier plots. A Cox proportional hazards model using robust standard errors to account for multiple observations (arising from readmissions) of the same individual will be fitted. The analyses will control for differences in individual characteristics, using a set of risk adjusters including frailty (Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS)), age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, Charlson Comorbidity Index, number of previous admissions, number of (surgical) procedures, Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSCs) and COVID-19 status (ICD-10 codes). Adjusted and unadjusted hazard ratios will be used to compare the rate of death for those with and without confirmed COVID-19, at different HFRS levels. We will test for an interaction between COVID-19 status and HFRS. A logit model will be implemented to analyse the secondary outcomes of admission to critical care mortality at 30 days, and mortality in critical care. For length of stay in hospital and in critical care, Poisson or negative binomial regression models will be fitted depending upon the dispersion.

The Portuguese people complied quickly, reducing their overall mobility by 80% . We estimate the impact of the lockdown in Portugal in terms of reducing burden on the health service. Methods: Using publicly available official data from the Portuguese Directorate-General of Health we forecasted epidemic curves for: Cases, hospital inpatients (overall and in ICU), and deaths without lockdown, assuming that the impact of containment measures would start 14 days after lockdown was implemented. We used exponential smoothing models for deaths, intensive care (ICU) and hospitalizations and an ARIMA model for number of cases. Models were selected considering fitness to the observed data to the 31st of March 2020. We then compared observed(with intervention) and forecasted curves( without intervention). Results: Between April 1 and April 15, there were 146 fewer deaths(-25%), 5568 fewer cases (-23%) and, as of April 15, there were 519 fewer ICU inpatients(-69%) and 508 fewer overall hospital inpatients(-28%) than forecasted without lockdown. On April 15 the number of ICU inpatients could have reached 748, three times higher than the observed value (229) if the intervention had been delayed. Conclusion: If the lockdown had not been implemented in mid-March, Portugal ICU capacity (528 ICU beds) would likely have been breached in the first half of April. The lockdown seems to have been effective in reducing transmission of SARS-Cov-2, serious Covid-19 illness and associated mortality, thereby decreasing demand on health services. Early action allowed time for the National Health Service to acquire protective equipment, to increase capacity to test and cope with the surge in hospital and ICU demand caused by the pandemic.","output":"Rapid assessment of the impact of lockdown on the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reading is integral to everyday life, and yet learning to read is a struggle for many young learners.

However, how patients with CeD perceive their COVID-19 risk may differ from their actual risk. AIM: To investigate risk perceptions of contracting COVID-19 in patients with CeD and determine the factors that may influence their perception. METHODS: We distributed a survey throughout 10 countries between March and June 2020 and collected data on demographics, diet, COVID-19 testing, and risk perceptions of COVID-19 in patients with CeD. Participants were recruited through various celiac associations, clinic visits, and social media. Risk perception was assessed by asking individuals whether they believe patients with CeD are at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 when compared to the general population. Logistic regression was used to determine the influencing factors associated with COVID-19 risk perception, such as age, sex, adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), and comorbidities such as cardiac conditions, respiratory conditions, and diabetes. Data was presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) RESULTS: A total of 10737 participants with CeD completed the survey. From them, 6019 (56.1%) patients with CeD perceived they were at a higher risk or were unsure if they were at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to the non-CeD population. A greater proportion of patients with CeD perceived an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 when compared to infections in general due to their CeD (56.1% vs 26.7%, P < 0.0001). Consequently, 34.8% reported taking extra COVID-19 precautions as a result of their CeD. Members of celiac associations were less likely to perceive an increased risk of COVID-19 when compared to non-members (49.5% vs 57.4%, P < 0.0001). Older age (aOR: 0.99; 95%CI: 0.99 to 0.99, P < 0.001), male sex (aOR: 0.84; 95%CI: 0.76 to 0.93, P = 0.001), and strict adherence to a GFD (aOR: 0.89; 95%CI: 0.82 to 0.96, P = 0.007) were associated with a lower perception of COVID-19 risk and the presence of comorbidities was associated with a higher perception of COVID-19 risk (aOR: 1.38; 95%CI: 1.22 to 1.54, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Overall, high levels of risk perceptions, such as those found in patients with CeD, may increase an individuals pandemic-related stress and contribute to negative mental health consequences. Therefore, it is encouraged that public health officials maintain consistent communication with the public and healthcare providers with the celiac community. Future studies specifically evaluating mental health in CeD could help determine the consequences of increased risk perceptions in this population.","output":"Risk perception and knowledge of COVID-19 in patients with celiac disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deterministic epidemic models, such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, are immensely useful even if they lack the nuance and complexity of social contacts at the heart of network science modeling.

Data reporting drawing from EHRs plays an essential role in public management of social problems, and data on social factors are commonly cited as foundational for eliminating health inequities. Yet one major shortcoming of these data-centered initiatives is their limited attention to social context, including the institutional conditions of biomedical stratification and variation of care provision across clinical settings. In this article, we leverage comparative fieldwork to examine provider and system responses to mandated data collection on patient sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI), highlighting unequal clinical contexts as they appear across a large county safety-net institution and an LGBTQ-oriented health organization. Although point of care data collection is commonly justified for governance in the aggregate (e.g., disparity monitoring), we find standardized data on social domains presents a double-edged sword in clinical settings: formal categories promote visibility where certain issues remain hidden, yet constrain clinical utility in sites with greater knowledge and experience with related topics. We further illustrate how data standardization captures patient identities yet fundamentally misses these unequal contexts, resulting in limited attenuation of inequity despite broad expectations of clinical change. By revealing the often-invisible contexts of care that elude standard measurement, our findings underline the strengths of qualitative social science in accounting for the complex dynamics of enduring social problems. We call for deeper engagement with the unequal contexts of biomedical stratification, especially in light of increasing pressure to quantify the social amidst the rising tide of data-driven care.","output":"Capturing patients, missing inequities: Data standardization on sexual orientation and gender identity across unequal clinical contexts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two discrete mathematical SIR models (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) are proposed for modelling the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) through Spain and Italy One of the proposed models is delay-free while the other one considers a delay in the propagation of the infection The objective is to estimate the transmission, also known as infectivity rate, through time taking into account the infection evolution data supplied by the official health care systems in both countries Such a parameter is estimated through time at different regional levels and it is seen to be strongly dependent on the intervention measures such as the total (except essential activities) or partial levels of lockdown Typically, the infectivity rate evolves towards a minimum value under total lockdown and it increases again when the confinement measures are partially or totally removed","output":"A Modelization of the Propagation of COVID-19 in Regions of Spain and Italy with Evaluation of the Transmission Rates Related to the Intervention Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Telemedicine use became widespread at our weight management center in 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine visits at a community-based hospital in the United States. Methods: Patients and providers were electronically surveyed at the end of 2020 regarding telemedicine visit experiences. These visits took place throughout the majority of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 85.7% (6) of providers reported spending the same or less time on telemedicine visits compared with in-person visits. All providers were either somewhat or very satisfied with the interpersonal connections made in telemedicine visits. All providers wished to see telemedicine visits continued in the future. A total of 355 patients responded. Over 90% of participants reported feeling comfortable speaking to their provider about personal issues through telemedicine. Around 73.2% of patients were very satisfied with their telemedicine visit. Around 69.8% of patients report that they would like to use either primarily telemedicine visits or a combination of telemedicine and in-person visits when it is safe to return to in-person care. Conclusions: Patients and providers exhibited high levels of satisfaction with telemedicine use in a weight management center. They both wish to see these visit types offered in the future. Patients who saved more than 30 min of time traveling with a telemedicine visit were significantly more likely to show high levels of satisfaction.

The main outcome measurements were complete response at 12 months, and adverse events.Of a total of 65 patients, 18 were treated with RFA and 47 with ESD. The procedure time of RFA was significantly shorter than that of ESD (126.6 vs 34.8 min; P < 0.001). The complete resection rate of ESD and complete response rate after primary RFA were 89.3% and 77.8%, respectively. Based on the histological evaluation of the post-ESD specimens showed 14 of 47 (29.8%) had histological upstaging compared with the pre-ESD biopsies, and 4 of them had lymphovascular invasion requiring chemoradiation or surgery. After additional therapy for residual lesions, 46 (97.9%) patients in the ESD group and 17 (94.4%) patients in the RFA group achieved a complete response at 12 months. Four patients (8.5%) developed major procedure-related adverse events in the ESD group, but none in the RFA group. In patients with lesions occupying more than 3/4 of the circumference, a significantly higher risk of esophageal stenosis was noted in the ESD group compared with RFA group (83% vs 27%, P = 0.01), which required more sessions of dilatation to resolve the symptoms (median, 13 vs 3, P = 0.04). There were no procedure-related mortality or neoplastic progression in either group; however, 1 patient who received ESD and 1 who received RFA developed local recurrence during a median follow-up period of 32.4 (range, 13-68) and 18.0 (range, 13-41) months, respectively.RFA and ESD are equally effective in the short-term treatment of early flat large ESCNs; however, more adverse events occur with ESD, especially in lesions extending more than 3/4 of the circumference.

Studies have shown that umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (uMSCs) could alleviate PF; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. METHODS: The therapeutic effects of uMSC-derived extracellular vesicles (uMSC-EVs) on PF were evaluated using bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse models. Then, the role and mechanism of uMSC-EVs in inhibiting myofibroblast differentiation were investigated in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: Treatment with uMSC-EVs alleviated the PF and enhanced the proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells in BLM-induced mice, thus improved the life quality, including the survival rate, body weight, fibrosis degree, and myofibroblast over differentiation of lung tissue. Moreover, these effects of uMSC-EVs on PF are likely achieved by inhibiting the transforming growth factor- (TGF-) signaling pathway, evidenced by decreased expression levels of TGF-2 and TGF-R2. Using mimics of uMSC-EV-specific miRNAs, we found that miR-21 and miR-23, which are highly enriched in uMSC-EVs, played a critical role in inhibiting TGF-2 and TGF-R2, respectively. CONCLUSION: The effects of uMSCs on PF alleviation are likely achieved via EVs, which reveals a new role of uMSC-EV-derived miRNAs, opening a novel strategy for PF treatment in the clinical setting.

Thus, estimation of radiation doses achieved during EVAR is of great importance. MATERIAL AND METHODS Organ doses (OD) and effective doses (ED) administered to 17 patients receiving EVAR were determined (1) from the exposure parameters by performing Monte Carlo simulations in mathematical phantoms and (2) by measurements with thermoluminescent dosimeters in a physical anthropomorphic phantom. RESULTS The mean fluoroscopy time was 26 min, the mean dose area product was 24995 cGy cm2. The mean ED was 34.8 mSv, ODs up to 626 mSv were found. Whereas digital subtraction angiographies (DSA) and fluoroscopies each contributed about 50% to the cumulative ED, the ED rates of DSAs were found to be ten times higher than those of fluoroscopies. Doubling of the field size caused an ED rate enhancement up to a factor of 3. CONCLUSION EVAR procedures cause high radiation exposure levels that exceed the values published thus far. As a consequence, (1) DSAs should be only performed when necessary and with a low image rate, (2) fluoroscopies should be kept as short as possible, and (3) field sizes should be minimized.

Perceptions were investigated in general and by age, sex and education. Results: Overall, 82.8% sample reported they were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and 17.2% reported they were unwilling. The three most common reasons for unwillingness were long-term side effects (65.5%), immediate side effects (60.5%), and lack of trust in the vaccine (55.2%). Vaccine willingness significantly differed by sex and education level, with female participants and those with less than a bachelors degree being more likely to report unwillingness. Perception of COVID-19 vaccine safety was significantly lower (-10.7%) than vaccines in general and differed by age, sex and education, with females, older adults, and individuals with less than a bachelors degree reporting lower perceived COVID-19 vaccine safety.

However, medications in this class differ considerably in their dosing frequency, which may impact adherence. We sought to perform a meta-analysis to compare adherence to injectable GLP-1RAs dosed once-weekly versus once-daily inpatients with T2D. METHODS Medline and Scopus were searched from 1/2005-7/2020 using keywords and MeSH terms pertaining to adherence and GLP-1RAs. Studies of adults with T2D were included if they compared adherence (as measured by proportion of days covered [PDC]) to injectable GLP-1RAs dosed once-weekly versus once-daily. A meta-analysis of non-overlapping studies was performed to evaluate the primary outcome of non-adherence, defined as the proportion of patients with a PDC<80. RESULTS A total of 7 studies evaluating 75,159 patients (range:2,886-30,097) with T2D were included. The follow-up periods of included studies ranged from 6-12 months. Injectable GLP-1RAs dosed once-weekly were either dulaglutide, albiglutide, or exenatide extended release; while liraglutide was the injectable once-daily agent evaluated in all included studies.

Fosfomycin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were collected from four medical centers in Taiwan from 2010 to 2018. The genes that contributed to fosfomycin resistance were amplified and sequenced. Carbohydrate utilization assays and mutagenesis studies were performed to determine the mechanisms underlying fosfomycin resistance. Forty fosfomycin-resistant CRKP strains were collected and used for further analysis. Fourteen strains exhibited low-level resistance (MIC = 256-512 mg/dl), while 26 strains showed high-level resistance (MIC  1,024 mg/dl). Chromosomal fosAKP I91V was detected in 39/40 fosfomycin-resistant CRKP strains. We observed that amino acid substitution of chromosomal fosAKP I91V increased the MIC of fosfomycin by approximately eight folds, and this was the only mechanism elucidated for low-level fosfomycin resistance. Among the 26 high-level resistance strains, fosAKP I91V combined with transporter deficiencies (18/26, 69.2%) was the most common resistant mechanism, and one strain showed transporter deficiency only.

One of the most significant impacts to people is the risk of contacting SARS while engaging daily routine activity. In this work we use data from daily underground ridership in Taipei and daily reported SARS cases in Taiwan to model the dynamics of the public underground usage during the wax and wane of the SARS period. We found that for each reported SARS case there is an immediate loss of about 1200 underground ridership. These loss rates propagate to the following days with an e-folding decay time of about 28 days, reflecting the public perception on the risk of contacting SARS disease when travelling with the underground system. About 50% of daily ridership was lost during the peak of the 2003 SARS period, compared with the loss of 80% daily ridership during the closure of the underground system after Typhoon Nari, the loss of 50-70% ridership due to the closure of the governmental offices and schools during typhoon periods, and the loss of 60% daily ridership during Chinese New Year holidays.","output":"A model of underground ridership during the severe outbreaks of the SARS epidemic in a modern city"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced educationist to come up with innovative solutions in delivering, engaging synchronous online academic modules.

The subsequent social burden is a major concern. We aimed to assess the short-term HRQoL, physical function and prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms of invasively mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients treated in our ICU. METHODS: Prospective, observational cohort study in a follow-up clinic. Patients completed a 6-min walking test (6MWT) to assess their cardio-pulmonary function around 2 months (early follow-up) from hospital discharge, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire for quality of life assessment around 2 months and at 6 months from hospital discharge and an anonymous web-based Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire for Post-Traumatic Stress symptoms at 2 months. RESULTS: 47 patients attended our follow-up program, mean age 59  10 years, median pre-morbid Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) 2 [2C3]. The median distance walked in 6 min was 470 [406C516] m, 83 [67C99]% of the predicted value. Overall 1 out 3 patients and 4/18 (22%) among those with a good functional baseline prior to COVID-19 (CFS of 1 or 2) had lower (84%) than predicted 6MWT.

As infection with SARS-CoV2 was suspected based on radiologic imaging, the hypoxemic patient was immediately transferred to the ICU, where he developed ARDS. Empiric antimicrobial chemotherapy was initiated, the patient deteriorated further, therapy was changed and the patient was transferred to a tertiary care ARDS center. As cold agglutinins were present, the hypothesis of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 was then questioned. Bronchoscopic sampling revealed Mycoplasma (M.) pneumoniae . When antimicrobial chemotherapy was adjusted, the patient recovered quickly. Conclusion: Usually, M. pneumoniae causes mild disease.

To this end, a mesocosm experiment exposing plants to single (nutrient enrichment or temperature increase) and multiple stressors (nutrient enrichment plus temperature increase), was performed. Results revealed a differential transcriptome regulation of plants under single and multiple stressors, showing an organ-specific sensitivity depending on plants' origin. While leaf tissues were more responsive to nutrient stress, SAM revealed a higher sensitivity to temperature treatments, especially in plants already impacted in their native environment. The exposure to stress conditions induced the modulation of different biological processes. Plants living in an oligotrophic environment were more responsive to nutrients compared to plants from a eutrophic environment. Evidences that epigenetic mechanisms were involved in the regulation of transcriptional reprogramming were also observed in both plants' organs.

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) represents the latest advance in laparoscopic surgery. The aim of this systematic review was to establish the safety and complication profile of colonic SILS. METHODS The search was performed in October 2011 using PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Search terms were 'colorectal', 'colon', 'colectomy', 'rectal' and single incision/port/trocar/site/scar. Only pure single-incision laparoscopic colonic surgery for benign and malignant colonic disease was included. Primary outcomes were the early postoperative complication profiles of colonic SILS. Secondary outcomes were duration of operation, lymph node yields, conversion rate and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS Colonic SILS data were compared with data from a Cochrane review on the short-term outcomes of laparoscopic colonic surgery and four main RCTs on laparoscopic colonic surgery. Median operating times and time to first bowel motion for colonic SILS were comparable with those for laparoscopic colonic surgery. The median lymph node retrieval for malignant disease achieved with SILS was acceptable. Evidence for a reduction in postoperative pain with SILS was conflicting. There was no significant reduction in length of hospital stay with SILS. Most patients selected for colonic SILS had a low body mass index, non-bulky tumours and were operated on by experienced laparoscopic surgeons. There was significant heterogeneity in study group characteristics, indications for surgery, research methodology, operative techniques and follow-up time.

We found that antibody sequences from different discovery cohorts shared biochemical properties and could be retrieved across validation cohorts confirming the stereotyped character of this naive response in COVID-19. While neutralizing antibody sequences were found independently of disease severity in line with serological data, individual non-neutralizing antibody sequences were associated with fatal clinical courses suggesting detrimental effects of these antibodies. We mined 200 immune repertoires of healthy individuals and 500 of patients with blood or solid cancers - all acquired prior to the pandemic - for SARS-CoV-2 antibody sequences. While the largely unmutated B cell rearrangements occurred in a substantial fraction of immune repertoires from young and healthy individuals, these sequences were less likely found in individuals over 60 years of age and in cancer. This reflects B cell repertoire restriction in aging and cancer and may to a certain extent explain the different clinical COVID-19 courses observed in these risk groups. Future studies will have to address if this stereotyped B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 emerging from unmutated antibody rearrangements will create long-lived memory.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody rearrangements in pre-pandemic immune repertoires of risk cohorts and COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundVenous Access Devices (VADs) are the most used device in COVID-19 patients. ObjectiveIdentify VADs implanted, catheter related thrombosis (CRT), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), and accidental remove of VADs in both COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 free patients. Successive analysis was conducted comparing COVID-19 positive patients with COVID-19 free with inverse probability propensity score weights using simple regression to account for these two confounders (peripheral tip as central/peripheral and hospitalization as no/yes). MethodsThis multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from 7 hospitals in Lombardy during the pandemic period from February 21st to May 31st 2020. Results2206 VADs were evaluated, of which 1107 (50.2%) were inserted in COVID-19 patients. In COVID-19 cohort the first choice was Long Peripheral Cannula in 388 patients (35.1%) followed by Midline Catheter in 385 (34.8%). The number of \\"central tip\\" VADs inserted in COVID-free inpatients and COVID-19 positive were similar (307vs334). We recorded 42 (1.9%) CRT; 32 (79.2%) were observed in COVID-19 patients. 19 CRBSI were diagnosed; 15 (78.95%) were observed in COVID-19. Accidental removals were the more represented complication with 123 cases, 85 (69.1%) of them were in COVID-19. COVID-19 significantly predicted occurrence of CRT (OR = 2.00(1.85-5.03); P<0.001), CRSB (OR = 3.82(1.82-8.97); P<0.001), and Accidental Removal (OR = 2.39(1.80-3.20); P<0.001) in our propensity score weighted models.

There is an urgent need to accurately, comprehensively and objectively understand their experiences, perceptions and current situation of burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, insomnia and coronavirus infection. Therefore, this protocol is to conduct a mixed-methods systematic review to summarise the evidence on the experiences of healthcare providers and impacts of the coronavirus on their psychological status and infection during the pandemics. METHODS: Published studies on experience, perspective, impact, burnout, PTSD, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and infection of healthcare providers with SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and COVID-19, and written in English and Chinese will be accepted. Databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, PubMed, Psychology Information, WanFang and SinoMed) from inception until 30 July 2020 will be searched. Two reviewers will select, screen, extract data and assess the risk of bias independently. Risk of bias of results will be using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. Using a convergent integrated approach on qualitative/quantitative studies, we will synthesise qualitative and quantitative data separately. The incidence and number of cases about burnout, PTSD, anxiety, depression, insomnia and coronavirus infection among medical staff will be extracted. Then we will transform quantitative data to synthesise narrative findings. This protocol will be reported per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines.

Over a four-year period, we tracked whole-system water fluxes in a two-tier rain garden network and assessed near-surface hydrology and soil development across construction and operational phases. The monitoring data provided a quantitative basis for determining effectiveness of this stormwater control measure. Based on 233 monitored warm-season rainfall events, nearly half of total inflow volume was detained, with 90 percent of all events producing no flow to the combined sewer. For the events that did result in flow to the combined sewer system, the rain garden delayed flows for an average of 5.5 h. Multivariate analysis of hydrologic fluxes indicated that total event rainfall depth was a predominant hydrologic driver for network outflow during both phases, with average event intensity and daily evapotranspiration as additional, independent factors in regulating retention in the operational phase. Despite sediment loads that can clog the rooting zone, and overall lower-than-design infiltration rates, tradeoffs among soil profile development and hydrology apparently maintained relatively high overall retention effectiveness.

A large number of life-saving vaccines are discarded before their application owing to exposure to sub-optimum temperatures. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of a thermostable vaccine with a long shelf life at ambient temperature. AREAS COVERED: A literature search was performed to compile a list of different vaccines, and their storage and handling conditions. Similarly, a separate list was prepared for different coronavirus vaccines. A literature survey was also performed to look at different approaches undertaken globally to address the issue of the cold-chain problem. We emphasized the importance of yeast cells in the development of thermostable vaccines. In the end, we discussed why thermostable vaccines are required, not only in resource-poor countries but also for resource-rich countries .

For this assay, an ICA strip was placed into a microtube containing 150 l PBS and either 0.75 l of rat serum or 1.5 l of whole blood. Binding antibodies were visualized by using anti-rat IgG antibody-conjugated colloidal gold. Under these conditions, the multiplex ICA simultaneously and specifically detected antibodies to multiple antigens. Positive serum samples for each infectious disease were used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex ICA. The sensitivities of the multiplex ICA for Sendai virus, hantavirus, and sialodacryoadenitis virus were 100%, 100%, and 81%, respectively. No nonspecific reactions were observed in any of the 52 positive sera against heterologous antigens. In addition, 10 samples of uninfected sera did not show any bands except for the control line. These observations indicate high specificity of the multiplex ICA. Moreover, the multiplex ICA could be applied to diluted blood.

Social support interventions have been shown to reduce loneliness, including when delivered through technology. Digital humans are a new type of computer agent that show promise as supportive peers in health care. For digital humans to be effective and engaging support persons, it is important that they develop closeness with people. Closeness can be increased by emotional expressiveness, particularly in female relationships. However, it is unknown whether emotional expressiveness improves relationships with digital humans and affects physiological responses. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate whether emotional expression by a digital human can affect psychological and physiological outcomes and whether the effects are moderated by the users gender. METHODS: A community sample of 198 adults (101 women, 95 men, and 2 gender-diverse individuals) was block-randomized by gender to complete a 15-minute self-disclosure conversation with a female digital human in 1 of 6 conditions. In these conditions, the digital human varied in modality richness and emotional expression on the face and in the voice (emotional, neutral, or no face; emotional or neutral voice). Perceived loneliness, closeness, social support, caring perceptions, and stress were measured after each interaction. Heart rate, skin temperature, and electrodermal activity were assessed during each interaction. 3-way factorial analyses of variance with post hoc tests were conducted. RESULTS: Emotional expression in the voice was associated with greater perceptions of caring and physiological arousal during the interaction, and unexpectedly, with lower feelings of support. User gender moderated the effect of emotional expressiveness on several outcomes. For women, an emotional voice was associated with increased closeness, social support, and caring perceptions, whereas for men, a neutral voice increased these outcomes. For women, interacting with a neutral face was associated with lower loneliness and subjective stress compared with no face. Interacting with no face (ie, a voice-only black screen) resulted in lower loneliness and subjective stress for men, compared with a neutral or emotional face. No significant results were found for heart rate or skin temperature. However, average electrodermal activity was significantly higher for men while interacting with an emotional voice. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional expressiveness in a female digital human has different effects on loneliness, social, and physiological outcomes for men and women. The results inform the design of digital human support persons and have theoretical implications. Further research is needed to evaluate how more pronounced emotional facial expressions in a digital human might affect the results.

Death from COVID-19 infection was increased 5.5-fold in hemodialysis patients compared to mortality in the general population for a similar period, and there was an age-associated mortality increase in both populations (see figure 1). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.58, 95% CI: 1.31-1.92), dyspnea at presentation (HR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.20-2.16), pneumonia (HR 1.76, 95% CI: 1.12-2.75) and admission to hospital (HR 4.13, 95% CI: 1.92-8.88) were identified as independent mortality risk factors in the elderly hemodialysis population. Treatment with glucocorticoids reduced the risk of death (HR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.51-0.98) in aged patients on hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: Mortality is dramatically increased in elderly hemodialysis patients affected by COVID-19. Age, dyspnea at presentation, pneumonia or hospitalization are factors associated with a worse prognosis, after adjusting dialysis population to other confounding factors. Treatment with glucocorticoids could be a therapeutic option for this specific population.","output":"FC 026 COVID-19 IMPACT ON ELDERLY HEMODIALYSIS POPULATION: RESULTS FROM THE SPANISH COVID-19 CKD WORKING GROUP REGISTRY"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Different COVID-19 vaccine efficacies are reported, with remarkable effectiveness against severe disease. The so called sterilizing immunity, occurring when vaccinated individuals cannot transmit the virus, is still being evaluated. It is also unclear to what extent people with no symptoms or mild infection transmit the disease, and estimating their contribution to outbreaks is challenging. OBJECTIVE: With an uneven roll out of vaccination, the purpose of this study is to investigate the role of mild and asymptomatic infections on COVID-19 vaccine performance as vaccine efficacy and vaccine coverage vary. METHODS: We use an epidemiological SHAR (Susceptible-Hospitalized-Asymptomatic-Recovered) model framework to evaluate the effects of vaccination in different epidemiological scenarios of coverage and efficacy. Two vaccination models, the vaccine [Formula: see text] protecting against severe disease, and the vaccine [Formula: see text] , protecting against infection as well as severe disease, are compared to evaluate the reduction of overall infections and hospitalizations. RESULTS: Vaccine performance is driven by the ability of asymptomatic or mild disease cases transmitting the virus. Vaccines protecting against severe disease but failing to block transmission might not be able to reduce significantly the severe disease burden during the initial stage of a vaccination roll out programme, with an eventual increase on the number of overall infections in a population. CONCLUSION: The different COVID-19 vaccines currently in use have features placing them closer to one or the other of these two extreme cases, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] , and insights on the importance of asymptomatic infection in a vaccinated population are of a major importance for the future planning of vaccination programmes.

To enhance the performances of IAQ screening models using surrogate parameters in identifying unsatisfactory IAQ, and to update the screening models such that they can apply to a new standard, a novel framework for the updating of screening levels, using machine learning methods, is proposed in this study. The classification models employed are Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF) and sigmoid), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN). With carefully selected model hyperparameters, the IAQ assessment made by the models achieved a mean test accuracy of 0.536C0.805 and a maximum test accuracy of 0.807C0.820, indicating that machine learning models are suitable for screening the unsatisfactory IAQ. Further to that, using the updated IAQ standard in Hong Kong as an example, the update of an IAQ screening model against a new IAQ standard was conducted by determining the relative impact ratio of the updated standard to the old standard. Relative impact ratios of 1.1C1.5 were estimated and the corresponding likelihood ratios in the updated scheme were found to be higher than expected due to the tightening of exposure levels in the updated scheme. The presented framework shows the feasibility of updating a machine learning IAQ model when a new standard is being adopted, which shall provide an ultimate method for IAQ assessment prediction that is compatible with all IAQ standards and exposure criteria.","output":"Updating Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Assessment Screening Levels with Machine Learning Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The objective of this article is to understand issues concerning the defense of the rights of people with disabilities in the midst of the pandemic reality caused by COVID-19, under the perspective of the Public Defender's Office.

It recognises the O-antigenic repeating units of cell surface lipopolysaccharide of serogroup A, B and D1 as receptor, but also inactivates its receptor by endoglycosidase (endorhamnosidase) activity. In the final step of bacteriophage P22 assembly six homotrimeric tailspike molecules are non-covalently attached to the DNA injection apparatus, mediated by their N-terminal, head-binding domains. We report the crystal structure of the head-binding domain of P22 tailspike protein at 2.3 ? resolution, solved with a recombinant telluromethionine derivative and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging. The trimeric dome-like structure is formed by two perpendicular -sheets of five and three strands, respectively in each subunit and caps a three-helix bundle observed in the structure of the C-terminal receptor binding and cleaving fragment, reported here after full refinement at 1.56 ? resolution. In the central part of the receptor binding fragment, three parallel -helices of 13 complete turns are associated side-by-side, while the three polypeptide strands merge into a single domain towards their C termini, with close interdigitation at the junction to the -helix part. Complex structures with receptor fragments from S. typhimurium, S. enteritidis and S. typhi253Ty determined at 1.8 ? resolution are described in detail. Insertions into the -helix form the O-antigen binding groove, which also harbours the active site residues Asp392, Asp395 and Glu359.

In this paper, we determine the Black-White disparity in COVID-19 mortality rates across 35 states using direct age standardization. We then explore the relationship between structural racism and differences in the magnitude of this disparity across states. METHODS: Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we calculated both crude and age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rates for the non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black populations in each state. We explored the relationship between a state-level structural racism index and the observed differences in the racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality across states. We explored the potential mediating effects of disparities in exposure based on occupation, underlying medical conditions, and health care access. RESULTS: Relying upon crude death rate ratios resulted in a substantial underestimation of the true magnitude of the Black-White disparity in COVID-19 mortality rates. The structural racism index was a robust predictor of the observed racial disparities. Each standard deviation increase in the racism index was associated with an increase of 0.26 in the ratio of COVID-19 mortality rates among the Black compared to the White population. CONCLUSIONS: Structural racism should be considered a root cause of the Black-White disparity in COVID-19 mortality. Dismantling the long-standing systems of racial oppression is critical to adequately address both the downstream and upstream causes of racial inequities in the disease burden of COVID-19.","output":"Actual Racial/Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Mortality for the Non-Hispanic Black Compared to Non-Hispanic White Population in 35 US States and Their Association with Structural Racism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We aimed to compare risk of hospital-acquired sacral pressure injuries (HASPI) in COVID-19+ and COVID-19- patients Method: Single-institution, multi-hospital, retrospective cohort review of all hospitalizations from March 1st, 2020 to September 1st, 2020 Patients with new-onset HASPI (stage II or greater) were included in our study Patients with chronic history of sacral ulcerations or patients with ulceration present on admission were excluded Patient demographics, baseline ulceration risk (based on Braden risk assessment), HASPI characteristics, laboratory parameters, and ulcer-associated morbidity were collected Results: During our study period, 36 of 59,208 COVID-19- and 13 of 3,488 COVID-19+ hospitalized patients developed a HASPI COVID-19+ patients had a 5 5x higher relative risk of developing a HASPI compared to COVID-19- patients (46 5 per 100,000 hospitalization days versus 8 4 per 100,000 hospitalization days, 95% CI 3 3-11 5, p&lt;0 0001) Of patients that developed a HASPI: median age, gender distribution, baseline ulceration risk, nursing skin checks per day, and time from admission to HASPI were similar between COVID-19+ and COVID-19- patients COVID-19+ patients had larger (median ulcer size 85 cm2 vs 7 5 cm2, p=0 04) and more severe (46 2% Stage 4/Unstageable vs 19 4%, p=0 03) HASPIs compared to COVID-19- patients All COVID-19+ patients with HASPI had elevated D-dimer concentrations, with a median peak D-dimer of 6,755 ng/mL that occurred on average 3 5 days before ulcer formation HASPI led to severe morbidity in 6 of 11 COVID-19+ patients who survived initial hospitalization, including need for debridement or surgery (n=5) and ulcer infection/sepsis (n=5) Conclusions: Hospitalized COVID-19+ patients are at increased risk for developing large and severe HASPI The etiology of increased HASPI risk is unclear, but may due to poor tissue perfusion secondary to microvasculature occlusion, decreased staffing, and inability to appropriately position hemodynamically unstable patients","output":"433 Increased risk of hospital acquired sacral pressure injuries in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to investigate novel emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineages in Japan that harbor variants in the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD).

This research seeks to understand how the COVID-19 event leads to impacts, lessons, and proposed solutions for the operations of global supply chains. This study is based on a structured review of publications released on or before 31 December 2020. It includes established academic publications but also those emerging primarily from academic institutions in trade magazines and on the wider internet. Specifically, four research questions are addressed: How and where are disruptions caused by COVID-19 understood to impact global supply chains? How does the literature portray supply chain lessons from the COVID-19-related disruptions? How does the literature portray the suggested resilience-driven solutions for the future operation of global supply chains? Finally, how are digital technologies proposed as part of resilience-driven solutions to the future operation of global supply chains? Concerning the findings, the study contributes by developing a new theoretical understanding of the ongoing collective supply chain lessons of the COVID-19 disruption. Six supply chain vulnerabilities, six solutions or resilience capabilities and seven technology clusters deemed particularly useful in mitigating future pandemic disruptions are identified. In addition, the interrelationships between the different elements are explored and understood as an ongoing learning process comprising a process of evoking vulnerabilities, a process of reacting and devising change and a process of implementing change.

Both quantitative and qualitative techniques, whether signal or target amplification based systems, are currently used routinely in most if not all virology laboratories. Technological improvements, from automated sample isolation to real time amplification technology, have given the ability to develop and introduce systems for most viruses of clinical interest, and to obtain clinical relevant information needed for optimal antiviral treatment options. Both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) can currently be used together with real time detection to generate results in a short turn-around time and to determine whether variants relevant for antiviral resistance are present. These new technologies enable the introduction of an individual patient disease management concept. Within our clinical setting, we have introduced this e.g. for quantitative detection of EpsteinCBarr Virus (EBV) in T-dell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. This enabled us to develop models for pre-emptive anti B-cell immunotherapy for EBV reactivation, thereby effectively reducing not the incidence of EBV-lymphoproliferative disease but the virus related mortality. Furthermore, additional clinically relevant viruses can now easily be detected simultaneously. It also becomes more feasible to introduce molecular testing for those viruses that can easily be detected using classical virological methods, like culture techniques or antigen detection. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the clinical importance of the additional positive samples detected. It should however be made clear that a complete exchange of technologies is unlikely to occur, and that some complementary technologies should stay operational enabling the discovery of new viruses. The implementation of these molecular diagnostic technologies furthermore warrants the use and introduction of standardized materials as well as participation in international quality control programs. Finally, the use of an internal control throughout the whole procedure not only ensures the accuracy of the results generated, but also is necessary to enable precise quantification of these results and to determine detection thresholds more accurately. Since so many targets do have clinical implications, laboratories might prefer to use universal internal controls before the in-house developed assays should be introduced in clinical virology.","output":"Clinical virology in real time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: High-speed tooth preparation requires effective cooling to avoid thermal damage, which generates spray mist, which is a mixture of an aerosol, droplets and particles of different sizes. The aim of this experimental study was to analyze the efficacy of spray mist reduction with an intraoral high-volume evacuation system (HVE) during simulated high-speed tooth preparation for suboptimal versus optimal suction positions of 16 mm sized cannulas and different flow rates of the HVE. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a manikin head, the upper first premolar was prepared with a dental turbine, and generated particles of 5C50 microns were analyzed fifty millimeters above the mouth opening with the shadow imaging technique (frame: 6.65.31.1 mm). This setup was chosen to generate a reproducible spray mist in a vertical direction towards an imaginary operator head (worst case scenario). The flow rate (FR) of the HVE was categorized into five levels (120 l/min up to 330 l/min). The number of particles per second (NP; p/s) was counted, and the mass volume flow of particles per second (MVF; g/s*cm(3)) was calculated for 10 sec. Statistical tests were nonparametric and two-sided (p0.05). RESULTS: With increasing flow rate, the NP/MVF values decreased significantly (eta: 0.671/0.678; p0.001). Using a suboptimally positioned cannula with an FR160 l/min, significantly higher NP values (meanSD) of 731.6754.24 p/s (p0.019) and an MVF of 3.720.42 g/s*cm(3) (p0.010) were measured compared to those of the optimal cannula position and FR300 l/min (NP/MVF: 0/0). No significant difference in NP and MVF was measurable between FR250 l/min and FR>300 l/min (p = 0.652, p = 0.664).

Targeting of BTK with small molecule inhibitors has proven to be efficacious in several B cell malignancies. Interestingly, recent studies reveal increased BTK protein expression in circulating resting B cells of patients with systemic autoimmune disease (AID) compared with healthy controls. Moreover, BTK phosphorylation following BCR stimulation in vitro was enhanced. In addition to its role in BCR signaling, BTK is involved in many other pathways, including pattern recognition, Fc, and chemokine receptor signaling in B cells and myeloid cells. This broad involvement in several immunological pathways provides a rationale for the targeting of BTK in the context of inflammatory and systemic AID. Accordingly, numerous in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies support the potential of BTK targeting in these conditions.

Accurate predictions of cognate pMHC targets for T Cell Receptors (TCR) would greatly facilitate identification of vaccine targets for both pathogenic diseases as well as personalized cancer immunotherapies. Predicting immunogenic peptides therefore has been at the centre of intensive research for the past decades but has proven challenging. Although numerous models have been proposed, performance of these models has not been systematically evaluated and their success rate in predicting epitopes in the context of human pathology, has not been measured and compared. In this study, we evaluated the performance of several publicly available models, in identifying immunogenic CD8+ T cell targets in the context of pathogens and cancers. We found that for predicting immunogenic peptides from an emerging virus such as SARS-CoV-2, none of the models perform substantially better than random or offer considerable improvement beyond HLA ligand prediction. We also observed suboptimal performance for predicting cancer neoantigens. Through investigation of potential factors associated with ill performance of models, we highlight several data- and model-associated issues. In particular, we observed that cross-HLA variation in the distribution of immunogenic and non-immunogenic peptides in training data of the models seem to substantially confound the predictions. We additionally compared key parameters associated with immunogenicity between pathogenic peptides and cancer neoantigens and observed evidence for differences in the thresholds of binding affinity and stability, which suggested the need to modulate different features in identifying immunogenic pathogen vs. cancer peptides. Overall, we demonstrate that accurate and reliable prediction of immunogenic CD8+ T cell targets remains unsolved, thus we hope our work will guide users and model developers regarding potential pitfalls and unsettled questions in existing immunogenicity predictors.","output":"Evaluating performance of existing computational models in predicting CD8+ T cell pathogenic epitopes and cancer neoantigens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to report return to sports (RTS) and return to work (RTW) outcomes after distraction arthroplasty (DA) plus lateral meniscal allograft transplantation (MAT) combined with cartilage repair in active patients with advanced osteoarthritis. It was hypothesised that DA combined with lateral MAT would improve clinical and radiological outcomes and enable RTS and RTW for most patients. METHODS: In total, 21 patients with advanced osteoarthritis (moderate to severe joint space narrowing at lateral edge on Rosenberg view and large cartilage defect of lateral femoral condyle) who underwent concomitant DA and MAT were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical outcomes were assessed using subjective knee scores [Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee score, and Tegner activity scale (TAS)] and functional tests (isokinetic extensor muscle strength test, single-leg vertical jump test, and single-leg hop for distance test). The rates of RTS, RTW, and satisfaction were evaluated. Radiological outcomes were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray (Rosenberg view). RESULTS: The mean age at surgery and mean follow-up duration were 37.2  5.9 years and 37.1  5.4 months, respectively. All improvements in subjective scores were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The Lysholm score improved from 58.3  8.1 to 84.3  8.2, the IKDC subjective score from 53.9  10.4 to 78.0  7.7, and the TAS from 4.0  0.5 to 5.1  0.8.

All patients were able to return to any sports activity and work. However, 67% and 90.5% returned to their defined or desired level of sports activity and occupation intensity, respectively. Further, 76.2% were very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the outcome at the last follow-up. The JSW increased by 0.8  0.4 to 2.3  0.6 mm (p = 0.005).

Significant improvements in clinical outcomes and the radiographic joint space width were observed. However, the activity ability was somewhat reduced compared with the best preoperative level.

Of these patients, 32 underwent LAPG-JI, and 38 underwent open proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition. Clinical characteristics and both surgical and postoperative outcomes were compared between LAPG-JI and open proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition. RESULTS The operation time was longer in the LAPG-JI group (189 vs 154 min, P < 0.001) and estimated blood loss was lower (30 vs 180 mL, P < 0.001). There were no differences in the rates of early (9.4% vs 13.2%) or late postoperative complications (12.5% vs 10.5%). No anastomotic leakage was observed in either group. In the LAPG-JI group, the time to first eating was shorter, and the white blood cell counts on postoperative days 1 and 7 and body temperature on postoperative day 3 were lower. The number of additional doses of postoperative analgesia was lower in the LAPG-JI group. Reflux esophagitis graded C according to the Los Angeles classification was observed in only one patient (3.1%) in the LAPG-JI group. CONCLUSION Although the operation time was longer in the LAPG-JI group, the procedure seemed to be feasible and safe. Also, it offered the advantages of laparoscopic surgery, including less invasiveness and quicker recovery.","output":"Comparison of outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted and open proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition for early gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach: A retrospective observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detailed data on clinical presentations and outcomes of children with COVID-19 in Europe are still lacking. In this descriptive study, we report on 130 children with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosed by 28 centers (mostly hospitals), in 10 regions in Italy, during the first months of the pandemic. Among these, 67 (51.5%) had a relative with COVID-19 while 34 (26.2%) had comorbidities, with the most frequent being respiratory, cardiac, or neuromuscular chronic diseases. Overall, 98 (75.4%) had an asymptomatic or mild disease, 11 (8.5%) had moderate disease, 11 (8.5%) had a severe disease, and 9 (6.9%) had a critical presentation with infants below 6 months having significantly increased risk of critical disease severity (OR 5.6, 95% CI 1.3 to 29.1). Seventy-five (57.7%) children were hospitalized, 15 (11.5%) needed some respiratory support, and nine (6.9%) were treated in an intensive care unit. All recovered. Conclusion:This descriptive case series of children with COVID-19, mostly encompassing of cases enrolled at hospital level, suggest that COVID-19 may have a non-negligible rate of severe presentations in selected pediatric populations with a relatively high rates of comorbidities. More studies are needed to further understand the presentation and outcomes of children with COVID-19 in children with special needs.

Although its activity is essential to fight infection and support tissue homeostasis, the inflammasome complex, which consists of the danger sensor NLRP3, the adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC; also known as PYCARD), caspase-1 and probably other regulatory proteins, also bears considerable potential for detrimental inflammation, as observed in human conditions such as gout, heart attack, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, multi-layered regulatory networks are required to ensure the fine balance between rapid responsiveness versus erroneous activation (sufficient and temporally restricted versus excessive and chronic activity) of the inflammasome. These involve multiple activation, secretion and cell death pathways, as well as modulation of the subcellular localization of NLRP3, and its structure and activity, owing to post-translational modification by other cellular proteins. Here, we discuss the exciting progress that has recently been made in deciphering the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Additionally, we highlight open questions and describe areas of research that warrant further exploration to obtain a more comprehensive molecular and cellular understanding of the NLRP3 inflammasome.","output":"Recent insights into the regulatory networks of NLRP3 inflammasome activation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article critically examines the recent literature on stigma that addresses the overspread association among the COVID-19 pandemic and racial and ethnic groups (i.e., mainland Chinese and East Asian populations) assumed to be the source of the virus.The analysis begins by reviewing the way in which infectious diseases have historically been associated with developing countries and their citizens, which, in turn, are supposed to become prime vectors of contagion.

The mechanisms for the therapeutic benefit of type 2 inhibitors in reducing virally-induced exacerbations, however, remain to be fully elucidated. Preclinical and clinical evidence supports the existence of a close counter-regulation of the high-affinity IgE receptor and interferon pathways, and a potential dual mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit for omalizumab and other type 2 inhibitors that inhibit IgE activity, which may enhance the prevention and treatment of virally-induced asthma exacerbations. Similar evidence regarding some novel type 2 inhibitor therapies, including biological and small molecule inhibitors, suggest that such a dual mechanism of action with enhancement of interferon production working through non-IgE pathways, might also exist. The specific mechanisms for this dual effect could be related to the close counter-regulation between type 2 and type 1 immune pathways and potential key underlying mechanisms are discussed. Further basic research and better understanding of these underlying counter-regulatory mechanisms could provide novel therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of virally-induced asthma exacerbations, as well as type 2 and non-type 2 driven asthma.

In the context of COVID-19, tertiary sector psychology educators responsible for facilitating these placements, which typically require face-to-face client work, have been challenged to arrange or maintain practica. During the pandemic, across Australia, most placements have been affected through cancellation, postponement, or modification (e.g., using telehealth, supported by the Australian Federal Government). In this paper we describe a collaborative initiative by members of the psychology profession across 15 providers of Australian postgraduate professional training programs. The initiative aimed to identify ways in which to develop and innovate psychological placement offerings, specifically using simulation-based learning. Although simulation-based learning in psychology training programs in Australia is a widely employed pedagogy for the scaffolding of theory into psychological practice, there is paucity of clear and comprehensive guidelines for the use of simulation to both optimize competency-based training and ensure public and student safety.

RTX can cause hypogammaglobulinemia and predispose patients to infections. Herein, we asked whether the underlying diagnosis influences the risk for hypogammaglobulinemia in patients treated with RTX. All patients who received RTX infusions and carried a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), or connective tissue disease (CTD) were included in this single-center retrospective cohort study. We used STATA? for analysis: Chi-square test was used for comparing categorical variables. Based on distribution, continuous variables were compared using the t test/ANOVA or the Wilcoxon/KruskalCWallis tests. Of the 163 patients who received RTX for an AIRD, 60 with pre- and post- RTX immunoglobulins were analyzed. A higher incidence of post-treatment hypogammaglobulinemia was seen in AAV (45%) compared to RA (22%) and CTD (9.1%) groups (p = 0.03). Glucocorticoid exposure of 10 mg or more was identified as a significant risk factor for hypogammaglobulinemia. Finally, we observed a higher number of clinically significant infections per person in the AAV group than in the RA and CTD groups. We observed an increased incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia in the RTX-treated AAV group, with almost half of patients developing post-RTX hypogammaglobulinemia. The rate of infections per person was highest in the AAV group. Screening immunoglobulins were not consistently measured pre- and post-RTX.

METHODS: For estimating of the basic reproduction number values, we fit the SIRD model using the Runge-Kutta simulation method in addition to the analytical solution of parts of the model. We use the collected data of the new coronavirus pandemic reported up to date July 30, 2020 in India, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United States, France, Nigeria, Yemen, China and Russia.

A few symptom checkers dedicated for COVID-19 have been described, but it remains unclear whether and how they can affect patients and health systems. OBJECTIVE: This paper demonstrates our experiences with the COVID-19 risk assessment (CRA) tool. We tried to determine who the user of the web-based COVID-19 triage app is and compare this group with patients in the infectious diseases wards admission room to evaluate who could benefit from implementing the COVID-19 online symptom checker as a remote triage solution. METHODS: We analyzed the answers of 248,862 people interacting with an online World Health OrganizationCbased triage tool for assessing the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These users filled in an online questionnaire between April 7 and August 6, 2020. Based on the presented symptoms, risk factors, and demographics, the tool assessed whether the users answers were suggestive of COVID-19 and recommended appropriate action. Subsequently, we compared the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of tool users with patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases Admission Room of J. Gromkowski Hospital in Wroc?aw. RESULTS: The CRA tool tended to be used by asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic individuals (171,226 [68.80%] of all users). Most users were young (162,432 [65.27%] were below 40 years of age) and without comorbidities. Only 77,645 (31.20%) of the self-assessment app users were suspected of COVID-19 based on their reported symptoms. On the contrary, most admission room patients were symptomaticsymptoms such as fever, cough, and dyspnea were prevalent in both COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients. COVID-19-suspected patients in the CRA tool group presented similar COVID-19 symptoms as those who presented to the admission room. These were cough (25,062/40,007 [62.64%] in the CRA tool group vs 138/232 [59.48%] in the admission room group), fever (23,123/40,007 [57.80%] in the CRA tool group vs 146/232 [62.93%] in the admission room group), and shortness of breath (15,157/40,007 [37.89%] in the CRA tool group vs 87/232 [37.50%] in the admission room group). CONCLUSIONS: The comparison between the symptomatology of the users interacting with the CRA tool and those visiting the admission room revealed 2 major patient groups who could have benefited from the implementation of the self-assessment app in preclinical triage settings. The primary users of the CRA tool were young, oligosymptomatic individuals looking for screening for COVID-19 and reassurance early in the COVID-19 pandemic.

In particular, simultaneous testing of several biomarkers can be powerful. Here, we critically review work from the previous 4 years up to February 2021 on developing microfluidic devices for multiplexed detection of biomarkers from samples. We focus on two principal approaches: electrical and optical detection methods that can distinguish and quantify biomarkers. Both electrical and spectroscopic multiplexed detection strategies are being employed to reach limits of detection below clinical sample levels. Some of the most promising strategies for point-of-care assays involve inexpensive materials such as paper-based microfluidic devices, or portable and accessible detectors such as smartphones. This review does not comprehensively cover all multiplexed microfluidic biomarker studies, but rather provides a critical evaluation of key work and suggests promising prospects for future advancement in this field.

Eurostat, World Bank and the World Economic Forum data for 2015C2019 were used for the purpose of the research. The research was divided into three stages, i.e. assessment of economic development on the basis of a synthetic ratio of economic anchor development, for which a relative benchmark method based on spatial median (so-called L1 median or Weber point) was used, identification of conditions for the development of entrepreneurial capacity and statistical analysis showing the correlation between economic anchor measures and selected factors of the 3SI countries economic development. Our study found that the entrepreneurial capacity of the 3SI countries in 2015C2019 was determined by nine characteristics, belonging to six areas, i.e. local economy, demographic situation, social situation, trade exchange, innovation and tourism economy.

The goal of the present study was to clarify histologically and immunohistochemically how division with the device affects the wall layers of the pulmonary vasculature. METHODS This prospective cohort study analysed outcomes of 20 patients who underwent anatomical lung resection. After a single proximal ligation, the PA and the PV (diameter 2-7 mm) were divided using a LigaSure Blunt Tip (LSB). Histological findings and thermal damage were evaluated in vascular specimens from resected lungs. RESULTS The PA has a well-developed media with rich elastic fibres and a thin adventitia, whereas the PV has a thinner media and a thicker adventitia with abundant collagen fibres. Vascular division of the PAs and PVs appeared complete to the naked eye. However, in all divided PAs, the area adjacent to the sealed zone comprised only adventitia and thin disrupted media. Additionally, thermal energy generated by the LSB resulted in a wide area of thermal necrosis over the histologically fragile region in all cases. Conversely, the wall layers of all divided PVs were completely fused without disruption. Thermal spread and disruption did not significantly differ between small (2-4 mm) and large (5-7 mm) PAs [187 (150-253) vs 236 (190-275) m, P = 0.22; 180 (138-200) vs 210 (161-305) m, P = 0.22]. Histological changes differed significantly between the pulmonary vessels after division using the LSB. CONCLUSIONS Surgeons should consider that dividing the pulmonary vessels with a vessel-sealing device might have more histological impact on the layers of the wall of the PA than on those of the PV, although it remains unclear whether these findings constitute a clinical risk.","output":"The differences in histological changes among pulmonary vessels divided with an energy device."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new epidemiological scenario has so far focused on the environmental circulation of human viral pathogens. Owing to the side effects of chemical disinfectants, there is an increasing need for knowledge on the use of virucidal compounds, especially those of a natural origin. Climacostol is a molecule produced by a freshwater ciliate and it exhibits activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens. We thus also speculated that there might be an effect on viral viability, which has never been tested. To evaluate such activity, we chose human adenovirus (HAdV), which is representative of waterborne viruses. We conducted experiments using HAdV serotype 5, whose titer was determined by infecting HeLa cell cultures. HAdV5 was shown to be sensitive to climacostol at a concentration of 0.0002 mg/mL, with an approximate 3 Log10 reduction when the initial titer of HAdV5 was approximately 104 and 103 TCID50/mL. These preliminary results could be an important starting point for further research aimed at improving the characterization of climacostol activity under different experimental conditions and against various viruses, including enveloped ones (i.e., the coronavirus).

The latter include idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), sarcoidosis and a group of miscellaneous, rare, but nonetheless interesting, diseases. In patients with ILD, MDCT enriches the diagnostic armamentarium by allowing volumetric high resolution scanning, i.e., continuous data acquisition with thin collimation and a high spatial frequency reconstruction algorithm. CT is a key method in the identification and management of patients with ILD. It not only improves the detection and characterization of parenchymal abnormalities, but also increases the accuracy of diagnosis. The spectrum of morphologic characteristics that are indicative of interstitial lung disease is relatively limited and includes a reticular pattern (with or without traction bronchiectasis), thickening of interlobular septa, honeycombing, nodules, and ground-glass opacities. In the correct clinical context, some patterns or combination of patterns, together with the anatomic distribution of the abnormality, i.e., from the lung apex to the base, or peripheral subpleural versus central bronchovascular, can lead the interpreter to a specific diagnosis.

Based on its conservation profile, this domain is proposed to have nucleotidylation activity. We used recombinant non-structural protein 9 of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) and different biochemical assays, including irreversible labeling with a GTP analog followed by a proteomics analysis, to demonstrate the manganese-dependent covalent binding of guanosine and uridine phosphates to a lysine/histidine residue. Most likely this was the invariant lysine of the newly identified domain, named nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN), whose substitution with alanine severely diminished the described binding. Furthermore, this mutation crippled EAV and prevented the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in cell culture, indicating that NiRAN is essential for nidoviruses. Potential functions supported by NiRAN may include nucleic acid ligation, mRNA capping and protein-primed RNA synthesis, possibilities that remain to be explored in future studies.","output":"Discovery of an essential nucleotidylating activity associated with a newly delineated conserved domain in the RNA polymerase-containing protein of all nidoviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has not impacted people or countries uniformly. This disparity has prompted investigations to identify clinical and genetic predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Headache, a COVID-19 symptom, has been associated with positive disease prognosis in small cohorts, but larger confirmatory data-sets are lacking. Moreover, the global predisposition to experience primary headache disorders might be correlated with variances in COVID-19 mortality rates. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of studies of COVID-19 inpatient survival that also reported headache as a COVID-19 symptom. Separately, using a generalized additive model regression (GAM), we analysed data across 171 nations to identify variables which impact COVID-19 mortality rates. We performed similar analyses of seasonal influenza mortality. Prevalence data were extracted from the Global Health Data Exchange. Findings: We meta-analysed 48 studies and observed a significantly higher risk ratio of survival (RR:2178 [1882-2520], p<00001) among COVID-19 inpatients with headache. In the global population-level analysis, we observed that a higher prevalence of headache disorders was associated with a higher COVID-19 mortality rate, and represented the main variable contributing to differences in COVID-19 mortality rates between countries (378%;F value=1068). By contrast, we observed a negative trend between the prevalence of headache disorders and influenza death rates.Interpretation: Headache as a COVID-19 symptom enhances survival, whereas headache as a primary disorder is more prevalent in nations with higher COVID-19 mortality. Further studies should investigate (1) mechanisms whereby headache is associated with survival from certain viral infections and (2) whether selection pressures from viruses may have contributed to the evolution of primary headache disorders as adaptations.Funding: No funding was receivedDeclaration of Interests: Dr Shapiro has received in the past 12 months financial or editorial compensation as a research consultant for Eli Lilly and Lundbeck.

This has caused a drastic change to our lifestyle and social contacts. This study investigates the impact of the corona crisis on the satisfaction of social contacts in Belgium. METHODS: Study participants included a subsample of adults aged 18 years (n = 510) of the Belgian health interview survey 2018, who also participated in a follow-up study in July 2020. Information on satisfaction with social contacts was measured twice with the same instrument. A multilevel logistic regression was used to analyse how the proportion of participants indicating they are unsatisfied with their social contacts had changed over time. RESULTS: Between 2018 and July 2020 the prevalence of being unsatisfied with social contacts increased from 10.0% to 19.0%. We observed important differences in the change in this indicator between the 3 Belgian regions. A significant increase was observed in Flanders (OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.8-7.1) and Brussels (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.2-7.5), whereas this was not the case in Wallonia (OR 1.1; 95% CI 0.5-2.5). No relation was observed with age, gender and education. Strictly respecting the measures about the social bubble was inversely related with being unsatisfied with social contacts (OR 0.5; 95%CI 0.2-0.9).

To understand the impact of COVID-19 on public health, many studies have been conducted for various countries. To complement the available work, in this article we examine Canadian COVID-19 data for the period of March 18, 2020 to August 16, 2020 with the aim to forecast the dynamic trend in a short term. METHOD: We focus our attention on Canadian data and analyze the four provinces, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec, which have the most severe situations in Canada. To build predictive models and conduct prediction, we employ three models, smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models, neural network (NN) models, and susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) models, to fit time series data of confirmed cases in the four provinces separately. In comparison, we also analyze the data of daily infections in two states of USA, Texas and New York state, for the period of March 18, 2020 to August 16, 2020. We emphasize that different models make different assumptions which are basically difficult to validate. Yet invoking different models allows us to examine the data from different angles, thus, helping reveal the underlying trajectory of the development of COVID-19 in Canada. FINDING: The examinations of the data dated from March 18, 2020 to August 11, 2020 show that the STAR, NN, and SIR models may output different results, though the differences are small in some cases. Prediction over a short term period incurs smaller prediction variability than over a long term period, as expected. The NN method tends to outperform other two methods. All the methods forecast an upward trend in all the four Canadian provinces for the period of August 12, 2020 to August 23, 2020, though the degree varies from method to method.

Those compensatory mutants isolated in bacteria and yeast with altered tRNA or protein factors are reviewed here and are considered to primarily cause altered P-site realignment and not altered translocation. Though the first sequenced tRNA mutant which suppressed a +1 frameshift mutation had an extra base in its anticodon loop and led to a textbook \\"yardstick\\" model in which the number of anticodon bases determines codon size, this model has long been discounted, although not by all. Accordingly, the reviewed data suggest that reading frame maintenance and translocation are two distinct features of the ribosome. None of the -1 tRNA suppressors have anticodon loops with fewer than the standard seven nucleotides. Many of the tRNA mutants potentially affect tRNA bending and/or stability and can be used for functional assays, and one has the conserved C74 of the 3' CCA substituted. The effect of tRNA modification deficiencies on framing has been particularly informative. The properties of some mutants suggest the use of alternative tRNA anticodon loop stack conformations by individual tRNAs in one translation cycle. The mutant proteins range from defective release factors with delayed decoding of A-site stop codons facilitating P-site frameshifting to altered EF-Tu/EF1alpha to mutant ribosomal large- and small-subunit proteins L9 and S9.

In case of Senegal, the country was already facing number of challenges at the inception of the pandemic, including high rates of poverty, prevalence of food insecurity, combined with other biophysical and socioeconomic challenges faced generally in Sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: To understand farmer perceptions of the potential impacts of COVID-19 on agricultural systems and social well-being of smallholder farmers in Senegal. Particular attention was given to potential vulnerabilities and resilience in the targeted farming systems. METHODS: A survey was developed to better understand smallholder farmer perceptions regarding the anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on their agriculture practices and social well-being. The survey was administered (between June 5 and June 20) with smallholder farmers (na?=a?872) in 14 regions covering all agroecological zones. Variables of interest included perceptions of potential impact on farming systems, agricultural productivity, communities, economics, markets, labor, gendered division of labor, food security, and community well-being. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Across the three farming systems examined (cropping, livestock, and horticulture) significant majorities expressed concerns related to access to inputs, ability to plant (cropping, horticulture), reduction of yields (cropping, horticulture), ability to feed livestock, ability to sell livestock, and the ability to hire labor (horticulture). The majority of respondents also expressed concern that COVID-19 would make it more difficult to get enough food on a regular basis for their household (82.5%); that the markets where they purchase food will either be closed or significantly disrupted (79.5%); that the price of food would increase (73.5%); and the market where they sell their produce/livestock will be either closed or significantly disrupted (73.2%). SIGNIFICANCE: Anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on agriculture will be felt on both the biophysical aspects such as production and access to inputs and socioeconomic aspects such as access to labor, markets, or rapid shifts in demand. Results support the need to use farming systems approach to gather perceived and actual impacts of COVID-19 and warrants a more in-depth examination of agronomic and biophysical issues as well as the impact on the livelihoods and social well-being of families at community and household levels. Further examination will help identify the characteristics that strengthen smallholder farming systems resilience to adjust to anticipated and unanticipated shocks, such as COVID-19, to decrease the negative impacts and increase the rate of recovery.","output":"Smallholder farmer perceptions about the impact of COVID-19 on agriculture and livelihoods in Senegal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To present the first experience with a 3-port technique for retroperitoneoscopic (HARP) radical nephrectomy, radical nephroureterectomy, and total and live donor nephrectomy. We believe that the retroperitoneoscopic (RP) approach to nephrectomy is advantageous, as it avoids mobilization of intraperitoneal organs and provides direct access to the renal artery. Nonetheless, this approach is not as popular as the transperitoneal approach, likely because of the steeper learning curve. We believe that hand-assistance reduces the learning curve because of the tactile feedback and similarity to open surgery. METHODS Over a 4-year period, 133 HARP nephrectomies were performed, including 92 radical nephrectomies, 19 radical nephroureterectomies, 12 total nephrectomies, and 10 live donor nephrectomies. Mean patient age was 62 years and mean body mass index was 30; 42% of patients had abdominal scars. Our technique uses a 7-cm muscle-sparing Gibson incision for the hand-port with 2 endoscopic ports. RESULTS Mean operative time, including ureterectomy, was 109 minutes, with a mean operative blood loss of 167 mL. Average hospitalization was 3.8 days. Two cases (1.5%) required open conversion. The complication rate was limited to 3.8% for blood transfusion, 3.8% for cardiac issues, 1.5% for pulmonary embolism, 2.3% for wound infection, and 1.5% for urinary retention.

We investigated the protective effect of the first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca non-replicating viral-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; AZD1222) and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2) in residents of long-term care facilities in terms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection over time since vaccination. METHODS: The VIVALDI study is a prospective cohort study that commenced recruitment on June 11, 2020, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission, infection outcomes, and immunity in residents and staff in long-term care facilities in England that provide residential or nursing care for adults aged 65 years and older. In this cohort study, we included long-term care facility residents undergoing routine asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 testing between Dec 8, 2020 (the date the vaccine was first deployed in a long-term care facility), and March 15, 2021, using national testing data linked within the COVID-19 Datastore. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated the relative hazard of PCR-positive infection at 0-6 days, 7-13 days, 14-20 days, 21-27 days, 28-34 days, 35-48 days, and 49 days and beyond after vaccination, comparing unvaccinated and vaccinated person-time from the same cohort of residents, adjusting for age, sex, previous infection, local SARS-CoV-2 incidence, long-term care facility bed capacity, and clustering by long-term care facility. We also compared mean PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values for positive swabs obtained before and after vaccination. The study is registered with ISRCTN, number 14447421. FINDINGS: 10 412 care home residents aged 65 years and older from 310 LTCFs were included in this analysis. The median participant age was 86 years (IQR 80-91), 7247 (696%) of 10 412 residents were female, and 1155 residents (111%) had evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. 9160 (880%) residents received at least one vaccine dose, of whom 6138 (670%) received ChAdOx1 and 3022 (330%) received BNT162b2. Between Dec 8, 2020, and March 15, 2021, there were 36 352 PCR results in 670 628 person-days, and 1335 PCR-positive infections (713 in unvaccinated residents and 612 in vaccinated residents) were included. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for PCR-positive infection relative to unvaccinated residents declined from 28 days after the first vaccine dose to 044 (95% CI 024-081) at 28-34 days and 038 (019-077) at 35-48 days. Similar effect sizes were seen for ChAdOx1 (adjusted HR 032, 95% CI 015-066) and BNT162b2 (035, 017-071) vaccines at 35-48 days. Mean PCR Ct values were higher for infections that occurred at least 28 days after vaccination than for those occurring before vaccination (313 [SD 87] in 107 PCR-positive tests vs 266 [66] in 552 PCR-positive tests; p<00001). INTERPRETATION: Single-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines provides substantial protection against infection in older adults from 4-7 weeks after vaccination and might reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, the risk of infection is not eliminated, highlighting the ongoing need for non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent transmission in long-term care facilities.

METHODS: The primary outcome was length of hospital stay, defined as the total number of days that patients remained hospitalized from the date of randomization until the date of hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, mortality during hospitalization, number of patients admitted to the intensive care unit, and number of patients who required mechanical ventilation. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04449718. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included in the study. The mean (SD) age was 58.5 (15.6) years, body mass index was 30.8 (8.6) kg/m(2), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 7.8 (1.6) ng/mL. No significant difference was observed in the median interquartile range of length of hospital stay between the vitamin D(3) group (6.0 [4.0-18.0] days) versus placebo (9.5 [6.3-15.5] days) (log-rank p=0.74; hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.53-2.40]; p=0.76).

It Is Therefore A Challenge To Implement Timely And Appropriate Public Health Interventions. Objective: This Study Investigates A Reinforcement Learning Based Approach To Incrementally Learn How Much Intensity Of Each Public Health Intervention Should Be Applied At Each Period In A Given Region. Methods: First We Define The Basic Components Of A Reinforcement Learning (Rl) Set Up (I.E., States, Reward, Actions, And Transition Function), This Represents The Learning Environment For The Agent (I.E., An Ai-Model). Then We Train Our Agent Using Rl In An Online Fashion, Using A Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Known As Reinforce. Finally, A Developed Flow Network, Serving As An Epidemiological Model Is Used To Visualize The Results Of The Decisions Taken By The Agent Given Different Epidemic And Demographic State Scenarios. Main Results: After A Relatively Short Period Of Training, The Agent Starts Taking Reasonable Actions Allowing A Balance Between The Public Health And Economic Considerations. In Order To Test The Developed Tool, We Ran The Rl-Agent On Different Regions (Demographic Scale) And Recorded The Output Policy Which Was Still Consistent With The Training Performance. The Flow Network Used To Visualize The Results Of The Simulation Is Considerably Useful Since It Shows A High Correlation Between The Simulated Results And The Real Case Scenarios.

Model results represent an important part of the information base for the decision process on different administrative levels. The Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) initiated a project whose main goal is to predict COVID-19-specific occupation of beds in intensive care units: Steuerungs-Prognose von Intensivmedizinischen COVID-19 Kapazitaten (SPoCK). The incidence of COVID-19 cases is a crucial predictor for this occupation. Methods: We developed a model based on ordinary differential equations for the COVID-19 spread with a time-dependent infection rate described by a spline. Furthermore, the model explicitly accounts for weekday-specific reporting and adjusts for reporting delay. The model is calibrated in a purely data-driven manner by a maximum likelihood approach. Uncertainties are evaluated using the profile likelihood method. The uncertainty about the appropriate modeling assumptions can be accounted for by including and merging results of different modelling approaches. Results: The model is calibrated based on incident cases on a daily basis and provides daily predictions of incident COVID-19 cases for the upcoming three weeks including uncertainty estimates for Germany and its subregions. Derived quantities such as cumulative counts and 7-day incidences with corresponding uncertainties can be computed. The estimation of the time-dependent infection rate leads to an estimated reproduction factor that is oscillating around one. Data-driven estimation of the dark figure purely from incident cases is not feasible. Conclusions: We successfully implemented a procedure to forecast near future COVID-19 incidences for diverse subregions in Germany which are made available to various decision makers via an interactive web application.

The compound selectively binds to the active state of TG2, forming a stable covalent bond with the cysteine in its catalytic center. The molecule was designed for the treatment of celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune-mediated chronic inflammatory condition of the small intestine affecting about 1C2% of people in Caucasian populations. The autoimmune disease is triggered by dietary gluten. Consumption of staple foods containing wheat, barley, or rye leads to destruction of the small intestinal mucosa in genetically susceptible individuals, and this is accompanied by the generation of characteristic TG2 autoantibodies. TG2 plays a causative role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. Upon activation by Ca(2+), it catalyzes the deamidation of gliadin peptides as well as the crosslinking of gliadin peptides to TG2 itself. These modified biological structures trigger breaking of oral tolerance to gluten, self-tolerance to TG2, and the activation of cytotoxic immune cells in the gut mucosa. Recently, in an exploratory proof-of-concept study, ZED1227 administration clinically validated TG2 as a druggable target in celiac disease.

Recent data suggest that persistent SARS-CoV-2 spike antigenemia may contribute to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). We quantified SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) antigens in blood of pediatric patients with either acute COVID-19 or MIS-C using ultrasensitive immunoassays (Meso Scale Discovery). MethodsPlasma was collected from inpatients (<21 years) enrolled across 15 hospitals in 15 US states. Acute COVID-19 patients (n=36) had a range of disease severity and positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR within 24 hours of blood collection. Patients with MIS-C (n=53) met CDC criteria and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR or serology). Controls were patients pre-COVID-19 (n=67) or within 24h of negative RT-PCR (n=43). ResultsSpecificities of N and S assays were 95-97% and 100%, respectively. In acute COVID-19 patients, N/S plasma assays had 89%/64% sensitivity, respectively; sensitivity in patients with concurrent nasopharyngeal swab cycle threshold (Ct) [] 35 were 93%/63%. Antigen concentrations ranged from 1.28-3,844 pg/mL (N) and 1.65-1,071 pg/mL (S) and correlated with disease severity. In MIS-C, antigens were detected in 3/53 (5.7%) samples (3 N-positive: 1.7, 1.9, 121.1 pg/mL; 1 S-positive: 2.3 pg/mL); the patient with highest N had positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR (Ct 22.3) concurrent with blood draw. ConclusionsUltrasensitive blood SARS-CoV-2 antigen measurement has high diagnostic yield in children with acute COVID-19. Antigens were undetectable in most MIS-C patients, suggesting that persistent antigenemia is not a common contributor to MIS-C pathogenesis.

RESULTS: From September 2020 to February 2021, 21 centers that care for 2690 patients submitted data from 648 COVID-19 tests on 465 patients. Most patients required supportive care only and were treated as outpatients, 16% experienced inpatient care, and 5% experienced intensive care. Allograft complications were rare, with acute kidney injury most common (7%). There was 1 case of respiratory failure and 1 death attributed to COVID-19. Twelve centers that care for 1730 patients submitted complete testing data on 351 patients. The incidence of COVID-19 among patients at these centers was 4%, whereas the incidence among tested patients was 19%. Risk factors to predict a positive COVID-19 test included age > 12 years, symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19.

Methods. We describe our experience evaluating 25 travelers who met the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition for a person under investigation (PUI) for EVD from July 20, 2014 to January 28, 2015. All patients were triaged and evaluated under the guidance of institutional protocols to the emergency department, outpatient tropical medicine clinic, or Emory's Ebola treatment unit. Strict attention to infection control and early involvement of public health authorities guided the safe evaluation of these patients. Results. None were diagnosed with EVD. Respiratory illnesses were common, and 8 (32%) PUI were confirmed to have influenza. Four patients (16%) were diagnosed with potentially life-threatening infections or conditions, including 3 with Plasmodium falciparum malaria and 1 with diabetic ketoacidosis. Conclusions. In addition to preparing for potential patients with EVD, Ebola assessment centers should consider other life-threatening conditions requiring urgent treatment, and travelers to affected countries should be strongly advised to seek pretravel counseling. Furthermore, attention to infection control in all aspects of PUI evaluation is paramount and has presented unique challenges.

The overall household SAR was 37% (95% CI 31-43%) with a mean serial interval of 4.67 days, an R0 of 1.85 and a household reproduction number of 2.33. We find lower secondary attack rates in larger households. SARs were highest when the primary case was a child. We estimate a mean incubation period of around 4.5 days. Conclusions: High rates of household transmission of COVID-19 were found in the UK emphasising the need for preventative measures in this setting. Careful monitoring of schools reopening is needed to monitor transmission from children.","output":"Transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in household and community settings in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human B-cell differentiation has been extensively investigated on genomic and transcriptomic grounds; however, no studies have accomplished so far detailed analysis of antigen-dependent maturation-associated human B-cell populations from a proteomic perspective. Here, we investigate for the first time the quantitative proteomic profiles of B-cells undergoing antigen-dependent maturation using a label-free LC-MS/MS approach applied on 5 purified B-cell subpopulations (naive, centroblasts, centrocytes, memory and plasma B-cells) from human tonsils (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD006191). Our results revealed that the actual differences among these B-cell subpopulations are a combination of expression of a few maturation stage-specific proteins within each B-cell subset and maturation-associated changes in relative protein expression levels, which are related with metabolic regulation. The considerable overlap of the proteome of the 5 studied B-cell subsets strengthens the key role of the regulation of the stoichiometry of molecules associated with metabolic regulation and programming, among other signaling cascades (such as antigen recognition and presentation and cell survival) crucial for the transition between each B-cell maturation stage.","output":"Dynamic Intracellular Metabolic Cell Signaling Profiles During Ag-Dependent B-Cell Differentiation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chitosan is a deacetylated polycationic polysaccharide derived from chitin.

We hypothesized that IL-6 trans-signaling in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) leads to endotheliopathy (a proinflammatory and procoagulant state) and liver injury in COVID-19. METHODS: Coagulopathy, endotheliopathy, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were retrospectively analyzed in a subset (n = 68), followed by a larger cohort (n = 3,780) of patients with COVID-19. Liver histology from 43 patients with COVID-19 was analyzed for endotheliopathy and its relationship to liver injury. Primary human LSECs were used to establish the IL-6 trans-signaling mechanism. RESULTS: Factor VIII, fibrinogen, D-dimer, von Willebrand factor (vWF) activity/antigen (biomarkers of coagulopathy/endotheliopathy) were significantly elevated in patients with COVID-19 and liver injury (elevated ALT). IL-6 positively correlated with vWF antigen (p = 0.02), factor VIII activity (p = 0.02), and D-dimer (p <0.0001). On liver histology, patients with COVID-19 and elevated ALT had significantly increased vWF and platelet staining, supporting a link between liver injury, coagulopathy, and endotheliopathy. Intralobular neutrophils positively correlated with platelet (p <0.0001) and vWF (p <0.01) staining, and IL-6 levels positively correlated with vWF staining (p <0.01). IL-6 trans-signaling leads to increased expression of procoagulant (factor VIII, vWF) and proinflammatory factors, increased cell surface vWF (p <0.01), and increased platelet attachment in LSECs. These effects were blocked by soluble glycoprotein 130 (IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitor), the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, and STAT1/3 small-interfering RNA knockdown. Hepatocyte fibrinogen expression was increased by the supernatant of LSECs subjected to IL-6 trans-signaling. CONCLUSION: IL-6 trans-signaling drives the coagulopathy and hepatic endotheliopathy associated with COVID-19 and could be a possible mechanism behind liver injury in these patients. LAY SUMMARY: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection often have liver injury, but why this occurs remains unknown. High levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its circulating receptor, which form a complex to induce inflammatory signals, have been observed in patients with COVID-19. This paper demonstrates that the IL-6 signaling complex causes harmful changes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and may promote blood clotting and contribute to liver injury.","output":"Liver injury in COVID-19 and IL-6 trans-signaling-induced endotheliopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. So far, viral targets of cellular immunity and factors determining successful mounting of T-cell responses are poorly defined. We therefore analyzed cellular responses to membrane, nucleocapsid and spike protein in individuals suffering from moderate or severe infection and after recovery from mild disease. We demonstrate that the CoV-2 specific CD4+ T-helper cell response is directed against all three proteins with comparable magnitude, ex vivo proliferation and portions of responding patients. However, deceased individuals were more frequently amongst non-responders. Higher patient age and comorbidity index correlated with increased frequencies of CoV-2 specific CD4+ T-cells, harboring higher portions of IL-2-, but lower portions of IFN?3 secreting cells. Diminished frequencies of membrane protein reactive IFN?3+ T cells were particularly associated with higher Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II scores in patients admitted to intensive care. CoV-2 specific T cells exhibited elevated PD-1 expression in active patients as compared to recovered individuals with previous mild disease. In summary, our data suggest a link between individual patient predisposition with respect to age and comorbidity and impairment of CoV-2 specific Th1-type cellular immunity, thereby supporting a concept of altered T-cell function in patients at risk.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses and correlations with COVID-19 patient predisposition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To explore the perioperative management and infection prevention methods for acute eye diseases during the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Methods Since the COVID-19 was included in the Class B infectious diseases and was managed according to Class A infectious diseases in China, 127 patients who underwent ophthalmic surgery were enrolled at First Affiliated Hospital of Army Military Medical University from January 21 to February 19,2020 The perioperative management according to the national epidemic prevention and control requirements was summarized, and the perioperative clinical management that should be taken during the epidemic prevention period were discussed Results One hundred and twenty-seven patients underwent ophthalmic surgeries, including emergency surgery, daytime surgery and other surgeries for sight-threatening diseases The methods of anesthesia included general anesthesia, local anesthesia and ocular superficial anesthesia According to the national epidemic prevention and control requirements, epidemic screening for these patients and infectious managing measures were performed during the perioperative period, including the sterilization of relevant environment and equipments, the personal medical prevention and protection for medical staffs and patients, which made surealltheoperationswent smoothlyand safely There were no 2019-nCoV infection, surgical-relative infection, crossing infection and operation-related complications occurred Meanwhile, there were not COVID-19-related infection events of medical staffs The air sampling compliance rate in the operating room, ward, examination and other areas was 100% Conclusions During the prevention and control period of the epidemic of COVID-19, strict adherence to the prevention and control measures can effectively ensure the smooth implementation of the operation and the perioperative safety of medical staff and patients","output":"Management of ophthalmic perioperative period during 2019 novel coronavirus disease outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical trials attempts to improve design and analysis in order to reduce the experimental burden, providing more rapid and valid answers, are common, especially in rare or pediatric diseases, or in the setting of an emerging disease such as COVID-19 One promising though underused approach is to increase the information by borrowing external data on control and/or on treatment effect, which is almost always available However, the objectives and extent of use of such external data differ widely across studies They may be dedicated to extrapolate from different populations (from adults to children, across geographic regions, etc ) or treatments They may adaptively apply during an ongoing trial or be only used at the time of analysis of a trial after study enrollment is closed They can use only outcome data from a historical control group for either a complete or partial replacement of the current control arm, or focusing on estimated treatment benefit from a whole historical sample They make various assumptions regarding the exchangeability or commensality of the historical and current populations, with various diagnostics for checking those assumptions Finally, they use either a frequentist or Bayesian inference, based on aggregated data or requiring individual patient data (IPD) Notably, borrowing of external data often uses Bayesian approaches, by modelling external information into a prior, with increasing complexity to face heterogeneity across populations Similar frequentist methods based on weighted tests or joint models, have also been proposed, as well as hierarchical models, either Bayesian or frequentist, similar to a meta-analysis setting Last, methods based on propensity scores and those based on matching-adjusted indirect comparisons could also been used, depending on the availability of IPD We aim to provide some comparison of the competing approaches for incorporating historical data into a contemporary trial Data from randomized clinical trials performed in patients with COVID-19 will serve as illustrative examples","output":"Challenges of using historical data in clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the experience of Italian nurses engaged in caring for patients with COVID\\\\19.

The primary exposure was RAASi at hospital discharge and the primary endpoint was recurrent AKI within 12 months. Cox proportional hazards models were fit on a propensity score-weighted cohort to compare time to recurrent AKI and mortality by RAASi exposure. Among 96,983 patients, 40% were on RAASi at discharge.

No differences in recurrent AKI risk was observed for non-users started or not on RAASi compared to prevalent users who continued RAASi. Subgroup analyses among those with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and malignancy were similar with exception of a modest reduction in recurrent AKI risk among RAASi discontinuers with chronic kidney disease. Thus, RAASi use among survivors of moderate to severe AKI was associated with little to no difference in risk for recurrent AKI but was associated with improved survival.

Amplification of cDNA from every sample can be verified using Bioanalyzer. This step not only reveals cDNA amplification but also provides greater precision for pooling equal concentrations of cDNA from different samples. A single pooled cDNA library is made suitable for sequencing on Illumina sequencers using a tagmentation kit.

We observed that the thrombus area and weight were decreased and that NET formation in the thrombi was reduced in the group treated with the selective C5aR1 receptor inhibitor PMX53 compared with the NaCl group. In vitro, NETosis was observed when C5a was added to neutrophil cultures, and this effect was reversed by PMX53. In addition, our data showed that C5a increased the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that the promotion of NET formation by C5a was mitochondrial ROS (Mito-ROS) dependent.

However, multiple invasion-related genes with complementary and overlapping functions afford the parasite the plasticity to vary ligands used for invasion, leading to phenotypic variation and immune evasion. Overcoming the challenge posed by redundant ligands requires a deeper understanding of conditions that select for variant phenotypes and the molecular mediators. While host factors including receptor heterogeneity and acquired immune responses may drive parasite phenotypic variation, we have previously shown that host-independent changes in invasion phenotype can be achieved by continuous culturing of the W2mef and Dd2 P. falciparum strains in moving suspension as opposed to static conditions. Here, we have used a highly biologically replicated whole transcriptome sequencing approach to identify the molecular signatures of variation associated with the phenotype switch. The data show increased expression of particular invasion-related genes in switched parasites, as well as a large number of genes encoding proteins that are either exported or form part of the export machinery. The genes with most markedly increased expression included members of the erythrocyte binding antigens (EBA), reticulocyte binding homologues (RH), surface associated interspersed proteins (SURFIN), exported protein family 1 (EPF1) and Plasmodium Helical Interspersed Sub-Telomeric (PHIST) gene families. The data indicate changes in expression of a repertoire of genes not previously associated with erythrocyte invasion phenotypes, suggesting the possibility that moving suspension culture may also select for other traits.","output":"Investigating a Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte invasion phenotype switch at the whole transcriptome level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH) is characterized by elevated pulmonary artery resistance and vascular remodeling. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is reported to be involved in HPH, but the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. We found that Xbp1s, a potent transcription factor during ERS, was elevated in hypoxic-cultured rat PASMCs and lung tissues from HPH rats. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that overexpressing Xbp1s can promote proliferation, cell viability, and migration and inhibit the apoptosis of PASMCs, while silencing Xbp1s led to the opposite. Through data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry, we identified extensive proteomic alterations regulated by hypoxia and Xbp1s. Further validation revealed that p-JNK, rather than p-ERK or p-p38, was the downstream effector of Xbp1s. p-JNK inhibition reversed the biological effects of Xbp1s overexpression in vitro. In the animal HPH model, rats were randomly assigned to five groups: normoxia, hypoxia, hypoxia+AAV-CTL (control), hypoxia+AAV-Xbp1s (prevention), and hypoxia+AAV-Xbp1s (therapy). Adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 1-mediated Xbp1s knockdown in the prevention and therapy groups significantly reduced right ventricular systolic pressure, total pulmonary resistance, right ventricular hypertrophy, and the medial wall thickness of muscularized distal pulmonary arterioles; AAV-Xbp1s also decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and increased apoptosis in pulmonary arterioles. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that the Xbp1s-p-JNK pathway is important in hypoxic vascular remodeling and that targeting this pathway could be an effective strategy to prevent and alleviate HPH development.","output":"Proteomic analysis reveals that Xbp1s promotes hypoxic pulmonary hypertension through the p-JNK MAPK pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study documents student engagement in face-to-face low-tech active learning and student perceptions of emergency remote instruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic in introductory biomechanics.

METHODS CNN, widely applied in medical image classification, was used for bone scintigraphy image classification. The retrospective study included 778 sequential male patients who underwent whole-body bone scans. A nuclear medicine physician classified all the cases into 3 categories: (1) normal, (2) malignant, and (3) degenerative, which were used as the gold standard. RESULTS An efficient CNN architecture was built, based on CNN exploration performance, achieving high prediction accuracy. The results showed that the method is sufficiently precise when it comes to differentiating a bone metastasis from other either degenerative changes or normal tissue (overall classification accuracy = 91.42%  1.64%). To strengthen the outcomes of this study the authors further compared the best performing CNN method to other popular CNN architectures for medical imaging, like ResNet50, VGG16 and GoogleNet, as reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS The prediction results reveal the efficacy of the proposed CNN-based approach and its ability for an easier and more precise interpretation of whole-body images in bone metastasis diagnosis for prostate cancer patients in nuclear medicine.

Yet, only 20% of biopsied amorphous calcifications are cancer. We present a quantitative approach for distinguishing between benign and actionable (high-risk and malignant) amorphous calcifications using a combination of local textures, global spatial relationships, and interpretable handcrafted expert features. METHOD: Our approach was trained and validated on a set of 168 2D full-field digital mammography exams (248 images) from 168 patients. Within these 248 images, we identified 276 image regions with segmented amorphous calcifications and a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis. A set of local (radiomic and region measurements) and global features (distribution and expert-defined) were extracted from each image. Local features were grouped using an unsupervised k-means clustering algorithm. All global features were concatenated with clustered local features and used to train a LightGBM classifier to distinguish benign from actionable cases. RESULTS: On the held-out test set of 60 images, our approach achieved a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 35%, and a positive predictive value of 38% when the decision threshold was set to 0.4. Given that all of the images in our test set resulted in a recommendation of a biopsy, the use of our algorithm would have identified 15 images (25%) that were benign, potentially reducing the number of breast biopsies.

A number of institutions have developed a COVID-free pathway for elective surgery patients in order to minimize the risk of viral transmission. The aim of this study is to identify the perioperative viral transmission rate in elective orthopaedic patients following the restart of elective surgery. Methods: This is a prospective study of 121 patients who underwent elective orthopaedic procedures through a COVID-free pathway. All patients underwent a 14-day period of self-isolation, had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of surgery, and underwent surgery at a COVID-free site. Baseline patient characteristics were recorded including age, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade, body mass index (BMI), procedure, and admission type. Patients were contacted 14 days following discharge to determine if they had had a positive COVID-19 test (COVID-confirmed) or developed symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (COVID-19-presumed). Results: The study included 74 females (61.2%) and 47 males (38.8%) with a mean age of 52.3 years  17.6 years (18 to 83 years). The ASA grade was grade I in 26 patients (21.5%), grade II in 70 patients (57.9%), grade III in 24 patients (19.8%), and grade IV in one patient (0.8%). A total of 18 patients (14.9%) had underlying cardiovascular disease, 17 (14.0%) had pulmonary disease, and eight (6.6%) had diabetes mellitus. No patients (0%) had a positive COVID-19 test in the postoperative period. One patient (0.8%) developed anosmia postoperatively without respiratory symptoms or a fever. The patient did not undergo a COVID-19 test and self-isolated for seven days. Her symptoms resolved within a few days. Conclusion: The development of a COVID-free pathway for elective orthopaedic patients results in very low viral transmission rates.

These variants of concern (VOC) are known for increased transmissibility and can also be responsible for avoiding immune responses. The gold standard to detect VOC is sequencing, however routine genomic surveillance in resource-limited countries like Pakistan is not always readily available. The inadvertent detection of the B.1.1.7 (United Kingdom) VOC by a target failure due to the key deletion in spike 69-70 by commercially available PCR assay helps to understand target failures as an alternative approach to detect variants. In pursuit of VOC it was further discovered that a deletion in the ORF1a gene (ORF1a 3675-3677) is common in B.1.1.7, B.1.351 (South African), and P.1 (Brazilian) VOC. The Real-Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay can distinguish target failures and can discriminate SARS-CoV-2 VOC. The study uses positive samples archived in respective labs.

This is a multicenter cross-sectional, prospective survey study. Questionnaires with multiple-choice and open-ended questions focusing on unit infrastructure, personnel, policies, limited patient data, and practices related to GBC for families and health care professionals (HCPs) were completed by on-site researchers, who were HCPs on the direct care of patients. PICU fulfillment of GBC goals was evaluated using a custom scoring based on indicators developed by the Initiative for Pediatric Palliative Care (IPPC). We compared average total and individual items fulfillment scores according to the respective country's World Bank income. Patient characteristics and details of unit infrastructure were also evaluated as potential predictors of total GBC fulfillment scores. Statistical analysis included multilevel generalized linear models (GLM) with a Gaussian distribution adjusted by child age/gender and clustering by center, using high income countries (HICs) as the comparative reference. Additionally, we applied principals of content analysis to analyze and summarize open-ended answers to contextualize qualitative data. The study included 34 PICUs from 18 countries: high-income countries (HICs): 32.4%, upper middle-income countries (UMICs): 44.1%, low middle-income and low-income countries (LMI/LICs): 23.5%. All groups reported some compliance with GBC goals; no group reported perfect fulfillment. We found statistically significant differences in GBC fulfillment scores between HICs and UMICs (specifically, HCP grief support), and between HICs and LMICs (specifically, family grief support and HCP grief support). PICUs world-wide provide some GBC, independent of income, but barriers include lack of financial support, time, and training, overall unit culture, presence of a palliative care consultation service, and varying cultural perceptions of child death. Disparities in GBC for families and HCPs exist and were related to the native countries' income level. Identifying barriers to support families and HCPs, can lead to opportunities of improving GBC in PICUs world-wide.","output":"Availability and Quality of Grief and Bereavement Care in Pediatric Intensive Care Units Around the World, Opportunities for Improvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reports of neuro-ophthalmological manifestations and complications in patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) are still scarce.

Since then, EUA with relaxed regulations were granted to numerous manufacturers and clinical microbiology laboratories to implement in-house testing assays with nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) and subsequently additional specimen types. Because of supply chain shortages leading to competition for reagents, sustaining any significant volume of testing soon became problematic. As a countermeasure, within several weeks the Henry Ford Microbiology Laboratory validated 4 different rtPCR assays and multiple specimen types using NeuMoDX, Diasorin Simplexa, Cepheid and Roche platforms. The purpose of this study was to analyze the analytic sensitivity of these rtPCR assays with NP/nasal swabs and sputum/tracheal aspirates. Qualitative analytic agreement between the 4 platforms for NP/nasal swabs ranged 95% - 100% overall with no statistically significant difference in threshold cT values. Similar results were obtained with the sputum/tracheal aspirates. These data demonstrate the high accuracy and reproducibility in detection of SARS-CoV 2 between the rtPCR assays performed on 4 different platforms with numerous specimen types.","output":"Comparison of the NeuMoDX, Diasorin Simplexa, Cepheid and Roche CDC SARS-CoV 2 EUA assays using nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs in universal transport media (UTM) and sputum and tracheal aspirates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Concerns about potential diagnostic delays due to pandemic-related disruptions were expressed early during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the present study, we investigated the impact of the Swiss COVID-19 lockdown between March and June 2020 on newly diagnosed melanomas. Our main findings include a short-term rise in melanoma diagnoses after the major lift of social lockdown restrictions. Further, the analyzed prognostic factor for melanomas, the Breslow thickness, was greater in elderly female patients during the lockdown compared to the pre- and post-lockdown period. In addition, proportionally more stage IV melanomas were diagnosed during the lockdown period. Our study highlights the need for an adjusted management of cancer patients in future pandemic management strategies. ABSTRACT: At the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, Switzerland was among the countries with the highest number of SARS-CoV2-infections per capita in the world. Lockdowns had a remarkable impact on primary care access and resulted in postponed cancer screenings. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on the diagnosis of melanomas and stage of melanomas at diagnosis. In this retrospective, exploratory cohort study, 1240 patients with a new diagnosis of melanoma were analyzed at five tertiary care hospitals in German-speaking Switzerland over a period of two years and three months. We compared the pre-lockdown (01/FEB/19C15/MAR/20, n = 655) with the lockdown (16/MAR/20C22/JUN/20, n = 148) and post-lockdown period (23/JUN/20C30/APR/21, n = 437) by evaluating patients demographics and prognostic features using Breslow thickness, ulceration, subtype, and stages. We observed a short-term, two-week rise in melanoma diagnoses after the major lift of social lockdown restrictions. The difference of mean Breslow thicknesses was significantly greater in older females during the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown (1.9  1.3 mm, p = 0.03) and post-lockdown period (1.9  1.3 mm, p = 0.048). Thickness increase was driven by nodular melanomas (2.9  1.3 mm, p = 0.0021; resp. 2.6  1.3 mm, p = 0.008). A proportional rise of advanced melanomas was observed during lockdown (p = 0.047). The findings provide clinically relevant insights into lockdown-related gender- and age-dependent effects on melanoma diagnosis. Our data highlight a stable course in new melanomas with a lower-than-expected increase in the post-lockdown period. The lockdown period led to a greater thickness in elderly women driven by nodular melanomas and a proportional shift towards stage IV melanoma. We intend to raise awareness for individual cancer care in future pandemic management strategies.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 Lockdown on Melanoma Diagnosis in Switzerland: Increased Tumor Thickness in Elderly Females and Shift towards Stage IV Melanoma during Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To reduce the spread of the virus, authorities have imposed restrictive measures, such as limiting movement of individuals, shutting down non-essential stores, imposing a general or local quarantine, along with physical distancing and isolation of vulnerable people. Remote working has become the new normal for many organizations, engendering further challenges for employees, who have started experiencing anxiety, technostress caused by digitalization and lack of social interaction, frustration, occupational burden, counterproductive work behavior, exhaustion, burnout, depersonalization, and increased turnover intention. All these factors, corroborated by prolonged restrictions, have contributed to a decrease in employee satisfaction, diminishing performance and generating a counterproductive behavior. Based on Social Exchange Theory, this research plans to investigate the influence of internal marketing on job satisfaction, task performance, and counterproductive work behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in an emerging market, namely Romania. Based on a quantitative research study among 850 employees, we show that internal marketing strongly and significantly impacts job satisfaction, while insignificantly impacting task performance and counterproductive work behavior. Job satisfaction actuates task performance in a significant and positive manner, contributing to a reduction in counterproductive work behaviors.

RESULTS: Overall, the 28-day mortality of patients with comorbid CVD was 3.25 times of that of patients without comorbid CVD (40.63% vs 12.50%, P=0.011). Clinic symptoms on admission were similar for the two groups. However, patients with comorbid CVD had higher levels of Interleukin-10 (22.22% vs 0%, P=0.034), procalcitonin (22.6% vs 3.13%, P<0.001), high-sensitivity troponin I (20 pg/mL vs 16.05 pg/mL, P=0.019), and lactic dehydrogenase (437 U/L vs 310 U/L, P=0.015).

A recent meta-analysis comparing the use of closed-incision negative-pressure therapy to standard dressings found a statistically significant reduction in surgical-site infection. The use of closed-incision negative-pressure therapy is gaining acceptance in this population; however, the economic impact of this innovative dressing remains unknown. In this study, a cost-utility analysis was performed assessing closed-incision negative-pressure therapy and standard dressings following closure of abdominal incisions in high-risk patients. METHODS Cost-utility methodology involved reviewing literature related to closed-incision negative-pressure therapy in abdominal wall surgery, obtaining utility estimates to calculate quality-adjusted life-year scores for successful surgery and surgery complicated by surgical-site infection, summing costs using Medicare Current Procedural Terminology codes, and creating a decision tree illuminating the most cost-effective dressing strategy. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS The aforementioned meta-analysis comparing closed-incision negative-pressure therapy to standard dressings included a subset of five studies assessing abdominal wall surgery in 829 patients (260 closed-incision negative-pressure therapy and 569 standard dressings). Decision tree analysis revealed an estimated savings of $1546.52 and a gain of 0.0024 quality-adjusted life-year with closed-incision negative-pressure therapy compared with standard dressings; therefore, closed-incision negative-pressure therapy is a dominant treatment strategy. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that closed-incision negative-pressure therapy is a cost-effective option when the surgical-site infection rate is greater than 16.39 percent.

Using a population-based stroke registry, we investigated the impact of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in stroke admissions in Joinville, Brazil. METHODS: Patients admitted after the onset of COVID-19 restrictions in the city (defined as March 17, 2020) were compared with those admitted in 2019. We analyzed differences between stroke incidence, types, severity, reperfusion therapies, and time from stroke onset to admission. Statistical tests were also performed to compare the 30 days before and after COVID-19 to the same period in 2019. RESULTS: We observed a decrease in total stroke admissions from an average of 12.9/100 000 per month in 2019 to 8.3 after COVID-19 (P=0.0029). When compared with the same period in 2019, there was a 36.4% reduction in stroke admissions. There was no difference in admissions for severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score >8), intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: The onset of COVID-19 was correlated with a reduction in admissions for transient, mild, and moderate strokes.

Hence, the Tele-Exercise and Multiple Sclerosis (TEAMS) study aims to provide patient-centered, coordinated care by implementing a 12-week complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) intervention for adults with MS. However, due to the societal impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in mid-March 2020, the University of Alabama at Birmingham announced a limited business model halting all nonessential research requiring on-site visits, which includes the TEAMS study. OBJECTIVE: In compliance with the shelter-in-place policy and quarantine guidance, a modified testing and training protocol was developed to allow participants to continue the study. METHODS: The modified protocol, which replaces on-site data collection and training procedures, includes a teleassessment package (computer tablet, blood pressure cuff, hand dynamometer, mini disc cone, measuring tape, an 8\\" step, and a large-print 8\\"  11\\" paper with ruler metrics and wall-safe tape) and a virtual meeting platform for synchronous interactive training between the therapist and the participant. The teleassessment measures include resting blood pressure and heart rate, grip strength, Five Times Sit to Stand, Timed Up & Go, and the Berg Balance Scale. The teletraining component includes 20 sessions of synchronous training sessions of dual tasking, yoga, and Pilates exercises designed and customized for a range of functional levels. Teletraining lasts 12 weeks and participants are instructed to continue exercising for a posttraining period of 9 months. RESULTS: The protocol modifications were supported with supplemental funding (from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute) and approved by the University Institutional Review Board for Human Use. At the time nonessential research visits were halted by the university, there were 759 people enrolled and baseline tested, accounting for 92.5% of our baseline testing completion target (N=820). Specifically, 325 participants completed the 12-week intervention and follow-up testing visits, and 289 participants needed to complete either the intervention or follow-up assessments.

The regulatory scheme imposed differential controls on access to eating places, schools, houses of worship, large gatherings and other businesses within the three zones, but without restrictions on mobility. Within the central red zone, COVID-19 incidence temporarily declined from 131.2 per 100,000 population during the week ending October 3 to 62.5 per 100,000 by the week ending October 31, but then rebounded to 153.6 per 100,000 by the week ending November 28.

Then, a strict quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was performed on several exposure scenarios associated with occupational health risks of temporary entrants (researchers, visitors, and inspectors) and staffs (field engineer and laboratory technician). RESULTS: Although the bioaerosol concentrations were generally regarded as safe according to existing standards, these bioaerosols health risks were still unacceptable. The microbial bioaerosols posed considerable infection health risks in WWTPs. These risks were generally above the WHO and US EPA benchmarks. The health risks of females were always smaller than those of male of grown-up age group.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence, longitudinal course and mortality-risk of WTD in community-dwelling older people. DESIGN: Observational study with 6-year follow-up. SETTING: The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a nationally representative cohort of older adults. SUBJECTS: In total, 8,174 community-dwelling adults aged 50 years. METHODS: To define WTD, participants were asked: In the last month, have you felt that you would rather be dead? Depressive symptoms were measured using the CES-D. Mortality data were compiled by linking administrative death records to individual-level survey data from the study. RESULTS: At Wave 1, 3.5% of participants (279/8,174) reported WTD. Both persistent loneliness (OR 5.73 (95% CI 3.41C9.64)) and depressive symptoms (OR 6.12 (95% CI 4.33C8.67)) were independently associated with WTD. Of participants who first reported WTD at Wave 1 or 2, 72% did not report WTD when reassessed after 2 years, and the prevalence of depressive symptoms (?44%) and loneliness (?19%) was more likely to decline in this group at follow-up. Fifteen per cent of participants expressing WTD at Wave 1 died during a 6-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: WTD amongst community-dwelling older people is frequently transient and is strongly linked with the course of depressive symptoms and loneliness.

To address this gap, our team organized a multi-country, cross-sectional online survey as part of a global consortium. METHODS: Consortium research teams conducted online surveys in 30 countries. Sampling methods included convenience, online panels, and population-representative. Primary outcomes included sexual behaviors, partner violence, and SRH service utilization, and we compared three months prior to and during policy measures to mitigate COVID-19. We conducted meta-analyses for primary outcomes and graded the certainty of the evidence using Cochrane methods. RESULTS: Among 4546 respondents with casual partners, condom use stayed the same for 3374 (74.4%) people and 640 (14.1%) people reported a decline. Fewer respondents reported physical or sexual partner violence during COVID-19 measures (1063/15144, 7.0%) compared to the period before COVID-19 measures (1469/15887, 9.3%). COVID-19 measures impeded access to condoms (933/10790, 8.7%), contraceptives (610/8175, 7.5%), and HIV/STI testing (750/1965, 30.7%).

There are several studies that investigating the influencing factors on distribution of COVID-19 in China. However, more influencing factors need to be considered to improve our understanding about the current epidemic. Moreover, in the absence of effective medicine or vaccine, the Chinese government introduced a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). However, assessing and predicting the effectiveness of these interventions requires further study. In this paper, we used statistical techniques, correlation analysis and GIS mapping expression method to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and the influencing factors of the COVID-19 in mainland China. The results showed that the spread of outbreaks in Chinas non-Hubei provinces can be divided into five stages. Stage I is the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak; in stage II the new peak of the epidemic was observed; in stage III the outbreak was contained and new cases decreased; there was a rebound in stage IV, and stage V led to level off. Moreover, the cumulative confirmed cases were mainly concentrated in the southeastern part of China, and the epidemic in the cities with large population flows from Wuhan was more serious. In addition, statistically significant correlations were found between the prevalence of the epidemic and the temperature, rainfall and relative humidity. To evaluate the NPIs, we simulated the prevalence of the COVID-19 based on an improved SIR model and under different prevention intensity.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging derived vascular permeability parameters, including the volume transfer constant, the volume of extravascular extracellular space, and the flux rate constant between the extravascular extracellular space and plasma, for the differentiation of primary CNS lymphoma and glioblastoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty glioblastomas and 11 primary central nervous system lymphomas were included. Pretreatment T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging with a 3D T1-weighted spoiled gradient-echo sequence was performed on a 3T MR imaging scanner. Perfusion parameters (volume transfer constant, the volume of extravascular extracellular space, and the flux rate constant) were measured on the basis of the Tofts-Kernmode model. The Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to compare those parameters between primary central nervous system lymphoma and glioblastoma. Histopathologic correlation of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging findings was performed by using reticulin staining and CD31 immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Median volume transfer constant and flux rate constant values were significantly higher in primary central nervous system lymphoma (0.145  0.057 and 0.396  0.088) than in glioblastoma (0.064  0.021 and 0.230  0.058) (P < .001, respectively). Median volume of extravascular extracellular space values did not differ significantly between primary central nervous system lymphoma (0.434  0.165) and glioblastoma (0.319  0.107). On receiver operating characteristic analysis, volume transfer constant had the best discriminative value for differentiating primary central nervous system lymphoma and glioblastoma (threshold, 0.093; sensitivity, 90.9%; specificity, 95.0%). Histopathologic evaluation revealed intact vascular integrity in glioblastoma despite endothelial proliferation, whereas primary central nervous system lymphoma demonstrated destroyed vessel architecture, thereby promoting vascular disintegrity. CONCLUSIONS Primary central nervous system lymphoma demonstrated significantly higher volume transfer constant and flux rate constant values compared with glioblastoma, implying a higher vascular permeability in primary central nervous system lymphoma. These findings confirm initial observations from perfusion CT and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging studies, correlating with underlying histopathologic features, and may be useful in distinguishing primary central nervous system lymphoma from glioblastoma.","output":"Evaluation of microvascular permeability with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for the differentiation of primary CNS lymphoma and glioblastoma: radiologic-pathologic correlation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus in addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that causes severe respiratory syndrome in humans.

Methods We designed this observational study to emulate a target trial of COVID-19 vaccination by BNT162b2 versus mRNA-1273 among persons who underwent vaccination in the national U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system from 11/12/2020 to 25/03/2021 using combined VA and Medicare electronic health records. We identified the best matching mRNA-1273 recipient(s) for each BNT162b2 recipient, using exact/coarsened-exact matching (calendar week, VA integrated service network, age buckets and Charlson comorbidity index buckets) followed by propensity score matching. Vaccine recipients were followed from the date of first vaccine dose until 25/08/2021 for the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization or SARS-CoV-2-related death. Findings Each group included 902,235 well-matched vaccine recipients, followed for a mean of 192 days, during which 16,890 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 3591 SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations and 381 SARS-CoV-2-related deaths were documented. Compared to BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 recipients had significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.736, 95% CI 0.696C0.779) and SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization (aHR 0.633, 95% CI 0.562C0.713), which persisted across all age groups, comorbidity burden categories and black/white race. The differences between mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 in risk of infection or hospitalization were progressively greater when the follow-up period was longer, i.e. extending to March 31, June 30 or August 25, 2021. These differences were more pronounced when we analyzed separately the outcomes that occurred during the follow-up period from July 1 to August 25, 2021 when the Delta variant became predominant in the U.S. (aHR for infection 0.584, 95% CI 0.533C0.639 and aHR for hospitalization 0.387, 95% 0.311C0.482). SARS-CoV-2-related deaths were less common in mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 recipients (168 versus 213) but this difference was not statistically significant (aHR 0.808, 95% CI 0.592C1.103). Interpretation In conclusion, although absolute rates of infection, hospitalization and death in both vaccine groups were low regardless of the vaccine received, our data suggests that compared to BNT162b2, vaccination with mRNA-1273 resulted in significantly lower rates of SARS-CoV-2-infection and SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization. These differences were greater with longer follow-up time since vaccination and even more pronounced in the Delta variant era.

The continuous emergence of new IBV genotypes and lack of cross protection among different IBV genotypes have been an important challenge. Although live attenuated IB vaccines remarkably induce potent immune response, the potential risk of reversion to virulence, neutralization by the maternal antibodies, and recombination and mutation events are important concern on their usage. On the other hand, inactivated vaccines induce a weaker immune response and may require multiple dosing and/or the use of adjuvants that probably have potential safety risks and increased economic burdens. Consequently, alternative IB vaccines are widely sought. Recent advances in recombinant DNA technology have resulted in experimental IB vaccines that show promise in antibody and T-cells responses, comparable to live attenuated vaccines. Recombinant DNA vaccines have also been enhanced to target multiple serotypes and their efficacy has been improved using delivery vectors, nanoadjuvants, and in ovo vaccination approaches. Although most recombinant IB DNA vaccines are yet to be licensed, it is expected that these types of vaccines may hold sway as future vaccines for inducing a cross protection against multiple IBV serotypes.","output":"Progress and Challenges toward the Development of Vaccines against Avian Infectious Bronchitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is already widely known that the COVID-19 pandemic has added a heavy burden to the health care system in different parts of the world.

Such heterogeneity is thought to be dynamic, shifting over periods of minutes to hours in response to signaling inputs from the tumor microenvironment. However, models of this process have been inferred from indirect or post-hoc measurements of cell state, leaving the temporal details of signaling-driven heterogeneity undefined. Here, we developed a live-cell model system in which microenvironment-driven signaling dynamics can be directly observed and linked to variation in gene expression. Our analysis reveals that paracrine signaling between two cell types is sufficient to drive continual diversification of gene expression programs. This diversification emerges from systems-level properties of the EGFR-RAS-ERK signaling cascade, including intracellular amplification of amphiregulin-mediated paracrine signals and differential kinetic filtering by target genes including Fra-1, c-Myc, and Egr1. Our data enable more precise modeling of paracrine-driven transcriptional variation as a generator of gene expression heterogeneity.

Main outcome measures Infection spreading velocity according to viral mutation load and to climate region. Results The mean doubling time of COVID-19 was 6.63 days in northern Italy, 5.87 days in central areas, and 5.38 days in southern Italy, with shorter COVID-19 doubling time in warmer regions. Spain extended this trend, with a mean COVID-19 doubling time of 4.2 days.

The impact of telehealth on patient satisfaction during the current pandemic is yet to be fully understood. Objective: This study aimed to identify patient perspectives and behaviors toward virtual primary care appointments at a telehealth-na?ve institution during the COVID-19 pandemic and establish the rate of missed appointments to help guide future implementation of telehealth services. Methods: Patients at a primary and specialty care clinic, seen between March and May 2020, completed a survey analyzing nine commonly used satisfaction metrics. The rate of missed appointments was recorded and compared with analogous cohorts of in-person office visits. Results: The no-show rate of telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic was 7.5% (14/186), lower than both the no-show rate of 36.1% for in-office visits (56/155) (p < 0.0001) and a pre-pandemic in-office no-show rate of 29.8% (129/433) (p < 0.0001). Surveyed patients who experienced telehealth visits (n = 65) had similar satisfaction compared with those surveyed who attended in-office visits (n = 36) in seven of nine metrics. No statistically significant differences were identified in the satisfaction metrics with telehealth visits performed on video (n = 26) versus the phone-only format (n = 38). Patients aged 65 years or over were less likely to have a video component to their virtual visit (1/12, 8.3%) than those under age 65 (25/44, 56.8%) (p = 0.0031).

This study aimed to estimate CKD burden and risk-attributable burden in LMICs from 1990 to 2019. METHODS: Data were collected from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019, which measure CKD burden using the years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and calculate percentage contributions of risk factors to age-standardized CKD DALY using population attributable fraction (PAF) from 1990 to 2019. Trends of disease burden between 1990 and 2019 were evaluated using average annual percent change (AAPC). The 95% uncertainty interval (UI) were calculated and reported for YLDs, YLLs, DALYs and PAF. RESULTS: In 2019, LICs had the highest age-standardized DALY rate at 692.25 per 100,000 people (95%UI: 605.14 to 785.67), followed by Lower MICs (684.72% (95%UI: 623.56 to 746.12)), Upper MICs (447.55% (95%UI: 405.38 to 493.01)). The age-standardized YLL rate was much higher than the YLD rate in various income regions. From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized DALY rate showed a 13.70% reduction in LICs (AAPC = -0.5, 95%UI: ? 0.6 to ? 0.5, P < 0.001), 3.72% increment in Lower MICs (AAPC = 0.2, 95%UI: 0.0 to 0.3, P < 0.05). Age-standardized YLD rate was higher in females than in males, whereas age-standardized rates of YLL and DALY of CKD were all higher in males than in females in globally and LMICs. Additionally, the YLD, YLL and DALY rates of CKD increased with age, which were higher in aged70 years in various income regions. In 2019, high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index remained the major causes attributable age-standardized CKD DALY. From 1990 to 2019, there were upward trends in the PAF of age-standardized DALY contributions of high fasting plasma glucose, high systolic blood pressure, and high body-mass index in Global, LICs, Lower MICs and Upper MICs. The greatest increase in the PAF was high body-mass index, especially in Lower MICs (AAPC = 2.7, 95%UI: 2.7 to 2.8, P < 0.001). The PAF of age-standardized DALY for high systolic blood pressure increased the most in Upper MICs (AAPC = 0.6, 95%UI: 0.6 to 0.7, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CKD burden remains high in various income regions, especially in LICs and Lower MICs. More effective and targeted preventive policies and interventions aimed at mitigating preventable CKD burden and addressing risk factors are urgently needed, particularly in geographies with high or increasing burden.

Here, we improved its biological collection efficiencies by plating a mineral oil layer (100 L) onto the agar plate. An Andersen six-stage sampler and a BioStage impactor were tested with mineral-oil-spread agar plates in collecting indoor and outdoor bacterial and fungal aerosols. The effects of sampling times (5, 10 and 20 min) were also studied using the BioStage impactor when sampling environmental bioaerosols as well as aerosolized Bacillus subtilis (G+) and Escherichia coli (G-). In addition, particle bounce reduction by mineral-oil-plate was also investigated using an optical particle counter (OPC). Experimental results revealed that use of mineral-oil-spread agar plate can substantially enhance culturable bioaerosol recoveries by Andersen type impactors (p-values<0.05). The recovery enhancement was shown to depend on bioaerosol size, type, sampling time and environment. In general, more enhancements (extra 20%) were observed for last stage of the Andersen six-stage samplers compared to the BioStage impactor for 10 min sampling. When sampling aerosolized B. subtilis, E. coli and environmental aerosols, the enhancement was shown to increase with increasing sampling time, ranging from 50% increase at 5 min to 100% at 20 min. OPC results indicated that use of mineral oil can effectively reduce the particle bounce with an average of 66% for 10 min sampling. Our work suggests that enhancements for fungal aerosols were primarily attributed to the reduced impaction stress, while for bacterial aerosols reduced impaction, desiccation and particle bounce played major roles.

Cardiac involvement is a well-known event with a high percentage of findings in the heart's magnetic field, even in asymptomatic areas. There are numerous uncertainties regarding their evolution, in the long and short term, due not only to a difficult to determine the varied clinical expression and the rarely performed intramyocardial biopsy which additionally presents diagnostic problems but also in part to different clinical prognosis. Today, the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is present at high levels in myocardial cells as its entrance it can create even severe heart injury. The pathophysiology in all of these cases can involve multiple immune and non-immune mechanisms within organs and vessels and can be occur in the clinical phases. Possible mechanisms of direct and indirect myocardial infarction in patients with COVID-19 include additional lesion and oxygen-rich and generalized inflammation response with myocardial immune hyperactivity (myocarditis). Therefore, these can occur through the excessive release of cytokines, the presence of thrombocytopenia, endocrine damage, heart failure, arrhythmias and more. Patients can show average signs of myocardial damage, and some develop spontaneous cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias and, rarely, rare cardiogenic disorders. Pathophysiology in all of these may involve multiple mechanisms within the cytokine cephalic membrane, endocrine damage and thrombogenicity.

Continuing improvements to extensively-raised livestock welfare is desirable, necessary and in some situations mandatory, if the social license for animal sourced food and fiber production is to continue sustainably. However, meeting increasingly high welfare standards is challenging. The changing climate in this millennium, has seen the occurrence of two of the most severe drought periods on record in Australia, resulting in complex welfare issues arising from unforeseen disease, trade and environmental catastrophes. The onset of the first drought coincided with an uncontrolled epidemic of ovine paratuberculosis. It ended just prior to a temporary ban on live export of tropical cattle to Indonesia that induced a major market failure and led to severe morbidity and mortality on some beef properties. The second drought period progressed in severity and culminated in the most extreme bushfires recorded, causing unprecedented levels of mortality, morbidity and suffering in farmed animals and wildlife. Temperature extremes have also caused periodic heat-associated or cold-induced hyopthermia losses, requiring increased vigilance and careful management to reduce both temperature-induced stress during transport and the high ovine peri-parturient losses traditionally observed in extensive sheep farming. Several issues remain controversial, including surgical mulesing of wool sheep to manage flystrike, and the continuing live export trade of sheep and cattle. However, in reviewing the increasingly complex welfare challenges for the extensive livestock population industries that are export trade dependent and remain vulnerable to welfare activism, it appears progress has been made. These include development of prescribed livestock welfare Standards and Guidelines and the introduction of the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS) to address export concerns. Further, the sheep mulesing crisis led to improved producer welfare attitudes and practices, including pain management during aversive husbandry procedures that is now occurring globally.

There was 80% decline in number of tenotomies and 90% decline in other clubfoot surgeries performed during pandemic year 2020 compared to year 2019. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic had definite disruptive impact on our clubfoot program. With decreased new registrations, follow-up visits and increased relapses, we anticipate a significant increase in clubfoot cases in need of casting & treatment. To deal with pent-up demand and an anticipated wave of relapse and neglected clubfoot cases, we have proposed strategies to re-establish clubfoot program in post-pandemic new-normal. We hope these will prepare us for any adversaries we face.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on clubfoot program at tertiary care institute"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging diseases are a major challenge to public health. Revealing the evolutionary processes that allow novel pathogens to adapt to new hosts, also the potential barriers to host adaptation, is central to understanding the drivers of disease emergence. In particular, it is unclear how the genetics and ecology of pathogens interact to shape the likelihood of successful cross-species transmission. To better understand the determinants of host adaptation and emergence, we modelled key aspects of pathogen evolutionary dynamics at both intra- and inter-host scales, using parameter values similar to those observed in influenza virus. We considered the possibility of acquiring the necessary host adaptive mutations both before (off-the-shelf emergence) and after (tailor-made emergence) a virus is transmitted from a donor to a new recipient species. Under both scenarios, population bottlenecks at inter-host transmission act as a major barrier to host adaptation, greatly limiting the number of adaptive mutations that are able to cross the species barrier. In addition, virus emergence is hindered if the fitness valley between the donor and recipient hosts is either too steep or too shallow. Overall, our results reveal where in evolutionary parameter space a virus could adapt to and become transmissible in a new species.","output":"Pathogen population bottlenecks and adaptive landscapes: overcoming the barriers to disease emergence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many areas of the United States have air pollution levels typically below Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory limits. Most health effects studies of air pollution use meteorological (e.g., warm/cool) or astronomical (e.g., solstice/equinox) definitions of seasons despite evidence suggesting temporally-misaligned intra-annual periods of relative asthma burden (i.e., asthma seasons). We introduce asthma seasons to elucidate whether air pollutants are associated with seasonal differences in asthma emergency department (ED) visits in a low air pollution environment. Within a Bayesian time-stratified case-crossover framework, we quantify seasonal associations between highly resolved estimates of six criteria air pollutants, two weather variables, and asthma ED visits among 66,092 children ages 5C19 living in South Carolina (SC) census tracts from 2005 to 2014. Results show that coarse particulates (particulate matter <10 m and >2.5 m: PM(10-2.5)) and nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) may contribute to asthma ED visits across years, but are particularly implicated in the highest-burden fall asthma season. Fine particulate matter (<2.5 m: PM(2.5)) is only associated in the lowest-burden summer asthma season. Relatively cool and dry conditions in the summer asthma season and increased temperatures in the spring and fall asthma seasons are associated with increased ED visit odds. Few significant associations in the medium-burden winter and medium-high-burden spring asthma seasons suggest other ED visit drivers (e.g., viral infections) for each, respectively. Across rural and urban areas characterized by generally low air pollution levels, there are acute health effects associated with particulate matter, but only in the summer and fall asthma seasons and differing by PM size.","output":"Using Bayesian time-stratified case-crossover models to examine associations between air pollution and asthma seasons in a low air pollution environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed great challenges in inpatient rehabilitation services, not only to implement the preventative measures to avoid the spreading of the virus in a highly interactive, multidisciplinary setting but also to create a rehabilitation pathway for post-COVID-19 patients.

However, advance care planning is uncommon for multiple reasons, some of which are linked to the perceptions of frail elders and their families. AIM: To explore the barriers and enablers to advance care planning engagement with frail elders. DESIGN: Qualitative in-depth interviews with thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sample of 10 frail elders and 8 nominated family members using a community-based older persons service run by a large urban UK hospice. Frail elders had capacity, were ?65 (median 85, range 71C95), scored 6 or 7 (median 6.5) on the Clinical Frailty Scale, and 70% were female. RESULTS: Key barriers were: Advance care planning is unclear, in terms of meaning and the language used; Lack of relevance, with frail elders preferring to focus on living well now; and the Importance of family, relationships and home, and the influence of relationship on end of life decision-making. Engagement strategies included preparing the frail elder for advance care planning conversations and using a gentle, honest, individualised approach. CONCLUSIONS: Essential enablers for frail elders are understanding what advance care planning is and why it may be relevant to them. For professionals, enablers include recognising the importance of living well now and relational decision-making. To further support advance care planning, recommendations include early engagement and re-conceptualising advance care planning as an ongoing process which encompasses current and future care.

This article describes an unsupervised CT scan image segmentation approach. This approach begins by performing a morphological reconstruction operation that is useful to remove the effect of the external disturbances on the infected regions and to locate different regions of interest precisely. The optimal size of the structuring element is selected using the Edge Content-based contrast matrix approach. After performing the opening by using the morphological reconstruction operation, further noise is eliminated using the closing-based morphological reconstruction operation. The original pixel space is restored and the obtained image is divided into some non-overlapping smaller blocks and the mean intensity value for each block is computed that is used as the local threshold value for the binarization purpose. It is preferable to manually determine the range of the infected region. If a region is greater than the upper bound then that region will be considered as an exceptional region and processed separately.

METHODS: In 2018, 35 participants (nurses, physicians, pharmacists) in an antimicrobial-stewardship program participated in facilitated discussion groups working on the emotional impact of MDRO. Deductive codings were done by four coders focusing on the five basic emotions described by Paul Ekmans. RESULTS: All five emotions revealed four to 11 codes forming several subthemes: Anger is expressed because of incompetence, workflow-impairment and lack of knowledge. Anxiety is provoked by inadequate knowledge, guilt, isolation, bad prognoses, and media-related effects. Enjoyment is seldom. Sadness is experienced in terms of helplessness and second-victim effects. Disgust is attributed to shame and bad associations, but on the other hand MDROs seem to be part of everyday life. Deductive coding yielded additional codes for bioethics and the Calgary Family Assessment Method. CONCLUSION: MDRO are perceived to have severe impact on emotions and may affect bioethical and family psychological issues.

Conclusions and Relevance In correcting aponeurotic ptosis, a small-incision levator aponeurectomy incorporating an algorithm and consistent stress on the aponeurosis during resection achieves the goal MRD1 efficiently. The algorithm closely estimates the desired height intraoperatively such that only small intraoperative suture height revisions, if any, are needed. No intraoperative adjustments were made in 12 eyelids, necessitating future studies to determine whether any adjustments are needed.

Currently, effective treatment options remain very limited for this disease; therefore, there is an urgent need to identify new anti-COVID-19 agents. In this study, we screened over 6,000 compounds that included approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and pharmacologically active compounds to identify leads that target the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). Together with main protease (M(pro)), PLpro is responsible for processing the viral replicase polyprotein into functional units. Therefore, it is an attractive target for antiviral drug development. Here we discovered four compounds, YM155, cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I and GRL0617 that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with IC(50) values ranging from 1.39 to 5.63 mol/L. These compounds also exhibit strong antiviral activities in cell-based assays. YM155, an anticancer drug candidate in clinical trials, has the most potent antiviral activity with an EC(50) value of 170 nmol/L. In addition, we have determined the crystal structures of this enzyme and its complex with YM155, revealing a unique binding mode. YM155 simultaneously targets three hot spots on PLpro, including the substrate-binding pocket, the interferon stimulating gene product 15 (ISG15) binding site and zinc finger motif. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening and repurposing strategy, which has led to the discovery of new drug leads with clinical potential for COVID-19 treatments.

Making the switch to online learning, teachers faced new difficulties that they had to sort out immediately. The purpose of the research is to provide scientific and methodological substantiation of the development of the online course of Russian as a foreign language at the University of Bologna. Due to the coronavirus lockdown, such a course was considered as the only possible way to provide the educational process. The author of the article made an attempt to empirically determine the potential of information technology used to organize a productive learning environment for language learners (including Russian-language learners). The article analyses the way the online educational process was organized to teach Russian to political science students of the University of Bologna (Forl Campus). The researcher studied the structure and functions of the IOL and Virtuale learning environment on the Moodle platform, as well as the means of interaction between students and teachers. The methods for analysing distance learning research papers and empirical methods for assessing the communicative-speech activity of Italian students attending the online Russian language course were used. Apart from that, based on the results of the survey conducted to find out the learners attitude to online education, a psychological and pedagogical analysis of the students educational activities was carried out. The researcher clarified the definition of e-learning, and considered the cognitive theory of multimedia learning in terms of effective transmission of information during the educational process and direct communication with students. As for the theoretical significance of the article, the author made an attempt to substantiate the need to create and use distance courses for students learning foreign languages (in particular Russian). As for the practical significance of this work, the researcher developed practice-oriented modular computer environment to teach Russian as a foreign language and considered computer-assisted language learning. Methodologies to increase linguistic, communicative and regional geographic competencies of Italian students were developed. In addition, new multimedia educational resources were introduced into the process of teaching political science students.

METHODS: We investigated the mental status of inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and compared the differences in cytokines and lymphocytes between patients with and without depression-anxiety symptoms at admission. After two weeks of treatment, we evaluated the mental conditions and measured the cytokines and lymphocytes of the patients with depression and anxiety symptoms and explored the changes and their associations. RESULTS: Approximately half of the patients with COVID-19 had depression and anxiety symptoms, and the symptoms were related to the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ and the level of CD4(+)T lymphocytes. When compared with patients without depression-anxiety symptoms, CD4(+)T lymphocytes level was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with depression-anxiety symptoms.

The risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI was calculated for dichotomous variables and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous variables. The GRADE methodology was implemented for assessing Quality of Evidence (QoE). TSA was implemented to address the risk of random error associated with sparse data and/or multiple testing. RESULTS: Seven RCTs were included for quantitative synthesis. 599 patients were allocated to either EC (n = 306) or DC (n = 293). EC was associated with a higher rate of wound complications compared to DC (RR 2.56; 95% CI 1.33 to 4.93; P = 0.005; I(2) = 0%, QoE High), a lower incidence of postoperative small bowel obstruction (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.89; P = 0.02; I(2) = 0%, QoE moderate), and a lower rate of stoma-related complications (RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.42; P < 0.00001; I(2) = 0%, QoE moderate). The rate of minor low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.55 to 2.33; P = 0.74; I(2) = 0%, QoE low) and major LARS (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.09; P = 0.16; I(2) = 0%, QoE low) did not differ between the two groups.

Information on MIS-C incidence is limited. Objective: To estimate population-based MIS-C incidence per 1a?000a?000 person-months and to estimate MIS-C incidence per 1a?000a?000 SARS-CoV-2 infections in persons younger than 21 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used enhanced surveillance data to identify persons with MIS-C during April to June 2020, in 7 jurisdictions reporting to both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention national surveillance and to Overcoming COVID-19, a multicenter MIS-C study. Denominators for population-based estimates were derived from census estimates; denominators for incidence per 1a?000a?000 SARS-CoV-2 infections were estimated by applying published age- and month-specific multipliers accounting for underdetection of reported COVID-19 case counts. Jurisdictions included Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York (excluding New York City), and Pennsylvania. Data analyses were conducted from August to December 2020. Exposures: Race/ethnicity, sex, and age group (ie, &#8804;5, 6-10, 11-15, and 16-20 years). Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall and stratum-specific adjusted estimated MIS-C incidence per 1a?000a?000 person-months and per 1a?000a?000 SARS-CoV-2 infections. Results: In the 7 jurisdictions examined, 248 persons with MIS-C were reported (median [interquartile range] age, 8 [4-13] years; 133 [53.6%] male; 96 persons [38.7%] were Hispanic or Latino; 75 persons [30.2%] were Black). The incidence of MIS-C per 1a?000a?000 person-months was 5.1 (95% CI, 4.5-5.8) persons. Compared with White persons, incidence per 1a?000a?000 person-months was higher among Black persons (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR], 9.26 [95% CI, 6.15-13.93]), Hispanic or Latino persons (aIRR, 8.92 [95% CI, 6.00-13.26]), and Asian or Pacific Islander (aIRR, 2.94 [95% CI, 1.49-5.82]) persons.

We aimed to characterize qualitatively the cardiotoxicity associated with lopinavir/ritonavir in the setting of COVID-19. Spontaneous notifications of cardiac adverse drug reactions reported to the national Pharmacovigilance Network were collected for 8 weeks since March 1st 2020. The Nice Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance, whose scope of expertise is drug-induced long QT syndrome, analyzed the cases, including the reassessment of all available ECGs. QTc  500 ms and delta QTc > 60 ms from baseline were deemed serious. Twenty-two cases presented with 28 cardiac adverse reactions associated with the empirical use of lopinavir/ritonavir in a hospital setting. Most adverse reactions reflected lopinavir/ritonavir potency to block voltage-gated potassium channels with 5 ventricular arrhythmias and 17 QTc prolongations. An average QTc augmentation of 97  69 ms was reported. Twelve QTc prolongations were deemed serious. Other cases were likely related to lopinavir/ritonavir potency to block sodium channels: 1 case of bundle branch block and 5 recurrent bradycardias.

Design: Observational cohort study Setting: UK Biobank study Participants: 461,052 people Interventions: None Measurements: Incidence rate ratio (IRR) of death from infection, cardiovascular disease, or other causes, adjusted for comorbidities and use of anti-inflammatory therapies, for serum C-reactive protein (CRP) at recruitment. Results: Low grade inflammation was common in all morbidities considered and was more prevalent as multimorbidity accrued (CRP []2mg/L in 23.3% of people without disease and 58.7% with 3+ comorbidities; p<0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors, CRP []2mg/L was associated with a higher IRR of infection death (IRR 1.70; 95% confidence interval 1.51-1.92) than cardiovascular death (IRR 1.48; 1.40-1.57) or other causes of death (IRR 1.41; 1.37-1.45); CRP thresholds of []5 and []10 mg/L yielded similar findings. Absolute rates of infection, cardiovascular and other death were 0.43, 1.59 and 5.39 per 1000 participant-years, respectively, in people with CRP []2mg/L. Analyses stratified by disease type, or number of comorbidities, showed consistent associations between elevated CRP and infection death. Limitations: Our observational study design precludes assessment of causality. We lacked data on the use of anti-inflammatory therapies after study recruitment. Conclusion: Low grade inflammation, irrespective of associated comorbidity, identifies people at particularly increased risk of infection death.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS Using Bayesian multivariable spatiotemporal models, we estimated the association between vaccine exposure and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) severe infections (with hospital admission) in dialysis patients from simultaneous incidence in the general population. For dialysis patients, cases were reported within the French end-stage kidney disease REIN registry from March 11, 2020, to April 29, 2021, and vaccine exposure (first dose) was reported in weekly national surveys since January 2021. Cases in the general population were obtained from the national exhaustive inpatient surveillance system (SI-VIC database), and vaccination coverage (first dose) was obtained from the national surveillance system (VAC-SI database). RESULTS During the first wave, incidence in dialysis patients was approximately proportional to the general population. However, we showed a lower relative incidence for dialysis patients during the second wave (compared with that observed in nondialysis patients), suggesting an effect of prevention measures. Moreover, from the beginning of the vaccination rollout, incidence in dialysis patients was lower compared with predictions based on the first and second waves. Adding vaccination coverages in dialysis and nondialysis patients as predictors allowed the reported cases to be fit correctly (3685 predicted cases, 95% confidence interval, 3552 to 3816, versus 3620 reported). Incidence rate ratios were 0.37 (95% confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.71) for vaccine exposure in dialysis patients and 0.50 (95% confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.61) per 10% higher in vaccination coverage in the same-age general population, meaning that vaccine exposure in dialysis patients and the general population was independently associated with lower hospitalization rate of dialysis patients.

However, CAT is a known risk factor for postoperative bleeding after elective surgery. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the short- and long-term complications of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in patients receiving CAT. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of a prospective database of CAT patients undergoing LSG between March 2004 and December 2012. This LSG-CAT group was matched 1:2 on preoperative data with patients not receiving CAT (LSG-control group). Primary efficacy criterion was the frequency of CAT-related complications. Secondary efficacy criteria were the major postoperative complications, frequency of revisional surgery, long-term CAT-related complications, and a change in the dose level of oral anticoagulants. RESULTS The LSG-CAT group consisted of 15 patients with a median age of 54 years (32-65). The LSG-control group consisted of 30 patients. Median operating time was 75 min in both groups (p = 0.33). Major complication rates in the LSG-CAT and LSG-control groups were 13.3 and 3.3 %, respectively (p = 0.20), with one case of postoperative bleeding in each group (6.7 and 3.3 %, p = 0.6); incidence of revisional surgery was 13.3 and 3.3 % (p = 0.2). There were no postoperative mortalities. After a median follow-up of 14 months (9-43), no changes in the dose level of oral anticoagulants were reported. CONCLUSIONS LSG in patients receiving CAT is not associated with CAT-specific complications. This surgical procedure enables good weight loss and does not require change in the dose level of oral anticoagulants.","output":"The Safety of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy in Patients Receiving Chronic Anticoagulation Therapy: A Case-Matched Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSES: This study investigates the moderating effect of age on the association between relationship with mentors and self-efficacy among low-income students.

We aimed to determine if robust and practical scales could be derived for conditions such as loneliness and social isolation using items from a national survey. METHODS: We conducted psychometric analyses of ten items in two waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, which included over 15,000 participants. We used the Hull method, exploratory structural equation modelling, and multidimensional item response theory analysis in a calibration sample to determine the number of factors and items within each factor. We cross-validated the factor structure using confirmatory factor analysis in a validation sample. We assessed construct validity by comparing the resulting sub-scales with measures for psychological distress and mental well-being. RESULTS: Calibration and cross-validation consistently revealed a three-factor model, with sub-scales reflecting constructs of loneliness and social isolation. Sub-scales showed high reliability and measurement invariance across waves, gender, and age. Construct validity was supported by significant correlations between the sub-scales and measures of psychological distress and mental health. Individuals who met threshold criteria for loneliness and social isolation had consistently greater odds of being psychologically distressed and having poor mental health than those who did not.

International standard organizations have developed standards, approaches, and models to improve and implement semantic interoperability. The openEHR approachone of the standout semantic interoperability approacheshas been implemented worldwide to improve semantic interoperability based on reused archetypes. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to verify the feasibility of implementing semantic interoperability in different countries by comparing the openEHR-based information models of 2 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) registries from China and New Zealand. METHODS: A semantic archetype comparison method was proposed to determine the semantics reuse degree of reused archetypes in 2 ACS-related clinical registries from 2 countries. This method involved (1) determining the scope of reused archetypes; (2) identifying corresponding data items within corresponding archetypes; (3) comparing the semantics of corresponding data items; and (4) calculating the number of mappings in corresponding data items and analyzing results. RESULTS: Among the related archetypes in the two ACS-related, openEHR-based clinical registries from China and New Zealand, there were 8 pairs of reusable archetypes, which included 89 pairs of corresponding data items and 120 noncorresponding data items. Of the 89 corresponding data item pairs, 87 pairs (98%) were mappable and therefore supported semantic interoperability, and 71 pairs (80%) were labeled as direct mapping data items. Of the 120 noncorresponding data items, 114 (95%) data items were generated via archetype evolution, and 6 (5%) data items were generated via archetype localization. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the semantic comparison between the two ACS-related clinical registries prove the feasibility of establishing the semantic interoperability of health care data from different countries based on the openEHR approach. Archetype reuse provides data on the degree to which semantic interoperability exists when using the openEHR approach. Although the openEHR community has effectively promoted archetype reuse and semantic interoperability by providing archetype modeling methods, tools, model repositories, and archetype design patterns, the uncontrolled evolution of archetypes and inconsistent localization have resulted in major challenges for achieving higher levels of semantic interoperability.","output":"Verifying the Feasibility of Implementing Semantic Interoperability in Different Countries Based on the OpenEHR Approach: Comparative Study of Acute Coronary Syndrome Registries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analysed 5,484 close contacts of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in Italy, all tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

However, the uptake of these apps in many countries around the world has been low due to several factors militating against their adoption and usage. OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review, we set out to uncover the key factors that facilitate or militate against the adoption of CTAs, which researchers, designers and other stakeholders should focus on in future iterations to increase their adoption and effectiveness in curbing the spread of COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: Seven databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Service, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar, were searched between October 30 and January 31, 2020. A total of 777 articles were retrieved from the databases, with 13 of them included in the systematic review after screening. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTION: The criteria for including articles in the systematic review were that they could be user studies from any country around the world, must be peer-reviewed, written in English, and focused on the perception and adoption of COVID-19 contact tracing and/or exposure notification apps. Other criteria included user study design could be quantitative, qualitative, or mixed, and must have been conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in the early part of 2020. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Three researchers searched seven databases (three by the first author, and two each by the second and third authors) and stored the retrieved articles in a collaborative Mendeley reference management system online. After the removal of duplicates, each researcher independently screened one third of the articles based on title/abstract. Thereafter, all three researchers collectively screened articles that were in the borderline prior to undergoing a full-text review. Then, each of the three researchers conducted a full-text review of one-third of the eligible articles to decide the final articles to be included in the systematic review. Next, all three researchers went through the full text of each borderline article to determine their appropriateness and relevance. Finally, each researcher extracted the required data from one-third of the included articles into a collaborative Google spreadsheet and the first author utilized the data to write the review. RESULTS: This review identified 13 relevant articles, which found 56 factors that may positively or negatively impact the adoption of CTAs. The identified factors were thematically grouped into ten categories: privacy and trust, app utility, facilitating conditions, social-cognitive factors, ethical concerns, perceived technology threats, perceived health threats, technology familiarity, persuasive design, and socio-demographic factors. Of the 56 factors, privacy concern turned out to be the most frequent factor of CTA adoption (12/13), followed by perceived benefit (7/13), perceived trust (6/13), and perceived data security risk (6/13). In the structural equation models presented by the authors of the included articles, a subset of the 56 elicited factors (e.g., perceived benefit and privacy concern) explains 16 to 77% of the variance of users' intention to download, install, or use CTAs to curb the spread of COVID-19. Potential adoption rates of CTA range from 19% (in Australia) to 75% (in France, Italy, Germany, United Kingdom, and United States). Moreover, actual adoption rates range from 37% (in Australia) to 50% (in Germany). Finally, most of the studies were carried out in Europe (66.7%), followed by North America (13.3%), and Australia, Asia, and South America (6.7% each). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that future CTA iterations should give priority to privacy protection through minimal data collection and transparency, improving contact tracing benefits (personal and social), and fostering trust through laudable gestures such as delegating contact tracing to public health authorities, making source code publicly available and stating who will access user data, when, how, and what it will be used for. Moreover, the results suggest that data security and tailored persuasive design, involving reward, self-monitoring, and social-location monitoring features, have the potential of improving CTA adoption. Hence, in addition to addressing issues relating to utility, privacy, trust, and data security, we recommend the integration of persuasive features into future designs of CTAs to improve their motivational appeal, adoption, and the user experience.

Although the relative risk for adverse effects of fit testing using denatonium benzoate is low, the absolute number of workers with adverse reactions may nevertheless be sizeable. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 34-year-old female nurse rapidly developed shortness of breath, cough, and agitation after denatonium benzoate fit testing. She had a history of allergy to shrimp, crab, mite, and disinfecting products (containing quaternary ammonium). DIAGNOSES: Due to typical symptoms of asthma after exposure to denatonium benzoate aerosol without any other apparent cause, serial pulmonary function tests indicating obstructive lung function and a higher concentration of immunoglobulin antibody E, she was diagnosed with allergic asthma. INTERVENTIONS: This patient was treated with omalizumab (Xolair), corticosteroid, (2) agonist, montelukast, and Symbicort turbuhaler. OUTCOMES: The patient showed quick responses after treatment with diphenhydramine (intramuscularly), fenoterol HBr (inhalation), and prednisolone (oral). Approximately 2 weeks later, she suffered from difficulty breathing and asthmatic symptoms again when she was exposed to polished wax and disinfectant.

Mindfulness training, which helps individuals attend to the present moment with a nonjudgmental attitude, improves sleep and reduces stress during regular times. Mindfulness training may also be relevant to the mitigation of harmful health consequences during acute crises. However, certain restrictions may necessitate the web-based delivery of mindfulness training (ie, rather than in-person group training settings). OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to examine the effects of mindfulness interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of web-based interventions. METHODS: Data from an ongoing study were used for this retrospective equivalence analysis. Recruited participants were enrollees from mindfulness courses at a local charity organization that promoted mental wellness. This study had no exclusion criteria. We created three groups; two groups received their training during the COVID-19 pandemic (in-person training group: n=36; videoconferencing group: n=38), and a second control group included participants who were trained before the pandemic (n=86). Our primary outcomes were self-reported stress and sleep quality. Baseline levels and changes in these variables due to mindfulness training were compared among the groups via an analysis of covariance test and two one-tailed t tests. RESULTS: Baseline perceived stress (P=.50) and sleep quality (P=.22) did not differ significantly among the three groups. Mindfulness training significantly reduced stress in all three groups (P<.001), and this effect was statistically significant when comparing videoconferencing to in-person training (P=.002). Sleep quality improved significantly in the prepandemic training group (P<.001). However, sleep quality did not improve in the groups that received training during the pandemic. Participants reported that they required shorter times to initiate sleep following prepandemic mindfulness training (P<.001), but this was not true for those who received training during the pandemic. Course attendance was high and equivalent across the videoconferencing and comparison groups (P=.02), and participants in the videoconferencing group engaged in marginally more daily practice than the in-person training group. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based mindfulness training via videoconferencing may be a useful intervention for reducing stress during times when traditional, in-person training is not feasible. However, it may not be useful for improving sleep quality.","output":"Effects of Web-Based Group Mindfulness Training on Stress and Sleep Quality in Singapore During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Equivalence Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asian Americans have experienced compounding stressors during the pandemic as a result of racial discrimination.

With nearly 4.92 million deaths by October 19, 2021, and serious health damages in millions of people, COVID-19 has been the most serious global challenge after the Second World War. Besides lost lives and long-term health problems, devastating impact on economics, education, and culture will probably leave a lasting impression on the future. Therefore, the actual extent of losses will become obvious only after years. Moreover, despite the availability of different vaccines and vaccination programs, it is still impossible to forecast what the next steps of the virus are or how near we are to the end of the pandemic. In this article, the route of molecular evolution of the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is thoroughly compiled, highlighting the changes that the virus has undergone during the last 2 years and discussing the approaches that the medical community has undertaken in the fight against virus-induced damages.","output":"Molecular Evolution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: Hazardous and More Hazardous Strains Behind the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic and Their Targeting by Drugs and Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract In addition to a characteristic set of essential genes coronaviruses contain several so-called group-specific genes. These genes differ distinctly among the three coronavirus groups and are specific for each group. While the essential genes encode replication and structural functions, hardly anything is known about the products and functions of the group-specific genes. As a first step to elucidate their significance, we deleted the group-specific genes from the group 2 mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome via a novel targeted recombination system based on host switching (L. Kuo, G. J.Godeke, M. J. Raamsman, P. S. Masters, and P. J. M. Rottier, 2000, J. Virol. 74, 1393C1406). Thus, we obtained recombinant viruses from which the two clusters of group-specific genes were deleted either separately or in combination in a controlled genetic background. As all recombinant deletion mutant viruses appeared to be viable, we conclude that the MHV group-specific genes are nonessential, accessory genes. Importantly, all deletion mutant viruses were attenuated when inoculated into their natural host, the mouse. Therefore, deletion of the coronavirus group-specific genes seems to provide an attractive approach to generate attenuated live coronavirus vaccines.","output":"The Group-Specific Murine Coronavirus Genes Are Not Essential, but Their Deletion, by Reverse Genetics, Is Attenuating in the Natural Host"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: High levels of serum Interleukin-6 correlate with disease severity in COVID-19 pneumonia We hypothesized that tocilizumab (a recombinant humanized","output":"Tocilizumab to Prevent Ventilatory Support for Severe Worsening COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Propensity Score Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Several studies have demonstrated that thromboembolic events increased in patients with coronavirus infection, usually occurring in elderly patients with severe illness, associated with comorbid diseases such as diabetes and hypertension.

AIM: To evaluate incidence of occurrence of acute PVT in cirrhotic patients infected with 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: This cross-sectional, observational study involved 70 patients of the liver cirrhosis: (group A) 28 patients with liver cirrhosis infected with COVID-19, and 42 patients with liver cirrhosis as the control group matched for age and sex (group B). All patients were subjected to thorough medical history, routine investigations (complete blood count, liver, and renal function tests), imaging in the form of abdominal and Doppler ultrasonography to assess the presence of acute PVT, serum ferritin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and PCR of COVID-19 for group A only. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the two groups regarding Doppler ultrasound findings as 3 of the patients in group A had PVT (10.7%), 2 of them had HCC diagnosed by triphasic CT abdomen, and only 1 patient in group B had PVT (2.3%) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In cirrhotic patients infected with COVID-19, portal vein thrombosis may be a potential complication even in the absence of hepatocellular carcinoma; further prospective studies with longer follow-up may be needed.","output":"COVID-19 in Cirrhotic Patients: Is Portal Vein Thrombosis a Potential Complication?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Russian Abstract: ֧ߧ 2020 .  ҧݧ ҧӧݧ֧ߧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧѧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ, ܧѧ ڧ٧ާ֧ߧڧݧ ڧӧߧ  ҧڧ ӧ ӧ֧ ާڧ. ߧԧڧ ҧէ֧ߧߧ է֧ݧ ֧ҧӧѧݧ ٧ߧѧڧ֧ݧߧ էݧߧڧ֧ݧߧ ڧݧڧ  ֧. ڧѧߧڧߧߧ ҧѧ٧ӧѧ֧ݧߧ ֧ߧݧԧڧ ڧҧ֧ݧ ҧ֧٧ѧݧ֧ߧѧڧӧߧ  ѧݧߧ ѧѧܧ֧,  ӧ٧ӧѧݧ ߧ֧ҧէڧާ ڧ ֧ߧԧ ӧ֧ߧڧ ӧ֧ާ ѧߧڧܧѧާ ҧѧ٧ӧѧ֧ݧߧԧ ֧. ٧ѧߧ ҧ֧ߧߧ է֧֧ ڧӧ֧ݧ  ѧڧ֧ߧڧ ܧԧ ߧ֧֧էӧ֧ߧߧ ѧߧڧܧ ܧݧߧԧ ҧ֧ߧڧ, ӧӧݧ֧ܧѧ ӧ ӧ٧ѧڧާէ֧ۧӧڧ էڧ֧ݧ֧.  ֧ڧ ӧ֧ߧڧ ܧݧߧ ԧѧާާ է֧ާ  ڧ էڧ֧ݧާ ѧ ٧ѧާڧߧѧڧާ էݧ ӧ֧ ҧ֧ܧ ߧӧԧ ӧڧѧݧߧԧ ҧѧ٧ӧѧ֧ݧߧԧ ѧߧӧ. ڧ֧ݧ, էڧ֧ݧ, է֧ ڧݧ ߧ ҧӧѧ ֧ҧ  ߧӧ ܧѧ֧ӧ  ݧߧ է֧اѧߧڧ ڧѧݧߧ ݧ ߧӧާ ?ܧާ֧֧ߧڧާ?.  ֧ݧ ӧӧݧ֧ߧڧ ѧѧܧ֧ڧڧ ߧ֧ߧڧ ?ܧݧ-֧ߧڧ-֧ާ?, ݧاڧӧڧ  ֧ڧ ާѧӧԧ  ܧ֧ߧߧԧ ֧֧ӧէ ܧݧߧԧ ҧ֧ߧڧ  էڧѧߧڧߧߧ ާѧ  ֧է֧ݧ֧ߧڧ ާ֧  ݧ ֧ҧקߧܧ   ڧ֧ާ ߧ֧ߧڧ  ֧ڧڧߧ ڧѧڧ, ҧݧ ӧ֧է֧ߧ ڧݧԧڧ֧ܧ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ. ߧ ݧ ڧ  ܧݧڧ֧ӧ֧ߧߧԧ  ܧѧ֧ӧ֧ߧߧԧ էէ C ڧ ܧߧ֧ߧ-ѧߧѧݧڧ٧  էڧܧ-ѧߧѧݧڧ٧.  ܧѧ֧ӧ ڧߧڧܧ ڧߧާѧڧ ӧ٧ ֧ܧӧ ҧ֧ߧڧ ݧ٧ӧѧ֧ݧ֧ ڧѧݧߧ ֧ ?Instagram?, ӧܧѧ٧ӧѧӧڧ  ҧݧ֧ާ ӧ֧ߧڧ էڧѧߧڧߧߧ ҧѧ٧ӧѧ֧ݧߧ ֧ߧݧԧڧ  ߧѧѧݧߧ ֧ڧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ. ӧ֧է֧ߧߧ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ܧѧ٧ѧݧ,   ڧѧէ ߧ֧ߧڧ ?ܧݧ-֧ߧڧ-֧ާ? ֧ҧקߧ,  ڧݧ ӧ٧ѧߧ ڧڧ٧ڧݧԧڧ֧ܧ ߧ֧٧֧ݧ  ߧ֧էѧߧ ֧ߧڧ֧ܧ ԧѧާߧ  ڧާ֧ߧ֧ߧڧ էڧѧߧڧߧߧ ҧѧ٧ӧѧ֧ݧߧ ֧ߧݧԧڧ, ڧҧ֧ѧ֧ ӧ֧֧ߧߧ ݧ ?ӧ֧էާԧ?. ѧ֧  ڧҧ֧֧ߧڧ ߧӧ ٧ߧѧߧڧ, ӧ٧ߧڧܧڧ ӧާ֧  ӧߧ֧է֧ߧڧ֧  ܧݧߧ ҧ֧ߧڧ էڧѧߧڧߧߧ ֧ߧݧԧڧ, ѧܧѧݧڧ٧ڧӧѧݧ ڧߧާѧڧߧߧ-٧ߧѧߧڧ֧ӧ ѧܧ (٧ߧѧߧڧ, ާ֧ߧڧ, ܧާ֧֧ߧڧ), ڧݧ֧ߧڧ ܧԧ ڧѧ֧ ԧѧߧڧ ާ֧اէ է֧ܧڧ  ӧ٧ݧ ާڧ,  ߧ֧էѧ C ҧѧҧݧڧӧѧ֧ է֧ӧ  ӧ٧ݧ. English Abstract: In the spring of 2020, the WHO announced a coronavirus pandemic, which changed the usual course of events around the world. Many everyday tasks required additional efforts and resources. Remote educational technologies acquired a non-alternative and total nature, which necessitated their rapid development by a l participants in the educational process. This period of mastering the school curriculum by children and their parents has become memorable for all subjects of the new virtual educational space. Teachers, parents, children had to urgently try themselves in a new quality and replenish the content of the social role with new competencies. In order to identify the characteristics of the school-student-family relationship that developed during the period of mass and accelerated transfer of school education to a distance format and to determine the place and role of the child in this system of relations and a specific situation, a sociological study was conducted. It consisted of a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches - from content analysis and discourse analysis. As a source of information, we took text messages from users of the social network Instagram who spoke out on the problem of mastering distance educational technologies in the initial period of a pandemic. The study showed that in the triad of school-student-family relations, a child, due to age-related psychophysiological immaturity and lack of technical literacy in the use of distance educational technologies, acquires a secondary role as a follower. The barriers in the acquisition of new knowledge that arose along with the introduction of distance technologies in school education updated the information and knowledge factor, the strengthening of which erases the boundaries between the child and adult world, and the lack of it isolates childhood from adults.","output":"Child Relationships in the Triad 'School-Student-Family' during the Development of Distance Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19) has been found to be caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2).

However, the underlying mechanism of this association is rarely understood. The current study investigated the links between personality and pregnant women's emotional distress (depressive and anxiety symptoms), tested the chain mediating effects of two resilience factorssocial support and positive coping, and explored whether socioeconomic status (SES) could moderate the effects (including direct and/or indirect effects) of personality on their emotional distress. Results of a relatively large sample of pregnant women in China (N = 1157) showed positive associations for psychoticism and neuroticism with depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as negative associations for extraversion with depression and anxiety. After controlling for four important variables (the first pregnancy or not, having adverse pregnancy experience or not, being pregnant as planned or not, and number of weeks of pregnancy), social support and positive coping acted as chain mediators on the associations of personality with depressive symptoms as well as of personality with anxiety. Overall, the association of personality and depressive symptoms demonstrated invariance across socioeconomic status (SES). However, SES moderated the relationship between personality and anxiety. Specifically, the negative association of positive coping with anxiety symptoms was weaker for low SES women than for high SES ones. Results highlight the importance of social support and positive coping to decrease personality-related depressive and anxiety symptom among pregnant women. Furthermore, identifying other resilience factors that alleviate anxiety in women with low SES is urgently called for.","output":"Personality Characteristics and Emotional Distress Among Chinese Pregnant Women: A Moderated Mediation Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, there has been attention to health disparities between racial groups in the US, and between urban and residents.

Design: A cross-sectional survey collecting data in Hong Kong and Fujian Province of China. Self-administered questionnaires were collected via online platform in April 2020. Participants: A convenience and snowball sample of 2706 students aged 18 years or older and studying a healthcare programme in Hong Kong or Fujian. Setting: Students were recruited in tertiary education institutions/universities in Hong Kong and Putian (a prefecture-level city in eastern Fujian province). The institutions offered various healthcare programmes in degree or sub-degree levels. Main outcome measures: Compliances to social distancing and personal hygiene measures were assessed by 10-item Social Distancing Scale and 5-item Personal Hygiene Scale respectively. Path analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the compliance outcomes. Results: The participants reported high compliances to both social distancing and personal hygiene measures. Confidence to manage the current situation, wishful thinking and empathetic responding directly predicted compliance to social distancing ({beta}=-0.31, p<0.001; {beta}=0.35, p=0.015; {beta}=0.33, p<0.001 respectively) and personal hygiene measures ({beta}=-0.16, p<0.001; {beta}=0.21, p<0.001; {beta}=0.16, p<0.001 respectively). Gender, geographical location, and clinical experience were the only three demographic variables having direct and/or indirect effects on social distancing and personal hygiene measures.

Conclusions: The predictive model constructed in this study is the first one to explore factors associating with the compliance to infection control measures in healthcare students amid the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings suggest that students who are male, habituate in Hong Kong, have more clinical experience and weak confidence to manage the threat tend to have lower compliance to social distancing and personal hygiene measures. Wishful thinking, contrasting to previous studies, was first found to positively associate with adherence to COVID-19 control measures.","output":"Associations between Demographic Characteristics, Perceived Threat, Perceived Stress, Coping Responses and Adherence to COVID-19 Prevention Measures among Healthcare Students in China: A Cross-Sectional Survey with Implications for the Control of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We improved the quality and reduced the time to produce machine learned models for use in small molecule antiviral design Our globally asynchronous multi-level parallel training approach strong scales to all of Sierra with up to 97 7% efficiency We trained a novel, character-based Wasserstein autoencoder that produces a higher quality model trained on 1 613 billion compounds in 23 minutes while the previous state of the art takes a day on 1 million compounds Reducing training time from a day to minutes shifts the model creation bottleneck from computer job turnaround time to human innovation time Our implementation achieves 318 PFLOPs for 17 1% of half-precision peak We will incorporate this model into our molecular design loop enabling the generation of more diverse compounds;searching for novel, candidate antiviral drugs improves and reduces the time to synthesize compounds to be tested in the lab","output":"Enabling rapid COVID-19 small molecule drug design through scalable deep learning of generative models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explore the information sensitivity of corporate bonds throughout the COVID-19 crisis by examining whether there is a differential market response to firms with high operating leverage Our results show that investors appear to discriminate based on firm operating leverage, which estimates the inability to adjust operating inputs quickly Spreads of high operating leverage firms increase by 70 basis points upon the Feds corporate credit facilities announcement, while spreads from all other firms decreased, indicating concern about potential downgrades When the facilities expanded, which made some downgraded firms eligible, spreads declined by 146 basis points for highly leveraged firms","output":"Information sensitivity of corporate bonds: Evidence from the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efforts towards slowing down coronavirus (COVID-19) transmission and reducing mortality have focused on timely case detection, isolation and treatment. Availability of laboratory COVID-19 testing capacity using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was essential for case detection. Hence, it was critical to establish and expand this capacity to test for COVID-19 in Ethiopia. To this end, using a three-phrased approach, potential public and private laboratories with RT-PCR technology were assessed, capacitated with trained human resource and equipped as required. These laboratories were verified to conduct COVID-19 testing with quality assurance checks regularly conducted. Within a 10-month period, COVID-19 testing laboratories increased from zero to 65 in all Regional States with the capacity to conduct 18,454 tests per day. The success of this rapid countrywide expansion of laboratory testing capacity for COVID-19 depended on some key operational implications: the strong laboratory coordination network within the country, the use of non-virologic laboratories, investment in capacity building, digitalization of the data for better information management and establishing quality assurance checks. A weak supply chain for laboratory reagents and consumables, differences in the brands of COVID-19 test kits, frequent breakdowns of the PCR machines and inadequate number of laboratory personnel following the adaption of a 24/7 work schedule were some of the challenges experienced during the process of laboratory expansion. Overall, we learn that multisectoral involvement of laboratories from non-health sectors, an effective supply chain system with an insight into the promotion of local production of laboratory supplies were critical during the laboratory expansion for COVID-19 testing.

Systemic steroids have been reported to therapeutically benefit patients, with elevated inflammatory markers, during the severe acute respiratory syndrome, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. COVID-19 disease is characterized by inflammation of the respiratory system and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Given the lack of specific treatment for COVID-19, the current study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of methylprednisolone as an add-on treatment for mechanically ventilated hospitalized COVID-19 patients with severe COVID pneumonia. Data were collected retrospectively from the electronic patient medical records, and interrater reliability was determined to limit selection bias. Descriptive and inferential statistical methods were used to analyze the data. The variables were cross-tabulated with the clinical outcome, and the chi-square test was used to determine the association between the outcomes and other independent variables. Sixty-one percent (43/70) of the COVID-19 ARDS patients received standard supportive care, and the remainder were administered, methylprednisolone (minimum 40 mg daily to a maximum 40 mg q 6 h). A 28-day all-cause mortality rate, in the methylprednisolone group, was 18% (5/27, p < 0.01) significantly lower, compared to the group receiving standard supportive care (51%, 22/43). The median number of days, for the hospital length of stay (18 days), ICU length of stay (9.5 days), and the number of days intubated (6 days) for the methylprednisolone-treated group, was significantly lower (p < 0.01) when compared with the standard supportive care group. Methylprednisolone treatment also reduced the C-reactive protein levels, compared to the standard care group on day 7.

The proposed image segmentation method depends on improving the density peaks clustering (DPC) using generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The DPC is faster than other clustering methods, and it provides more stable results. However, it is difficult to determine the optimal number of clustering centers automatically without visualization. So, GEV is used to determine the suitable threshold value to find the optimal number of clustering centers that lead to improving the segmentation process. The proposed model is applied for a set of twelve COVID-19 CT images.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Qualitative interviews with decision-makers and managers working in community health programmes and managing CHWs (n=36); life history interviews and photovoice with CHWs (n=15, in Sierra Leone only). RESULTS: While policies were put in place in Sierra Leone and Liberia to attract women to the newly paid position of CHW after the Ebola outbreak, these good intentions evaporated in practice. Gender norms at the community level, literacy levels and patriarchal expectations surrounding paid work meant that fewer women than imagined took up the role. Only in DRC, there were more women than men working as CHWs. Gender roles, norms and expectations in all contexts also affected retention and progression as well as safety, security and travel (over long distance and at night). Women CHWs also juggle between household and childcare responsibilities. Despite this, they were more likely to retain their position while men were more likely to leave and seek better paid employment. CHWs demonstrated agency in negotiating and challenging gender norms within their work and interactions supporting families.

Adenovirus was recovered with efficiencies of 56.5, 31.8, and 34.8 % from lettuce, strawberries, and raspberries, respectively. Coronavirus was recovered from lettuce with an efficiency of 19.6 % yet could not be recovered from strawberries. Poliovirus was recovered with efficiencies of 76.7 % from lettuce, but only 0.06 % from strawberries. For comparison purposes, the survival of Ad2, CoV229E, and PV1 was determined for periods up to 10 days on produce. The enteric PV1 survived better than both respiratory viruses on lettuce and strawberries, with only 1.03 log(10) reductions after 10 days of storage at 4 C compared to CoV229E not being recovered after 4 days on lettuce and reductions of 1.97 log(10) and 2.38 log(10) of Ad2 on lettuce and strawberries, respectively, after 10 days.

RESULTS: Our evidence review found that physical activity/exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period is safe, has health benefits for the woman and her unborn child, and may reduce the risks of some pregnancy related complications. Four specific guidelines were developed. These encourage all women without pregnancy complications to: (1) meet the Australian Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for Adults before, during and after pregnancy; (2) modify activities to accommodate the physical changes that occur as pregnancy progresses; (3) do pelvic floor exercises during and after pregnancy; and (4) take an active role in shared decision-making about their physical activity/exercise during and after pregnancy. The review also identified warning signs and contraindications for physical activity/exercise during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: All women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy should be aware of the benefits of physical activity/exercise, and health professionals should encourage safe levels of activity and be familiar with the contraindications, signs and symptoms which suggest that physical activity/exercise should be modified or avoided.","output":"Australian guidelines for physical activity in pregnancy and postpartum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACTThis paper comprehensively evaluates the dynamic effects on China's environment and economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that the COVID-19 lockdown resulted in a temporary improvement in air quality. Furthermore, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in the atmosphere in China were 36% lower than in the week after last year's Lunar New Year holiday, but this also led to an economic downturn. Moreover, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) decreased significantly. During the back-to-work period, the economy recovered and there was an increase in energy consumption, and CO2, NO2 emissions sharply increased to pre-lockdown levels. In the post-lockdown period, the AOD was lower than that of the same period last year. This study can provide reference for environmental policy making, as it demonstrates to what extent the control of pollution sources can improve air quality. Precise emission reduction and regional joint prevention and control are important and effective means for the prevention and control of O3 pollution. The health and economic benefits of COVID-19 pandemic control measures are incalculable. And this can provide an effective scientific basis and theoretical support for the prevention and control of air pollution.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic: impacts on air quality and economy before, during and after lockdown in China in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exerted a significant impact on health care workers. Recent studies have reported the detrimental effects of the pandemic on neurosurgery residents in North America, Asia, and Italy. However, the impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical training in Latin America and Spain has not yet been reported. In the present report, we describe effects of COVID-19 on training and working conditions of neurosurgery residents in these countries. METHODS: An electronic survey with 33 questions was sent to neurosurgery residents between September 7, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Statistical analysis was made in SPSS version 25. RESULTS: A total of 293 neurosurgery residents responded. The median age was 29.47  2.6 years, and 79% (n = 231) were male. Of respondents, 36.5% (n = 107) were residents training from Mexico; 42% surveyed reported COVID symptoms and 2 (0.7%) received intensive care unit care; 61.4% of residents had been tested for COVID and 21.5% had a positive result; 84% of the respondents mentioned persisted with the same workload (&#8805;70 hours per week) during the pandemic. Most residents from Mexico were assigned to management of patients with COVID compared with the rest of the countries (88% vs. 68.3%; P < 0.001), mainly in medical care (65.4% vs. 40.9%; P < 0.001), mechanical ventilators (16.8% vs. 5.9%; P = 0.003), and neurologic surgeries (94% vs. 83%; P = 0.006).

Potential target populations were distinguished based on perceived need for mental health treatment and psychological distress, assessed by the Kessler-6, among those without perceived need. Populations were characterized with respect to demographic characteristics and prior mental health treatment history using logistic regression models.Results: The prevalence of perceived need for mental health treatment was 21%. Perceived need was strongly associated with pre-pandemic treatment history; compared to those with no treatment history, perceived need was dramatically higher among those in treatment when the pandemic began (OR = 53.8 95% CI 28.2-102.8) and those with pre-pandemic treatment history (OR = 9.3, 95% CI 5.1-16.8). Among the 79% who did not perceive need, moderate or greater distress was reported by 19% and was associated with younger age and Hispanic ethnicity (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.6).Conclusions: In the U.S., where mental health treatment is relatively common, mental health treatment response during the pandemic, and perhaps other crises, should target people with a history of mental health treatment.

An essential requirement of self-management is behaviour change, but many practitioners have not been trained in skills to support behaviour change. Healthy Conversation Skills (HCS) training was developed at the University of Southampton for this purpose. This article reports on a pilot study that aimed to assess the feasibility of primary care practitioners adopting HCS in their routine practice. It describes their experiences and level of competence post-training. METHODS: Health Education England (Wessex) commissioned HCS training for 18 primary care practitioners. Fifteen of these practitioners were subsequently observed in their consultations at one or two time points; face-to-face semi-structured, reflective feedback interviews were conducted immediately following the observations. Practitioners HCS competence was assessed from the observations and interviews using a previously developed and published coding rubric. The interview data were analysed thematically to understand practitioners experiences of using the new skills. RESULTS: Practitioners demonstrated competence in embedding the skills into their routine practice following HCS training. They reflected on how patients liked being asked questions, the usefulness of setting SMARTER (Specific, Measured, Action-oriented, Realistic, Timed, Evaluated and Reviewed) goals and the power of listening. They could also identify facilitators of skill use and ways to overcome challenges such as patients with competing priorities and organisational constraints. They found the skills valuable as a way of empowering patients to make changes to manage their own health. CONCLUSIONS: HCS are acceptable to primary care practitioners, can be readily adopted into their routine consultations and are a helpful strategy for supporting patients to make changes. HCS training has the potential to be a sustainable, scalable and effective way of contributing to the prevention agenda by supporting disease self-management, and hence of addressing todays epidemic of lifestyle-related conditions.","output":"Meeting the UK Governments prevention agenda: primary care practitioners can be trained in skills to prevent disease and support self-management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic poses new challenges in providing safe pedestrian navigation information that helps to reduce the risk of severe illness due to the highly contagious nature of the virus.

Methods: Two hundred and twenty eight board-certified urologists completed our self-designed survey. An analysis was done to assess the increase in the use of telemedicine and the urologists' telemedicine experience responses. Data analysis was done using SPSS software. Results: There has been a tremendous increase in the use of telemedicine among urologists during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Most of the respondents of this study performed general urology as part of their daily practice (59.6%). Prior to the pandemic, 53.9% of the participants had never used any means of telemedicine. However, during the pandemic, 72.4% of urologists who had never used telemedicine began using the same. Almost all of the respondents agreed that physical examination is difficult when using telemedicine, which resulted in the highest mean value among the questionnaire items. Urologists below 35-year-old agreed, to a larger extent, that telemedicine saves them more time and is simple to use than urologists from other age groups. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, most urologists adopted telemedicine technology rapidly. Adopting telemedicine in the future could have multiple advantages. However, the limitations of telemedicine should be respected in order to avoid compromising patient safety.

In the context of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, involvement of DC-SIGN has been linked to severe cases of COVID-19. Inhibition of the interaction between DC-SIGN and viral glycoproteins has the potential to generate broad spectrum antiviral agents. Here, we demonstrate that mannose-functionalized poly- l -lysine glycoconjugates efficiently inhibit the attachment of viral glycoproteins to DC-SIGN-presenting cells with picomolar affinity. Treatment of these cells leads to prolonged receptor internalization and inhibition of virus binding for up to 6 h. Furthermore, the polymers are fully bio-compatible and readily cleared by target cells. The thermodynamic analysis of the multivalent interactions reveals enhanced entropy-driven affinities and promising perspectives for the future development of multivalent therapeutics.","output":"Poly-L-lysine Glycoconjugates Inhibit DC-SIGN-mediated Attachment of Pandemic Viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thiones have been investigated as ligands in metal complexes with catalytic and biological activity.

We show that binary black hole (BBH) merger rates in active galactic nuclei (AGN) should always exceed merger rates in quiescent galactic nuclei (nuclear star clusters, NSCs) around supermassive BHs (SMBHs) without accretion disks. This is primarily due to average binary lifetimes in AGN that are significantly shorter than in NSCs. The lifetime difference comes from rapid hardening of BBHs in AGN, such that their semi-major axes are smaller than the hard-soft boundary of their parent NSC; this contrasts with the large average lifetime to merger for BBHs in NSCs around SMBHs, due to binary ionization mechanisms. Secondarily, merger rates in AGNs are enhanced by gas-driven binary formation mechanisms. Formation of new BHs in AGN disks are a minor contributor to the rate differences. With the gravitational wave detection of several BBHs with at least one progenitor in the upper mass gap, and signatures of dynamical formation channels in the $\\\\chi_{\\\\rm eff}$ distribution, we argue that AGN could contribute $\\\\sim 25\\\\%-80\\\\%$ of the LIGO-Virgo measured rate of $\\\\sim 24 \\\\rm{Gpc}^{-3} \\\\rm{yr}^{-1}$.","output":"Binary Black Hole Merger Rates in AGN Disks versus Nuclear Star Clusters: Loud beats Quiet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors report a unique case of an intramedullary cerebellar hemangioblastoma that was supplied by a persistent hypoglossal artery.

Our objective was to examine differences between in-person and video telemedicine appointments in terms of cancellation rates by age, race, ethnicity, gender, and insurance, and compare 30-day inpatient hospitalizations rates and 30-day emergency department visit rates between the two visit types. Demographic characteristics and comorbidities for adults scheduled for an Emory Healthcare ambulatory clinic appointment from June 2020 to December 2020 were extracted from the electronic medical record. Each appointment was identified as either a video telemedicine or in-person clinic appointment. The outcomes were ambulatory clinic cancellation rates, 30-day hospitalization rates, and 30-day emergency department visit rates. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess differences between appointment types. A total of 1,652,623 ambulatory clinic appointments were scheduled. Ambulatory appointment cancellations rates were significantly lower among telemedicine compared to in-person appointments overall (20.4% vs. 31.0%, p < .001) and regardless of gender, age, race, ethnicity, insurance, or specialty (p < .05 for all sub-groups).

We aimed to develop new markers based on the morphology of the QRS complex of the electrocardiogram (ECG). Methods: ECG recordings from 29 patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) were processed. Mean warped QRS complexes were computed in two-minute windows at the start of an HD session, at the end of each HD hour and 48 h after it. We quantified QRS width, amplitude and the proposed QRS morphology-based markers that were computed by warping techniques. Reference [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] were determined from blood samples acquired at the time points where the markers were estimated. Linear regression models were used to estimate electrolyte levels from the QRS markers individually and in combination with T wave morphology markers.

OBJECTIVE: We describe our experience of the data application and linkage process for our study LAUNCHES QI, and the time, processes and resource requirements involved. To help others planning similar projects, we highlight challenges encountered and advice for applications in the current system as well as suggestions for system improvements. FINDINGS: The study set up for LAUNCHES QI began in March 2018, and the process through to data acquisition took 2.5 years. Several challenges were encountered, including the amount of information required (often duplicate information in different formats across applications), lack of clarity on processes, resource constraints that limit an audits capacity to fulfil requests and the unexpected amount of time required from the study team. It is incredibly difficult to estimate the resources needed ahead of time, and yet necessary to do so as early on as funding applications. Early decisions can have a significant impact during latter stages and be hard to change, yet it is difficult to get specific information at the beginning of the process.

This study aimed to assess circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines in adult patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and stratified according to age (older or younger than 65 years) aiming to explore associations between these markers of inflammation and comorbidities. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of 142 COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to the University Hospital of the Federal University of S?o Carlos, from July to October 2020. Sociodemographic data, chronic comorbidities, and baseline NEWS2 and SOFA for clinical deterioration were obtained at hospital admission. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were determined by flow cytometry. Results Older adults with COVID-19 had higher serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 as compared to those under 65 years of age (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). IL-10 was independently associated with age (p = 0.04) and severity of the disease (p = 0.05), whereas serum levels of IL-6 were not directly associated with age (p = 0.5). The comorbidity index seems to be the main responsible for this, being significantly associated with IL-6 levels among those aged 65 and over (p = 0.007), in addition to the severity of the disease. Conclusions Higher serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 are associated with the severity of the disease and a higher comorbidity index among adults aged 65 and over with COVID-19.

Furthermore, mice genetically lacking SHP-1 (me/me) display a profound susceptibility to inflammatory CNS demyelination relative to wild type mice. In particular, SHP-1 deficiency may act predominantly in inflammatory macrophages to increase CNS demyelination as SHP-1-deficient macrophages display co-expression of inflammatory effector molecules and increased demyelinating activity in me/me mice. Recently, we reported that PBMCs of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have a deficiency in SHP-1 expression relative to normal control subjects indicating that SHP-1 deficiency may play a similar role in MS as to that seen in mice. Therefore, it became essential to examine the specific expression and function of SHP-1 in macrophages from MS patients. Herein, we document that macrophages of MS patients have deficient SHP-1 protein and mRNA expression relative to those of normal control subjects. To examine functional consequences of the lower SHP-1, the activation of STAT6, STAT1, and NF-B was quantified and macrophages of MS patients showed increased activation of these transcription factors. In accordance with this observation, several STAT6-, STAT1-, and NF-B-responsive genes that mediate inflammatory demyelination were increased in macrophages of MS patients following cytokine and TLR agonist stimulation. Supporting a direct role of SHP-1 deficiency in altered macrophage function, experimental depletion of SHP-1 in normal subject macrophages resulted in an increased STAT/NF-B activation and increased inflammatory gene expression to levels seen in macrophages of MS patients.

Participation in SNAP declined among households with children in the first four months of the pandemic, while participation in WIC increased slightly, and participation in school meals remained unchanged. There were significant differences in SNAP, WIC, and school meal programs use by race/ethnicity, income, and urbanicity before and during the pandemic. Food insecurity prevalence was higher among SNAP participants at both periods but the gap between participants and non-participants was smaller during the pandemic. Pantry use and food insecurity rates were consistently higher among federal nutrition assistance program participants, possibly suggesting unmet food needs.

Our objective was to investigate patient preference for biologic treatments in patients with psoriasis in China. METHODS: From October 2020 to January 2021, psoriasis patients were recruited for a survey that included demographic and disease-related questions, as well as a discrete choice experiment to measure their preferences for biologic therapy. A discrete-choice experiment was used in which respondents selected psoriasis treatments based on benefits (ie, early onset of efficacy, long-term efficacy, sustained efficacy) and treatment costs. We analyzed choice data using conditional logit model. RESULTS: This study included 236 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The relative importance of the cost of biologic treatments, probability of keeping PASI100 at 5 years, probability of achieving PASI100 at 3 months and time to achieve PASI50 after initiation the biologic treatment were 0.593, 0.137, 0.185 and 0.085. Over 50% of patients regarded the cost of biologic treatments as the most important attribute. High-income and low-income subgroups had higher preference weight in probability of achieving PASI100 at 3-month and monthly cost. CONCLUSION: The cost of biologic treatments was found as the most important attribute for Chinese patients with psoriasis. Among efficacy attributes, the probability of achieving PASI100 at 3 months showed most sensitive.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of all recorded atraumatic OHCA in Marion County, Indiana, from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 and from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020. We described patient, arrest, EMS response, and survival characteristics. We performed paired and unpaired t-tests to evaluate the changes in those characteristics during COVID-19 as compared to the prior year. Data were matched by month to control for seasonal variation. RESULTS: The total number of arrests increased from 884 in 2019 to 1034 in 2020 (p = 0.016). Comparing 2019 to 2020, there was little difference in age [median 62 (IQR 59-73) and 60 (IQR 47-72), p = 0.086], gender (38.5% and 39.8% female, p = 0.7466, witness to arrest (44.3% and 39.6%, p = 0.092), bystander AED use (10.1% and 11.4% p = 0.379), bystander CPR (48.7% and 51.4%, p = 0.242).

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of pediatric inpatients exposed to IV acetaminophen from January 2011 to June 2016, using the national database Health Facts. RESULTS: Eighteen thousand one hundred ninety-seven (2.0%) of 893,293 pediatric inpatients received IV acetaminophen for a median of 14 doses per patient (IQR, 8-56). A greater proportion of IV acetaminophen patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (14.8% vs 5.1%, p < 0.0001), received positive pressure ventilation (2.0% vs 1.5%, p < 0.0001), had a higher hospital mortality rate (0.9% vs 0.3%, p < 0.0001), and were operative (35.5% vs 12.8%, p < 0.001) than those not receiving IV acetaminophen. The most common operations associated with IV acetaminophen use were musculoskeletal and digestive system operations. Prescription of IV acetaminophen increased over time, both in prescription rates and number of per patient doses. Of the 18,197 patients prescribed IV acetaminophen, 16,241 (89.2%) also were prescribed opioids during their hospitalization. A multivariate analysis revealed patients prescribed both IV acetaminophen and opioids had a 54.8% increase in opioid duration as compared with patients who received opioids alone. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to assess IV acetaminophen prescription practices for pediatric inpatients. Intravenous acetaminophen prescription was greater in the non-operative pediatric inpatient population than operative patients. Intravenous acetaminophen prescription was associated with an increase in opioid duration as compared with patients who received opioids alone, suggesting that it is commonly used to supplement opioids for pain relief.","output":"National Intravenous Acetaminophen Use in Pediatric Inpatients From 2011-2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In previous influenza pandemics, bacterial co-infections have been a major cause of mortality.

The high mortality in African-Americans and males, in general, raises the concern for a possible X-linked mediated process that could affect the viral pathogenesis and the immune system. We hypothesized that G6PD, the most common X-linked enzyme deficiency, associated with redox status, may have a role in severity of pneumonia. Retrospective chart review was performed in hospitalized patients with COVID19 pneumonia needing supplemental oxygen. A total of 17 patients were evaluated: six with G6PD deficiency (G6PDd) and 11 with normal levels. The two groups (normal and G6PDd) were comparable in terms of age, sex, co-morbidities, and laboratory parametersLDH, IL-6, CRP, and ferritin, respectively. Thirteen patients needed ventilatory support ; 8 in the normal group and 5 in the G6PDd group (72% vs.83%). The main differences indicating increasing severity in normal vs. G6PDd groups included G6PD levels (12.2 vs. 5.6, P = 0.0002), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (159 vs. 108, P = 0.05), days on mechanical ventilation (10.25 vs. 21 days P = 0.04), hemoglobin level (10 vs. 8.1 P = 0.03), and hematocrit (32 vs. 26 P = 0.015). Only one patient with G6PDd died; 16 were discharged home. Our clinical series ascribes a possible biological role for G6PDd in SARS-CoV2 viral proliferation.

The influence of functionalization in porosity, morphology and acidic sites was investigated. Samples with an increased number of acidic sites and with higher microporosity when compared to pure silica were produced.

In humans, introns account for large portions of the pre-mRNA, with intronic sequences representing about 95% of most pre-mRNA. Intron length varies considerably; introns can be as short as a few to hundreds of thousands of nucleotides in length. How nascent long intronic RNA is organized during transcription to facilitate the communication between 5 and 3 splice-sites required for spliceosome assembly however is still poorly understood. Here, we use single-molecule fluorescent RNA in situ hybridization (smFISH) to investigate the spatial organization of co- and post-transcriptional long introns in cells. Using two long introns within the POLA1 pre-mRNA as a model, we show that introns are packaged into compact assemblies, and when fully transcribed, are organized in a looped conformation with their ends in proximity. This organization is observed for nascent and nucleoplasmic pre-mRNAs and requires spliceosome assembly, as disruption of U2 snRNP binding results in introns with separated 5 and 3 ends. Moreover, interrogating the spatial organization of partially transcribed co-transcriptional POLA1 intron 35 indicates that the 5 splice site is maintained proximal to the 3 splice site during transcription, supporting a model that 5 splice site tethering to the elongating polymerase might contribute to spliceosome assembly at long introns.

With the onset of the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, several issues related to conducting social behavioural sciences research and related community engagement activities arise, especially in rural areas of low-income countries, where the coverage of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is limited and their application on field-based research would imply a biased selection of relatively more privileged minorities with access to on-line and other communication platforms not requiring physical contact. This article enumerates and discusses the different technical challenges that social behavioural sciences research and community engagement activities face in times of public health emergencies caused by pandemics such as COVID-19.

Several recent human studies have proved the safety and efficacy of TB in different surgical procedures, but there have been no similar studies about its efficacy in hepatic parenchymal transection. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the TB device in laparoscopic liver resection. METHODS This retrospective study compared TB and ultrasonic Harmonic devices in 80 patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection from 2010 to 2016 in our institution. To reduce the selection bias, the two groups were matched in a 1-to-2 ratio on the basis of propensity scores. RESULTS There were no differences in the preoperative patient characteristics between the two groups. The extent of liver resection was comparable between the groups. Although the Harmonic group's intraoperative blood loss and operative time were less than that of the TB group, the differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.08, P = 0.32, respectively). Postoperative complications, mortality within 90 days, and hospital stay were comparable between the two groups.

Infidelity is also one of the most frequently cited reasons for divorce. The increased stress brought on by the pandemic may be putting couples at an increased risk for experiencing infidelity, and data collected during the pandemic have shown that people across the United States are engaging in behaviors that are associated with a high likelihood of experiencing infidelity. The negative consequences of infidelity are also likely to be exacerbated for couples during the pandemic due to the intersection with the social, emotional, and financial consequences of COVID-19. Furthermore, couples are likely to experience disruptions and delays to the affair recovery process during the pandemic, which can negatively impact their ability to heal.

Potential leakage risks, however, are associated with bilateral dog ear formation, which results from traditional double-stapling anastomosis. The authors determined the feasibility of combining these techniques with a commercial stapling set to achieve a nondog ear (end-to-end) anastomosis for patients with mid- and distal rectal neoplasms. Patients with early-stage (c/ycT1-2N0), mid- to distal rectal neoplasms and good anal sphincter function were included in this study. Laparoscopic low anterior resection was performed with a standard total mesorectal excision technique downward to the pelvic floor as low as possible. The bowel was resected proximal to the lesion with an endoscopic linear stapler. An anvil was inserted extracorporeally into the proximal colon via an extended working pore. The distal rectum coupled with the lesion was prolapsed and everted out of the anus. The neoplasm was resected with a sufficient margin above the dentate line under direct sight. A transrectal anastomosis without dog ears was performed intracorporeally to reconstitute the continuity of the bowel. Eleven cases, 6 male and 5 female patients, were included in this study. The mean operative time was 191 (129-292) minutes. The mean blood loss was 110 (30-300) mL. The median distal margin distance from the lower edge of the lesion to the dentate line was 1.5 (0.5-2.5) cm. All the resection margins were negative. Most patients experienced uneventful postoperative recoveries. No patient had anastomotic leak. Most patients had an acceptable stool frequency after loop ileostomy closure.

SARS-CoV2 quickly changed the educational environment. Faculty scrambled to convert in-person lectures into online format. While this transition appeared chaotic, perhaps the more daunting task was converting laboratory and clinical courses to online labs without compromising the integrity of student learning. In this study, we examined if virtual simulations could be comparable experience to in-person lab courses. The two groups included students taking microbiology lab courses that was either (1) in-person or (2) online. Students taking in-person, hands-on lab were assigned virtual simulations as homework. Students in an online lab course only had virtual simulations. The simulations, which were selected based on curriculum mapping to the learning outcomes, included theoretical concepts, performing virtual experiments, and answering questions. In both groups, students were instructed to complete seven to nine virtual lab simulations. We examined student learning with pre/post-tests, containing 3 to 4 questions per learning outcome. Students were given the same set of 24 questions on the first day of the course and during the final exam. We found that although treatment was a significant factor, time had an effect size an order of magnitude larger using repeated measures ANOVA analyses. There was statically significant increase in student learning over time (Fig. 1). Students from the in-person courses (n=31) showed significant improvement in three of the seven learning outcomes using Bonferroni correction, paired t-tests on pre/post-tests. Students from the online courses (n=88) showed significant improvement in six of the seven learning outcomes. The only learning outcome that had no significant change over time in both groups was on lab safety. This was not surprising because students normally take other lab courses prior to entering microbiology lab. In addition, students voluntarily responded to an end-of-course anonymous survey that had statements about anxiety, career/value, confidence, motivation, and self-pace on a scale of 1-5 (1: strongly disagree to 5: strongly agree). Overall, students in both groups showed significant improvement in anxiety, confidence, and motivation by the end as compared to the beginning of the course. However, when asked if a student can see themselves becoming a scientist, both groups mean responses was neutral (2.89, n=31 for in-person;3.16, n=52 for online). This study showed that virtual lab simulations, although they could be viewed as a Pandora's Box, have the potential to be a valuable tool for students in microbiology lab. For students, the cost of virtual simulations is less than a hands-on microbiology home kit, not to mention the safer route biologically. However, practicality of simulations could be hampered by limitations in computer and Internet access. In addition, this study only tested lab concepts and did not test lab skills. Universities and colleges will continue to evaluate virtual labs and assess their strengths and weakness well beyond this Pandemic.","output":"Microbiology Lab Simulations, A Pandora's Box, During an Epic Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the restaurant industry due to enforced closures and limitations on social gatherings, prompting restaurateurs to innovate and adapt in order to ensure the viability of their businesses. Pandemic has also induced changes in our perceptions of safety in public spaces, necessitating the adoption of social distancing and more widespread use of online platforms for purchasing and communication. While the pandemic might be a catalyst for the adoption of contactless technologies, some restaurateurs remain hesitant to invest in service robots because they are not convinced of the return on investment and the potential value service robots can deliver to their customers. Therefore, this study aims to explore customer value perceptions of service robots and their impact on customers attitudes and behaviors toward robotic restaurants. Findings yielded by a survey of 445 potential diners in Taiwan show that customers willingness to use and to pay more for robotic restaurants are determined by their attitudes toward robots, which are influenced by functional, conditional, epistemic, emotional, co-creation, and social values. Our survey results also reveal that the importance of conditional value is amplified by crisis-specific antecedents, namely the need for physical distancing and mysophobia. These findings have implications for restaurant pricing policies and can be considered by restaurant managers when formulating strategies aimed at sustaining their business in these challenging times.

These modified nucleosides are liberated from RNA molecules as the consequence of RNA catabolism and released into extracellular space, but the molecular mechanism of extracellular transport and its pathophysiological implications have been unclear. In the present study, we discovered that RNA-derived modified nucleosides are exported to extracellular space through equilibrative nucleoside transporters 1 and 2 (ENT1 and ENT2), with ENT1 showing higher preference for modified nucleosides than ENT2. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of ENT1 and ENT2 significantly attenuated export of modified nucleosides thereby resulting in their accumulation in cytosol. Using mutagenesis strategy, we identified an amino acid residue in ENT1 that is involved in the discrimination of unmodified and modified nucleosides. In ENTs-deficient cells, the elevated levels of intracellular modified nucleosides were closely associated with an induction of autophagy response as evidenced by increased LC3-II level. Importantly, we performed a screening of modified nucleosides capable of inducing autophagy and found that 1-methylguanosine (m(1)G) was sufficient to induce LC3-II levels. Pathophysiologically, defective export of modified nucleosides drastically induced Zika virus replication in an autophagy-dependent manner. In addition, we also found that pharmacological inhibition of ENTs by dilazep significantly induced Zika virus replication. Collectively, our findings highlight RNA-derived modified nucleosides as important signaling modulators that activate autophagy response and indicate that defective export of these modified nucleoside can have profound consequences for pathophysiology.","output":"Export of RNA-derived modified nucleosides by equilibrative nucleoside transporters defines the magnitude of autophagy response and Zika virus replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Latinos in the US are experiencing higher excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic than any other racial/ethnic group, but it is unclear which subgroups within this diverse population are most affected. Such information is necessary to target policies and programs that prevent further excess mortality and reduce inequities. Methods: Using death certificate data for January 1, 2016 through February 29, 2020 and time-series models, we estimated the expected weekly deaths among Latinos in California from March 1 through October 3, 2020. We quantified excess mortality as observed minus expected deaths and risk ratios (RR) as the ratio of observed to expected deaths. We considered subgroups defined by age, sex, place of birth, education, occupation, and combinations of these factors. Results: During the first seven months of the pandemic, Latino deaths in California exceeded expected deaths by 10,304, a 31% increase. Excess death rates were greatest for individuals born in Mexico (RR 1.44; 95% PI, 1.41, 1.48) or Central America (RR 1.49; 95% PI, 1.37, 1.63), with less than a high school degree (RR 1.41; 95% PI, 1.35, 1.46), or in manufacturing (RR 1.62; 95% PI, 1.52, 1.72) or food-and-agriculture occupations (RR 1.50; 95% PI, 1.40, 1.61). Disparities in excess death by place of birth and education were magnified among Latinos in essential occupations. Conclusions: Foreign-birth, low formal education, and work in an essential sector put some Latinos in California at higher risk of death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions should reduce the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on Latino immigrants and Latinos in unsafe working conditions; these may include early vaccination, workplace safety enforcement, and expanded access to medical care.","output":"Excess deaths among Latino people in California during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments to impose major restrictions on individual freedom in order to stop the spread of the virus. With the successful development of a vaccine, these restrictions are likely to become obsolete-on the condition that people get vaccinated. However, parts of the population have reservations against vaccination. While this is not a recent phenomenon, it might prove a critical one in the context of current attempts to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, the task of designing policies suitable for attaining high levels of vaccination deserves enhanced attention. In this study, we use data from the Eurobarometer survey fielded in March 2019. They show that 39% of Europeans consider vaccines to cause the diseases which they should protect against, that 50% believe vaccines have serious side effects, that 32% think that vaccines weaken the immune system, and that 10% do not believe vaccines are tested rigorously before authorization. We find that-even when controlling for important individual-level factors-ideological extremism on both ends of the spectrum explains skepticism of vaccination. We conclude that policymakers must either politicize the issue or form broad alliances among parties and societal groups in order to increase trust in and public support for the vaccines in general and for vaccines against COVID-19 in particular, since the latter were developed in a very short time period and resulted-in particular in case of the AstraZeneca vaccine-in reservations because of the effectiveness and side effects of the new vaccines.

METHODS We used standard legal research methods to collect policies governing the use of child restraint systems (CRS) in rideshare and taxi vehicles for all 50 states and the 50 largest cities in the USA. We abstracted the collected policies to determine whether the policy applies to specific vehicles, requires specific safety restraints in those vehicles, lists specific requirements for use of those safety restraints, seeks to enhance compliance and punishes noncompliance. RESULTS All 50 states have policies that require the use of CRS for children under a certain age, weight or height. Seven states exempt rideshare vehicles and 28 states exempt taxis from their CRS requirements. Twelve cities have relevant policies with eight requiring CRS in rideshare vehicles, but not taxis, and two cities requiring CRS use in both rideshare vehicles and taxis. CONCLUSION Most states require CRS use in rideshare vehicles, but not as many require CRS use in taxis. Though states describe penalties for drivers who fail to comply with CRS requirements, these penalties do not actually facilitate the use of CRS in rideshare or taxis. Furthermore, there is ambiguity in the laws about who is responsible for the provision and installation of the restraints. To prevent serious or fatal injuries in children, policy-makers should adopt policies that require, incentivise and facilitate the use of CRS in rideshare vehicles and taxis.","output":"State and city laws governing the use of child restraint systems in rideshare vehicles and taxicabs: requirements and responsibility."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The identification of profiled cancer-related genes plays an essential role in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Based on literature research, the classification of genetic mutations continues to be done manually nowadays. Manual classification of genetic mutations is pathologist-dependent, subjective, and time-consuming. To improve the accuracy of clinical interpretation, scientists have proposed computational-based approaches for automatic analysis of mutations with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. Nevertheless, some challenges, such as multiple classifications, the complexity of texts, redundant descriptions, and inconsistent interpretation, have limited the development of algorithms. To overcome these difficulties, we have adapted a deep learning method named Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to classify genetic mutations based on text evidence from an annotated database. During the training, three challenging features such as the extreme length of texts, biased data presentation, and high repeatability were addressed. Finally, the BERT+abstract demonstrates satisfactory results with 0.80 logarithmic loss, 0.6837 recall, and 0.705 F-measure. It is feasible for BERT to classify the genomic mutation text within literature-based datasets.

Transmission occurs by droplets, contact and aerosols. In medical settings, filtering facepiece (FFP) respirators are recommended for use by personnel exposed to aerosol-generating procedures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for FFP respirators exceeded their supply worldwide and low-quality products appeared on the market, potentially putting healthcare workers at risk. AIMS To raise awareness about variations in quality of imported FFP respirators in Switzerland during the COVID-19 pandemic, to draw attention to the current directives regulating the market launch of FFP respirators in Switzerland, to provide practical support in identifying suspicious products or documents and, finally, to offer strategies aimed at reducing the distribution of low-quality FFP respirators in the future. METHODS Three Swiss laboratories, Spiez Laboratory and Unisant in partnership with TOXpro SA individually set up testing procedures to evaluate aerosol penetration and fit testing of FFP respirators imported into Switzerland during COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, Spiez Laboratory visually inspected the products, examined the certification documents and crosschecked the product information with international databases. RESULTS Between 31 March and 15 June 2020, 151 FFP respirators were analysed. The initial assessment performed before testing allowed a reduction of up to 35% in the number of FFP respirators sent to Spiez Laboratory for evaluation, for which product information found to be faulty. After filtration efficiency evaluation and fit testing, 52% and 60% of all products tested by Spiez Laboratory and Unisant-TOXpro SA, respectively, did not meet the minimum performance requirements established independently by the three Swiss laboratories. CONCLUSION The demand for FFP respirators exceeded the supply capacity from established suppliers of the Swiss market. New production and import channels emerged, as did the number of poor-quality FFP respirators. FFP respirators remaining in stocks should be checked for conformity before being used, or eliminated and replaced if quality does not meet standards.","output":"Distribution of low quality filtering facepiece respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic: an independent analysis of the situation in Switzerland."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An eco-epidemiological investigation was carried out on Madagascar bat communities to better understand the evolutionary mechanisms and environmental factors that affect virus transmission among bat species in closely related members of the genus Morbillivirus, currently referred to as Unclassified Morbilli-related paramyxoviruses (UMRVs).

Using RT-PCR targeting the L-polymerase gene of the Paramyxoviridae family, we found that 10.5% of sampled bats were infected, representing six out of seven families and 15 out of 31 species analyzed. Univariate analysis indicates that both abiotic and biotic factors may promote viral infection. Using generalized linear modeling of UMRV infection overlaid on biotic and abiotic variables, we demonstrate that sympatric occurrence of bats is a major factor for virus transmission. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all paramyxoviruses infecting Malagasy bats are UMRVs and showed little host specificity. Analyses using the maximum parsimony reconciliation tool CoRe-PA, indicate that host-switching, rather than co-speciation, is the dominant macro-evolutionary mechanism of UMRVs among Malagasy bats.","output":"An eco-epidemiological study of Morbilli-related paramyxovirus infection in Madagascar bats reveals host-switching as the dominant macro-evolutionary mechanism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Platelet indices are inexpensive, easily accessible parameters and potentially useful prognostic indicators in sepsis.

Platelet count (PLT), mean-platelet-volume (MPV), platelet-distribution-width (PDW) and plateletcrit (PCT) on admission, and third, fifth and last days of hospitalization were analyzed. Fractional change in platelet indices (MPV(72h,) PDW(72h), PCT(72h), and PLT(72h)) by day-3 were calculated. Unpaired and paired t-tests were used to compare survivors with non-survivors, and to study the change in platelet indices with time. Logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. ROC-curves and optimum cut-offs to predict mortality were obtained. There were 64 survivors. Non-survivors had significantly higher MPV(72h,) PDW(72h,) day-1 MPV and PDW, and lower PLT(72h). MPV and PDW increased, and PLT decreased with time among non-survivors. Trends were reversed in survivors. Only MPV and PDW showed significant change by day-3. Both were independent predictors of mortality on multivariate analysis, alongside MPV(72h) and PLT(72h). On ROC analysis, MPV, PDW, MPV(72h,) PDW(72h) and PLT(72h) effectively predicted mortality.

To determine whether IL-6 inhibition is associated with an increased occurrence of secondary infections in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We retrospectively reviewed the medical record of patients during an 8-week span and compared the incidence of secondary infection in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. The study was approved by the IRB. Additionally, we included representative histopathologic post-mortem findings from several COVID-19 cases that underwent autopsy at our institution. The study was conducted in a cohorted COVID-19 ICU at a tertiary care university medical center. Patients 18 years of age or older admitted to the adult COVID-19 intensive care unit with COVID-19 were randomly selected. We reviewed the occurrence and nature of secondary infections and clinical outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Measures were formulated prior to the study. For autopsy findings, we were interested in the lung pathology. 60 patients were selected of which 28 had received tocilizumab while 32 had not.

Noncoding RNAs have been shown to be crucial regulators of toxicological processes and as promising biomarkers for toxicity monitoring and prevention of mycotoxin contamination. Herein, we characterized genome-wide transcriptional profiling of porcine intestinal epithelial cells upon DON exposure and illustrated a subset of miRNAs and lncRNAs involved in the cellular processes by targeting genes associated with stress responses. A total of 110 differential expression miRNAs and 143 differential expression lncRNAs were identified between the DON exposure and control cell samples. Interactive network analysis showed that miR-330 was one hub noncoding RNA, expression of which was significantly increased upon DON exposure. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the genes involved in the networks were mainly enriched in the terms of plasma membrane bounded cell projection assembly, mRNA processing, and regulation of mitochondrion organization. Further functional analysis revealed that high expression of miR-330 inhibits the reactive oxygen species production, cell apoptosis, and autophagic flux in cells upon DON exposure. Luciferase assay further indicated that miR-330 could directly target MAPK15. Knockdown of MAPK15 resulted in decreased reactive oxygen species level and cell apoptosis induced by DON, indicating the existence of miR-330-MAPK15 regulatory axis in regulating DON toxicity. Our work shed novel insights into the mode of action of DON at cellular level and indicated the potential of miR-330 as a biomarker for toxicity monitoring of DON contamination, which contributes to the development of effective biomonitoring and prevention strategies to reduce the toxicological effects of DON.","output":"Genome-wide transcriptional profiling and functional analysis reveal miR-330-MAPK15 axis involving in cellular responses to deoxynivalenol exposure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To dispose of the medical waste generated during the COVID-19 pandemic, a new type of mobile emergency incinerator (MEI) was used in Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China, and consequently, it produced a number of medical bottom ashs (MBAs). In this study, the characterization and environmental risk evaluation of these MBAs were conducted to evaluate the disposal effect of this MEI used during the pandemic. Three types of leaching tests, EN 12457C2, TCLP 1311, and HJ/T 299C2007, were compared to investigate the release behaviors of major and trace elements from these MBAs. Lack of detection of COVID-19 in MBAs showed that this mobile emergency incinerator could thoroughly eliminate the COVID-19 virus in medical wastes to avoid secondary transmission. The results indicated that the increasing usage of chlorinated disinfectants and physiological saline solutions resulted in high Cl contents in MBAs. In addition, the increasing usage of polypropylene (PP) products changed the chemical properties and compositions of MBAs, with Ca as the main element. The leachability investigation revealed that the main metals in leachates were Ca, Na and K, and the toxic heavy metals such as Zn, Pb, Cu, and Cr in MBAs were difficult to extract because of the high pH (>12) of these MBAs. This study could provide consultation for the treatment and management of MBAs produced from MEIs dealing with emergent infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","output":"Characterization and evaluation of the leachability of bottom ash from a mobile emergency incinerator of COVID-19 medical waste: A case study in Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed the life and security of most of the world countries, and especially of the Western countries, without similar experiences in the recent past. In a first phase, the response of health systems and governments was disorganized, but then incisive, also driven by the fear of a new and dramatic phenomenon. In the second phase, several governments, including Italy, accepted the doctrine of coexistence with the virus by putting into practice a series of containment measures aimed at limiting the dramatic sanitary consequences while not jeopardizing the economic and social stability of the country. Here, we present a new mathematical approach to modeling the COVID-19 dynamics that accounts for typical evolution parameters (i.e., virus variants, vaccinations, containment measurements). Reproducing the COVID-19 epidemic spread is an extremely challenging task due to the low reliability of the available data, the lack of recurrent patterns, and the considerable amount and variability of the involved parameters. However, the adoption of fairly uniform criteria among the Italian regions enabled to test and optimize the model in various conditions leading to robust and interesting results. Although the regional variability is quite large and difficult to predict, we have retrospectively obtained reliable indications on which measures were the most appropriate to limit the transmissibility coefficients within detectable ranges for all the regions. To complicate matters further, the rapid spread of the English variant has upset contexts where the propagation of contagion was close to equilibrium conditions, decreeing success or failure of a certain measure. Finally, we assessed the effectiveness of the zone assignment criteria, highlighting how the reactivity of the measures plays a fundamental role in limiting the spread of the infection and thus the total number of deaths, the most important factor in assessing the success of epidemic management.","output":"Integro-differential approach for modeling the COVID-19 dynamics - Impact of confinement measures in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. The impacts on mortality of both the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and the interventions to manage it differ between countries. The Rapid Mortality Surveillance System set up by the South African Medical Research Council based on data from the National Population Register (NPR) provides a means of tracking this impact on mortality in South Africa. Objectives. To report on the change in key metrics of mortality (numbers of deaths, life expectancy at birth, life expectancy at age 60, and infant, under-5, older child and adolescent, young adult, and adult mortality) over the period 2015 - 2020. The key features of the impact are contrasted with those measured in other countries. Methods. The numbers of registered deaths by age and sex recorded on the NPR were increased to account for both registered deaths that are not captured by the NPR and an estimate of deaths not reported. The estimated numbers of deaths together with estimates of the numbers in the population in the middle of each of the years were used to produce life tables and calculate various indicators. Results. Between 2019 and 2020, the number of deaths increased by nearly 53-000 (65% female), and life expectancy at birth fell by 1 year for females and by only 2.5 months for males. Life expectancy at age 60 decreased by 1.6 years for females and 1.2 years for males. Infant mortality, under-5 mortality and mortality of children aged 5 - 14 decreased by 22%, 20% and 10%, respectively, while that for older children and adolescents decreased by 11% for males and 5% for females. Premature adult mortality, the probability of a 15-year-old dying before age 60, increased by 2% for males and 9% for females. Conclusions. COVID-19 and the interventions to manage it had differential impacts on mortality by age and sex. The impact of the epidemic on life expectancy in 2020 differs from that in most other, mainly developed, countries, both in the limited decline and also in the greater impact on females. These empirical estimates of life expectancy and mortality rates are not reflected by estimates from agencies, either because agency estimates have yet to be updated for the impact of the epidemic or because they have not allowed for the impact correctly. Trends in weekly excess deaths suggest that the drop in life expectancy in 2021 will be greater than that in 2020.","output":"The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic on mortality in South Africa in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mRNA 5 cap structure serves both to protect transcripts from degradation and promote their translation. Cap removal is thus an integral component of mRNA turnover that is carried out by cellular decapping enzymes, whose activity is tightly regulated and coupled to other stages of the mRNA decay pathway. The poxvirus vaccinia virus (VACV) encodes its own decapping enzymes, D9 and D10, that act on cellular and viral mRNA, but may be regulated differently than their cellular counterparts. Here, we evaluated the targeting potential of these viral enzymes using RNA sequencing from cells infected with wild-type and decapping mutant versions of VACV as well as in uninfected cells expressing D10. We found that D9 and D10 target an overlapping subset of viral transcripts but that D10 plays a dominant role in depleting the vast majority of human transcripts, although not in an indiscriminate manner. Unexpectedly, the splicing architecture of a gene influences how robustly its corresponding transcript is targeted by D10, as transcripts derived from intronless genes are less susceptible to enzymatic decapping by D10. As all VACV genes are intronless, preferential decapping of transcripts from intron-containing genes provides an unanticipated mechanism for the virus to disproportionately deplete host transcripts and remodel the infected cell transcriptome.","output":"Vaccinia virus D10 has broad decapping activity that is regulated by mRNA splicing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyzes the co-movements of prices of fossil fuels, energy stock markets and EU allowances. This analysis is conducted in order to identify the spillover effect of volatility and correlation among these financial markets, and to provide a scientific basis that shows the interest of incorporating sustainable assets in the design of minimum risk strategies of investment. To achieve this goal, we have used a Vector Autoregressive-Dynamic Conditional Correlation-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (VAR-DCC-GARCH) model that also incorporates a stock index of industrial companies as a leading indicator of the level of economic activity. In addition, the paper conducts an impulse response analysis to determine how unexpected shocks to prices are propagated along time, and, in particular, how they affect prices of the others, both in mean, variance and correlation. Therefore, the results of this one- and two-dimensional analysis allow for the study of short and long run dynamics of the relationship among those prices, thus, providing greater meaning and information for investors, which has implications for building their portfolios. The analyzed period was from January 2010 to February 2021, so that the data include half of phase II, full phase III and the onset of phase IV of the EU ETS, as well as the COVID-19 outbreak in the European context. We also analyzed whether the EUA price impulses the demand of clean energy stocks, which has important implications for the objective of triggering the investment in clean energy. Our results show the transmission mechanism of all of those prices, which are relevant not only for investors but also for policymakers to construct an early-warning system, revealing the most important transmission channels. Moreover, from an investment viewpoint, we observe a decline in dirty energies and a rise in the clean energy market, which might be an indication of the progress towards the energy transition to renewables sources within a circular economy perspective. Therefore, this shows that the EU ETS is achieving its goals, and that clean energy companies, aligned with their role towards socially responsible initiatives, are also gaining acceptance in terms of investments, which would be beneficial for the environment.","output":"Co-Movements between Eu Ets and the Energy Markets: A Var-Dcc-Garch Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVAXIN was granted restricted emergency approval based on safety and immunogenicity studies alone. The approval was heavily questioned leading to controversy regarding safety concerns and unethical trial allegations resulting in lack of trust and vaccine hesitancy among common people. In this article, we aimed to review the scientific evidence regarding the safety and immunogenicity of COVAXIN. Adverse events reported in phase-I/II COVAXIN trials were mild to moderate with no serious adverse events. The incidence of adverse events due to COVAXIN was comparable to other inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines like BBIBP-CorV and CoronaVac. COVAXIN has also demonstrated a similar immunogenicity profile and enhanced immune response as reported by other inactivated vaccines. COVAXIN has demonstrated an enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune response among vaccine recipients. COVAXIN vaccinated human serum has also shown comparable antibody neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7, B.1.617, and other heterologous strains. Evidence suggests that COVAXIN is a safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine.

However, evidence shaping treatment decisions, particularly for treatment-refractory cases, is sparse. Both rituximab and eculizumab may be considered as therapeutic options for refractory MG after insufficient symptom control by standard immunosuppressive therapies. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we included 57 rituximab-treated and 20 eculizumab-treated patients with MG to compare the efficacy of treatment agents in generalised, therapy-refractory anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody (anti-AChR-ab)-mediated MG with an observation period of 24 months. Change in the quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) score was defined as the primary outcome parameter. Differences between groups were determined in an optimal full propensity score matching model. RESULTS: Both groups were comparable in terms of clinical and demographic characteristics. Eculizumab was associated with a better outcome compared with rituximab, as measured by the change of the QMG score at 12 and 24 months of treatment. Minimal manifestation of disease was more frequently achieved in eculizumab-treated patients than rituximab-treated patients at 12 and 24 months after baseline. However, the risk of myasthenic crisis (MC) was not ameliorated in either group. INTERPRETATION: This retrospective, observational study provides the first real-world evidence supporting the use of eculizumab for the treatment of refractory, anti-AChR-ab positive MG.

We focused on predicting the peaks (time and size) in positive cases, active cases and new infections. We applied the approach to data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of treatment with colchicine on cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial (the Greek Study in the Effects of Colchicine in COVID-19 Complications Prevention), 105 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were randomized in a 1:1 allocation from April 3 to April 27, 2020, to either standard medical treatment or colchicine with standard medical treatment. The study took place in 16 tertiary hospitals in Greece. INTERVENTION: Colchicine administration (1.5-mg loading dose followed by 0.5 mg after 60 min and maintenance doses of 0.5 mg twice daily) with standard medical treatment for as long as 3 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end points were (1) maximum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin level; (2) time for C-reactive protein to reach more than 3 times the upper reference limit; and (3) time to deterioration by 2 points on a 7-grade clinical status scale, ranging from able to resume normal activities to death. Secondary end points were (1) the percentage of participants requiring mechanical ventilation, (2) all-cause mortality, and (3) number, type, severity, and seriousness of adverse events. The primary efficacy analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: A total of 105 patients were evaluated (61 [58.1%] men; median [interquartile range] age, 64 [54-76] years) with 50 (47.6%) randomized to the control group and 55 (52.4%) to the colchicine group. Median (interquartile range) peak high-sensitivity cardiac troponin values were 0.0112 (0.0043-0.0093) ng/mL in the control group and 0.008 (0.004-0.0135) ng/mL in the colchicine group (P = .34). Median (interquartile range) maximum C-reactive protein levels were 4.5 (1.4-8.9) mg/dL vs 3.1 (0.8-9.8) mg/dL (P = .73), respectively. The clinical primary end point rate was 14.0% in the control group (7 of 50 patients) and 1.8% in the colchicine group (1 of 55 patients) (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01-0.96; P = .02). Mean (SD) event-free survival time was 18.6 (0.83) days the in the control group vs 20.7 (0.31) in the colchicine group (log rank P = .03). Adverse events were similar in the 2 groups, except for diarrhea, which was more frequent with colchicine group than the control group (25 patients [45.5%] vs 9 patients [18.0%]; P = .003).

Here we report that astrocytes also play a role in cortical neurons' vulnerability to Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infection through the release of extracellular ATP. We found that the interaction of HSV-1 with heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed on the plasma membrane of astrocytes triggered phospholipase C-mediated IP3 -dependent intracellular Ca2+ transients causing extracellular release of ATP. ATP binds membrane purinergic P2 receptors (P2Rs) of both neurons and astrocytes causing an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration that activates the Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK)-3?, whose action is necessary for HSV-1 entry/replication in these cells. Indeed, in co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes HSV-1-infected neurons were only found in proximity of infected astrocytes releasing ATP, whereas in the presence of fluorocitrate, an inhibitor of astrocyte metabolism, switching-off the HSV-1-induced ATP release, very few neurons were infected. The addition of exogenous ATP, mimicking that released by astrocytes after HSV-1 challenge, restored the ability of HSV-1 to infect neurons co-cultured with metabolically-inhibited astrocytes. The ATP-activated, P2R-mediated, and GSK-3-dependent molecular pathway underlying HSV-1 infection is likely shared by neurons and astrocytes, given that the blockade of either P2Rs or GSK-3 activation inhibited infection of both cell types. These results add a new layer of information to our understanding of the critical role played by astrocytes in regulating neuronal functions and their response to noxious stimuli including microbial agents via Ca2+ -dependent release of neuroactive molecules.","output":"Ca2+ -dependent release of ATP from astrocytes affects herpes simplex virus type 1 infection of neurons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. INTRODUCTION: The Russian Federation reported one of the largest number of COVID-19 infections. In spring 2020 social distancing, travel bans, the cancellation of sporting and other mass participation events, and changes to work practices have dramatically affected daily life throughout the country. Major restrictions were introduced on the 28th March 2020 with the level of restrictions varied depending on the epidemiology of the virus from region to region. Cities with a large number of cases had the most strict restrictions such as limitations on any outdoor activities. In cities with a smaller number of cases limitations were less strict, especially with outdoor activities. Indoor sport activities were limited across the country and outdoor sports were restricted C depending on the situation in the region. The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the levels of physical activity among adults in Russia. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected during the period of tightest restrictions between 26 April 2020 and 6 June 2020. The link on the on-line survey was distributed through the regional centers of public health. Eligible participants included all Russian adults aged 18 years and over. Participants reported frequency and duration of walking, moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity, and muscle strengthening activities before COVID-19 and during the past seven days. RESULTS: A convenience sample of 2432 adults from 62 regions of Russia completed a 15-min self-report questionnaire. Participants were primarily female (83%). Compared with before COVID-19, physical activity was adversely affected during COVID-19. The average time spent in MPA and VPA each declined by around 12 minutes per day (42.43  37.57 to 30.44  35.35 and 37.79  37.80 to 26.56  34.69, respectively [all P < 0.001]). The number of minutes per day spent walking decreased by around 20 minutes from 60.5  38.66 to 40.83  38.6 (P < 0.001). The proportion of participants who met the WHO Guidelines for physical activity declined from 68% to 49% (P < 0.001). The proportion who participated in muscle strengthening activities for 2 or more days per week declined from 53% to 45% (P < 0.001). Compared with those who did not use online PA resources, those who did were 1.4 (95%CI 1.3, 1.5) and 1.9 (95%CI 1.8, 2.1) times more likely to meet the recommendations for PA and for muscle-strengthening activities, respectively. CONCLUSION: Effective health promotion strategies directed at adopting or maintain positive health-related behaviors such as targeted social media messaging and balanced media reporting, should be used to increase the physical activity during these unprecedented times.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity: Results of the Russian online survey on spring 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of the current pandemic on ophthalmology residency training in Saudi Arabia, focusing on its effects on clinical education, training, and the mental well-being of the trainees. METHODS: An online self-administered questionnaire was distributed among residents in the Saudi ophthalmology training programs between July 7 and 14, 2020. In this study, we explored residents opinions regarding training disruption and virtual education. The patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess the COVID-19 pandemics impact on their mental health. We used descriptive statistics for data analysis. RESULTS: Out of 183 registered ophthalmology residents, 142 participated in this study. Ninety-six participants (35.4%) were rotated at a specialized eye hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, while 52 (19.2%) had rotations in the ophthalmology department at general hospitals. Those who rotated in both types of hospitals were 123 (45.4%). According to the participants, there was a significant decline in exposure to surgical and office-based procedures compared to emergency eye consultations (Friedman P <0.001). The COVID-19 pandemics effect on mental health was reported by 100 (70.5%) participants. Eighty-five (55.4%) respondents were satisfied with the virtual method of education.

We developed an efficient, rapid, and scalable surveillance strategy to detect remaining COVID-19 community cases through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not require reinstatement. METHODS: We compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of the following: hospital cases; fever, cough and/or ARI testing at community/primary care; and asymptomatic testing; using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities, reproductive number (R) and weekly cumulative incidence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 respiratory symptoms using data from Australia. We assessed system requirements to identify all transmission chains and follow up all cases and primary contacts within each chain, per million population. RESULTS: Assuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and 30% of symptomatic COVID-19 cases present for testing, with R = 2.2, a median of 14 unrecognised community cases (8 infectious) occur when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 7 unrecognised cases (4 infectious) through community-based surveillance. The 7 unrecognised community upstream cases are estimated to generate a further 55-77 primary contacts requiring follow-up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 10 if 50% of cases are asymptomatic. Screening asymptomatic community members cannot exhaustively identify all cases under any of the scenarios assessed. The most important determinant of testing requirements for symptomatic screening is levels of non-COVID-19 respiratory illness. If 4% of the community have respiratory symptoms, and 1% of those with symptoms have COVID-19, exhaustive symptomatic screening requires approximately 11,600 tests/million population using 1/4 pooling, with 98% of cases detected (2% missed), given 99.9% sensitivity. Even with a drop in sensitivity to 70%, pooling was more effective at detecting cases than individual testing under all scenarios examined. CONCLUSIONS: Screening all acute respiratory disease in the community, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of COVID-19 community transmission. An important component is identification, testing, and management of all contacts, including upstream contacts (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains). Pooling allows increased case detection when testing capacity is limited, even given reduced test sensitivity. Critical to the effectiveness of all aspects of surveillance is appropriate community engagement, messaging to optimise testing uptake and compliance with other measures.","output":"Exit strategies: optimising feasible surveillance for detection, elimination, and ongoing prevention of COVID-19 community transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The identification of active binding drugs for target proteins (referred to as drug-target interaction prediction) is the key challenge in virtual screening, which plays an essential role in drug discovery. Although recent deep learning-based approaches achieve better performance than molecular docking, existing models often neglect topological or spatial of intermolecular information, hindering prediction performance. We recognize this problem and propose a novel approach called the Intermolecular Graph Transformer (IGT) that employs a dedicated attention mechanism to model intermolecular information with a three-way Transformer-based architecture. IGT outperforms state-of-the-art (SoTA) approaches by 9.1% and 20.5% over the second best option for binding activity and binding pose prediction, respectively, and exhibits superior generalization ability to unseen receptor proteins than SoTA approaches.

In particular, we assume that an epidemic spreads stochastically on a scale-free network and that each infected individual in the network gains a temporary immunity after its infectious period is over. After the temporary immunity period is over, the individual becomes susceptible to the virus again. When the underlying contact network is embedded in Euclidean geometry, we model three different intervention strategies that aim to control the spread of the epidemic: social distancing, restrictions on travel, and restrictions on maximal number of social contacts per node. Our first finding is that on a finite network, a long enough average immunity period leads to extinction of the pandemic after the first peak, analogous to the concept of herd immunity. For each model, there is a critical average immunity duration L(c) above which this happens. Our second finding is that all three interventions manage to flatten the first peak (the travel restrictions most efficiently), as well as decrease the critical immunity duration L(c), but elongate the epidemic. However, when the average immunity duration L is shorter than L(c), the price for the flattened first peak is often a high second peak: for limiting the maximal number of contacts, the second peak can be as high as 1/3 of the first peak, and twice as high as it would be without intervention. Thirdly, interventions introduce oscillations into the system and the time to reach equilibrium is, for almost all scenarios, much longer. We conclude that network-based epidemic models can show a variety of behaviors that are not captured by the continuous compartmental models.","output":"Not all interventions are equal for the height of the second peak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) highlight the importance of investments in early childhood care and education (ECCE) for young children and youth development. Given Pakistan's large young population and gender and urban-rural inequalities in access to education, training and employment, such investments offer opportunities. LEAPS is a youth-led ECCE program that trains female youth, 18-24 years, as Community Youth Leaders (CYLs) to deliver high quality ECCE for children, 3.5-5.5 years, in rural Sindh, Pakistan. Methods: We use a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial to evaluate implementation of LEAPS. Ninety nine clusters will be randomized to receive the intervention in one of three seven-month steps (33 clusters/step). Primary outcomes are children's school readiness (measured with the International Development and Early Learning Assessment) and executive functions. Secondary outcomes are youth personal and professional development, depressive symptoms, and executive functions. Data is collected in cross-sectional surveys of 1,089 children (11 children/cluster from 99 clusters) aged 4.5-5.5 years at four time points (baseline and at the end of each step). We will enroll three youth participant open cohorts, one per step (33 CYLs: 66 comparison youth per cohort; 99:198 in total). Youth cohorts will be assessed at enrollment and every six to seven months thereafter (i.e., once per consecutive Step). A school cohort of 330 LEAPS students (10 students/cluster from 33 clusters) will be enrolled and assessed during Step 1 after intervention rollout and at endline. The quality of the learning environment will be assessed in each LEAPS ECCE center and in a comparison center at two time points midway following rollout and at endline. A concurrent mixed-methods implementation evaluation will assess program fidelity and quality, as well as the extent to which a technical support strategy is successful in strengthening systems for program expansion. A cost evaluation will assess cost-per-beneficiary. Data collection for implementation and cost evaluations will occur in Step 3. Discussion: Youth-led models for ECCE offer a promising approach to support young children and youth; however, there is little empirical evidence on real-world implementation. This study will contribute to the evidence as a means to promote sustainable human development across multiple SDG targets.","output":"Evaluating implementation of LEAPS, a youth-led early childhood care and education intervention in rural Pakistan: protocol for a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has led to major changes in the delivery of medical care around the globe.

We found that compared with the original VP1 vaccine, ABD-fused VP1 (ABD-VP1) vaccine gained the new ability to efficiently bind murine albumin both in vitro and in vivo, possessed a much longer serum half-life in serum and exhibited more abundance in the dLNs after immunization. Accordingly, ABD-VP1 immunization not only significantly facilitated the enrichment and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), induced higher percentages of IFN-(+) CD8(+) cells in the dLNs, but also robustly promoted VP1-induced T cell proliferation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in the spleens.

We evaluated the feasibility of a predefined multifaceted individualized pneumoperitoneum strategy aiming at the lowest possible intra-abdominal pressure during laparoscopic colorectal surgery. METHODS Multicenter prospective study in patients scheduled for laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The strategy consisted of ventilation with low tidal volume, a modified lithotomy position, deep neuromuscular blockade, pre-stretching of the abdominal wall, and individualized intra-abdominal pressure titration; the effect was blindly evaluated by the surgeon. The primary endpoint was the proportion of surgical procedures completed at each individualized intra-abdominal pressure level. Secondary endpoints were the respiratory system driving pressure, and the estimated volume of insufflated CO2 gas needed to perform the surgical procedure. RESULTS Ninety-two patients were enrolled in the study. Fourteen cases were converted to open surgery for reasons not related to the strategy. The intervention was feasible in all patients and well-accepted by all surgeons. In 61 out of 78 patients (78%), surgery was performed and completed at the lowest possible IAP, 8 mmHg. In 17 patients, IAP was raised up to 12 mmHg. The relationship between IAP and driving pressure was almost linear. The mean estimated intra-abdominal CO2 volume at which surgery was performed was 3.2 L.

Ventilation may exert detrimental hemodynamic effects that must be balanced with its expected benefits. The risks of hyperventilation have been thoroughly addressed, even questioning the need for ventilation, emphasizing the need to prioritize chest compression quality. However, ventilation is mandatory for adequate gas exchange as soon as CPR is prolonged. Factors affecting the capability of chest compressions to produce alveolar ventilation are poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the conventional interpretation of interactions between ventilation and circulation, from the perspective of novel physiological observations. RECENT FINDINGS Many patients with cardiac arrest exhibit 'intrathoracic airway closure.' This phenomenon is associated with lung volume reduction, impedes chest compressions to generate ventilation and overall limits the delivered ventilation. This phenomenon can be reversed by the application of small levels of positive end-expiratory pressure. Also, a novel interpretation of the capnogram can rate the magnitude of this phenomenon, contributing to clarify the physiological meaning of exhaled CO2 and may help assess the real amount of delivered ventilation.

Amid the global public health threats posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, active cooperative governance has gradually emerged as the most powerful weapon against its spread. To facilitate international cooperation for pandemic governance, this paper applied the evolutionary game theory to analyze the factors influencing active cooperative governance and, based on the results, proposed a series of recommendations for promoting international cooperation. (1) leveraging the role of international organizations to reduce the cost of realizing the strategy of active cooperative governance, (2) promoting the international exchange of related experiences to lower the cost of active pandemic governance, (3) sustaining productive and daily activities during the pandemic in a classified and hierarchical manner to reduce the economic loss incurred by active pandemic governance, and (4) optimizing the incentive measures of international organizations to facilitate the selection of active cooperative governance. Finally, from the four aspects of resource management of pandemic treatment, supply management of living materials, population flow cooperation management, and governance fund cooperation management, this paper gives the path of international pandemic cooperative governance.","output":"Research on International Cooperative Governance of the COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Endoscopic therapy (ET) and esophagectomy result in similar survival for Barrett's esophagus (BE) with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or T1a esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), but the long-term quality of life (QOL) has not been compared. AIMS We aimed to compare long-term QOL between patients who had undergone ET versus esophagectomy. METHODS Patients were included if they underwent ET or esophagectomy at the University of Michigan since 2000 for the treatment of HGD or T1a EAC. Two validated survey QOL questionnaires were mailed to the patients. We compared QOL between and within groups (ET = 91, esophagectomy = 62), adjusting for covariates. RESULTS The median time since initial intervention was 6.8 years. Compared to esophagectomy, ET patients tended to be older, had a lower prevalence of EAC, and had a shorter duration since therapy. ET patients had worse adjusted physical and role functioning than esophagectomy patients. However, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of having symptoms was significantly less with ET for diarrhea (0.287; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.114, 0.724), trouble eating (0.207; 0.0766, 0.562), choking (0.325; 0.119, 0.888), coughing (0.291; 0.114, 0.746), and speech difficulty (0.306; 0.0959, 0.978). Amongst the ET patients, we found that the number of therapy sessions and need for dilation were associated with worse outcomes. DISCUSSION Multiple measures of symptom status were better with ET compared to esophagectomy following treatment of BE with HGD or T1a EAC. We observed worse long-term physical and role functioning in ET patients which could reflect unmeasured baseline functional status rather than a causal effect of ET.","output":"Long-Term Quality of Life Following Endoscopic Therapy Compared to Esophagectomy for Neoplastic Barrett's Esophagus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cobalt catalysts supported on Y zeolite and mesoporized Y zeolite (Y-mod) have been studied in steam reforming of ethanol (SRE). Specifically, the effect of the mesoporosity and the acidity of the y zeolite as a support has been explored. Mesoporous were generated on Y zeolite by treatment with NH4F and the acidity was neutralized by Na incorporation. Four cobalt catalysts supported on Y zeolite have been prepared, two using Y zeolite without mesoporous (Co/Y, Co/Y-Na), and two using Y zeolite with mesoporous (Co/Y-mod and Co/Y-mod-Na). All catalysts showed a high activity, with ethanol conversion values close to 100%. The main differences were found in the distribution of the reaction products. Co/Y and Co/Y-mod catalysts showed high selectivity to ethylene and low hydrogen production, which was explained by their high acidity. On the contrary, neutralization of the acid sites could explain the higher hydrogen selectivity and the lower ethylene yields exhibited by the Co/Y-Na and Co/Y-mod-Na. In addition, the physicochemical characterization of these catalysts by XRD, BET surface area, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and TEM allowed to connect the presence of mesoporous with the formation of metallic cobalt particles with small size, high dispersion, and with high interaction with the zeolitic support, explaining the high reforming activity exhibited by the co/y-mod-Na sample as well as its higher hydrogen selectivity. It has been also observed that the formation of coke is affected by the presence of mesoporous and acidity. Both properties seem to have an opposite effect on the reforming catalyst, decreasing and increasing the coke deposition, respectively.","output":"Sustainable Production of Hydrogen by Steam Reforming of Ethanol Using Cobalt Supported on Nanoporous Zeolitic Material"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study discusses the intersection between the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) and the Anti-Monopoly Act (AMA) in Japan, by focusing on abusing superior bargaining position from platform operators. My analysis is based on examinations of the provisions and related guidelines of AMA, the relevant provisions of APPI, and comparisons between the two regulations. Based on these findings: (1) most of the types of abuse which the Guidelines on Abusing Superior Bargaining Position (ASBP Guidelines) presented by Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) overlap with APPI provisions; (2) restrictions on abusing superior bargaining positions could play a specific role by applying itself to profiling activities which APPI might not effectively regulate. However, the possibility for indefinitely expanding the scope of superior bargaining position and the scarce experiences of administrative fines would be challenges for AMA. In addition, clarifying the theoretical reason to incorporate privacy and personal data protection into AMA would be a fundamental issue. Other than abusing superior bargaining positions, cooperation or conflict between anti-monopoly law and protection of personal information law need to be carefully examined depending on the situation, such as refusal of deal, and merger. While privacy and personal data must be the first priority in laws designed to protect personal information, competition law and other adjacent laws are increasingly significant. Studying them can offer a different perspective on the protection of personal information.","output":"A Study on Abusing Superior Bargaining Position in the Anti-Monopoly Act and Its Relation to the Act on the Protection of Personal Information in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global dispersal and increasing frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant D614G are suggestive of a selective advantage but may also be due to a random founder effect. We investigate the hypothesis for positive selection of spike D614G in the United Kingdom using more than 25,000 whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Despite the availability of a large dataset, well represented by both spike 614 variants, not all approaches showed a conclusive signal of positive selection. Population genetic analysis indicates that 614G increases in frequency relative to 614D in a manner consistent with a selective advantage. We do not find any indication that patients infected with the spike 614G variant have higher COVID-19 mortality or clinical severity, but 614G is associated with higher viral load and younger age of patients. Significant differences in growth and size of 614G phylogenetic clusters indicate a need for continued study of this variant.","output":"Evaluating the Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Mutation D614G on Transmissibility and Pathogenicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Resource planning is essential for successful transport of the mechanically ventilated patient. Mechanically ventilated patients require adequate oxygen supplies to ensure transport is completed without incident. The LTV-1000 portable ventilator utilizes a program to calculate oxygen cylinder duration, based on cylinder size, fraction of inspired oxygen (F(IO(2))), and current minute ventilation. We evaluated the accuracy of the cylinder-duration algorithm in a laboratory setting. METHODS The LTV-1000 was attached to a test lung. Lung compliance was set at 0.04 L/cm H(2)O, and airway resistance was 5.0 cm H(2)O/L/s. We tested 7 different combinations of ventilator settings a minimum of 2 times each. With each setting, minute ventilation was kept at 10 L/min. Breath type, positive end-expiratory pressure, and F(IO(2)) were varied to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm across a range of clinical scenarios. The cylinder-duration calculation from the ventilator program and manual calculation was determined at each setting and compared to the actual cylinder duration. RESULTS The ventilator algorithm and the manual calculation underestimated the actual cylinder duration by 12 +/- 3% with each test. The range of differences between calculated and actual cylinder duration was 2-26 min across the 7 conditions. CONCLUSION Actual cylinder duration averaged 12% longer than the cylinder duration estimated by the algorithm of the LTV-1000. One explanation is that the E cylinders may contain more liters of oxygen than indicated by the sticker on the side of the tank. Additionally, the bias flow during expiration is affected by inspiratory-expiratory ratio and respiratory rate. Clinicians should be aware of these differences when planning for patient transport.","output":"Accuracy of the oxygen cylinder duration calculator of the LTV-1000 portable ventilator."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: To develop time\\\\dependent doseCresponse models for highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) of the H5N1 subtype virus.

We reviewed the current evidence on the transmission dynamics and on pathogenic and clinical features of COVID-19 to critically identify any gaps in the current infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines. METHODS: In this study, we reviewed global COVID-19 IPC guidelines by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Guidelines from 2 high-income countries (Australia and United Kingdom) and from 1 middle-income country (China) were also reviewed. We searched publications in English on PubMed and Google Scholar. We extracted information related to COVID-19 transmission dynamics, clinical presentations, and exposures that may facilitate transmission. We then compared these findings with the recommended IPC measures. RESULTS: Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings occurs through droplets, aerosols, and the oralCfecal or fecalCdroplet route. However, the IPC guidelines fail to cover all transmission modes, and the recommendations also conflict with each other. Most guidelines recommend surgical masks for healthcare providers during routine care and N95 respirators for aerosol-generating procedures. However, recommendations regarding the type of face mask varied, and the CDC recommends cloth masks when surgical masks are unavailable. CONCLUSION: IPC strategies should consider all the possible routes of transmission and should target all patient care activities involving risk of person-to-person transmission. This review may assist international health agencies in updating their guidelines.","output":"Current knowledge of COVID-19 and infection prevention and control strategies in healthcare settings: A global analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recent report suggested that 2 novel bunyaviruses discovered in insects in C?te dIvoire caused lethal disease in swine in South Korea.

In the Republic of Ireland, the first national lockdown was decreed on 23rd of March 2020, followed by a succession of restriction increases and decreases (phases) over the the following year. To date, the effects of these interventions remain unclear, and particularly within differing population subsets. The current study sought to assess the impact of individual NPI phases on COVID-19 transmission patterns within delineated population subgroups in the Republic of Ireland. Methods and Findings Confirmed, anonymised COVID-19 cases occurring between the 29th of February 2020 and 30th November 2020 (n= 72,654) were obtained. Segmented modelling via breakpoint regression with multiple turning points was employed to identify structural breaks across sub-populations, including primary/secondary infections, age deciles, urban/commuter/rural areas, patients with underlying health conditions, and socio-demographic profiles. These were subsequently compared with initiation dates of eight overarching NPI phases. Five distinct breakpoints were identified. The first breakpoint, associated with a decrease in the daily COVID-19 incidence, was reported within 14 days of the first set of restrictions in mid-March 2020 for most population sub-groups. Results suggest that moderately strict NCIs were more effective than the strictest Phase 5 (National Lockdown). Divergences were observed across population sub-groups; lagged response times were observed among populations >80 years, residents of rural/ commuter regions, and cases associated with a below-median deprivation score. Conclusions Study findings suggest that many NPIs have been successful in decreasing COVID-19 incidence rates, however the strictest Phase 5 NPI was not. Moreover, NPIs were not equally successful across all sub-populations, with differing response times noted. Mitigation strategies and interventions may need to be increasingly bespoke, based on sub-population profiles and required responses.","output":"Breakpoint modelling of temporal associations between non-pharmaceutical interventions and the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in the Republic of Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The emergence of a new coronavirus (CoV), named 2019-nCoV, in an outbreak located in the city of Wuhan, China, has resulted in the death more than 3,400 people this year alone and has caused worldwide alarm, particularly following previous CoV epidemics, including the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012.

However, precise predictors of treatment outcomes are still lacking. This study aimed to use angiographic parametric imaging (API)-derived radiomics features to explore whether biomarkers extracted from immediate postprocedural digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were associated with complications and embolization outcomes of IAs treated with PED without adjunctive coils. METHODS Radiomic features were extracted from postprocedural DSA by API, and radiomics feature selection and radiomics score calculation were performed by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression. Angiographic findings and clinical characteristics were screened using stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify significant variables for predicting the complication endpoint. Radiomics feature selection and radiomics risk score (RadRS) calculations were performed by LASSO Cox regression. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify significant predictors for the occlusion endpoint. RESULTS We screened 281 observations for complications and 235 observations for embolization outcomes from IAs treated in our center using PED between June 2015 and July 2020. Multivariate regression analysis showed association of the radiomics score (p<0.01) and hypertension (p=0.04) with complications. RadRS (p<0.01), symptoms (p<0.01), and age (p=0.03) were predictors of embolization outcomes. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that symptomatic patients (p<0.01) and those with off-label IAs (p=0.03) had shorter intervals to complete occlusion.

METHODS: 227 pneumonia patients who visited the fever clinics in Shanghai General Hospital and 97 hospitalized COVID\\\\19 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center were involved in a retrospective research study. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected. The trend of EOS level in COVID\\\\19 patients and comparison among patients with different severity were summarized. RESULTS: The majority of COVID\\\\19 patients (71.7%) had a decrease in circulating EOS counts, which was significantly more frequent than other types of pneumonia patients. EOS counts had good value for COVID\\\\19 prediction, even higher when combined with NLR. Patients with low EOS counts at admission were more likely to have fever, fatigue and shortness of breath, with more lesions in chest CT and radiographic aggravation, longer length of hospital stay and course of disease than those with normal EOS counts. Circulating EOS level gradually increased over the time, and was synchronous with the improvement of chest CT(12days vs 13days, P=0.07), later than that of body temperature(12days vs 10days, P=0.014), but was earlier than the negative conversion of nucleic acid assays(12days vs 17days, P=0.001).

Here, we highlight how COVID-19 threatens to jeopardize the tremendous gains made over the last few decades on improving children's health globally. Recent Findings: In contrast to adults, children with COVID-19 are less likely to develop severe disease requiring hospitalization or die as a direct result of infection. However, the pandemic will likely have other important health impacts disproportionately affecting vulnerable children globally. Possible effects include worsening of poverty and food insecurity; disruption of already strained routine child health services; damage to already imperiled healthcare workforces; a wave of mental health challenges; interruption of education; and increased risks of violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect. These challenges notwithstanding, the response to COVID-19 may also provide opportunities, such as for health system strengthening, that could improve child health after the pandemic. Summary: The negative impacts of COVID-19 on global child health may be substantial. However, these are not foregone conclusions and much can be done to mitigate the worst outcomes.

This study examines the indirect impact of the pandemic on a population of critically ill children in the United States. RESEARCH QUESTION: Were there significantly fewer critically ill children admitted to PICUs during the second quarter of 2020, and were there significant changes in the types of diseases admitted? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study used the Virtual Pediatric Systems database. Participants were 160,295 children admitted to the PICU at 77 sites in the United States during quarters 1 (Q1) and 2 (Q2) of 2017 to 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and 2020 (COVID-19). RESULTS: The average number of admissions was similar between pre-COVID-19 Q1 and COVID-19 Q1 but decreased by 32% from pre-COVID-19 Q2 to COVID-19 Q2 (20,157 to 13,627 admissions per quarter).

The mechanical oscillations that occur during breathing have profound effects on airway tone and airway responsiveness both in experimental animals and humans in vivo and in isolated airway tissues in vitro. Experimental evidence suggests that alterations in the contractile and mechanical properties of airway smooth muscle tissues caused by mechanical perturbations result from adaptive changes in the organization of the cytoskeletal architecture of the smooth muscle cell. The cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure that undergoes rapid reorganization in response to external mechanical and pharmacologic stimuli. Contractile stimulation initiates the assembly of cytoskeletal/extracellular matrix adhesion complex proteins into large macromolecular signaling complexes (adhesomes) that undergo activation to mediate the polymerization and reorganization of a submembranous network of actin filaments at the cortex of the cell. Cortical actin polymerization is catalyzed by Neuronal-WiskottCAldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and the Arp2/3 complex, which are activated by pathways regulated by paxillin and the small GTPase, cdc42. These processes create a strong and rigid cytoskeletal framework that may serve to strengthen the membrane for the transmission of force generated by the contractile apparatus to the extracellular matrix, and to enable the adaptation of smooth muscle cells to mechanical stresses. This model for the regulation of airway smooth muscle function can provide novel perspectives to explain the normal physiologic behavior of the airways and pathophysiologic properties of the airways in asthma.","output":"Molecular Mechanisms for the Mechanical Modulation of Airway Responsiveness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Control of the pandemic has required countries to look for other forms of tests besides the gold standard real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rapid antigen tests (RAT), though less sensitive than RT-PCR, offer the possibility of rapid, inexpensive and early detection of the most infectious COVID-19 cases. Only very few studies have assessed the performance of the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 RAT among asymptomatic people or in Latin America. This study set out to validate this test among people attending the public test street in Sint Maarten, Dutch Caribbean. Methods: People of all ages were recruited from the public COVID-19 test street regardless of COVID-19 symptoms. They received a nasopharyngeal swab for the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 RAT and the RT-PCR Qtower. Diagnostic accuracy of the RAT was compared to the RT-PCR among the overall study population and for subgroups with/without symptoms, with/without close contact and different Ct values. Results: Using a RT-PCR Ct cut-off value of <33, 119 out of 1,411 people (8.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Most were asymptomatic (59%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAT was 84% (95% CI 76.2-90.1) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.6-100) respectively. The sensitivity reduced to 67.6% (95% CI: 49.5%, 82.6%) among people without symptoms, regardless of whether they were in close contact with a known COVID-19 case. Sensitivity reduced considerably with a Ct cut-off value of <35. Conclusions: The Abbott Panbio RAT is a valid and cheaper alternative to RT-PCR when used on symptomatic individuals among the general population. However, among asymptomatic people it should not be used as a stand-alone test and negative results should be confirmed with RT-PCR.","output":"Validation of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test (Abbott) to screen for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Sint Maarten: a diagnostic accuracy study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze the impact of COVID-19 on investment by incorporating a stochastic transmission shock into the standard [Formula: see text] theoretical framework.

Due to a lack of available real-world data, we assessed its effectiveness and safety in moderately to critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in two public/specialty hospitals in Saudi Arabia. We included patients &#8805;18 years) admitted April-August 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swab. Patients received either favipiravir (1800 mg or 1600 mg twice daily loading dose, followed by 800 mg or 600 mg twice daily) or supportive-care treatment. Patients were excluded if they were outside the study period, classified as having a mild form of the disease per WHO criteria, or had an incomplete patient file. Kaplan-Meier (KM) models were used to estimate median time to discharge. Discharge ratios, progression to mechanical ventilation, and mortality outcomes were estimated across the severity spectrum using Cox proportional-hazards models. As a sensitivity analysis, we performed propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis. RESULTS: Overall, median time to discharge was 10 days (95%CI = 9-10) in the favipiravir arm versus 15 days (95%CI = 14-16) in the supportive-care arm. The accelerated discharge benefit was seen across the COVID-19 spectrum of severity. The adjusted discharge ratio was 1.96 (95%CI = 1.56-2.46). Progression to mechanical ventilation was slower with favipiravir (HRadj = 0.10, 95%CI = 0.04-0.29). There was no significant effect on mortality (HRadj = 1.56, 95%CI = 0.73-3.36). There was a statistically non-significant trend toward worse outcomes in the critical category (HRadj = 2.80, 95%CI = 0.99-7.89). Age was an independent risk factor for mortality in mechanically ventilated patients. PSM analyses confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: Favipiravir was associated with clinical benefits, including accelerated discharge rate and less progression to mechanical ventilation; however, no overall mortality benefits were seen across the severity spectrum.","output":"Effectiveness and safety of favipiravir compared to supportive care in moderately to critically ill COVID-19 patients: a retrospective study with propensity score matching sensitivity analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a serious infectious threat to public health. To create a novel trial vaccine and evaluate its potency, we attempted to generate a SARS inactivated vaccine using SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strain F69 treated with formaldehyde and mixed with Al(OH)(3). Three doses of the vaccine were used to challenge three groups of BALB/c mice. We found that the mice exhibited specific IgM on day 4 and IgG on day 8. The peak titers of IgG were at day 47 in low-dose group (1:19,200) and high-dose group (1:38,400) whereas in middle-dose group (1:19,200), the peak was at day 40. On day 63, the IgG levels reached a plateau. Neutralization assay demonstrated that the antisera could protect Vero-E6 cells from SARS-CoV's infection. Analysis of the antibody specificity revealed that the mouse antisera contained a mixture of antibodies specifically against the structure proteins of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, the mouse antisera conferred higher amount of antibodies against protein N, polypeptide S4 and S2 than those of proteins M and 3CL. These findings suggest that the inactivated SARS-CoV could preserve its antigenicity and the inactivated vaccine can stimulate mice to produce high levels of antibodies with neutralization activity. Results also suggest that polypeptides originating from protein N or S might be a potential target for the generation of a recombinant SARS vaccine.","output":"Immunogenicity of SARS inactivated vaccine in BALB/c mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 has a significant impact on the health of people around the world. In the clinical condition of COVID-19, the condition of critical cases changes rapidly with a high mortality rate. Therefore, early prediction of disease severity and active intervention play an important role in the prognosis of severe patients. Methods: All the patients with COVID-19 in Taizhou city were retrospectively included and segregated into the non-severe and severe group according to the severity of the disease. The clinical manifestations, laboratory examination results, and imaging findings of the 2 groups were analysed for comparing the differences between the 2 groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used for screening the factors that could predict the disease, and the nomogram was constructed. Results: : A total of 143 laboratory-confirmed cases were included in the study, including 110 non-severe patients and 33 severe patients. The median age of patients was 47 years (range, 4C86 years). Fever (73.4%) and cough (63.6%) were the most common initial clinical symptoms. By using the method of multivariate logistic regression, the variables to construct nomogram include age (OR: 1.052, 95% CI: 1.020C1.086, P = 0.001), body temperature (OR: 2.252, 95% CI: 1.139C4.450, P = 0.020), lymphocyte count (OR: 1.128, 95% CI: 1.000C1.272, P = 0.049), ADA (OR: 1.163, 95% CI: 1.023C1.323, P = 0.021), PaO 2 (OR: 0.972, 95% CI: 0.953C0.992, P = 0.007), IL-10 (OR: 1.184, 95% CI: 1.037C1.351, P = 0.012), and bronchiectasis (OR: 3.818, 95% CI: 1.694C8.605, P = 0.001).

This review aimed to summarise all studies that examined the placenta or neonates following infection with SARS-CoV-2, or closely related highly pathogenic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1, or the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)). Structured literature searches found 50 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Twenty studies reported placental histopathology findings in third trimester placentas following maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using the Amsterdam Consensus criteria to categorise the histopathology results, evidence of both fetal vascular malperfusion (35.3% of cases; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 27.7-43.0%) and maternal vascular malperfusion (46% of cases; 95% CI 38.0-54.0%) were reported, along with evidence of inflammation in the placentas (villitis 8.7% cases, intervillositis 5.3% of cases, chorioamnionitis 6% of cases). The placental pathologies observed in SARS-CoV-2 were consistent with findings following maternal SARS-CoV-1 infection. Of those tested, a minority of neonates (2%) and placental samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (21%). Limited conclusions can be drawn about the effect of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on placental pathology as most lack control groups and the majority of reports followed third trimester infection. Collaboration to maximise the number of samples examined will increase the reliability and generalisability of findings.

Knowledge of the evolution of receptor-binding specificity of these viruses, which might affect host range, is urgently needed. We report that emergence of these viruses is accompanied by a change in receptor-binding specificity. In contrast to ancestral clade 2.3.4 H5 proteins, novel clade 2.3.4.4 H5 proteins bind to fucosylated sialosides because of substitutions K222Q and S227R, which are unique for highly pathogenic influenza virus H5 proteins.

It is characterized by pain and stiffness in the shoulders, arms, hips, and neck. Relapses are common in patients with PMR. Areas covered: The review describes when and how relapses occur in patients with PMR. Potential predisposing factors associated with relapses and management are also discussed. An extensive literature search on PubMed database was conducted for publications on \\"polymyalgia rheumatica\\" AND \\"relapses\\" AND \\"risk factors\\". Expert opinion: Relapses are common in PMR being observed in approximately half of the patients. They often occur when the dose of prednisone is low, generally below 5-7.5 mg/day or when the prednisone has been discontinued. Several risk factors for the development of PMR relapses have been proposed. The speed of glucocorticoid tapering is considered the main factor influencing the development of relapses in isolated PMR. In addition, a genetic component may favor the presence of relapses in isolated PMR. Studies on the involvement of HLA genes revealed that HLA-DRB1*04 patients, particularly those carrying the HLA-DRB1*0401 allele, were at increased risk of relapse. An implication of the IL-6 promoter -174 G/C polymorphism was also reported. Furthermore, PMR patients with the HLA-DRB1 * 0401 and the GG241 ICAM-1 genotype had a higher risk of relapse after correction for age and sex. With regard to serological biomarkers, elevated levels of angiopoietin-2 were associated with an unfavorable course of PMR.

Halting face-to-face tutorials resulting in decreased clinical contact for medical students. Prior to the pandemic, we had developed the Virtual Integrated Patient (VIP). Equipped with conversational technology, it provides students online practice in various clinical skills such as history-taking, physical examination and investigations. The aim of this paper is to describe the supplementary use of VIP in the second-year class, in which a pilot study was conducted. Methods: The VIP platform was introduced to the cohort and used to supplement the teaching of history-taking in the \\"Communication with Patients\\" (CWP) module for second-year students. Traditionally, CWP tutorials involve face-to-face history-taking from standardised patients (SPs). Students, who consented to participating in the trial, had an additional 3 weeks' access to VIP to practice their history-taking skills. They completed a survey on their user experience and satisfaction at the end of the 3 weeks. Results: Out of the 106 participants, 87% strongly agreed or agreed that using VIP helped in remembering the content while 69% of them felt that VIP increased their confidence and competence in history-taking. Conclusion: VIP was well-received by students and showed promise as a tool to supplement history-taking tutorials, prior to students' encounter with SPs and real patients. Hence, this trend showed its potential as an alternative when clinical rotations were delayed or cancelled. Further research can be done to evaluate its effectiveness in this context.

We assessed the adoption of increased take-home medication during COVID-19 and whether increased take-home doses is associated with clients' characteristics. METHODOLOGY: We completed a pre-post study of adults receiving methadone for OUD from an OTP in Spokane, Washington. Our outcome was the change in the number of take-home methadone doses three months before and three months after the March 2020 take-home medication exemption. Clients' characteristics included age, gender, ethnicity, education level, homelessness, spatial access to the clinic, and methamphetamine use. RESULTS: The study included 194 clients in treatment for a median of three years. All study participants experienced an average increase in take-home medication of 41.4 in the three-month period after the COVID-19 exemption. In the final adjusted models, clients who reported using methamphetamine in the last 30 days experienced a significantly larger increase in take-home dosage (55.6 days) compare to clients who did not use methamphetamine (p 0.001). Most of the clients who reported using methamphetamine were also likely to be homeless. All other variables were not associated with a change in take-home doses. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the Spokane OTP quickly expanded take-home medication dosing in response to the COVID-19 exemption and broadly expanded take-home dosing among established clients.

Multilevel regression showed that after controlling for parents and childrens demographic variables (e.g., sex and age), parents intention to vaccinate their children was higher if parents had higher levels of perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, positive attitudes, and subjective norms and if they had lower levels of perceived barriers. Positive attitudes were the strongest correlate of parents intention. These findings have important implications for public health by informing which factors authorities should address in order to boost Hong Kong parents intention to vaccinate their children.","output":"Why do Hong Kong parents have low intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19? testing health belief model and theory of planned behavior in a large-scale survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the most important complications of diabetic mellitus. It is essential for nephrologists to understand the evolution and development trends of DKD. METHODS: Based on the total cited numbers in the Web of Science Core Collection, which was searched through September 28th, 2020, we performed a bibliometric analysis of the top 100 most cited full-length original articles on the subject of DKD. The timespans, authors, contributions, subcategories, and topics of those 100 articles were analysed. In addition, the evolution of topics in DKD research was investigated. RESULTS: There were 23,968 items under the subject of DKD in the Web of Science Core Collection. The top 100 cited articles, published from 1999 to 2017, were cited 38,855 times in total. Researchers from the USA contributed the most publications. The number of articles included in Experimental studies (EG), Clinical studies (CS), Epidemiological studies (ES), and Pathological and pathophysiological studies (PP) were 65, 26, 7, and 2, respectively. Among the 15 topics, the most popular topic is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), occurring in 26 articles, including 6 of the top 10 most cited articles. The evolution of topics reveals that the role of RAAS inhibitor is a continuous hotspot, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist are two renoprotective agents which represent novel therapeutic methods in DKD. In addition, the 26 clinical studies among the top 100 most cited articles were highlighted, as they help guide clinical practice to better serve patients. CONCLUSIONS: This bibliometric analysis of the top 100 most cited articles revealed important studies, popular topics, and trends in DKD research to assist researchers in further understanding the subject.

Because epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) express ACE2, we wanted to identify the main factors associated with ACE2 levels and its cleavage enzyme, ADAM17 in epicardial fat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epicardial and subcutaneous fat biopsies were obtained from 43 patients who underwent open-heart surgery. From 36 patients, biopsies were used for RNA expression analysis by real time PCR of ACE1, ACE2 and ADAM17. From 8 patients, stromal vascular cells were submitted to adipogenesis or used for studying the treatment effects on gene expression levels. Soluble ACE2 was determined in supernatants by ELISA. RESULTS: Epicardial fat biopsies expressed higher levels of ACE2 (1.53 [1.49-1.61] vs. 1.51 [1.47-1.56] a.u., p<0.05) and lower ADAM17 than subcutaneous fat (1.67 [1.65-1.70] vs. 1.70 [1.66-1.74] a.u., p<0.001). Both genes were increased in epicardial fat from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (1.62 [1.50-2.28] vs. 1.52 [1.49-1.55] a.u., p=0.05 for ACE2 and 1.68 [1.66-1.78] vs. 1.66 [1.63-1.69] a.u., p<0.05 for ADAM17). Logistic regression analysis determined that T2DM was the main associated factor with epicardial ACE2 levels (p<0.01). The highest ACE2 levels were found on patients with diabetes and obesity. ACE1 and ACE2 levels were not upregulated by anti-diabetic treatment (metformin, insulin or thiazolidinedione). Its cellular levels, which were higher in epicardial than in subcutaneous stromal cells (1.61 [1.55-1.63] vs. 1 [1-1.34]), were not correlated with the soluble ACE2.

Early detection of affected patients within the large and heterogeneous group of patients with common cold symptoms is an important element of this effort, but often hindered by limited testing resources, false-negative test results and the lack of pathognomonic symptoms in COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to identify anamnestic items with an increased/decreased odds ratio for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (CovPCR) result in a primary care setting. METHODS: We performed a multi-center cross-sectional cohort study on predictive clinical characteristics for a positive CovPCR over a period of 4 weeks in primary care patients in Germany. RESULTS: In total, 374 patients in 14 primary care centers received CovPCR and were included in this analysis. The median age was 44.0 (IQR: 31.0C59.0) and a fraction of 10.7% (n = 40) tested positive for COVID-19. Patients who reported anosmia had a higher odds ratio (OR: 4.54; 95%-CI: 1.51C13.67) for a positive test result while patients with a sore throat had a lower OR (OR: 0.33; 95%-CI: 0.11C0.97). Furthermore, patients who had a first grade contact with an infected persons and showed symptoms themselves also had an increased OR for positive testing (OR: 5.16; 95% CI: 1.72C15.51).

Affinity is the key feature for biological activity and clinical efficacy of an antibody, especially of therapeutic antibodies, and thus antibody affinity improvement is indispensable and still remains challenging. To address this issue, we developed the E. coli Assisted Speed affINity-maturation Evolution SyStem (EASINESS) for continuous directed evolution of AgCAb interactions. Two key components of EASINESS include a mutation system modified from error-prone DNA polymerase I (Pol I) that selectively mutates ColE1 plasmids in E. coli and a proteinCprotein interaction selection system from mDHFR split fragments. We designed a GCN4 variant which barely forms a homodimer, and during a single round of evolution, we reversed the homodimer formation activity from the GCN4 variant to verify the feasibility of EASINESS. We then selected a potential therapeutic antibody 18A4Hu and improved the affinity of the antibody (18A4Hu) to its target (ARG2) 12-fold in 7 days while requiring very limited hands-on time. Remarkably, these variants of 18A4Hu revealed a significant improved ability to inhibit melanoma pulmonary metastasis in a mouse model.

On this premise, the regular use of potent disinfectant, (Hydrogen peroxide 2% and chlorhexidine gluconate mixed solution) for oral rinsing and gargling three times daily, through the repeated reduction in microbial load, was tested to determine whether it is able to induce a strain sufficient to inhibit reciprocal altruism, and hence halt the progression of the disease. through an RCT, (n = 93, intervention group: 47, control group: 46) the outcome tested in terms of in relation to the PCR/CT test of nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs from the baseline (at diagnosis), changes in the clinical category (improvement Vs. deterioration), and the final disposition (discharge Vs.

Lysis is mediated by the small membrane bound toxin X174-E, which is composed of a transmembrane domain and a soluble domain. The toxin requires activation by the bacterial chaperone SlyD and inhibits the cell wall precursor forming enzyme MraY. Bacterial cell wall biosynthesis is an important target for antibiotics, therefore knowledge of molecular details in the X174-E lysis pathway could help to identify new mechanisms and sites of action. In this study, cell-free expression and nanoparticle technology were combined to avoid toxic effects upon X174-E synthesis, resulting in the efficient production of a functional full-length toxin and engineered derivatives. Pre-assembled nanodiscs were used to study X174-E function in defined lipid environments and to analyze its membrane insertion mechanisms. The conformation of the soluble domain of X174-E was identified as a central trigger for membrane insertion, as well as for the oligomeric assembly of the toxin. Stable complex formation of the soluble domain with SlyD is essential to keep nascent X174-E in a conformation competent for membrane insertion. Once inserted into the membrane, X174-E assembles into high-order complexes via its transmembrane domain and oligomerization depends on the presence of an essential proline residue at position 21. The data presented here support a model where an initial contact of the nascent X174-E transmembrane domain with the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase domain of SlyD is essential to allow a subsequent stable interaction of SlyD with the X174-E soluble domain for the generation of a membrane insertion competent toxin.","output":"Membrane insertion mechanism and molecular assembly of the bacteriophage lysis toxin X174-E."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of COVID-19 in countries with high and medium incidence of tuberculosis has led to an increased risk of COVID-19 and tuberculosis co-infection, introducing new diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for the clinician.

The selection of an appropriate adjuvant has become vital as new vaccines trend toward narrower composition, expanded application, and improved safety. Functionally, adjuvants act directly or indirectly on antigen presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells (DCs) and are perceived as having molecular patterns associated either with pathogen invasion or endogenous cell damage (known as pathogen associated molecular patterns [PAMPs] and damage associated molecular patterns [DAMPs]), thereby initiating sensing and response pathways. PAMP-type adjuvants are ligands for toll-like receptors (TLRs) and can directly affect DCs to alter the strength, potency, speed, duration, bias, breadth, and scope of adaptive immunity. DAMP-type adjuvants signal via proinflammatory pathways and promote immune cell infiltration, antigen presentation, and effector cell maturation. This class of adjuvants includes mineral salts, oil emulsions, nanoparticles, and polyelectrolytes and comprises colloids and molecular assemblies exhibiting complex, heterogeneous structures. Today innovation in adjuvant technology is driven by rapidly expanding knowledge in immunology, cross-fertilization from other areas including systems biology and materials sciences, and regulatory requirements for quality, safety, efficacy and understanding as part of the vaccine product. Standardizations will aid efforts to better define and compare the structure, function and safety of adjuvants.

Due to lockdown restrictions, all data were collected remotely with the survey instrument being distributed via the social media platform WhatsApp. Three coders thematically analysed data until consensus was reached. Results: Forty-six first- and second-year interns reflected on personal and systemic challenges as the major threats and weaknesses in intern training during the COVID-19 pandemic. Extrapolating on strengths and opportunities, there were three overarching learnings interns reflected on. These related to being a medical professional, being in a learning environment, and specific learnings realised. Existing challenges in the environment exacerbated the threats posed by COVID-19 and innovative strategies related to improving support, feedback and broadening the intern curriculum were identified. In addition, the use of online training around holistic care and intern evaluation was mooted as an innovation to develop out of this pandemic. Conclusion: Although the clinical environment where interns learn and work is often stressful and overpowered by high service burdens, there are unique opportunities to enhance self-directed learning and graduate competencies, even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Medical internship training during the COVID-19 pandemic C a case of sacrificial pawns or not?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to similarities in initial disease presentation, clinicians may be inclined to repeatedly test community-acquired pneumonia cases for COVID-19 before recognizing the need to test for Legionnaires disease. Legionnaires disease is an illness characterized by pneumonia that has a summer/early fall seasonality due to favorable conditions for Legionella growth and exposure. Legionella proliferate in warm water environments and stagnant sections of indoor plumbing and cooling systems. During the ongoing pandemic crisis, exposures to aerosolized water from recently reopened office or retail buildings should be considered as an epidemiologic risk factor for Legionella exposure and an indication to test. The majority of Legionnaires disease cases occurring each year are not diagnosed, and some experts recommend that all patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia without a known etiology be tested for Legionella infection. Proper diagnosis can increase the likelihood of appropriate and timely antibiotic treatment, identify potential clusters of disease, and facilitate source attribution.","output":"Legionnaires disease in the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Orthopedic surgical procedures (OSPs) are known to generate bioaerosols, which could result in transmission of infectious diseases. Hence, this review was undertaken to analyse the available evidence on bioaerosols in OSPs, and their significance in COVID-19 transmission. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv and Lancet preprint databases for studies on bioaerosols in OSPs. Random-effects metanalysis was conducted to determine pooled estimates of key bioaerosol characteristics. Risk of bias was assessed by the RoB-SPEO tool; overall strength of evidence was assessed by the GRADE approach. Results: 17 studies were included in the systematic review, and 6 in different sets of meta-analyses. The pooled estimate of particle density was 390.74a?g/m3, Total Particle Count, 6.08a?a?106/m3, and Microbial Air Contamination, 8.08a?CFU/m3. Small sized particles (</a?=a?0.5 m) were found to be 37 and 1604 times more frequent in the aerosol cloud in comparison to medium and large sized particles respectively. 4 studies reported that haemoglobin could be detected in aerosols, and one study showed that HIV could be transmitted by blood aerosolized by electric saw and burr. The risk of bias for all studies in the review was determined to be high, and the quality of evidence, low. Conclusion: Whereas there is evidence to suggest that OSPs generate large amounts of bioaerosols, their potential to transmit infectious diseases like COVID-19 is questionable. High-quality research, as well as consensus minimum reporting guidelines for bioaerosol research in OSPs is the need of the hour.","output":"Bioaerosols in orthopedic surgical procedures and implications for clinical practice in the times of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors for fatality and severity in these patients. METHODS: In this nationwide population-based retrospective study, we investigated the data of 7339 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, aged &#8805; 18 years, using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database. Comorbidities and medications used were identified using HIRA codes, and severe COVID-19 was defined as that requiring oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilator, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The outcomes were death due to COVID-19 and COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 47.1 years; 2970 (40.1%) patients were male. Lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics, ribavirin, oseltamivir, and interferon were administered to 35.8%, 28.4%, 38.1%, 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.9% of patients, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, previous history of pneumonia, aging, and male were significantly associated with increased risk of death and severe disease. No medication was associated with a reduced risk of fatality and disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: We found several risk factors for fatality and severity in COVID-19 patients. As the drugs currently used for COVID-19 treatment have not shown significant efficacy, all efforts should be made to develop effective therapeutic modalities for COVID-19.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors for Fatality and Severity in Patients with Coronavirus Disease in Korea: A Nationwide Population-Based Retrospective Study Using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) Database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction/Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encoded nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) orchestrates a multi-pronged mechanism to shut down host gene expression, also known as the host shutoff Nsp1 is a 180 amino acid long protein with a primarily flexible structure that allows nsp1 to interact with various cellular factors during host shutoff to inhibit translation and promote mRNA decay Hypothesis/Goal of Study Mutations of the surface residues of nsp1 either attenuate or augment its host shutoff function prompting the hypothesis that these residues bind cellular proteins that facilitate nsp1 during the host shutoff To identify cellular proteins that interact with nsp1 and assist its function, we isolated host proteins proximal to nsp1 in human epithelial kidney cells by using a fusion protein, nsp1-BioID2 These isolated proteins are identified using mass spectroscopy and verified by western blot Also, we are using computer-based modeling to predict the binding sites of these nsp1-interacting proteins Methods and Results By comparing protein complexes, we identified a large group of proteins including ribosomal proteins that are likely involved in host shutoff In addition to the ribosomal proteins, factors implicated in the stress granule formation and RNA processing are identified and verified We have tested these interactions in multiple mutants that are known to affect the host shutoff activity of nsp1 Surprisingly, none of the mutations in the structured region of nsp1 disrupts any of these mutations Conclusions BioID-mediated tagging of the host proteins proximal to nsp1 allows us to identify multiple pathways modulated by nsp1","output":"The Impact of Mutations on the Functions of Nonstructural Protein 1 of SARS Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 is the \\"gold standard\\" for diagnosing COVID-19. However, due to the low detection capacity of SARS-CoV-2 and the high false negative rate at the beginning of the epidemic, and the medical staff did not know much about the condition and treatment of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, our hospital paid more attention to the results of other laboratory indicators in the early stage of the epidemic of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to explore clinical characteristics and laboratory results of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China and provide evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Retrospective study of 562 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Wuhan Red Cross Hospital from January 28 to March 12, 2020 was performed. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the severity of illness: Mild group (n = 436) and Severe group (n = 126). The general clinical characteristics of the patients were collected, including age, gender, past medical history, clinical symptoms, etc. All patients underwent blood routine test, biochemical indicators, blood gas analysis and other related laboratory examinations. The clinical data and laboratory results of the two groups were compared. Compared with the patients in the Mild group, the patients in Severe group were older and the proportion of patients suffering from underlying disease (61.11%) was higher (p &lt; 0.05). In Severe group, WBC, NEUT, NLR, PCT, CRP, IL-6, ESR, CK, CK-MB, Mb, cTnI, D-D, Fib, and PaCO2 of patients had higher values, while the levels of LYMPH, HBG, PLT, PO2, and SaO2 were significantly reduced, and the differences were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). Between Severe group and Mild group, there was no significant difference in other indexes such as ALT, Urea, and Cr (p &gt; 0.05) or in the positive rate of influenza A, B virus, or other respiratory pathogens by pairwise comparison (p &gt; 0.05). Viral infection and inflammation were more serious in elderly patients or patients with underlying diseases. They were more likely to progress to severely ill patients.

We hypothesized that the association between follow-up noncontrast computed tomography ILV and outcome as assessed with mRS 3 months after stroke is strengthened when taking the mRS relevance of the infarct location into account. METHODS An anatomic atlas with 66 areas was registered to the follow-up noncontrast computed tomographic images of 254 patients from the MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands). The anatomic brain areas were divided into brain areas of high, moderate, and low mRS relevance as reported in the literature. Based on this distinction, the ILV in brain areas of high, moderate, and low mRS relevance was assessed for each patient. Binary and ordinal logistic regression analyses with and without adjustment for known confounders were performed to assess the association between the ILVs of different mRS relevance and outcome. RESULTS The odds for a worse outcome (higher mRS) were markedly higher given an increase of ILV in brain areas of high mRS relevance (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-1.55 per 10 mL) compared with an increase in total ILV (odds ratios, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.19 per 10 mL). Regression models using ILV in brain areas of high mRS relevance instead of total ILV showed a higher quality. CONCLUSIONS The association between follow-up noncontrast computed tomography ILV and outcome as assessed with mRS 3 months after stroke is strengthened by accounting for the mRS relevance of the affected brain areas. Future prediction models should account for the ILV in brain areas of high mRS relevance.","output":"Association of Computed Tomography Ischemic Lesion Location With Functional Outcome in Acute Large Vessel Occlusion Ischemic Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To investigate the effects of feedback, in the form of a virtual avatar paced at 100% and 102% of baseline performance, on neuromuscular fatigue after a 4-km cycling time trial (TT). We hypothesized that improved cycling performance would occur because of the participants exceeding a previously established critical threshold and experiencing greater neuromuscular fatigue. METHODS After familiarization, 10 well-trained cyclists performed a baseline 4-km TT without feedback (BASE), followed by two 4-km TT where they raced against an avatar (set at 100% accurate [ACC] and 102% deception [DEC] of baseline power output) in a randomized and counterbalanced order. Before and after each TT, neuromuscular fatigue was assessed using maximal isometric voluntary contractions (MVC) of the quadriceps, and supramaximal electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve, during and 2 s after MVCs to assess voluntary activation and potentiated twitch force. Blood lactate was taken pretrials and posttrials and RPE was taken throughout each TT. RESULTS Time trial performance improved after deception of feedback compared with baseline performance (-5.8 s, P = 0.019). Blood lactate increased after DEC compared with BASE (+1.37 mmolL, P = 0.019). Despite this, there was no difference in any measures of exercise-induced neuromuscular fatigue (P > 0.05). Similarly, RPE was not different between trials. CONCLUSIONS Well-trained male cyclists can improve cycling TT performance when competing against an avatar increased to 102% of a previously established best effort.

Cytokines play a vital role in regulating inflammation and immune responses, but dysregulation of cytokine responses has been implicated in different disease states. Host genetic factors were previously shown to significantly impact cytokine response heterogeneity mainly in European-based studies, but it is unclear whether these findings are transferable to non-European individuals. Here, we aimed to identify genetic variants modulating cytokine responses in healthy adults of East African ancestry from Tanzania. We leveraged both cytokine and genetic data and performed genome-wide cytokine quantitative trait loci (cQTLs) mapping. The results were compared with another cohort of healthy adults of Western European ancestry via direct overlap and functional enrichment analyses. We also performed meta-analyses to identify cQTLs with congruent effect direction in both populations. In the Tanzanians, cQTL mapping identified 80 independent suggestive loci and one genome-wide significant locus (TBC1D22A) at chromosome 22;SNP rs12169244 was associated with IL-1b release after Salmonella enteritidis stimulation. Remarkably, the identified cQTLs varied significantly when compared to the European cohort, and there was a very limited percentage of overlap (1.6% to 1.9%). We further observed ancestry-specific pathways regulating induced cytokine responses, and there was significant enrichment of the interferon pathway specifically in the Tanzanians. Furthermore, contrary to the Europeans, genetic variants in the TLR10-TLR1-TLR6 locus showed no effect on cytokine response. Our data reveal both ancestry-specific effects of genetic variants and pathways on cytokine response heterogeneity, hence arguing for the importance of initiatives to include diverse populations into genomics research.","output":"A functional genomics approach in Tanzanian population identifies distinct genetic regulators of cytokine production compared to European population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has boosted telemedicine in medical clinical practice.

Our hypothesis was that participants with severe stroke randomized to endovascular therapy after intravenous tPA would have improved 90-day outcome (distribution of modified Rankin Scale scores), when compared with those who received intravenous tPA alone. RESULTS Among 342 participants in the pooled analysis (194 from IMS III and 148 from MR CLEAN), an ordinal logistic regression model showed that the endovascular group had superior 90-day outcome compared with the intravenous tPA group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-2.66). In the logistic regression model of the dichotomous outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2, or functional independence), the endovascular group had superior outcomes (adjusted odds ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.56).

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds primarily to ACE2 on target cells and is then processed by membrane proteases, including TMPRSS2, leading to viral internalisation or fusion with the plasma membrane. It has been suggested, however, that receptors other than ACE2 may be involved in virus binding. We have investigated the interactions of recombinant versions of the spike protein with human epithelial cell lines that express low/very low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a proxy assay for interaction with host cells. A tagged form of the spike protein containing the S1 and S2 regions bound in a temperature-dependent manner to all cell lines, whereas the S1 region alone and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) interacted only weakly. Spike protein associated with cells independently of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, while RBD required the presence of high levels of ACE2 for interaction. As the spike protein has previously been shown to bind heparin, a soluble glycosaminoglycan, we tested the effects of various heparins on ACE2-independent spike protein interaction with cells. Unfractionated heparin inhibited spike protein interaction with an IC(50) value of <0.05 U/mL, whereas two low-molecular-weight heparins were less effective. A mutant form of the spike protein, lacking the arginine-rich putative furin cleavage site, interacted only weakly with cells and had a lower affinity for unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin than the wild-type spike protein. This suggests that the furin cleavage site might also be a heparin-binding site and potentially important for interactions with host cells.

Here, we have applied a methodology to identify DHODH antagonist candidates, and compared them using in silico target prediction tools. A large set of 7900 FDA-approved and clinical stage drugs obtained from DrugBank were docked against 20 different structures DHODH available in PDB. Drugs were eliminated according to their predicted affinities by Autodock Vina. About 28 FDA-approved and 79 clinical trial ongoing drugs remained. The mode of interaction of these molecules was analyzed by repeating docking using Autodock 4 and DS Visualiser. Finally, the target region predictions of 28 FDA-approved drugs were determined through PASS and SwissTargetPrediction tools. Interestingly, the analysis of in silico target predictions revealed that serotoninCdopamine receptor antagonists could also be potential DHODH inhibitors. Our candidates shared a common attribute, a possible interaction with serotoninCdopamine receptors as well as other oxidoreductases, like DHODH. Moreover, the Bruton Tyrosine Kinase-inhibitor acalabrutunib and serotoninCdopamine receptor inhibitor drugs on our list have been found in the literature that have shown to be effective against Sars-CoV-2, while the path of activity is yet to be identified. Identifying an effective drug that can suppress both inflammation and virus proliferation will play a crucial role in the treatment of COVID. Therefore, we suggest experimental investigation of the 28 FDA-approved drugs on DHODH activity and Sars-CoV-2 virus proliferation. Those who are found experimentally effective can play an important role in COVID19 treatment. Moreover, we suggest investigating COVID19 case conditions in patients using schizophrenia and depression drugs.","output":"A comprehensive drug repurposing study for COVID19 treatment: novel putative dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitors show association to serotoninCdopamine receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many efforts are being made around the world to discover the vaccine against COVID-19. After discovering the vaccine, its acceptance by individuals is a fundamental issue for disease control. This study aimed to examine COVID-19 vaccination intention determinants based on the protection motivation theory (PMT). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in the Iranian adult population and surveyed 256 study participants from the first to the 30th of June 2020 with a web-based self-administered questionnaire. We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to investigate the interrelationship between COVID-19 vaccination intention and perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived self-efficacy, and perceived response efficacy. RESULTS: SEM showed that perceived severity to COVID-19 ( = .17, p < .001), perceived self-efficacy about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine ( = .26, p < .001), and the perceived response efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine ( = .70, p < .001) were significant predictors of vaccination intention. PMT accounted for 61.5% of the variance in intention to COVID-19 vaccination, and perceived response efficacy was the strongest predictor of COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSIONS: This study found the PMT constructs are useful in predicting COVID-19 vaccination intention. Programs designed to increase the vaccination rate after discovering the COVID-19 vaccine can include interventions on the severity of the COVID-19, the self-efficacy of individuals receiving the vaccine, and the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing infection.","output":"The protection motivation theory for predict intention of COVID-19 vaccination in Iran: a structural equation modeling approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Recent estimates indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, could be effectively controlled via the development and implementation of diagnostic tools such as quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR).

Whether underlying social vulnerabilities of counties influence premature CVD mortality is uncertain.

We calculated scores for overall SVI and its 4 subcomponents (ie, socioeconomic status; household composition and disability; minority status and language; and housing type and transportation) using 15 social attributes. Scores were presented as percentile rankings by county, further classified as quartiles on the basis of their distribution among all US counties (1st [least vulnerable] = 0 to 0.25; 4th [most vulnerable = 0.75 to 1.00]). We grouped age-adjusted mortality rates per 100 000 person-years for overall CVD and its subtypes (ischemic heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and heart failure) for nonelderly (<65 years of age) adults across SVI quartiles. RESULTS Overall, the age-adjusted CVD mortality rate per 100 000 person-years was 47.0 (ischemic heart disease, 28.3; stroke, 7.9; hypertension, 8.4; and heart failure, 2.4). The largest concentration of counties with more social vulnerabilities and CVD mortality were clustered across the southwestern and southeastern parts of the United States. The age-adjusted CVD mortality rates increased in a stepwise manner from 1st to 4th SVI quartiles. Counties in the 4th SVI quartile had significantly higher mortality for CVD (rate ratio, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.43-2.36]), ischemic heart disease (1.52 [1.09-2.13]), stroke (2.03 [1.12-3.70]), hypertension (2.71 [1.54-4.75]), and heart failure (3.38 [1.32-8.61]) than those in the 1st SVI quartile. The relative risks varied considerably by demographic characteristics. For example, among all ethnicities/races, non-Hispanic Black adults in the 4th SVI quartile versus the 1st SVI quartile exclusively had significantly higher relative risks of stroke (1.65 [1.07-2.54]) and heart failure (2.42 [1.29-4.55]) mortality. Rural counties with more social vulnerabilities had 2- to 5-fold higher mortality attributable to CVD and subtypes. CONCLUSIONS In this analysis, US counties with more social vulnerabilities had higher premature CVD mortality, varied by demographic characteristics and rurality.

Simplified arithmetic models of COVID-19 transmission, control and elimination are presented in user-friendly Shiny and Excel formats that allow non-specialists to explore, query, critique and understand the containment decisions facing their country and the world at large. Although the predictive model is broadly applicable, the simulations presented are based on parameter values representative of the United Republic of Tanzania, which is still early enough in its epidemic cycle and response to avert a national catastrophe. The predictions of these models illustrate (1) why ambitious lock-down interventions to crush the curve represent the only realistic way for individual countries to contain their national-level epidemics before they turn into outright catastrophes, (2) why these need to be implemented so early, so stringently and for such extended periods, (3) why high prevalence of other pathogens causing similar symptoms to mild COVID-19 precludes the use of contact tracing as a substitute for lock down interventions to contain and eliminate epidemics, (4) why partial containment strategies intended to merely flatten the curve, by maintaining epidemics at manageably low levels, are grossly unrealistic, and (5) why local elimination may only be sustained after lock down ends if imported cases are comprehensively excluded, so international co-operation to conditionally re-open trade and travel between countries certified as free of COVID-19 represents the best strategy for motivating progress towards pandemic eradication at global level.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have engaged 34 patients with COVID-19 conditions [eight of them were healthcare workers patients (HCW)] hospitalized at \\"Policlinico Gemelli Foundation\\" of Rome, Italy. All patients were evaluated through the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R) first, during their hospitalization (baseline), and then, after 4 months from hospital discharge (follow-up), through phone interviews. RESULTS: At baseline, 82% of patients revealed from mild to severe psychological impact of COVID-19, according to the IES-R. At follow-up, the mean IES-R total score was significantly decreased (p<0.001) even if almost half (46.6%) of our cohort still showed it.

Methods: : The levels of sex hormones including estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone, and free testosterone were measured in 162 female and male patients with COVID-19 infection during hospitalization and one month after discharge. A demographic questionnaire and a checklist were used to collect the data. The ANCOVA test was used to compare the level of hormones in patients with severe and moderate disease. Results: : In the primary assessment, 162 patients were assessed for serum levels of sex hormones, while a month after discharge, only 69 patients provided consent for assessment, and nine had passed away. During hospitalization, female patients with severe disease had an elevated level of estradiol (407.70623.37 pg/mL) in comparison to those with a moderate disease (213.78407.17 pg/mL).

Precarious employment conditions may contribute to these disparities by impeding workers in such conditions from adopting COVID-19 mitigation measures to reduce infection risk. This study investigated the relationship between employment and economic conditions and the adoption of COVID-19 protective behaviors among US workers during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Employing a social media advertisement campaign, an online, self-administered survey was used to collect data from 2,845 working adults in April 2020. Hierarchical generalized linear models were performed to assess the differences in engagement with recommended protective behaviors based on employment and economic conditions, while controlling for knowledge and perceived threat of COVID-19, as would be predicted by the Health Belief Model (HBM). RESULTS: Essential workers had more precarious employment and economic conditions than non-essential workers: 67% had variable income; 30% did not have paid sick leave; 42% had lost income due to COVID-19, and 15% were food insecure. The adoption of protective behaviors was high in the sample: 77% of participants avoided leaving home, and 93% increased hand hygiene. Consistent with the HBM, COVID-19 knowledge scores and perceived threat were positively associated with engaging in all protective behaviors. However, after controlling for these, essential workers were 60% and 70% less likely than non-essential workers, who by the nature of their jobs cannot stay at home, to stay at home and increase hand hygiene, respectively. Similarly, participants who could not afford to quarantine were 50% less likely to avoid leaving home (AOR: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.4, 0.6) than those who could, whereas there were no significant differences concerning hand hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with the accumulating evidence that the employment conditions of essential workers and other low-income earners are precarious, that they have experienced disproportionately higher rates of income loss during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and face significant barriers to adopting protective measures.

Fifty-two in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders involved in local food production. Interviews were analysed by both country teams using thematic analysis. Local food production networks in both settings included formal governance bodies as well as more informal connections through civil society and communities. Their main function was the sharing of resources and knowledge, but levels of trust and cooperation between the stakeholders varied in a market open to intense competition from imports. Local food production was hindered by few and slow investments by local governments, dated technology, and lack of knowledge.

PURPOSE: The potentially vast supply of unused opioids in Americans' homes has long been a public health concern. We conducted a needs assessment of how Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities address and manage disposal of unused opioid medications to identify opportunities for improvement. METHODS: We used rapid qualitative content analysis methods with team consensus to synthesize findings. Data were collected in 2 waves: (1) semistructured interviews with 19 providers in October 2019 and (2) structured questions to 21 providers in March to April of 2020 addressing how coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) changed disposal priorities. RESULTS: While many diverse strategies have been tried in the VA, we found limited standardization of advice on opioid disposal and practices nationally. Providers offered the following recommendations: target specific patient scenarios for enhanced disposal efforts, emphasize mail-back envelopes, keep recommendations to providers and patients consistent and reinforce existing guidance, explore virtual modalities to monitor disposal activity, prioritize access to viable disposal strategies, and transition from pull to push communication. These themes were identified in the fall of 2019 and remained salient in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: A centralized VA national approach could include proactive communication with patients and providers, interventions tailored to specific settings and populations, and facilitated access to disposal options. All of the above strategies are feasible in the context of an extended period of social distancing.","output":"Opportunities for improving opioid disposal practices in the Veterans Health Administration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Referral to an oral surgeon for soft-tissue surgery before, during or after orthodontic treatment is not uncommon.

Participants from both a European (i.e., Italy; Experiment 1) and an Asian (i.e., China; Experiment 2) country were involved, namely two countries in which the daily use of face masks before COVID-19 pandemic was either extremely uncommon or frequently adopted, respectively. Both samples completed a task in which a peripheral target had to be discriminated while a task irrelevant averted gaze face, wearing a mask or not, acted as a central cueing stimulus. Overall, a reliable and comparable gaze cueing emerged in both experiments, independent of the mask condition.

METHODS: HNSCC cases (oropharynx/larynx/hypopharynx) treated with definitive RT-hypo (60 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks), moderately accelerated radiotherapy (RT-acc) alone (70 Gy in 35 fractions over 6 weeks), or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) during 2005-2017 were included. Locoregional control (LRC) and distant control (DC) after RT-hypo, RT-acc, and CCRT were compared for various subgroups. RESULTS: The study identified 994 human papillomavirus-positive (HPV+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma cases (with 61, 254, and 679 receiving RT-hypo, RT-acc, and CCRT, respectively) and 1045 HPV- HNSCC cases (with 263, 451, and 331 receiving RT-hypo, RT-acc, and CCRT, respectively). The CCRT cohort had higher T/N categories, whereas the radiotherapy-alone patients were older. The median follow-up was 4.6 years. RT-hypo, RT-acc, and CCRT produced comparable 3-year LRC and DC for HPV+ T1-2N0-N2a disease (seventh edition of the TNM system [TNM-7]; LRC, 94%, 100%, and 94%; P = .769; DC, 94%, 100%, and 94%; P = .272), T1-T2N2b disease (LRC, 90%, 94%, and 97%; P = .445; DC, 100%, 96%, and 95%; P = .697), and T1-2N2c/T3N0-N2c disease (LRC, 89%, 93%, and 95%; P = .494; DC, 89%, 90%, and 87%; P = .838). Although LRC was also similar for T4/N3 disease (78%, 84%, and 88%; P = .677), DC was significantly lower with RT-hypo or RT-acc versus CCRT (67%, 65%, and 87%; P = .005). For HPV- HNSCC, 3-year LRC and DC were similar with RT-hypo, RT-acc, and CCRT in stages I and II (LRC, 85%, 89%, and 100%; P = .320; DC, 99%, 98%, and 100%; P = .446); however, RT-hypo and RT-acc had significantly lower LRC in stage III (76%, 69%, and 91%; P = .006), whereas DC rates were similar (92%, 85%, and 90%; P = .410). Lower LRC in stage III predominated in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma receiving RT-acc (62%) but not RT-hypo (80%) or CCRT (92%; RT-hypo vs CCRT: P = .270; RT-acc vs CCRT: P = .004). CCRT had numerically higher LRC in comparison with RT-hypo or RT-acc in stage IV (73%, 65%, and 66%; P = .336). CONCLUSIONS: It is proposed that RT-hypo be considered in place of CCRT for HPV+ T1-T3N0-N2c (TNM-7) HNSCCs, HPV- T1-T2N0 HNSCCs, and select stage III HNSCCs during the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Hypofractionated radiotherapy alone with 2.4 Gy per fraction for head and neck cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic: The Princess Margaret experience and proposal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considerable scholarly attention has been directed at increasing social isolation and loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic, and their adverse impact on later life psychological well-being.

It is unclear whether loneliness continues to differ across different levels of financial hardship even amidst immense uncertainty, social isolation, and anxiety induced by the pandemic. Based on our nationwide web-based survey of adults aged 50 years and older (n=1861), we used ordinal logistic regression to examine the influence of financial hardship on loneliness and assessed the role of socioeconomic status (SES), emotional support, and health status in contributing to such influence. We found significantly higher odds of greater loneliness ( = .28, p < .001) among individuals who reported experiencing greater financial hardship. Among two measures of SES, only household income contributed substantially to the influence of financial hardship on loneliness. We documented significantly lower emotional support and greater health disadvantage among individuals experiencing greater financial hardship. Consideration of emotional support and health status explained the remaining influence of financial hardship, due to their association with both financial hardship and loneliness. Despite a sense of shared vulnerability and social isolation across the general population, our findings suggest that SES inequalities in later life loneliness are maintained even in the midst of the pandemic.","output":"Financial Hardship and the Pain of Social Disconnection During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Smart cities play an important role in overall development of a nation by progressing with economic, environmental and social domains India has projected to create 100 smart cities in near future The purpose of the paper is to identify the key influencing components and the social media users expectations for smart cities development in India The Twitter social media content of smart cities council and the user posts on smart cities are collected through Twitter application programming interface The collected tweets are cleaned by pre-processing methods and analyzed for insights Technology, infrastructure, innovation, transport, mobility and management are the key influencing components for smart cities development in India The social media users are expecting to emphasize on combating the issues like Covid-19 and use of IoT technology for the success of smart cities project The integration of different components could increase the success of the project The analysis of the content shared by the groups (smart cities council and the social media users) which are at different sides of smart cities development project, increases the novelty of the study ? 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing","output":"Developing Indian Smart Cities: Insights from Social Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Low-value prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is common yet contributes substantial waste and downstream patient harm. Decision fatigue may represent an actionable target to reduce low-value urologic care. The objective of this study was to determine whether low-value PSA testing patterns by outpatient clinicians are consistent with decision fatigue. METHODS Outpatient appointments for adult men without prostate cancer were identified at a large academic health system from 2011 through 2018. The authors assessed the association of appointment time with the likelihood of PSA testing, stratified by patient age and appropriateness of testing based on clinical guidelines. Appointments included those scheduled between 8:00 am and 4:59 pm, with noon omitted. Urologists were examined separately from other clinicians. RESULTS In 1,581,826 outpatient appointments identified, the median patient age was 54 years (interquartile range, 37-66 years), 1,256,152 participants (79.4%) were White, and 133,693 (8.5%) had family history of prostate cancer. PSA testing would have been appropriate in 36.8% of appointments. Clinicians ordered testing in 3.6% of appropriate appointments and in 1.8% of low-value appointments. Appropriate testing was most likely at 8:00 am (reference group). PSA testing declined through 11:00 am (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50-0.64) and remained depressed through 4:00 pm (P < .001). Low-value testing was overall less likely (P < .001) and followed a similar trend, declining steadily from 8:00 am (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.42-0.56) through 4:00 pm (P < .001; OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.18-0.30). Testing patterns in urologists were noticeably different. CONCLUSIONS Among most clinicians, outpatient PSA testing behaviors appear to be consistent with decision fatigue. These findings establish decision fatigue as a promising, actionable target for reducing wasteful and low-value practices in routine urologic care. LAY SUMMARY Decision fatigue causes poorer choices to be made with repetitive decision making. This study used medical records to investigate whether decision fatigue influenced clinicians' likelihood of ordering a low-value screening test (prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) for prostate cancer. In more than 1.5 million outpatient appointments by adult men without prostate cancer, the chances of both appropriate and low-value PSA testing declined as the clinic day progressed, with a larger decline for appropriate testing. Testing patterns in urologists were different from those reported by other clinicians. The authors conclude that outpatient PSA testing behaviors appear to be consistent with decision fatigue among most clinicians, and interventions may reduce wasteful testing and downstream patient harms.","output":"Decision fatigue in low-value prostate cancer screening."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To compare clinical and angiographic outcomes between balloon-assisted (BAC) and stent-assisted coiling for internal carotid artery unruptured aneurysms (ICA-UA). MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 227 ICA-UA in 190 patients were treated with BAC (120 patients, 141 ICA-UA) or SAC (70 patients, 86 ICA-UA. We compared characteristics of patients and ICA-UA, and clinical and angiographic outcomes between groups. RESULTS Aneurysm size and neck diameter were greater for SAC than in BAC, but aneurysm volume and coil packing density were not different between groups. Immediate angiographic occlusion grade was better for BAC than for SAC. Periprocedural thromboembolic events were more frequent during SAC (11.6%) than BAC (2.4%) per aneurysm, but hemorrhagic events were the opposite (2.4% for BAC and none for SAC per aneurysm) (p < 0.05). At discharge, treatment-related morbi-mortality rates were 1.6% for BAC and 1.4% per patient for SAC. At clinical follow-up (BAC, 118 patients [98.3%] for a mean of 48.4 months; SAC, 69 patients [98.6%], for a mean of 37.4 months), 1 additional treatment-related infarction occurred during SAC, resulting in a modified Rankin scale score of 4. Thus, overall treatment-related morbi-mortality rates were 1.7% in BAC and 2.9% in SAC. At imaging follow-up (BAC, 135 aneurysms [95.7%] for 28.3 months; SAC, 81 aneurysms [94.1%] for 23.9 months), BAC and SAC showed stable or improved occlusion in 94.1% and 95.0%, minor recurrence in 4.4% and 2.5%, and major recurrence in 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION Both BAC and SAC were safe and effective techniques for ICA-UA.

Beside acute respiratory distress syndrome found in acute phase of infection, there is also pulmonary fibrosis as a chronic complication due to COVID-19. With the global pandemic of COVID-19, more and more autopsy and puncture histopathological results have been published.Until now there is no specific therapy to handle post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis due to COVID-19 infection. Several studies are ongoing to determine an effective treatment for this chronic complication. While ARDS appears to be the main cause of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19, the pathogenesis of ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2 is different from the typical ARDS. Some therapies may be considered for reducing the fibrosis process in lung after COVI-19 infection namely pirfenidone, nintedanib and mesenchymal stem cells. Many patients are still recovering spontaneously in the first six weeks after acute COVID-19 infection and do not generally require fast-track entry into a pulmonary rehabilitation programme. However, those who have significantly persistent respiratory illness may need to be supported by pulmonary rehabilitation.

However, as endovascular techniques continue to progress, they are increasingly applied to this patient population, especially to the high-risk surgical cohort or patients with limited surgical options. This enthusiasm to employ endovascular interventions in IP CLI is accompanied by persistent controversies, as demonstrated in the recent literature. Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty has been the predominant endovascular intervention applied to treat IP CLI and recent literature supports its role. The durability of percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty is limited, and thus this intervention is recommended for high-risk patients with limited life expectancy. Bare-metal stents for IP CLI currently do not have supportive data to warrant their use as a primary treatment. Newer drug-eluting stents improve patency and prevent restenosis, but they do not significantly improve patient clinical status compared with bare-metal stents alone. Drug-coated balloons are still relatively new tools in this arena and evidence of their safety and clear efficacy are still lacking. The data on atherectomy, in all of its forms, for IP CLI are overall variable, without any clear benefit to justify its increased complication risks and costs over other modalities. Use of retrograde tibial/pedal access for treating IP CLI as a viable alternative to antegrade access and treatment from a totally retrograde approach has recently been described. Level I evidence to aid in clarifying the true efficacy for each of these endovascular modalities is greatly needed. As we await these data, we must remember that, as with any arterial intervention, proper patient selection is extremely important and the intervention, whether endovascular or open surgical repair, should be tailored to the individual patient's anatomy and disease characteristics.","output":"Endovascular intervention for tibial artery occlusive disease in patients with critical limb ischemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The occurrence of large-vessel occlusion in young patients with COVID-19 infection is exceedingly rare.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced neuro-oncology services worldwide to re-design and at the University Hospitals Birmingham UK, telephone clinics were quickly implemented in select patients to limit numbers of patients attending hospital. It was important to determine how these changes were perceived by patients. METHODS: A 20-question patient satisfaction questionnaire was distributed to patients who attended neuro-oncology clinic in person (face-to-face), or via the telephone. Fishers exact test was used to determine significance, which was set at p< 0.05. RESULTS: Eighty questionnaires were distributed between June 2020 and August 2020. Overall, 50% (n=40) of patients returned the questionnaire, 50% (n=23) of face-to-face and 50% (n=17) telephone patients. Of those who received telephone consultations, 88% (n=15) felt the consultation was convenient, 88% (n=15) were satisfied with their consultation and 18% (n=3) felt they would have preferred to have a face-to-face appointment. Of those who attended clinic in person, 96% (n=22) felt their consultation was convenient, 100% (n=23) were satisfied with their consultation and 13% (n=3) would have preferred a telephone consultation. Within the face-to-face clinic attendees, only 13% (n=3) were concerned regarding the COVID risk associated with attending hospital. There was no significant difference in patient convenience or satisfaction (p=0.565 and p=0.174 respectively) between face-to-face and telephone clinics. There was no significant difference in whether patients wouldve preferred the alternative method of consultation (p > 0.999). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that careful patient selection for neuro-oncology telephone clinic is not inferior to face-to-face clinic. Telephone clinic during COVID-19 pandemic proved to be convenient, safe and effective. This global health crisis has transformed telephone neuro-oncology consultations from an experimental innovation into established practice and should be continued beyond the pandemic in select cases.","output":"COVD-26.

An epidemiological survey showed that the pneumovirus infection was closely related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, causing great panic among the general population. Through isolation of the pneumovirus strain and whole-genome sequencing, an infection model of the pneumovirus in human airway epithelial cells was established, and the pneumovirus was identified as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which belongs to the -coronavirus genus. This study focused on the different characteristics of 2019-nCoV, which we learned at the early stage of Covid-19 pandemic will help us to save more lives during the outbreak. Methods: The data of 17 deaths from 13 hospitals in Wuhan were obtained, and the initial symptoms, clinical features during the progression of the disease, and treatment processes were well analyzed. Results: At the initial phase of the outbreak of 2019-nCoV, the lack of effective drugs for pneumonia has led to lethal results in people who are often elderly with multiple underlying conditions. Males were affected more than females. Fever, dry coughing, shortness of breath were the primary presentations, but not all. Chest images showed typical features of viral pneumonia. Respiratory support treatment were needed, although sometimes did not improve respiratory distress. All the patients died of multiple organ failure caused by respiratory failure. Many treatments of covid-19 were done in ICU and lasted for a long time, the occupation of public medical resources will put pressure on the present medical system. Conclusions: COVID-19 is different from pneumonia caused by previous coronaviruses, it is more infectious and hard to manage. The initial death population were mainly elderly patients with underlying diseases. Protecting the elderly is an effective method to reduce the number of deaths. In the absence of nucleic acid detection reagents, relying on identifying typical symptoms and making full use of CT can increase the diagnosis of suspicious people. The condition of patients may deteriorate rapidly which increased the complexity of treatment.

The prospect of using this technology in rheumatology was based on the possibility of getting maximum information about the patient during the survey, examination and interpretation of laboratory and instrumental data, that is excepting direct contact with the patient. Several rheumatological clinics have reported on the success of using TMC. However, there is very little data of the difficulties that can be encountered when organizing this process. Objectives: To characterize the identified problems during TMC in rheumatology, to suggest potential directions for their elimination. Methods: Since June 2021, on the basis of the Medical Association New Hospital, Yekaterinburg, Russian Federation, 76 TMCs have been performed on the profile of rheumatology in patients aged 29 to 71 years. Of these, 13 applied to the primary TMC, the other patients were preliminarily examined in person. The consultation included the preliminary acquaintance with the examination results, a 20-minute video communication and writing of a conclusion. After each TMC, a survey was conducted between the doctor and the patient, including the identified deficiencies in counseling. The frequency of identified problems is presented as an absolute indicator and as a percentage of the total number of TMCs performed.

[2] Lack of objective examination, leading to the impossibility of correct remote diagnosis -8 (10.5%). This problem was identified due to the inability to establish the presence or absence of arthritis during the initial diagnosis (6 cases) and to clarify the nature of the rash (2 cases). All patients are invited for a face-to-face consultation. [3] The need to write prescriptions for psychotropic drugs -12 (15.8%), which under the conditions of national legislation cannot be done in the TMC regime. [4] The time spent directly on remote communication with the patient was 17.2 minutes (from 8 to 31), however, taking into account the study data and writing the conclusion, the total time was 40.7 minutes (from 21 to 73). Thus, it turned out that the average time for remote and face-to-face consultations is the same, while TMC's payment is only about 50% of the face-to-face consultation. This situation reduces the doctor's interest in carrying out TMC. The solution to the problem is associated with reducing the time for the documentation process through technical improvements. In addition, of the 9 patients in whom the TMC process lasted 60 minutes or more, 5 were diagnosed with fibromyalgia. It is possible that with a previously established diagnosis of fibromyalgia, only face-to-face counseling should be recommended to patients. Conclusion: The TMC system is promising, however, there are a number of problems that need to be improved, since they can reduce the doctor's interest in using this technology.","output":"Telemedicine consultations in rheumatology: Identified problems of new technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread over the world, the World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of COVID-19 an international public health emergency.

For this purpose, it is essential to develop new biomarkers to diagnose, stratify, or possibly prevent diseases. Plasma is an available source of biomarkers that greatly reflects the physiological and pathological conditions of the body. An increasing number of studies are focusing on proteins and peptides, including many involving the Human Proteome Project (HPP) of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO), and proteomics and peptidomics techniques are emerging as critical tools for developing novel precision medicine preventative measures. Excitingly, the emerging plasma proteomics and peptidomics toolbox exhibits a huge potential for studying pathogenesis of diseases (e.g., COVID-19 and cancer), identifying valuable biomarkers and improving clinical management. However, the enormous complexity and wide dynamic range of plasma proteins makes plasma proteome profiling challenging.

Now with available vaccines and declining case rates efforts are underway to return to in-person visits as they provide more revenue and are viewed as best for patients and clinicians. This reviews these assumptions. METHODS Electronic medical records from seven full-time faculty neuro-oncologists at Johns Hopkins Hospitals were retrospectively reviewed from 4/1/20 to 3/31/21 to examine the use of video visits over time and their patient demographics. RESULTS From 4/1/20 to 3/31/21, 279 new patients were seen (57% video-visits) with a median age of 52 years for both video and in-person visits. Patients came from 15 states for video and 17 states for in-person visits. There were also 2247 follow-up visits (85% video-visits) with a median age of 47 yrs for video and 50 yrs for in-person visits. Patients came from 28 states for video and 14 for in-person visits. No show visits were more frequent for in-person visits. During early months of the pandemic, few patients were seen in the clinics. Thereafter, video-visits rose sharply comprising 93% of follow-up visits in June 2020 and 62% of new patient consultations in September 2020. These rates have remained high (in March 2021, 72% of all follow-up visits and 59% of new patient consultations). CONCLUSIONS Despite reductions in COVID-19 infection rates, our neuro-oncologists continue to favor video-visits for new patient consultations and follow-up visits. Video-visits save patients and caregivers travel time, parking costs, and time away from work. They also allow an acceptable history and neurological exam, participation by many family members, easy sharing of MRI scans and laboratory data, and discussions unencumbered by face masks and shields. These advantages to video-visits remain significant even as the pandemic recedes.","output":"Innv-38.

By using a fluorescently labeled antigen as a tag for a complementary cell surface immunoglobulin, antigen-specific plasma/plasmablast cells were sorted from the rest of the cell population by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Amplification of cognate pairs of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes followed by DNA transfection into 293FT cells resulted in the highly efficient production of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies from a variety of immunized animals.

An in-depth assessment of the risk of infection that takes into account environmental setting and mitigation strategies is needed to make safe and informed decisions regarding reopening university spaces. A quantitative model of infection probability that accounts for space-specific parameters is presented to enable assessment of the risk in reopening university spaces at given densities.The model uses local positivity rate, room capacity, mask filtration efficiency, air exchange rate, room volume, and time spent in the space as parameters to calculate infection probabilities in teaching spaces, dining halls, dorms, and shared bathrooms. The model readily calculates infection probabilities in various university spaces, with mask filtration efficiency and air exchange rate being among the dominant variables. When applied to university spaces, this model demonstrated that, under specific conditions that are feasible to implement, in-person classes could be held in large lecture halls with an infection risk over the semester < 1%. Meal pick-ups from dining halls and the use of shared bathrooms in residential dormitories among small groups of students could also be accomplished with low risk. The results of applying this model to spaces at Harvard University (Cambridge and Allston campuses) and Stanford University are reported. Finally, a user-friendly web application was developed using this model to calculate infection probability following input of space-specific variables. The successful development of a quantitative model and its implementation through a web application may facilitate accurate assessments of infection risk in university spaces.

In March 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 spread to Venezuela and Ecuador. The basic reproduction number (R0 ) is a value that allows measuring the transmission rate of a virus. The SIR model is the simplest compartmental epidemiological model (Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered). The SIR model can be used to estimate R0 by fitting the curve of the infected compartment to the experimental curve of infected subjects per day. This work aims to study the projection of the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in Venezuela and Ecuador. For this purpose, five experiments took place by adjusting the SIR model curve of the infected compartment to experimental data at five-time intervals (the first 14, 28, 42, 56, and 178 days for Ecuador data and 165 days for Venezuela data). The R0 fell from 6.923 to 1.003 (between experiments 2 and 3) for Venezuelan data, and from 3.622 to 1.022 (between experiments 1 and 2) for Ecuadorian data. These differences imply that R0 depends on the preventive measures implemented to face the pandemic. On the other hand, the number of infections in Ecuador is higher compared to the infection numbers in Venezuela in each experiment. Venezuela is experiencing a complex economic crisis that limits the ability of its citizens to mobilize due to the lack of gasoline, monetary liquidity, and failures in basics services, suggesting that the economic activity of the countries will also influence the number of infections. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"SIR Model Parameter Fitting of SARS-CoV-2 Basic Reproduction Number in Venezuela and Ecuador Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I develop a conceptual framework based on a systematic and comprehensive literature review on burnout syndrome, clinically significant depression, and acute stress among medical personnel providing care to COVID-19 patients Building my argument by drawing on data collected from APIC, BMA, Ginger, Statista, IPPR, Pew Research Center, UPMC, and YouGov, I performed analyses and made estimates regarding the psychological wellbeing of frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak The data for this research were gathered via online survey questionnaires Descriptive statistics of compiled data from the completed surveys were calculated when appropriate","output":"Burnout Syndrome, Clinically Significant Depression, and Acute Stress among Medical Personnel Providing Care to COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Healthcare workers (HCWs) are particularly exposed SARS-CoV-2 because they are critical in preventing viral transmission and treating COVID-19 patients.

However, the limited pace at which the vaccine can be administered motivates the question, to what extent must we continue to adhere to social intervention measures such as mask wearing and social distancing? To address this question, we develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 spread incorporating both vaccine dynamics and socio-epidemiological parameters. We use this model to study two important measures of disease control and eradication, the effective reproductive number $R_t$ and the peak intensive care unit (ICU) caseload, over three key parameters: social measure adherence, vaccination rate, and vaccination coverage. Our results suggest that, due to the slow pace of vaccine administration, social measures must be maintained by a large proportion of the population until a sufficient proportion of the population becomes vaccinated for the pandemic to be eradicated. By contrast, with reduced adherence to social measures, hospital ICU cases will greatly exceed capacity, resulting in increased avoidable loss of life. These findings highlight the complex interplays involved between vaccination and social protective measures, and indicate the practical importance of continuing with extent social measures while vaccines are scaled up to allow the development of the herd immunity needed to end or control SARS-CoV-2 sustainably.","output":"Interplay between COVID-19 vaccines and social measures for ending the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this short communication is to outline our experience in policies and processes of a nuclear medicine service during the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore.

We analyze the change in world-wide mobility at multiple spatio-temporal resolutions -- county, state, country -- using an anonymized aggregate mobility map that captures population flows between geographic cells of size 5 km2. We show that human mobility underwent an abrupt and significant change, partly in response to the interventions, resulting in 87% reduction of international travel and up to 75% reduction of domestic travel. Taking two very different countries sampled from the global spectrum, we observe a maximum reduction of 42% in mobility across different states of the United States (US), and a 68% reduction across the states of India between late March and late April. Since then, there has been an uptick in flows, with the US seeing 53% increase and India up to 38% increase with respect to flows seen during the lockdown. As we overlay this global map with epidemic incidence curves and dates of government interventions, we observe that as case counts rose, mobility fell -- often before stay-at-home orders were issued. Further, in order to understand mixing within a region, we propose a new metric to quantify the effect of social distancing on the basis of mobility. We find that population mixing has decreased considerably as the pandemic has progressed and are able to measure this effect across the world. Finally, we carry out a counterfactual analysis of delaying the lockdown and show that a one week delay would have doubled the reported number of cases in the US and India. To our knowledge, this work is the first to model in near real-time, the interplay of human mobility, epidemic dynamics and public policies across multiple spatial resolutions and at a global scale.","output":"Interplay of global multi-scale human mobility, social distancing, government interventions, and COVID-19 dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Participation in leisure activities is key to the physical and mental health of children and adolescents with disabilities.

This report provides updated information about symptomatic women of reproductive age (15-44 years) with laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. During January 22-October 3, CDC received reports through national COVID-19 case surveillance or through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) of 1,300,938 women aged 15-44 years with laboratory results indicative of acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Data on pregnancy status were available for 461,825 (35.5%) women with laboratory-confirmed infection, 409,462 (88.7%) of whom were symptomatic. Among symptomatic women, 23,434 (5.7%) were reported to be pregnant. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions, pregnant women were significantly more likely than were nonpregnant women to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) (10.5 versus 3.9 per 1,000 cases; adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.6-3.4), receive invasive ventilation (2.9 versus 1.1 per 1,000 cases; aRR = 2.9; 95% CI = 2.2-3.8), receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (0.7 versus 0.3 per 1,000 cases; aRR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.5-4.0), and die (1.5 versus 1.2 per 1,000 cases; aRR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2-2.4). Stratifying these analyses by age and race/ethnicity highlighted disparities in risk by subgroup. Although the absolute risks for severe outcomes for women were low, pregnant women were at increased risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness. To reduce the risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19, pregnant women should be counseled about the importance of seeking prompt medical care if they have symptoms and measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection should be strongly emphasized for pregnant women and their families during all medical encounters, including prenatal care visits.

The severity and mortality of the disease is associated with a high level of release of cytokine in the patients which is known as CRS (cytokine release syndrome) or cytokine storm syndrome. IL-6 is a type of pro-inflammatory cytokine which release in the severe COVID-19 patients. This cytokine initiates CRS the JAK-STAT pathway. Tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is designed to bind both mIL-6R (membrane bound receptor for IL-6) and sIL-6R (soluble receptor for IL-6) and inhibit the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. It finally stops the cytokine storm syndrome. However, we need to understand that how tocilizumab is bound with mIL-6R or sIL-6R. Similarly, we also need to understand more about the real molecular mechanism of activity of tocilizumab.","output":"Tocilizumab: A Therapeutic Option for the Treatment of Cytokine Storm Syndrome in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, populations from many countries have been confined at home for extended periods of time in stressful environmental and media conditions. Cross-sectional studies already evidenced deleterious psychological consequences, with poor sleep as a risk factor for impaired mental health. However, limitations of cross-sectional assessments are response bias tendencies, and the inability to track daily fluctuations in specific subjective experiences in extended confinement conditions. In a prospective study conducted across three European countries, we queried participants (N = 166) twice a day through an online interface about their sleep quality and their negative psychological experiences for two consecutive weeks. Focus was set on between-and within-person associations of subjective sleep quality with daytime experiences such as rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints about the typical symptoms of the coronavirus. Results show that daily reports of country-specific COVID-19 deaths predicted increased negative mood, psychotic-like experiences and somatic complaints during the same day, and decreased subjective sleep quality the following night. Disrupted sleep was globally associated with negative psychological outcomes during the study period, and a relatively poorer night of sleep predicted increased rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints the following day. This temporal association was unidirectional since daytime reports of negative mental experiences were not associated with poor sleep quality on the following night. Our findings show that night-to-night changes in sleep quality predict how individuals cope the next day with daily challenges induced by home confinement","output":"Home confinement during the COVID-19: day-to-day associations of sleep quality with rumination, psychotic-like experiences and somatic symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In our time, the theater has greatly expanded in scope to include education, personal development, and sometimes therapy.

Personalisation of invitation letters is a potentially pragmatic and feasible way of increasing recruitment rates at a low-cost. However, there is a lack of evidence concerning the effect of personalising of study invitation letters on recruitment rates. METHODS We undertook a Study Within A Trial (SWAT) to investigate the effect of personalised versus non-personalised study invitation letters on recruitment rates into the host feasibility trial ENGAGE, a feasibility study of an internet-administered, guided, Low Intensity Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy based self-help intervention for parents of children previously treated for cancer. An intervention group (n = 254) received a personalised study invitation letter and the control group (n = 255) received a non-personalised study invitation letter. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants in the intervention group and the control group enrolled into the ENGAGE host feasibility trial. Secondary outcomes relating to the recruitment and screening process, and retention were examined. Differences in proportions between groups for the primary and secondary outcomes were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS Of the 509 potential participants, 56 (11.0%) were enrolled into the ENGAGE host feasibility trial: personalised: 30/254 (11.8%) and non-personalised: 26/255 (10.2%). No statistically significant effect on personalisation of enrolment was found (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.68-2.06). No statistically significant differences were found for any secondary outcome. CONCLUSIONS Personalisation of study invitations had no effect on recruitment. However, given the small study sample size in the present SWAT, and lack of similar embedded recruitment RCTs to enable a meta-analysis, additional SWATs to examine the personalisation of study invitation letters are warranted.

Data are needed on the effect of this antibody in patients who are hospitalized with Covid-19. METHODS: In this platform trial of therapeutic agents, we randomly assigned hospitalized patients who had Covid-19 without end-organ failure in a 1:1 ratio to receive either LY-CoV555 or matching placebo. In addition, all the patients received high-quality supportive care as background therapy, including the antiviral drug remdesivir and, when indicated, supplemental oxygen and glucocorticoids. LY-CoV555 (at a dose of 7000 mg) or placebo was administered as a single intravenous infusion over a 1-hour period. The primary outcome was a sustained recovery during a 90-day period, as assessed in a time-to-event analysis. An interim futility assessment was performed on the basis of a seven-category ordinal scale for pulmonary function on day 5. RESULTS: On October 26, 2020, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping enrollment for futility after 314 patients (163 in the LY-CoV555 group and 151 in the placebo group) had undergone randomization and infusion. The median interval since the onset of symptoms was 7 days (interquartile range, 5 to 9). At day 5, a total of 81 patients (50%) in the LY-CoV555 group and 81 (54%) in the placebo group were in one of the two most favorable categories of the pulmonary outcome. Across the seven categories, the odds ratio of being in a more favorable category in the LY-CoV555 group than in the placebo group was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 1.29; P = 0.45). The percentage of patients with the primary safety outcome (a composite of death, serious adverse events, or clinical grade 3 or 4 adverse events through day 5) was similar in the LY-CoV555 group and the placebo group (19% and 14%, respectively; odds ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.78 to 3.10; P = 0.20).

Some of them are based on the classical epidemiological approach that assumes an exponential growth, but a few studies report that a power-law scaling may provide a better fit to the currently available data. Hereby, we examine the data in China (01/20/2020--02/24/2020), and indeed find that the growth closely follows a power-law kinetics over a significantly wide time period. The exponents are $2.48(20)$, $2.21(6)$ and $4.26(12)$ for the number of confirmed infections, deaths and cured cases, respectively, indicating an underlying small-world network structure in the pandemic. While no obvious deviations from the power-law growth can be seen yet for the number of deaths and cured cases, negative deviations have clearly appeared in the number of infections, particularly that for the region outside Hubei. This suggests the beginning of the slowing-down of the virus spreading due to the huge containment effort. Meanwhile, we find that despite the dramatic difference in magnitudes, the growth kinetics of the infection number exhibits much similarity for Hubei province and the region outside Hubei. On this basis, in log-log plot, we rescale the infection number for the region outside Hubei such that it overlaps as much as possible with the total infection number in China, from which an approximate extrapolation yields the maximum of the pandemic around March 3, 2020, with the number of infections about $83,000$. Further, by analyzing the kinetics of the mortality in log-log scale, we obtains a rough estimate that near March 3, the death rate of COVID-19 would be about $4.7\\\\%\\\\thicksim 5.0\\\\%$ for Hubei province and $0.7\\\\%\\\\thicksim1.0\\\\%$ for the region outside Hubei.

The paper took a simulated sustainable food system in urban community as an example. It formulated a rational spatial planning strategy based on urban agriculture of different scales, technologies, and efficiencies, quantified productive community metrics to accommodate different scales of urban space, and wrote algorithms to develop a spatial model of a meta-cellular automaton that coupled consumer housing with productive surfaces. Finally, by comparing and optimizing the spatial patterns of multiple solutions, urban agriculture-oriented urban community planning was developed. The model was only a preliminary attempt at food system planning, but it explored the distribution patterns of housing and agriculture within a given territory in three steps: theoretical strategy-morphological simulation-planning design while meeting urban and productivity indicators.

Many viruses use members of the hosts' chaperoning system to infect the target cells, replicate, and spread, and here we present illustrative examples. Unfortunately, the role of chaperones in the SARS-CoV-2 cycle is still poorly understood. In this review, we examine the interactions of various coronaviruses during their infectious cycle with chaperones in search of information useful for future research on SARS-CoV-2. We also call attention to the possible role of molecular mimicry in the development of autoimmunity and its widespread pathogenic impact in COVID-19 patients. Viral proteins share highly antigenic epitopes with human chaperones, eliciting anti-viral antibodies that crossreact with the chaperones. Both, the critical functions of chaperones in the infectious cycle of viruses and the possible role of these molecules in COVID-19 autoimmune phenomena, make clear that molecular chaperones are promising candidates for the development of antiviral strategies. These could consist of inhibiting-blocking those chaperones that are necessary for the infectious viral cycle, or those that act as autoantigens in the autoimmune reactions causing generalized destructive effects on human tissues.","output":"The Role of Molecular Chaperones in Virus Infection and Implications for Understanding and Treating COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of October 8th(,) 2020, the number of confirmed cases and deaths in Brazil due to COVID-19 hit 5,002,357 and 148,304, respectively, making the country one of the most affected by the pandemic. The State of S?o Paulo (SSP) hosts the largest number of confirmed cases in Brazil, with over 1,016,755 cases to date. This study was carried out to investigate how the social distancing measures could have influenced the Ibitinga reservoir's water transparency in S?o Paulo State, Brazil. We hypothesize that although the city's drainage is the major reservoir's input, as opposed to what has been reported elsewhere, the effect of extensive lockdown in the city of S?o Paulo due to COVID-19 is marginal on the water transparency. A time series of OLI/Landsat-8 images since 2014 were used to estimate the Secchi Disk Depth (Z(SD)). The COVID-19 cases and deaths (per 100,000 inhabitants), and social isolation index were used to find links between the Z(SD) and COVID-19. The results showed that the highest Z(DS) (higher than 1.6 m) occurred during the dry season (Austral autumn and beginning of Austral winter) and the lowest (0.4C0.8 m) during March 2020 (end of Austral summer).

Z(SD) values from May 20th were not statistically different from May 14th and April 15th; June 20th values were not different from June 14th; and March 20th values were statistically different from all.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically evaluate the quality, usability, evidence-based content, and gamification features (GFs) of commercially available m-learning apps for teaching guideline-directed BLS knowledge and skills to school-aged children. METHODS: We searched the Google Play Store and Apple iOS App Store using multiple terms (eg, cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR] or BLS). Apps meeting the inclusion criteria were evaluated by 15 emergency health care professionals using the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale and System Usability Scale. We modified a five-finger mnemonic for teaching schoolchildren BLS and reviewed the apps BLS content using standardized criteria based on three CPR guidelines. GFs in the apps were evaluated using a gamification taxonomy. RESULTS: Of the 1207 potentially relevant apps, only 6 (0.49%) met the inclusion criteria. Most apps were excluded because the content was not related to teaching schoolchildren BLS. The mean total scores for the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale and System Usability Scale score were 3.2/5 points (95% CI 3.0-3.4) and 47.1/100 points (95% CI 42.1-52.1), respectively. Half of the apps taught hands-only CPR, whereas the other half also included ventilation. All the apps indicated when to start chest compressions, and only 1 app taught BLS using an automated external defibrillator. Gamification was well integrated into the m-learning apps for teaching schoolchildren BLS, whereas the personal and fictional, educational, and performance gamification groups represented most GFs. CONCLUSIONS: Improving the quality and usability of BLS content in apps and combining them with GFs can offer educators novel m-learning tools to teach schoolchildren BLS skills.","output":"Evaluating Quality, Usability, Evidence-Based Content, and Gamification Features in Mobile Learning Apps Designed to Teach Children Basic Life Support: Systematic Search in App Stores and Content Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 coronavirus encodes an essential papain\\\\like protease domain as part of its non\\\\structural protein (nsp)\\\\3, namely SARS2 PLpro, that cleaves the viral polyprotein, but also removes ubiquitin\\\\like ISG15 protein modifications as well as, with lower activity, Lys48\\\\linked polyubiquitin.

This paper considers employing a simple abstract single-trace analysis method using simple interval and congruent modulo domains to track dependencies at lower time and memory costs. The method gathers and abstracts the set of all memory reference addresses for each static memory access instruction. This method removes the need for keeping a large shadow memory and only requires a single pair-wise analysis pass to detect dependencies among memory instructions through simple intersection operations. Moreover, the combination of interval and congruent domains improves precision when compared with only using an interval domain representation, mainly when the data is not accessed in a dense access pattern. We further improve precision through partitioning memory space into blocks, where references in each block abstracted independently.

The mean follow-up duration was 40.5 months (18-108). Twenty-one risk factors were identified, 10 of which were explored quantitatively. Statistically significant risk factors for recurrent instability following a Bankart procedure were age under 20 years (odds ratio [OR] 4.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8-96.23, p < 0.00001), a Hill-Sachs lesion (OR 3.61, 95% CI 2.06-6.33, p < 0.00001), a glenoid bone lesion (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.96-4.01, p < 0.00001), shoulder hyperlaxity (OR 4.55, 95% CI 2.19-9.44, p < 0.0001), and an off-track lesion (OR 5.53, 95% CI 2.21-13.86, p = 0.0003). There was moderate evidence indicating that male sex (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.07-2.37, p = 0.02) and playing contact sports (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.96-2.45, p = 0.07) were further risk factors. Dominant side, a superior labrum from anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesion, and more than five preoperative dislocations were not found to be risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Patients younger than 20 years of age, a Hill-Sachs lesion, a glenoid bone lesion, shoulder hyperlaxity, and an off-track lesion appear to be significant predictors of recurrent instability following a Bankart procedure. Factors such as male sex and playing contact sports were associated with recurrent instability.

It represents a unique method for image processing, object detection, and classification. CNN has shown to be an efficient approach in the machine learning and computer vision fields. CNN is composed of several filters accompanied by nonlinear functions and pooling layers. It enforces limitations on the weights and interconnections of the neural network to create a good structure for processing spatial and temporal distributed data. A CNN can restrain the numbering of free parameters of the network through its weight-sharing property. However, the training of CNNs is a challenging approach. Some optimization techniques have been recently employed to optimize CNN's weight and biases such as Ant Colony Optimization, Genetic, Harmony Search, and Simulated Annealing. This paper employs the well-known nature-inspired algorithm called Shuffled Frog-Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) for training a classical CNN structure (LeNet-5), which has not been experienced before. The training method is investigated by employing four different datasets. To verify the study, the results are compared with some of the most famous evolutionary trainers: Whale Optimization Algorithm (WO), Bacteria Swarm Foraging Optimization (BFSO), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The outcomes demonstrate that the SFL technique considerably improves the performance of the original LeNet-5 although using this algorithm slightly increases the training computation time. The results also demonstrate that the suggested algorithm presents high accuracy in classification and approximation in its mechanism.","output":"Investigation of Effectiveness of Shuffled Frog-Leaping Optimizer in Training a Convolution Neural Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shaken hospitals worldwide.

We conducted a literature review of studies (n = 12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n = 12) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression. We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays. The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. Control/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies. Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses of ACEIs or ARBs than are typically administered to patients. Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression. Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19.

However, with the progression of the global pandemic and the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, follow-up studies need to be performed to monitor the alterations of psychological status and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among CD patients. AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant on the mental health and life quality among the CD population and tried to explore potent risk factors. METHODS: This observational study included 153 CD patients who responded to our pre-designed self-reported questionnaire. Demographic, clinical, and psychological information were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Quite a number of CD patients were confronted with different levels of anxiety and depression, with incidence of 28.10 and 31.37% for anxiety and depression, respectively. Compared with non-pandemic circumstances, the life quality of CD patients due to the present situation was more often compromised. Isolation [odds ratio (OR): 4.71, P = 0.007] was verified as a risk factor for anxiety while use of telemedicine could help relieve anxiety (OR: 0.22, P < 0.001). Worsening of symptoms (OR: 4.92, P = 0.006), isolation (OR: 5.75, P = 0.005), and drug withdrawn (OR: 2.66, P = 0.026) were identified to be independent factors for developing depression. Likewise, use of telemedicine (OR: 0.13, P < 0.001) was negatively related to depression. Considering life quality, vaccination (OR: 3.07, P = 0.021) together with no medication (OR: 7.73, P = 0.010) was relevant to better life quality while worsening of symptoms (OR: 0.09, P = 0.034) were an independent risk factor for impaired life quality. CONCLUSION: Many CD patients suffered from symptoms of anxiety and depression and impaired life quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those in isolation or with worsening of symptoms and drug withdrawn were more prone to experience psychological stress. Individualized management such as drug delivery and telemedicine should be promoted to maintain control of mental health and life quality during the pandemic.","output":"Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant on the Psychological States and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With Crohns Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The viral epidemic caused by the new Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the new Coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19).

However, the population of patients with COVID who are admitted with false negative testing is unstudied. OBJECTIVE: To characterize and develop a model to predict true SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients who initially test negative for COVID by PCR. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Five hospitals within the Yale New Haven Health System between 3/10/2020 and 9/1/2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients who received diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus within the first 96 hours of hospitalization. EXPOSURE: We developed a logistic regression model from readily available electronic health record data to predict SARS-CoV-2 positivity in patients who were positive for COVID and those who were negative and never retested. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This model was applied to patients testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 who were retested within the first 96 hours of hospitalization. We evaluated the ability of the model to discriminate between patients who would subsequently retest negative and those who would subsequently retest positive. RESULTS: We included 31,459 hospitalized adult patients; 2,666 of these patients tested positive for COVID and 3,511 initially tested negative for COVID and were retested. Of the patients who were retested, 61 (1.7%) had a subsequent positive COVID test. The model showed that higher age, vital sign abnormalities, and lower white blood cell count served as strong predictors for COVID positivity in these patients. The model had moderate performance to predict which patients would retest positive with a test set area under the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) of 0.76 (95% CI 0.70-0.83). Using a cutpoint for our risk prediction model at the 90th percentile for probability, we were able to capture 35/61 (57%) of the patients who would retest positive. This cutpoint amounts to a number-needed-to-retest range between 15 and 77 patients. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: We show that a pragmatic model can predict which patients should be retested for COVID.

Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) is a core aspect of good research practice and is recommended throughout the research process, including the formulation and refinement of pertinent research questions. Therefore, the explicit aim of this PPI study was to collect qualitative data from patients on the feasibility and requirement for further research into the experience of younger hip arthroplasty patients. Methods: Qualitative data was collected via an online questionnaire that was advertised on social media, requesting the input of anybody who had experienced a lower limb musculoskeletal injury or condition before the age of 50. The survey asked the respondents to describe their experiences and reflect on their priorities and goals throughout their recovery. Results: There were 71 respondents, of which 90% were female, with an average age of 43. Qualitative responses identified many concerns that were issues that could be translated across all patient ages. However, other priorities were raised that are not always recognised as important when measuring successful outcomes after a THA. Furthermore, many respondents described not feeling listened to by clinicians or treatment options not being sufficiently addressed and explored.

One of the tools that can help students to understand those phenomena in a better way is computer simulations. The computer simulations are usually used in both on-site classroom and on-line learning platforms. Learning in the COVID-19 pandemic era at present, the computer simulations are very important for helping students to understand the physics concept. Interactive computer simulation can be considered as one of the effective methods of facilitating inquiry learning in science, as it allows students to experience the scientific inquiry process and facilitates students to understand an conception and to understand the relationship between variables of invisible phenomena more clearly in reasonable ways. This study aimed to develop the interactive computer simulation and learning activity for enhancing students' conceptual understanding of the buoyant force on the CoSci learning platform. Totally eighteen participants were studied in the twelfth grade in science classrooms of a university-affiliated school project (SCiUS), Khon Kaen University, Thailand, in 2019. The learning activity was developed based on students' alternative concepts and used to facilitate students' conceptual understanding of the buoyant force. There were six basic concepts related to the buoyant force constructed based on the predict-observe-explain strategy (POE) with the interactive computer simulation (i.e., the CoSci learning platform) in the learning activity. The learning activity on the CoSci learning platform consisted of eight pie charts such as 1) main question pie chart, 2) density pie chart, 3) water level pie chart, 4) volume pie chart, 5) mass pie chart, 6) weight pie chart, 7) submerged depth pie chart, and 8) answer pie chart. There were six interactive computer simulations used in this research including 1) density simulation, 2) water level simulation, 3) volume simulation, 4) mass simulation, 5) submerged depth simulation, and 6) weight simulation. All of these simulations were developed on the CoSci learning platform (https://cosci.tw/). The findings showed that 72% of students performed better in the post-test scores than in the pre-test score in all six basic concepts related to the buoyant force after learning buoyant force on the CoSci platform. Furthermore, the most difficulty in changing misconception in learning of the buoyant force was the concept related to the mass of the object. ? 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

This study reports the results of bamlanivimab utilization in monotherapy in Umbria (Italian region) to verify whether, in a population with multiple risk factors, comparable results to the phase 2 BLAZE1 trial had been obtained. METHODS: Between March and April 2021, a retrospective observational study was performed on patients treated with bamlanivimab. Demographic and clinical characteristics before and after infusion were evaluated. Moreover, a telephone interview was conducted about 30 days after the infusion to evaluate the overall course. RESULTS: All patients had an early infection (mean 41.73 days), almost all by alpha variant (97%). No adverse events to treatment were observed.

An elevated IFN signature has been associated with clinically observed neuro-behavioural deficits such as mild cognitive impairment, fatigue, depression and psychosis in these diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying these neuropsychiatric symptoms remain largely unknown, and it is as yet unclear how IFN signalling might influence central nervous system (CNS) function. Aberrant microglia-mediated synaptic pruning and function has recently been implicated in several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, but whether and how IFN modulates these functions are not well defined. METHODS: Using a model of peripheral IFN administration, we investigated gene expression changes due to IFNAR signalling in microglia. Bulk RNA sequencing on sorted microglia from wild type and microglia-specific Ifnar1 conditional knockout mice was performed to evaluate IFN and IFNAR signalling-dependent changes in gene expression. Furthermore, the effects of IFN on microglia morphology and synapse engulfment were assessed, via immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found that IFN exposure through the periphery induces a unique gene signature in microglia that includes the expected upregulation of multiple interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), as well as the complement component C4b. We additionally characterized several IFN-dependent changes in microglial phenotype, including expression of CD45 and CD68, cellular morphology and presynaptic engulfment, that reveal subtle brain region-specific differences. Finally, by specifically knocking down expression of IFNAR1 on microglia, we show that these changes are largely attributable to direct IFNAR signalling on microglia and not from indirect signalling effects through other CNS parenchymal cell types which are capable of IFN-IFNAR signal transduction. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral IFN induces unique genetic and phenotypic changes in microglia that are largely dependent on direct signalling through microglial IFNAR. The IFN-induced upregulation of C4b could play important roles in the context of aberrant synaptic pruning in neuropsychiatric disease.

The outcome variable was the onset or increase in sleep problems, and the exposure variable was the presence of CNCDs. The adjusted Odds Ratio of the association between CNCDs and sleep was estimated, and a mediation analysis was performed to test the effect of the report of sadness or nervousness on this association, using the Karlson Holm Breen method. The increase in sleep problems was reported by 44.9% of the population, and 33.9% reported at least one CNCD. The chance of sleep problems was higher among people with diabetes (1.34; 1.05-1.71), hypertension (1.26; 1.06-1.50), and with coronary heart diseases (1.36; 1.13-1.65) or respiratory diseases (1.42; 1.04-1.93).

METHODS The FMECA study was performed on each single selected phase of appendectomy and on complication-related data during the period January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2010. The risk analysis phase was completed by evaluation of the criticality index (CI) of each appendectomy-related failure mode (FM). The CI is calculated by multiplying the estimated frequency of occurrence (O) of the FM, by the expected severity of the injury to the patient (S), and the detectability (D) of the FM. RESULTS In the first year of analysis (2009), 177 appendectomies were performed, 110 open and 67 laparoscopic. Eleven adverse events were related to the open appendectomy: 1 bleeding (CI: 8) and 10 postoperative infections (CI: 32). Three adverse events related to the laparoscopic approach were recorded: 1 postoperative infection (CI: 8) and 2 incorrect extractions of the appendix through the umbilical port (CI: 6). In the second year of analysis (2010), 158 appendectomies were performed, 69 open and 89 laparoscopic. Four adverse events were related to the open appendectomy: 1 incorrect management of the histological specimen (CI: 2), 1 dehiscence of the surgical wound (CI: 6), and 2 infections (CI: 6). No adverse events were recorded in laparoscopic approach. CONCLUSION FMECA helped the staff compare the 2 approaches through an accurate step-by-step analysis, highlighting that laparoscopic appendectomy is feasible and safe, associated with a lower incidence of infection and other complications, reduced length of hospital stay, and an apparent lower procedure-related risk.","output":"Use of failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis to compare the vulnerabilities of laparoscopic versus open appendectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fermented foods have been proposed in limiting SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Patients with hematological disorders are known to be at high risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been rapidly developed. Although mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are reported to be effective, efficacy in patients with hematological malignancies who have received anti-CD20 antibody treatment remains unclear. Here, we prospectively evaluated the efficacy of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients with B-cell malignancies treated with anti-CD20 antibody. We first evaluated antibody titers in 12 healthy volunteers (median age 75.5 years, range 57-82) and three lymphoma patients undergoing R-CHOP therapy (73, 81, and 81 years old) who had received 2 vaccine doses of BNT162b2 at pre-vaccination, 21 days after the first dose and 14 days after the second dose of vaccination. IgG antibody titers for S1 protein were measured in serum samples by ELISA. In healthy control subjects, titers were clearly increased. In contrast, no patient treated with R-CHOP developed antibodies even after the second vaccination (Figure A). To determine the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell reactivity in these three patients, we evaluated interferon (IFN)- response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide before and after the second vaccination dose, and detected IFN- responses after vaccination in all three patients (Figure B). Next, to investigate the duration of the effect of anti-CD20 antibody on antibody production to BNT162b2, we enrolled 36 patients (median age 74 years, range 50-87) who had received the final dose of anti-CD20 antibody 48-1320 (median 571) days before vaccination. S1 antibody titers were measured 14 days after the second dose of vaccination. Diagnoses included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 21), follicular lymphoma (n = 9), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstr?m's macroglobulinemia (n = 3), and mantle cell lymphoma (n = 3). Thirty-four patients had received rituximab-based and 2 had received obinutuzumab-based therapy, with a median of 6 (range 3-20) courses. No patient had received any chemotherapy after the last anti-CD20 antibody dose. No patient vaccinated within close to one year or sooner after the last anti-CD20 antibody administration showed an increase in titers. Furthermore, titers in most patients were lower than in healthy volunteers even among those vaccinated more than three years after the last administration (Figure C). Finally, we investigated surrogate markers of antibody production ability. We found no relationship between the percent of B-cells (CD19-positive cells) and S1 antibody titers (Figure D), whereas all patients (n = 9) with total IgG level below lower normal limit (< 870 mg/dl) had low S1 antibody titers (< 0.16), below the lowest optical density (O.D.) value in healthy donors (Figure E). These findings indicate that the antibody-mediated response to vaccination in patients following treatment with anti-CD20 antibody was considerably impaired for an extended time. Alternative protection strategies for these patients are therefore warranted. Although T-cell responses were detected, we recommend that these patients continue to wear a face mask and wash their hands to prevent COVID-19 even after vaccination.

RESULTS: While per capita food waste did not significantly change (mean(pre) = 1.076 kg per week, mean(post) = 1.080 kg per week), total per capita unavoidable food waste (mean(pre) = 0.388 kg per week, mean(post) = 0.614 kg per week) and pre capita unavoidable fruit and vegetable (mean(pre) = 0.289 kg per week, mean(post) = 0.427 kg per week) waste significantly increased (p < 0.01) at post-COVID-19. Total per capita avoidable other waste decreased (mean(pre) = 0.385 kg per week, mean(post) = 0.179 kg per week, p < 0.05). The increase in unavoidable food waste may relate to households cooking more often at home, as reported in interviews, or shopping less frequently and buying more per trip, as identified in the surveys. The decrease in avoidable food waste could be related to the increase in serving of leftovers (p < 0.01), as identified in the surveys, or an increase in meal planning and inventory management, as reported in interviews.

The present study assessed expectations and perceptions of a school-based mindfulness training among school personnel in 21 Appalachian schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Upon enrollment in the training, staff (N = 191) responded to open ended survey questions regarding perceived impacts of COVID-19 on students, expected benefits and barriers to school-based mindfulness, and perceived community acceptance of mindfulness. RESULTS: School personnel identified social isolation and lack of structure as negative impacts of COVID-19 on students. Expected benefits of classroom mindfulness included improved coping skills, focus, and emotion regulation, whereas barriers included lack of time and student ability level (e.g., age, attention). While most respondents indicated that their community was accepting of mindfulness practices, some noted resistance to and misperceptions of mindfulness, which may illustrate the influence of local cultural norms and values on the acceptability of mental health interventions.

An environmental realistic higher tier test is a STP simulation test as described in OECD 303A (2001) which for nanoparticles can also be used to study their sorption behavior to activated sludge. However, information is limited on the influence of synthetic sewage on the microbial community of the activated sludge. A modified community can result in modifications of the sludge floccules affecting the sorption behavior. The main objective of our study was to show whether a representative microbial diversity remains under standardized test conditions as described in OECD 303A (2001) using synthetic sewage as influent. Furthermore, we investigated whether just considering the functional properties of a STP (elimination of dissolved organic carbon; nitrification), is sufficient for an assessment of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) or whether the influence on microbial diversity also needs to be considered. AuNPs were used as a case study due to their rising medical applications and therefore increasing probability to reach the sewer and STP. The results can provide significant input for the interpretation of results from the regulatory point of view. To deliver these objectives, the general changes of the microbial population in activated sludge and its influence on the degradation activity (dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and inorganic nitrogen) using freshly collected sludge from the municipal STP in an artificial test system as a model STP in accordance with OECD 303A (2001) were assessed. Additionally, we evaluated the potential impact of AuNPs and its dispersant on the microbial composition and the overall impact on the function of the STP in terms of DOC degradation and nitrogen removal to observe if an assessment based on functional properties is sufficient. The bacteria composition in our study, evaluated at a class level, revealed commonly described environmental bacteria. Proteobacteria (?, &#945;, ?) accounted for more than 50% but also nitrifying bacteria as Nitrospira were present. Our results show that mainly within the first 7 days of an acclimatization phase by addition of synthetic sewage, the bacterial community changed. Even though AuNPs can have antibacterial properties, no adverse effects on the function and structure of the microorganisms in the STP could be detected at concentrations of increased modeled PEC values by a factor of about 10,000. Complementary to other metallic nanomaterials, gold nanomaterials also sorb to a large extent to the activated sludge. If activated sludge is used as fertilizer on agricultural land, gold nanoparticles can be introduced into soils. In this case, the effect on soil (micro)organisms must be investigated more closely, also taking into account the structural diversity.","output":"Microbial Population Dynamics in Model Sewage Treatment Plants and the Fate and Effect of Gold Nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aim: The COVID-19 has affected sensory organs in a different manner. This paper aimed to review the auditory-vestibular symptoms associated with COVID-19 and it also investigated the impacts of this pandemic on hearing-impaired community. Recent Findings: The existing studies related to the effects of COVID-19 on the auditoryvestibular system were reviewed and discussed in order to achieve the overall image of COVID-19 on this system. Moreover, due to the adverse effects of using a mask on the communication function of hearing-impaired people, the effects of the mask on the communication process of hearing-impaired people were also reviewed. Conclusion: COVID-19 may be accompanying with some auditory and vestibular dysfunctions. Although there are few findings in this area, they showed that the induced hearing loss is often sudden in nature and it is unclear that this situation is because of the ototoxicity of virus treated drugs or not. The vertigo induced by COVID-19 can be a direct invasion of the virus or an invasion by the immune system and its association with hearing loss and tinnitus must be identified, and appropriate referrals should be considered. On the other hand, due to the adverse effects of using personal protective equipment such as masks on the communication performance of hearing-impaired people, the necessary advice and guidance in this field are provided to the medical staff.

The study aimed at appraisal of CP transfusion safety and usefulness in COVID pneumonia. METHODS: Single arm, MEURI study design of non-randomized open label trial was conducted in five centers. Patients werecategorized as moderately severe, severe, and critical. The primary endpoint was a) improvement in clinical status and change in category of disease severity; secondary endpoint was b) CP ability to halt disease progression to invasive ventilation. CP transfused to hospitalized patients. Statistical tests including median (interquartile ranges), Mann-Whitney U test, Fishers exact test using SPSS ver. 23, ANOVA and Chi-square test were applied for the analysis of results parameters before and after CP treatment. SOFA score was applied for multiorgan failure in severe and critical cases. RESULTS: A total of 50 adult patients; median age 58.5 years (range: 29C92 years) received CP with infusion titers; median 1:320 U/mL (Interquartile range 1:80C1:320) between April 4 to May 5, 2020. The median time from onset of symptoms to enrollment in trial was 3 to 7 days with shortness of breath and lung infiltration as severity criterion. In 35 (70%) recipients, oxygen saturation improved from 80 to 95% within 72h, with resolution of lung infiltrates. Primary endpoint was achieved in 44 (88%) recipients whereas secondary endpoint was achieved in 42 (84%). No patient experienced severe adverse events. A high SOFA score (> 7) correlated with deaths in severe and critical patients. Eight (16%) patients expired due to comorbidities; cardiac arrest in 2 (4%), multiorgan failure secondary to cytokine storm in 5 (10%) and ventilator associated complications in 1 (2%). CONCLUSION: CP transfusion can be used as a safe and useful treatment in moderately severe and severe patients.

Advanced statistical workflows permitting such evaluation is a needed area within respiratory medicine; their adoption remains slow, with poor workflow accuracy. Diseased lung regions often produce high-density zones on CT images, limiting an algorithm's execution to specify damaged lobes due to oblique or lacking fissures. This impact motivated developing an improved machine learning method to segment lung lobes that utilises tracheobronchial tree information to enhance segmentation accuracy through the algorithm's spatial familiarity to define lobar extent more accurately. The method undertakes parallel segmentation of lobes and auxiliary tissues simultaneously by employing multi-task learning (MTL) in conjunction with V-Net-attention, a popular convolutional neural network in the imaging realm. In keeping with the model's adeptness for better generalisation, high performance was retained in an external dataset of patients with four distinct diseases: severe lung cancer, COVID-19 pneumonitis, collapsed lungs and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), even though the training data included none of these cases. The benefit of our external validation test is specifically relevant since our choice includes those patients who have diagnosed lung disease with associated radiological abnormalities. To ensure equal rank is given to all segmentations in the main task we report the following performance (Dice score) on a per-segment basis: normal lungs 0.97, COPD 0.94, lung cancer 0.94, COVID-19 pneumonitis 0.94 and collapsed lung 0.92, all at p<0.05. Even segmenting lobes with large deformations on CT images, the model maintained high accuracy.

Adolescents with diabetes are at higher risk of developing eating problems than are their healthy peers. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of leisure time boredom and A1C level on eating problems in adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. DESIGN AND METHODS A descriptive, correlational, and cross-sectional design was used in this study. The study was conducted in Turkey, with the participation of 173 adolescents diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Convenience sampling was used to recruit patients from pediatric endocrinology outpatient clinics of hospitals. RESULTS It was determined that the diabetes eating problems of adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes were mostly affected by the level of leisure time and A1C, respectively. In the overall model, 58% (F = 4119.701, p < .001) of the factors affecting diabetes eating problems could be explained by the level of leisure boredom and A1C level. CONCLUSION It has been found that the adolescents with diabetes with high A1C levels and who cannot use their leisure time and have boredom are more at risk in terms of diabetes eating problems. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS It should be determined how the adolescents with diabetes spend their lesiure time by diabetes health care team, which should be supported to develop leisure time skills. Effective use of leisure time and strategies to cope with boredom should also be included in diabetes education.","output":"The effect of leisure boredom and A1C level on diabetes eating problems in adolescents with type 1 diabetes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Addressing health inequities for racial and ethnic minority populations is challenging.

This exposes them to a higher risk of developing chronic stress, psychological distress, and any other mental health symptoms. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate stress and burnout in a health workers population and, in addition, to measure hair cortisol concentration as a current biomarker of stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 234 health workers from Hospital de Clnicas Jos de San Martn, Buenos Aires University, were included in this study. In this population hair samples were obtained from the posterior vertex as close to the scalp as possible and the individuals completed the following surveys: perceived stress, social support, burnout scale, life event scale, and sociodemographic data. Hair cortisol was measured by an automated chemiluminescent method. The studied population was divided into three groups considering those individuals below the healthy reference sample range (< 40 pg/mg hair), within the healthy reference range (40C128 pg/mg hair) and above the reference range (> 128 pg/mg hair). This study used a transversal and observational design. RESULTS: Our results show that 40% of the studied population presented hair cortisol values outside of the healthy reference range. In the whole studied population, a direct correlation was found between hair cortisol concentration and perceived stress as well as between hair cortisol concentration and the emotional exhaustion component of burnout (r = 0.142, p = 0.030; r = 0.143, p = 0.029, respectively). 12% of the studied population showed Burnout (52% doctors and residents, 19% nurses, 19% administrative personnel). Higher values in hair cortisol levels were found in the group with burnout versus individuals without burnout (p = 0.034). Finally, a mediation analysis was performed, finding that depersonalization is a mediating variable in the relationship between self-perceived stress and hair cortisol level (F = 4.86, p = 0.0086; indirect effect IC: 0.0987-1.8840). CONCLUSION: This is the first study in which a stress biomarker such as hair cortisol is evaluated in this population and in this context. Healthcare workers are subjected to increased levels of stress and burnout. High depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and decreased personal sense of accomplishment characterize this population. It is the responsibility of the health authorities to implement strategies to manage this psychological emergency.","output":"Evaluation of stress, burnout and hair cortisol levels in health workers at a University Hospital during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many viruses, including bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenzavirus-3 (PI3), bovine coronavirus, bovine viral diarrhea virus and bovine reovirus, have been etiologically associated with respiratory disease in cattle.

The so-called and recently introduced term 'acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections' (ABSSSIs), a cluster of fairly common types of infection, including abscesses, cellulitis, and wound infections, require an immediate effective antibacterial treatment as part of a timely and cautious management. The extreme level of resistance globally to many antibiotic drugs in the prevalent causative pathogens, the presence of risk factors of treatment failure, and the high epidemic of comorbidities (e.g. diabetes and obesity) make the appropriate selection of the antibiotic for physicians highly challenging. The selection of antibiotics is primarily empirical for ABSSSI patients which subsequently can be adjusted based on culture results, although rarely available in outpatient management. There is substantial evidence suggesting that inappropriate antibiotic treatment is given to approximately 20-25% of patients, potentially prolonging their hospital stay and increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality. The current review paper discusses the concerns related to the management of ABSSSI and the patient types who are most vulnerable to poor outcomes. It also highlights the key management time-points that treating physicians and surgeons must be aware of in order to achieve clinical success and to discharge patients from the hospital as early as possible.","output":"Management of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections with a focus on patients at high risk of treatment failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anomaly detection remains an open challenge in many application areas. While there are a number of available machine learning algorithms for detecting anomalies, analysts are frequently asked to take additional steps in reasoning about the root cause of the anomalies and form actionable hypotheses that can be communicated to business stakeholders. Without the appropriate tools, this reasoning process is time-consuming, tedious, and potentially error-prone. In this paper we present PIXAL, a visual analytics system developed following an iterative design process with professional analysts responsible for anomaly detection. PIXAL is designed to fill gaps in existing tools commonly used by analysts to reason with and make sense of anomalies. PIXAL consists of three components: (1) an algorithm that finds patterns by aggregating multiple anomalous data points using first-order predicates, (2) a visualization tool that allows the analyst to build trust in the algorithmically-generated predicates by performing comparative and counterfactual analyses, and (3) a visualization tool that helps the analyst generate and validate hypotheses by exploring which features in the data most explain the anomalies. Finally, we present the results of a qualitative observational study with professional analysts. These results of the study indicate that PIXAL facilitates the anomaly reasoning process, allowing analysts to make sense of anomalies and generate hypotheses that are meaningful and actionable to business stakeholders.","output":"PIXAL: Anomaly Reasoning with Visual Analytics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The generalized logistic equation is used to interpret the COVID-19 epidemic data in several countries: Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey and South Korea.

It is shown that the dependence of the number of the infected people on time is well described on average by the logistic curve (within the framework of a simple or generalized logistic equation) with a determination coefficient exceeding 0.8. At the same time, the dependence of the number of the infected people per day on time has a very uneven character and can be described very roughly by the logistic curve. To describe it, it is necessary to take into account the dependence of the model coefficients on time or on the total number of cases. Variations, for example, of the growth rate can reach 60%. The variability spectra of the coefficients have characteristic peaks at periods of several days, which corresponds to the observed serial intervals.

We used a static simulation model with detailed demographic and risk factor stratification to compare the impact of different vaccine prioritization strategies in the United States on key health outcomes, using California as a case example. We calibrated the model to demographic and location data on 28,175 COVID-19 deaths in California up to December 30, 2020, and incorporated variation in risk by occupation and comorbidity status using published estimates. We predicted the proportion of COVID-19 clinical cases, deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted over 6 months relative to a scenario of no vaccination for five vaccination strategies that prioritized vaccination by a single risk factor: random allocation; targeting special populations (e.g. incarcerated individuals); targeting older individuals; targeting essential workers; and targeting individuals with comorbidities. Targeting older individuals averted the highest proportion of DALYs (40% for 5 million individuals vaccinated) and deaths (65%) but the lowest proportion of cases (12%). Targeting essential workers averted the lowest proportion of DALYs (25%) and deaths (33%). Allocating vaccinations simultaneously by age and location or by age, sex, race/ethnicity, location, occupation, and comorbidity status averted a significantly higher proportion of DALYs (48% and 56%) than any strategy prioritizing by a single risk factor. Our results corroborate findings of other studies that age targeting is the best single-risk-factor prioritization strategy for averting DALYs, and suggest that targeting by multiple risk factors would provide additional benefit.","output":"Comparison of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Covid-19 pandemic, four patients were admitted to a healthcare centre.

All had different usual long-term therapy treatments but had fixed doses of AVK to reach a stable INR. No changes to the background regimen were implemented. One patient presented a cough whereas the three others were asymptomatic. In the context of the pandemic, a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was carried out for each patient. The results of the RT-PCR rests were all positive and were associated with a substantially increased INR. Mr H. was admitted with an INR of 2.25 which increased to 5.93 the day after RT-PCR positivity. AVK treatment was stopped but the INR one day after was 7.89. Ms J. presented INR values between 1.96 and 4.58, 10 days later. a PCR test was conducted and AVK treatment was stopped, but the INR still increased to 5.85.

Inversely, these four cases show a haemorrhagic risk as the INR increases. There could be a risk of overdose when patients are treated with AVK and are positive for Covid-19. This raises the question of discontinuing AVK and substituting it with another anticoagulant, or performing INR checks more frequently in the context of Covid-19.

We also observed protective associations by influenza, pneumococcal, and several other vaccines. Subgroup and interaction analyses were also conducted, which revealed differences in protective effects in various subgroups.

Two dimensions of exposure to temperature are generally used to model budbreak: accumulation of time spent at low temperatures (chilling); and accumulation of heat units (forcing). These two effects have a well-established negative correlation: the more chilling, the less forcing required for budbreak. Furthermore, temperate plant species are assumed to vary in amount of chilling required to complete endodormancy and begin the transition to breaking bud. Still, prediction of budbreak remains a challenge. The present work demonstrates across a wide range of species how bud cold hardiness must be accounted for to study dormancy and accurately predict time to budbreak. Cold hardiness defines the path length to budbreak, meaning the difference between the cold hardiness buds attain during the winter, and the cold hardiness at which deacclimated buds are predicted to open. This distance varies among species and throughout winter within a species. Increases in rate of cold hardiness loss (deacclimation) measured throughout winter show that chilling controls deacclimation potential C the proportion of the maximum rate response attained at high chill accumulation C which has a sigmoid relationship to chilling accumulation. For forcing, rates of deacclimation increase non-linearly in response to temperature. Comparisons of deacclimation potential show a dormancy progresses similarly for all species. This observation suggests that comparisons of physiologic and genetic control of dormancy requires an understanding of cold hardiness dynamics and the necessity for an update of the framework for studying dormancy and its effects on spring phenology.","output":"Woody species do not differ in dormancy progression: differences in time to budbreak due to forcing and cold hardiness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that affects almost every organ system and it is treated with immunomodulation and immunosuppression.

Due to the absence of any approved antiviral drug to treat COVID-19, its lethality is getting severe with time. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2, M(pro) is considered one of the potential drug targets because of its role in processing proteins translated from viral RNA. In the present study, four of the plant metabolites, 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide, andrograpanin, quinine, cinchonine from two eminent medicinal plants Andrographis paniculata and Cinchona officinalis, have been evaluated against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 through in-silico molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation study. From the result interpretations, it is found that andrograpanin has strong binding affinities with the target protein in its active site with potential negative energies. Molecular Dynamic simulation and MMGBSA studies suggest that earlier reported N3 inhibitor and andrograpanin exhibit effective binding interactions involving identical amino acid residues with the same binding pockets of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the theoretical experiment suggests that andrograpanin, could be considered the promising inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro).

Currently, it has become the primary mechanism of care delivery for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While obstacles are present for hospitals and providers to establish these services, most barriers exist with patient access. Patients require advanced technical support, translator services, and other measures to become comfortable engaging in a telemedicine encounter. In addition, appropriate follow-up must be provided for chronic medical illnesses and malignancies, helping to prevent the evolution of these conditions during the COVID-19 crisis. Finally, we must ensure equity for all patients seeking to access health services, including those of lower socioeconomic status. Many of these patients rely on public hotspots or library computers for their internet connectivity, but this is likely not conducive to a clinical encounter.

When the sampling process (collection of samples over time) depends on $N_{e}(t)$, the coalescent and the sampling processes can be jointly modeled to improve estimation of $N_{e}(t)$.

Methods: Data from the OECD iLibrary were used. The sector definition was based on the OECD sector classification. For core funding to multilateral agencies that do not specialize in each aid sector, we estimated ODA and its flows based on the OECD methodology for calculating imputed multilateral ODA. Results: For all 29 countries, during the period of 2014C2018 where data were available for all the countries, the sector with the highest average annual ODA contribution was health at 20.34 billion USD (13.21%), followed by humanitarian aid at 18.04 billion (11.72%). Humanitarian aid has increased in the sectoral share rankings in both bilateral and multilateral aid, and the sectoral share for refugees in donor countries has increased in bilateral aid.

Methods: We developed a network-based model of workplace contacts based on data and consultations from companies in the parcel delivery and logistics sectors. We used these in stochastic simulations of disease transmission to predict the probability of workplace outbreaks in this settings. Individuals in the model have different viral load trajectories based on SARS-CoV-2 in-host dynamics, which couple to their infectiousness and test positive probability over time, in order to determine the impact of testing and isolation measures. Results: The baseline model (without any interventions) showed different workplace infection rates for staff in different job roles. Based on our assumptions of contact patterns in the parcel delivery work setting we found that when a delivery driver was the index case, on average they infect only 0.18 other employees , while for warehouse and office workers this went up to 0.93 and 2.58 respectively. In the large-item delivery setting this was predicted to be 0.83, 0.94, and 1.61 respectively. Nonetheless, the vast majority of simulations resulted in $0$ secondary cases among customers (even without contact-free delivery). Our results showed that a combination of social distancing, office staff working from home, and fixed driver pairings (all interventions carried out by the companies we consulted) reduce the risk of workplace outbreaks by 3-4 times. Conclusion: This work suggests that, without interventions, significant transmission could occur in these workplaces, but that these pose minimal risk to customers. We found that identifying and isolating regular close-contacts of infectious individuals (i.e. house-share, carpools, or delivery pairs) is an efficient measure for stopping workplace outbreaks. Regular testing can make these isolation measures even more effective but also increases the number of staff isolating at one time. It is therefore more efficient to combine these measures with social distancing and contact reduction interventions, as these reduce both transmission and the number of people needing to isolate.","output":"Modelling the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on workplace transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the home-delivery sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The Malaysian government implemented MCO or lockdown for nearly 3 months from 18 Mar to 9 Jun 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Methodology: This is a cross-sectional study exploring effects of MCO on adult (&amp;gt;18 years) DM patients (both Type 1 and Type 2) attending endocrinologist-run DM clinics in 3 tertiary centres in Malaysia. Glycaemic and metabolic parameters were collected through medical record review while data on healthcare utilisation, dietary and lifestyle habits before MCO (17 Nov 2019 to 17 Mar 2020) and during MCO were collected by investigator-administered questionnaires during routine clinic follow-up after the MCO period (10 Jun to 30 Oct 2020). Results: From a total of 207 patients (56.5% female, 73.4% T2D and 80% on insulin) no significant difference between mean (SD) A1c [8.6(2.39) % vs 8.4(2.14) %;p=0.073] or BMI [29.2(7.57) vs 29.4(9.23)kg/m2;p=0.968] were seen before and during MCO respectively. More than 95% of the patients attended clinic before MCO and at least 20.3% saw either the DM nurse educator, DM pharmacist or dietitian. In contrast, during MCO only 31.4% of patients attended clinic and less than 10% had face-to-face consultation with the DM support team. More patients also reported missing insulin (11.6% vs 7.7%) and not checking blood glucose (17.9% vs 15.5%) during MCO. Before MCO, 61.8% of patients had home-cooked food daily. During MCO this increased to 83.1%. However, there was a trend towards unhealthy eating during MCO. Patients reported eating more frequently with those eating more than 4 meals a day nearly tripled during MCO (18.4% vs 6.8%). In addition, 22% of patients recalled consuming more confectionary;a similar percentage also reported higher consumption of processed food like dry snacks, canned food and instant noodles during MCO. Mean (SD) hours of sleep [6.8 (1.35) vs 7.2 (1.73) hours;p&amp;lt;0.001] and screen time [3.3 (2.51) vs 4.51 (3.10] hours, p&amp;lt;0.001) increased significantly during MCO compared to before. Notably, before MCO 44% of patients reported no exercise and this increased to 65.7% during MCO. Conclusion: Despite reduced clinic attendance and contact with the DM support team, there were no consequent significant change in A1c or BMI of our DM patients from the 3-month MCO in our short term study. However, a worrying increase in sedentariness and unhealthy eating existed. The imperative need to conduct work or lessons online, among others contributed to the inevitable rise in screen time and reduced physical activity.

To further understand the evolutionary relationship between SARS-CoV and its reservoirs, 334 bats were collected from Zhoushan city, Zhejiang province, China, between 2015 and 2017. PCR amplification of the conserved coronaviral protein RdRp detected coronaviruses in 26.65% of bats belonging to this region, and this number was influenced by seasonal changes. Full genomic analyses of the two new SL-CoVs from Zhoushan (ZXC21 and ZC45) showed that their genomes were 29,732 nucleotides (nt) and 29,802 nt in length, respectively, with 13 open reading frames (ORFs). These results revealed 81% shared nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs, which was more distant than that observed previously for bat SL-CoVs in China. Importantly, using pathogenic tests, we found that the virus can reproduce and cause disease in suckling rats, and further studies showed that the virus-like particles can be observed in the brains of suckling rats by electron microscopy.

Frameshifting takes place at the slippery sequence by simultaneous slippage of two ribosome-bound tRNAs. All of the tRNAs that are predicted to decode frameshift sites in the ribosomal A-site (XXXYYYN) possess a hypermodified base in the anticodon-loop and it is conceivable that these modifications play a role in the frameshift process. To test this, we expressed slippery sequence variants of the coronavirus IBV frameshift signal in strains of Escherichia coli unable to modify fully either tRNA(Lys) or tRNA(Asn). At the slippery sequences UUUAAAC and UUUAAAU (underlined codon decoded by tRNA(Asn), anticodon 5 QUU 3), frameshifting was very inefficient (2 to 3%) and in strains deficient in the biosynthesis of Q base, was increased (AAU) or decreased (AAC) only two-fold. In E. coli, therefore, hypomodification of tRNA(Asn) had little effect on frameshifting. The situation with the efficient slippery sequences UUUAAAA (15%) and UUUAAAG (40%) (underlined codon decoded by tRNA(Lys), anticodon 5 mnm(5)s(2)UUU 3) was more complex, since the wobble base of tRNA(Lys) is modified at two positions. Of four available mutants, only trmE (s(2)UUU) had a marked influence on frameshifting, increasing the efficiency of the process at the slippery sequence UUUAAAA. No effect on frameshifting was seen in trmC1 (cmnm(5)s(2)UUU) or trmC2 (nm(5)s(2)UUU) strains and only a very small reduction (at UUUAAAG) was observed in an asuE (mnm(5)UUU) strain. The slipperiness of tRNA(Lys), therefore, cannot be ascribed to a single modification site on the base. However, the data support a role for the amino group of the mnm(5) substitution in shaping the anticodon structure. Whether these conclusions can be extended to eukaryotic translation systems is uncertain. Although E. coli ribosomes changed frame at the IBV signal (UUUAAAG) with an efficiency similar to that measured in reticulocyte lysates (40%), there were important qualitative differences. Frameshifting of prokaryotic ribosomes was pseudoknot-independent (although secondary structure dependent) and appeared to require slippage of only a single tRNA.","output":"Expression of a coronavirus ribosomal frameshift signal in Escherichia coli: influence of tRNA anticodon modification on frameshifting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought an unprecedented change in the way we deliver eye care to our patients, most notably with the rapid addition of telehealth technology into our practices.

The aim of this study was to measure the effect of reambulation for up to 2 years after 60 days of bed rest on the lumbar bone marrow composition. METHODS In a prospective clinical trial, 20 healthy men participated in a 60-day, 6-degree head-down tilt bed rest study. Serial 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging measures of the lumbar spine were performed at baseline, after 57 days of bed rest, and at 30, 360, and 720 days of reambulation (100 MR imaging scans). Proton density with and without fat saturation, 2-point Dixon, and single-voxel MR spectroscopy techniques were used to assess bone marrow composition (300 measures). Erythropoiesis was measured using hematocrit, reticulocyte, and ferritin. Also, participants randomly received either a nutritional intervention composed of polyphenols, omega-3, vitamin E, and selenium or a normal diet. RESULTS Thirty days of reambulation after 60 days of bed rest caused a marked decrease of the mean lumbar vertebral fat fraction (VFF) (-9.2  1.6 percentage points, -8.0  1.3 percentage points, and -12.7  1.2 percentage points compared with baseline using proton density, Dixon, MR spectroscopy, respectively; all 3, P < 0.05). Reambulation also decreased the fat saturation index (-5.3  1.1 percentage points compared with baseline; P < 0.05). These coincided with lower hematocrit and ferritin and with increased reticulocytes at reambulation day 13 compared with baseline (all 3, P < 0.05). After 57 days of bed rest, the VFF was unchanged from baseline (all 3 MR techniques, P > 0.05); reambulation for 2 years returned the lumbar VFF to baseline values. INTERPRETATION This longitudinal trial established that 30 days of reambulation after 60 days of bed rest constituted a powerful stimulus for bone marrow reconversion. In this model, the enhanced erythropoiesis coupled with preferential consumption of fatty acids from regulated marrow adipose tissue to supply energy for erythropoiesis and bone anabolism may explain the lumbar vertebrae reconversion. These results will help interpreting bone marrow signal in ambulatory patients after long periods of bed rest.","output":"Bone Marrow Reconversion With Reambulation: A Prospective Clinical Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiological studies consistently implicate traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) and/or proximity to heavily trafficked roads as risk factors for developmental delays and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs); however, there are limited preclinical data demonstrating a causal relationship. To test the effects of TRAP, pregnant rat dams were transported to a vivarium adjacent to a major freeway tunnel system in northern California where they were exposed to TRAP drawn directly from the face of the tunnel or filtered air (FA). Offspring remained housed under the exposure condition into which they were born and were tested in a variety of behavioral assays between postnatal day 4 and 50. To assess the effects of near roadway exposure, offspring of dams housed in a standard research vivarium were tested at the laboratory. An additional group of dams was transported halfway to the facility and then back to the laboratory to control for the effect of potential transport stress. Near roadway exposure delayed growth and development of psychomotor reflexes and elicited abnormal activity in open field locomotion. Near roadway exposure also reduced isolation-induced 40-kHz pup ultrasonic vocalizations, with the TRAP group having the lowest number of call emissions. TRAP affected some components of social communication, evidenced by reduced neonatal pup ultrasonic calling and altered juvenile reciprocal social interactions.

The tools currently available to measure adolescent health literacy have been adapted from adult versions. This limits their applicability to young people because of the developmental characteristics that impact on adolescents' behaviour, including impulse control and judgement skills. This protocol describes the intended development and validity testing of a questionnaire to measure health literacy in adolescents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol describes this mixed methods study that has three phases: the first phase will involve grounded research with adolescents using qualitative group interviews, co-design and concept mapping workshops to understand what health and healthy behaviours mean to adolescents and to explore their health literacy needs and the potential domains for the questionnaire. The draft health literacy domains identified will be presented to the youth advisory panel, and the questionnaire will be altered based on their feedback. Cognitive pretesting of the questionnaire items will also be conducted. Phase 2 will involve piloting the questionnaire to a two-stage random sample of young people in five urban and rural schools in Ireland. Test-retest reliability will be conducted using Pearson correlation coefficient. Confirmatory factor analysis will also be conducted to analyse the psychometric properties of the questionnaire. Phase 3 will involve the questionnaire being rolled out to a nationally representative sample of adolescents (n=6052) in Ireland to assess their levels of health literacy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval to conduct this study has been granted from the University College Dublin Human Research Ethics Committee - Sciences (LS-20-08).

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter retrospective observational study of patients 18 years hospitalized due to COVID-19 at the Johns Hopkins Health system. Patients who were transferred from another facility with >24 hours stay and patients who died within 48 hours of hospitalization were excluded. METHODS: Elevated PCT values were determined based on each hospitals definition. Antibiotic therapy and PCT results were evaluated for patients with no evidence of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (bCAP) and patients with confirmed, probable, or possible bCAP. The added value of PCT to clinical criteria in detecting bCAP were evaluated with receiving operating curve characteristics (ROC). RESULTS: 64% (611/962) of patients received a PCT. ROC curves for clinical criteria and clinical criteria plus PCT were similar (at 0.5ng/ml and 0.25ng/ml). By bCAP group, median initial PCT values were 0.58 ng/mL (IQR 0.24, 1.14), 0.23 ng/mL (IQR 0.1, 0.63) and 0.15 ng/mL (IQR 0.09, 0.35) for proven/probable, possible, and no bCAP groups. Among patients without bCAP, an elevatedPCT was associated with 1.8 additional days of CAP therapy (95% CI 1.01 2.75, P<0.01) compared to patients with a negative PCT after adjusting for potential confounders. Duration of CAP therapy was similar between patients without a PCT ordered and a low PCT for no bCAP and possible bCAP groups.

Attempts to use reverse vaccinology to generate an HIV-1 vaccine on the basis of the structure of viral epitopes bound to monoclonal neutralizing antibodies have failed so far because it was not possible to extrapolate from an observed antigenic structure to the immunogenic structure required in a vaccine. Vaccine immunogenicity depends on numerous extrinsic factors such as the host immunoglobulin gene repertoire, the presence of various cellular and regulatory mechanisms in the immunized host and the process of antibody affinity maturation. All these factors played a role in the appearance of the neutralizing antibody used to select the epitope to be investigated as potential vaccine immunogen, but they cannot be expected to be present in identical form in the host to be vaccinated. It is possible to rationally design and optimize an epitope to fit one particular antibody molecule or to improve the paratope binding efficacy of a monoclonal antibody intended for passive immunotherapy. What is not possible is to rationally design an HIV-1 vaccine immunogen that will elicit a protective polyclonal antibody response of predetermined efficacy. An effective vaccine immunogen can only be discovered by investigating experimentally the immunogenicity of a candidate molecule and demonstrating its ability to induce a protective immune response. It cannot be discovered by determining which epitopes of an engineered antigen molecule are recognized by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody. This means that empirical immunogenicity trials rather than structural analyses of antigens offer the best hope of discovering an HIV-1 vaccine.","output":"Requirements for Empirical Immunogenicity Trials, Rather than Structure-Based Design, for Developing an Effective HIV Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has recently emerged and rapidly spreading in humans causing a significant threat to international health and the economy.

Patient follow-up ended May 2013. INTERVENTIONS Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either endoscopic treatment with radiofrequency ablation (ablation) or endoscopic surveillance (control). Ablation was performed with the balloon device for circumferential ablation of the esophagus or the focal device for targeted ablation, with a maximum of 5 sessions allowed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was neoplastic progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma during a 3-year follow-up since randomization. Secondary outcomes were complete eradication of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia and adverse events. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients were randomized to receive ablation and 68 to receive control. Ablation reduced the risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma by 25.0% (1.5% for ablation vs 26.5% for control; 95% CI, 14.1%-35.9%; P < .001) and the risk of progression to adenocarcinoma by 7.4% (1.5% for ablation vs 8.8% for control; 95% CI, 0%-14.7%; P = .03). Among patients in the ablation group, complete eradication occurred in 92.6% for dysplasia and 88.2% for intestinal metaplasia compared with 27.9% for dysplasia and 0.0% for intestinal metaplasia among patients in the control group (P < .001). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19.1% of patients receiving ablation (P < .001).

METHODS: The retrospective study included patients who applied to a tertiary orthodontic referral center for orthodontic treatment between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020. Clinical and demographic characteristics including age, age groups (child, young adult, adult), gender, and numbers of monthly and annual applications were compared between the pre-pandemic (2017-2020) and post-pandemic (2020) periods. The daily average numbers of applications were compared between 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: The average number of monthly admissions was 240.69  81.48 in the pre-pandemic period as opposed to 113.75  88.89 in the year 2020 (p<0.001). The average number of monthly admissions decreased by 48.3% in 2020 compared to 2019, while the average number of daily admissions in 2020 decreased significantly in all months (p<0.05) except for January (p=0.613) compared to the months of the previous year. No significant difference was found between the pre-pandemic period and 2020 with regard to gender distribution (p=0.410).

Her temperature was 37.6 C. Blood testing revealed a mildly elevated inflammatory response, although blood cultures were negative. Computed tomography (CT) showed atlanto-axial subluxation and joint destruction. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displayed high signals in the soft tissues in the anterior space of the atlas and axis, posterior wall of the pharynx, and interspinous ligament, indicating spinal cord compression at the C1 level. Differential diagnoses of inflammation and diseases causing atlanto-axial subluxation included rheumatoid arthritis, amyloidosis, pyogenic spondylitis due to posterior pharyngeal abscess, and crowned dens syndrome. After the systematic elimination of each condition, we considered Grisel's syndrome and began non-surgical treatment with intravenous antibiotics and a Philadelphia neck collar. Her inflammatory response and neck pain gradually decreased. Six months later, there was no progression of instability. She was able to walk unaided and live normally with the use of a neck collar as needed.Conclusion: Grisel's syndrome occurs predominantly in children, but can also afflict adults. Since early diagnosis and treatment can improve symptoms in some cases and prevent progressive atlanto-axial instability, prompt evaluation of the atlanto-axial joint using CT or MRI is advised in patients with neck pain and limited range of motion.","output":"A case of adult-onset Grisel's syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is reasonable to state that the impact on Thailand's economy has been severe due to the lack of international tourists.

In this study, an attempt was made to document the genome-wide codon usage profile and the various factors influencing the codon usage patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in human and dog. The SARS-CoV-2 genome showed relative abundance of A and U nucleotides and relative synonymous codon usage analysis revealed that the preferred synonymous codons mostly end with A/U. The analysis of ENc-GC3s, Neutrality and Parity rule 2 plots indicated that natural selection and other undefined factors dominate the overall codon usage bias in SARS-CoV-2 whereas the impact of mutation pressure is comparatively minor. The codon adaptation index and relative codon deoptimization index of SARS-CoV-2 deciphered that human is more favoured host for adaptation compared to dog.

PURPOSE To investigate the outcome of endovascular treatment of large and giant aneurysms and the long-term angiographic follow-up results. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of all patients with endovascular treatment of large and giant aneurysms between 1998 and 2009 was performed. There were 90 large or giant aneurysms treated with coiling alone, stent-assisted coiling, covered-stent deployment, or parent artery occlusion (PAO) in 88 patients (female/male, 54/34; age range, 23-92 years; mean age, 56 years). RESULTS Immediately after the initial endovascular embolization procedure, complete occlusion was achieved in 56.7%, near complete occlusion in 37.8%, and incomplete occlusion in 5.5%. The total periprocedural complication rate excluding subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced vasospasm was 10.2% with a mortality rate of 2.3%. Follow-up angiography was performed in all of the aneurysms with the longest follow-up duration of 131 months. Among 38 aneurysms initially treated with coiling alone and 17 initially treated with stent-assisted coiling, 22 (57.9%) and four (23.5%) recurred, respectively, during follow-up. No recurrence occurred in aneurysms initially treated with covered-stent deployment or PAO. Aneurysm recurrence was predominantly seen in older and female patients, in larger aneurysms, and in aneurysms treated with coiling alone. Twenty-three aneurysms were successfully retreated endovascularly. CONCLUSION Endovascular intervention with coiling alone or stent-assisted coiling for large and giant cerebral aneurysms is not very effective, while covered stents are more promising. Better endovascular devices are needed to obtain more secure closure.","output":"Endovascular embolization is applicable for large and giant intracranial aneurysms: experience in one center with long-term angiographic follow-up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To identify areas that need improvement in Jordanian health centers regarding infection prevention and control (IPC) programs; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services; and other protective measures, especially in the context of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a national assessment study that comprised hospitals of different sectors in Jordan, including, Ministry of Health (MoH), private, and military hospitals. The study included 23 Jordanian hospitals. Assessment tools were developed and adapted mainly from the WASH Facility Improvement Tool (WASH FIT) and other tools. Hospitals were assessed to meet targets based on whether indicators were fully met, partially met, or not met. RESULTS: The mean percentage of the 150 indicators that met the standards was 83.2% (72.6% for MoH, 84.5% for private, and 90.4% for military hospitals). The percentage of indicators, both WASH/IPC and training and education indicators, that met the targets were higher in military hospitals than in MoH and private hospitals. However, in context of COVID-19, only 64.7% of indicators related to precautionary measures were met by all hospitals.

Mechanistically, EIAV-Rev competitively binds to Keap1 and releases Nrf2 from Keap1-mediated repression, leading to the accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus and promoting Nrf2 responsive genes transcription. Subsequently, we demonstrated that the Nrf2/Keap1 axis represses EIAV replication via two independent molecular mechanisms: directly increasing antioxidant enzymes to promote effective cellular resistance against EIAV infection, and repression of Rev-mediated RNA transport through direct interaction between Keap1 and Rev. Together, these data suggest that activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 axis mediates a passive defensive response to combat EIAV infection.

METHODS: We developed and optimized an enzyme immunoassays (EIA) using SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N), S1 and receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein, and N proteins from SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and 4 low-pathogenic human CoVs. Neutralizing antibody activity was compared with SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM EIA results. RESULTS: The sensitivity of EIA for detecting immune response in COVID-19 patients (n = 101) was 77% in the acute phase and 100% in the convalescent phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection when N and RBD were used as antigens in IgG and IgA specific EIAs. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased humoral immune responses against the 229E and NL63 N proteins. S1 and RBD-based EIA results had a strong correlation with microneutralization test results.

In this study, we have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to systematically evaluate the effect of 10 cardiometabolic risk factors and genetic liability to lifetime smoking on 97 circulating host proteins postulated to either interact or contribute to the maladaptive host response of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach and several robust MR methods in a two-sample setting to systemically estimate the genetically predicted effect of each risk factor in turn on levels of each circulating protein. Multivariable MR was conducted to simultaneously evaluate the effects of multiple risk factors on the same protein. We also applied MR using cis-regulatory variants at the genomic location responsible for encoding these proteins to estimate whether their circulating levels may influence severe SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: In total, we identified evidence supporting 105 effects between risk factors and circulating proteins which were robust to multiple testing corrections and sensitivity analyzes. For example, body mass index provided evidence of an effect on 23 circulating proteins with a variety of functions, such as inflammatory markers c-reactive protein (IVW Beta=0.34 per standard deviation change, 95% CI=0.26 to 0.41, P = 2.19  10(?16)) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IVW Beta=0.23, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.30, P = 9.04  10(?12)). Further analyzes using multivariable MR provided evidence that the effect of BMI on lowering immunoglobulin G, an antibody class involved in protection from infection, is substantially mediated by raised triglycerides levels (IVW Beta=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.25 to -0.12, P = 2.32  10(?08), proportion mediated=44.1%). The strongest evidence that any of the circulating proteins highlighted by our initial analysis influence severe SARS-CoV-2 was identified for soluble glycoprotein 130 (odds ratio=1.81, 95% CI=1.25 to 2.62, P = 0.002), a signal transductor for interleukin-6 type cytokines which are involved in inflammatory response. However, based on current case samples for severe SARS-CoV-2 we were unable to replicate findings in independent samples.

Some individuals are incurring both physical and psychological injuries. Often, psychological injuries are more miserable than physical injuries. To combat the psychological injury suffered by individuals involved in social work, authorities should mobilize support via social media and raise funds by this and other feasible means to cover the cost of care for these individuals. This study focuses on social media support and funding assistance that could play useful roles in helping to treat psychological injuries among social workers and their clients in China. METHODS: A scoping review of academic and gray literature was undertaken to identify the different injuries involved in social work. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 7 experts, including social workers, social media professionals, and social fund directors. Empirical studies on psychological injuries in social work provided examples in support of the policy advocacy reported in this paper. RESULTS: The scoping review found diverse literature on the subject of psychological injury in social work over the past decade in China. Semi-structured interviews with experts indicate that social media support can alleviate psychological suffering and that funding assistance has a positive influence on assisting individuals coping with psychological injuries. The empirical cases support the plan to encourage more support from social media and funding sources. CONCLUSION: Psychological injury is greatly influenced by social bias and discrimination. According to cases and actions are taken to mitigate the harm done, supportive social media strategies could greatly diminish the psychological injuries to social workers and their clients and help them avoid much suffering.

METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 high titer convalescent plasma to placebo control plasma in symptomatic adults 18 years positive for SARS-CoV-2 regardless of risk factors for disease progression or vaccine status. Participants with symptom onset within 8 days were enrolled, then transfused within the subsequent day. The measured primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospitalization within 28 days of plasma transfusion. The enrollment period was June 3, 2020 to October 1, 2021. RESULTS: A total of 1225 participants were randomized and 1181 transfused. In the pre-specified modified intention-to-treat analysis that excluded those not transfused, the primary endpoint occurred in 37 of 589 (6.3%) who received placebo control plasma and in 17 of 592 (2.9%) participants who received convalescent plasma (relative risk, 0.46; one-sided 95% upper bound confidence interval 0.733; P=0.004) corresponding to a 54% risk reduction. Examination with a model adjusting for covariates related to the outcome did not change the conclusions. CONCLUSION: Early administration of high titer SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma reduced outpatient hospitalizations by more than 50%. High titer convalescent plasma is an effective early outpatient COVID-19 treatment with the advantages of low cost, wide availability, and rapid resilience to variant emergence from viral genetic drift in the face of a changing pandemic.

Autopsy examination revealed signs of sepsis with multiple organ involvement, including meningoencephalitis with necrotic foci and necrosis of the brain tissue. On histological examination, an area of brain tissue necrosis with neuronal destruction, focal purulent infiltrates, and neurons with dystrophic changes were observed. Cerebral edema with brain stem and amygdala foramen magnum herniation were identified. Lung interalveolar septa are thickened due to edema and hyperemia. Few macrophages, mononuclear infiltration, edematous fluid, and hyaline membranes are seen in the alveoli. Pathology examination of the kidneys showed signs of cortical ischemia with tubular necrosis and hyaline-drop dystrophy in the remaining epithelium of the proximal and distal tubules of the cortex. A lipids reduction, atrophy, and focal delipoidization in some areas in the cortex of the adrenal glands were observed. Damage and necrosis of hepatocytes of different severity and changes in endotheliocytes and stellate macrophagocytes in the liver were revealed. Hyperemia and hemorrhages in the red pulp of spleen were observed. A zone of total delymphatization with a cluster of destroyed neutrophils was determined around the central artery. Immunohistochemical examination of E-selectin, VLA-4, and ICAM-1 in lung tissue showed positive expression of VLA-4 in intraalveolar, interstitial and intravascular leukocytes, as well as the pronounced reaction of E-selectin and ICAM-1 in endotheliocytes of significant arteries, arterioles, precapillaries, capillaries, venules and veins, lung macrophages, and lymphocytes. Signs of septic shock were observed: liquid blood in the lumen of large vessels and heart cavities, cortical ischemia, and severe cerebral pyramidal hemorrhage of the kidneys increased lung volume, hemorrhage, and edema. Disseminated intravascular coagulation as a sign of coagulation disorders was revealed.

Evidently, there is an urgent need for new strategies to develop efficient antiviral agents with broad-spectrum activities. In this paper, we identified camphene derivatives that showed broad antiviral activities in vitro against a panel of enveloped pathogenic viruses, including influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), Ebola virus (EBOV), and the Hantaan virus. The lead-compound 2a, with pyrrolidine cycle in its structure, displayed antiviral activity against influenza virus (IC(50) = 45.3 M), Ebola pseudotype viruses (IC(50) = 0.12 M), and authentic EBOV (IC(50) = 18.3 M), as well as against pseudoviruses with Hantaan virus Gn-Gc glycoprotein (IC(50) = 9.1 M). The results of antiviral activity studies using pseudotype viruses and molecular modeling suggest that surface proteins of the viruses required for the fusion process between viral and cellular membranes are the likely target of compound 2a. The key structural fragments responsible for efficient binding are the bicyclic natural framework and the nitrogen atom. These data encourage us to conduct further investigations using bicyclic monoterpenoids as a scaffold for the rational design of membrane-fusion targeting inhibitors.","output":"Synthesis and Antiviral Activity of Camphene Derivatives against Different Types of Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Comparative Computational Study of SARS-CoV-2 Receptors Antagonists from Already Approved Drugs","output":"Comparative Computational Study of SARS-CoV-2 Receptors Antagonists from Already Approved Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents an overview of virus pandemics throughout the 20th and the 21st century and their main characteristics Selected examples of applied health protection measures are described, as well as cultural, political, economic, and public health responses to pandemics A rich heritage of preventive health protection specific for our territory, and its role in selecting protective health models during the coronavirus pandemic is emphasized ? 2020 Hrvatski Lijecnicki Zbor All rights reserved","output":"Victories and defeats: Battles with pandemics caused by viruses during the last one hundred years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The infectious diseases with a viral origin are of significant worldwide concern.

We conducted a survey to investigate the level of stress and its association with job types, work departments, and medical centers among COVID-19 pandemic frontline medical personnel. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a self-administered questionnaire among 307 frontline medical staff who cared for COVID-19 patients in Daegu city. We used a 33-item questionnaire to assess respondents general characteristics, job stress, personal effects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and their stress level. A general health questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) was included in our questionnaire. Results: Majority (74.3%) of the respondents were in the stress group. The mean GHQ-12 score was 14.31  4.96. More females (67.4%, p < 0.05) and nurses (73.3%, p = 0.001) were in the stress group compared to males and doctors. Medical staff in the general ward considered the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic situation higher. Nurses perceived work changes (p < 0.05), work burden (p < 0.05), and personal impact (p < 0.05) more serious than doctors. Medical staff in Level 3 emergency department (ED) perceived a lack of real-time information (p = 0.012), a lack of resources, and negative personal impacts associated with the pandemic as more serious than staff in Level 1 and Level 2 EDs. Medical staff in the intensive care unit perceived work changes (p < 0.05), work burden (p < 0.05), and lack of personal protective equipment (p = 0.002) as more serious than staff in the ED and general ward.

Methods: During July to November, 2020, individuals from multiple high risk groups in 6 urban centres in the state of Odisha, India, which included health care workers, police personnel, municipality/ sanitation staff, residents of urban slums, vendors, press staff, and prisoners, were recruited into the study after obtaining written informed consent. Blood samples collected from the study participants were tested for IgG antibodies against COVID-19 in Roche Cobas e441. Information on socio-demographic variables, association with a confirmed or suspected case, symptoms profile of individuals within 30 days, travel and history of testing for COVID-19 were collected. All the statistical analyses were performed using STATA 16.0 (Stata corp., Texas). A P value  0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Of the 5434 individuals included in the final analysis, the overall COVID-19 seroprevalence was found to be 34.9% (95% CI 33.6-36.2). The seroprevalence varied from 21.8% (95% CI 19.6-24.1) in Rourkela to 54.9% (95% CI 51.5-58.2) in Bhubaneswar.

In this study, we demonstrate that CEACAM2 is expressed on the surface and in intracellular pools of platelets. Functional studies of platelets from Ceacam2(-/-)-deficient mice (Cc2(-/-)) revealed that CEACAM2 serves to negatively regulate collagen glycoprotein VI (platelet) (GPVI)-FcR-chain and the C-type lectinlike receptor 2 (CLEC-2) signaling. Cc2(-/-) platelets displayed enhanced GPVI and CLEC-2-selective ligands, collagen-related peptide (CRP), collagen, and rhodocytin (Rhod)-mediated platelet aggregation. They also exhibited increased adhesion on type I collagen, and hyperresponsive CRP and CLEC-2-induced  and dense granule release compared with wild-type platelets. Furthermore, using intravital microscopy to ferric chloride (FeCl3)-injured mesenteric arterioles and laser-induced injury of cremaster muscle arterioles, we herein show that thrombi formed in Cc2(-/-) mice were larger and more stable than wild-type controls in vivo. Thus, CEACAM2 is a novel platelet immunoreceptor that acts as a negative regulator of platelet GPVI-collagen interactions and of ITAM receptor CLEC-2 pathways.","output":"CEACAM2 negatively regulates hemi (ITAM-bearing) GPVI and CLEC-2 pathways and thrombus growth in vitro and in vivo."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic.

METHODS: We examined survival outcomes for US patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between Aug-Nov 2020 and treated with RDV within two-days of hospitalization vs. those not receiving RDV during their hospitalization using the Premier Healthcare Database. Preferential within-hospital propensity score matching with replacement was used. Additionally, patients were also matched on baseline oxygenation level (no supplemental oxygen charges (NSO), low-flow oxygen (LFO), high-flow oxygen/non-invasive ventilation (HFO/NIV) and invasive mechanical ventilation/ECMO (IMV/ECMO) and two-month admission window and excluded if discharged within 3-days of admission (to exclude anticipated discharges/transfers within 72-hrs consistent with ACTT-1 study). Cox Proportional Hazards models were used to assess time to 14-/28-day mortality overall and for patients on NSO, LFO, HFO/NIV and IMV/ECMO. RESULTS: 28,855 RDV patients were matched to 16,687 unique non-RDV patients. Overall, 10.6% and 15.4% RDV patients died within 14- and 28-days, respectively compared with 15.4% and 19.1% non-RDV patients. Overall, RDV was associated with a reduction in mortality at 14-days (HR[95% CI]: 0.76[0.70-0.83]) and 28-days (0.89[0.82-0.96]). This mortality benefit was also seen for NSO, LFO and IMV/ECMO at 14-days (NSO:0.69[0.57-0.83], LFO:0.68[0.80-0.77], IMV/ECMO:0.70[0.58-0.84]) and 28-days (NSO:0.80[0.68-0.94], LFO:0.77[0.68-0.86], IMV/ECMO:0.81[0.69-0.94]).

It is noteworthy that air quality is also closely related to the risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, we aimed to assess the mediating role of air quality on the association between human mobility and the infection caused by this novel coronavirus. METHODS: We collected daily confirmed cases, human mobility data, air quality data and meteorological variables in 120 cities from China between January 23, 2020 and February 29, 2020. We applied the generalized additive model to examine the association of human mobility index with COVID-19 confirmed cases, and to assess the mediating effects of air quality index and each pollutant. RESULTS: We observed a significant positive relationship between human mobility index and the daily counts of COVID-19 confirmed cases. A unit increase in human mobility index (lag0-14) was associated with a 6.45% increase in daily COVID-19 confirmed cases, and air quality index significantly mediated 19.47% of this association. We also observed a positive relationship between human mobility index and air quality index. In the pollutant level analyses, we found significant mediating effects of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that limiting human movements could reduce COVID-19 cases by improving air quality besides decreasing social contact.","output":"The mediating effect of air quality on the association between human mobility and COVID-19 infection in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors are used for the treatment of various diseases. Although their effect(s) on the respective kinase are generally quite well understood, surprisingly, their interaction with membranes is only barely investigated; even though these drugs necessarily come into contact with the plasma and intracellular membranes. Using biophysical methods such as NMR, ESR, and fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with lipid vesicles, we studied the membrane interaction of the kinase inhibitors sunitinib, erlotinib, idelalisib, and lenvatinib; these drugs are characterized by medium log p values, a parameter reflecting the overall hydrophobicity of the molecules, which is one important parameter to predict the interaction with lipid membranes. While all four molecules tend to embed in a similar region of the lipid membrane, their presence has different impacts on membrane structure and dynamics. Most notably, sunitinib, exhibiting the lowest log p value of the four inhibitors, effectively influences membrane integrity, while the others do not. This shows that the estimation of the effect of drug molecules on lipid membranes can be rather complex. In this context, experimental studies on lipid membranes are necessary to (i) identify drugs that may disturb membranes and (ii) characterize drugCmembrane interactions on a molecular level. Such knowledge is important for understanding the efficacy and potential side effects of respective drugs.","output":"Impact of Selected Small-Molecule Kinase Inhibitors on Lipid Membranes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Stressful events, such as those imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, are associated with depression risk, raising questions about processes that make some people more susceptible to the effects of stress on mental health than others. Emotion regulation may be a key process, but methods for objectively measuring emotion regulation abilities in youth are limited. We leveraged event-related potential (ERP) measures and a longitudinal study of adolescents oversampled for depression and depression risk to examine emotion regulation difficulties as prospective predictors of depressive symptoms in response to pandemic-related stress. METHODS Before the pandemic, adolescents with (n = 28) and without (n = 34) clinical depression (N = 62 total) completed an explicit emotion regulation task while ERP data were recorded and measures of depressive symptoms. Adolescents were re-contacted during the pandemic to report on COVID-19 related stressful events and depressive symptoms (n = 48). RESULTS Adolescents who had never experienced a depressive episode showed an increase in depressive symptoms during the pandemic, but adolescents who were clinically depressed before the pandemic did not exhibit significant changes in symptoms. Neural markers of emotion regulation abilities interacted with pandemic-related stressful events to predict depressive symptoms during the pandemic, such that stressors predicted increases in depressive symptoms only for adolescents with greater difficulty modulating responses to negative images before the pandemic.

We identified all outbreaks involving three or more cases and reviewed the major characteristics of the enclosed spaces in which the outbreaks were reported and associated indoor environmental issues. Results: Three hundred and eighteen outbreaks with three or more cases were identified, involving 1245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural cities. We divided the venues in which the outbreaks occurred into six categories: homes, transport, food, entertainment, shopping, and miscellaneous. Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8% involved three cases, 26.4% involved four cases, and only 1.6% involved ten or more cases. Home outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9%), followed by transport (108; 34.0%; note that many outbreaks involved more than one venue category). Most home outbreaks involved three to five cases. We identified only a single outbreak in an outdoor environment, which involved two cases.

In Brazil, municipalities were empowered to define regulatory measures, potentially resulting in diverse effects on CVD morbimortality. ObjectiveTo analyse the impact of COVID-19 pandemics on CVD outcomes in Belo Horizonte (BH), the 6th greater capital city in Brazil, including: mortality, mortality at home, hospitalizations, intensive care unit utilization, and in-hospital mortality; and the differential effect according to sex, age range, social vulnerability, and pandemics phase. MethodsEcological study analysing data from the Mortality and Hospital Information System of BH residents aged []30 years. CVD was defined as in Chapter IX from ICD-10. Social vulnerability was classified by a composite socioeconomic index as high, medium and low. The observed age-standardized rates for epidemiological weeks 10-48, 2020, were compared to the expected rates (mean of 2015-2019). Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test differences, and risk ratios with their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. National demographic estimates was used to calculate rates. ResultsWe found no changes in CVD mortality rates (RiR 1.01, 95%CI 0.96-1.06). However, CVD deaths occurred more at homes (RiR 1.32, 95%CI 1.20-1.46) than in hospitals (RiR 0.89, 95%CI 0.79-0.99), as a result of a substantial decline in hospitalization rates, even though proportional in-hospital deaths increased. The rise in home deaths was greater in older adults and in had an increasing gradient in those more socially vulnerable (RiR 1.45); for high (RiR 1.45), medium (RiR 1.32) and low vulnerability (RiR 1.21). ConclusionThe greater occurrence of CVD deaths at home, in parallel with lower hospitalization rates, suggests that CVD care was disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemics, which more adversely affected older and more socially vulnerable individuals, exacerbating health inequities in BH.","output":"Cardiovascular Mortality during the COVID-19 Pandemics in a Large Brazilian City: a Comprehensive Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Channeling medical resources for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) management can potentially endanger routine healthcare practices As a preventive measure, a department of obstetrics and gynecology in Israel constructed a separate, designated complex for its COVID-19-exposed patients OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic infection control measures on obstetric care in the obstetrical emergency department and delivery unit METHODS: The authors collected data retrospectively from February 2020 to March 2020 and compared it to data of a parallel period in 2019 RESULTS: From 1 February 2020 to 28 March 2020, 3897 women were referred to the emergency department (ED), compared to 4067 the previous year Mean duration of treatment until decision and referral indications did not differ between 2020 and 2019 (207 vs 220 minutes, P = 0 26;urgent referrals 58 8% vs 59 2%, P = 0 83) A per-week comparison showed a significant reduction in ED referrals only in the last week of the period (337 [2020] vs 515 [2019], P &lt; 0 001) The proportion of women admitted to the delivery unit in active labor was significantly higher in the last three weeks (39 1% vs 28 2%, P = 0 005) During February and March 2020, 1666 women delivered, compared to 1654 during February and March 2019 The proportion of types and modes of delivery did not differ In a per-week comparison, the number of deliveries did not differ (mean 208 vs 206, P = 0 88) CONCLUSIONS: With timely preparation and proper management, negative impact of COVID-19 can be reduced in obstetrical emergency departments","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Routine Obstetrical Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hypocalcemia has been identified as a major distinctive feature of COVID-19, predicting poor clinical outcomes. Among the mechanisms underlying this biochemical finding, high prevalence of vitamin D (VD) deficiency in COVID-19 patients reported so far in several studies was advocated. However, robust data in favor of this hypothesis are still lacking. Therefore, aim of our study was to investigate the role of hypovitaminosis D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the development of hypocalcemia in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients admitted to IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele for COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, excluding those with comorbidities and therapies influencing calcium and VD metabolism. Serum levels of total calcium (tCa), ionized calcium (Ca(2+)), 25-OH-VD, and PTH were evaluated at admission. We defined VD deficiency as VD below 20 ng/mL, hypocalcemia as tCa below 2.2 mmol/L or as Ca(2+) below 1.18 mmol/L, and hyperparathyroidism as PTH above 65 pg/mL. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were included in the study. Median tCa and Ca(2+) levels were 2.15 and 1.15 mmol/L, respectively. Total and ionized hypocalcemia were observed in 53 (67.9%) and 55 (70.5%) patients, respectively. VD deficiency was found in 67.9% of patients, but secondary hyperparathyroidism was detected in 20.5% of them, only. tCa levels were significantly lower in patients with VD deficiency and regression analyses showed a positive correlation between VD and tCa. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we confirmed a high prevalence of hypocalcemia in COVID-19 patients and we showed for the first time that it occurred largely in the context of marked hypovitaminosis D not adequately compensated by secondary hyperparathyroidism.","output":"Hypocalcemia in COVID-19 is associated with low vitamin D levels and impaired compensatory PTH response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Bacterial and epithelial cell samples were obtained, within 24 h of onset of pharyngeal symptoms, from the palatine tonsils of nine patients (four female and five male; age range 10C40 years, median age 23) with acute tonsillitis, culture-positive for Streptococcus pyogenes. The specimens were examined using fluorescein isothiocyanate- (FITC) and gold-labelled antiserum to S. pyogenes and fluorescence, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy.

A maximum surgical blood ordering schedule (MSBOS), is a tool used to assist clinicians in predicting intraoperative blood usage based on retrospective historical data within an institution. Although MSBOS proves to be valuable, it is rudimentary in nature. Not only is data collection cumbersome but the data generated may not reflect current surgical practices and inter-patient variability may skew procedural averages. Predictive blood modeling is contingent generation of a digital health dashboard (DHB). DHB are electronically embedded in the electronic health record (EHR) to collect perioperative data. Coupling the generated informatics (patient demographics, diagnosis, laboratory results, procedural type, medications/supplements, surgeon) with machine learning allows for creation of patient centered predictive blood modeling algorithms and better inventory control. Methods: To characterize blood use across various procedures at our institution, we engaged information technology specialists to create a Web Intelligence report by integrating data from both an EHR and a lab information system (LIS) into a single repository. Information obtained illuminated a master procedure list, blood product usage patterns, and characterized patient demographics during January-March, 2020. Data is continuously extracted to create a perpetually updated MSBOS while secondarily functioning to cultivate data for future predictive machine learning algorithms. Results: Data analysis demonstrated 5598 procedures were performed during the first quarter of 2020. Procedures not transfused with packed red blood cells (pRBCs) totaled to 4,156 and 1,442 had a greater than or equal to 10% probability of requiring pRBCs. Our current practices reflected our overall cross-match to transfusion ratio ( C:T) was 5.4 to 1. Concerted collaboration, resulting in preparation of pre-surgical blood product orders according laboratory generated MSBOS schedule could decrease the C:T to 1.7 to 1. Additionally, high intraprocedural pRBCs variability was identified in current procedural subtypes. Conclusions: Traditionally generated MSBOS are functionally limited and may not be reflective of current surgical practices. Additionally, inter-patient variability may distort some procedural type guidance. Creating an integrated data report, eliminates some of the inherent limitations of traditional MSBOS. Moving forward, the cultivated data if coupled with machine learning has the potential to create transferable proprietary algorithms that proactively predict individual patient transfusion needs.","output":"Predictive modeling to create a proactive approach to patient blood management in the oncology population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on respiratory specimens and serology on paired blood specimens are used to determine the etiology of respiratory illnesses for research studies.

Sporadic human cases of avian A(H5N6), A(H10N8) and A(H6N1) have also emerged. Closure of live poultry markets in China has reduced the risk of A(H7N9) infection. Observational studies have shown that oseltamivir treatment for adults hospitalized with severe influenza is associated with lower mortality and better clinical outcomes, even as late as 4-5 days after symptom onset. Whether higher than standard doses of neuraminidase inhibitor would provide greater antiviral effects in such patients requires further investigation. High-dose systemic corticosteroids were associated with worse outcomes in patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 or A(H5N1). MERS-CoV has continued to spread since its first discovery in 2012.

In this brief note, we endeavour to assess the efficiency of quarantine measures by means of mathematical modelling. Instead of the classical SIR model, we introduce a new model of infection progression under the assumption that all infected individual are isolated after the incubation period in such a way that they cannot infect other people. Disease progression in this model is determined by the basic reproduction number $\\\\mathcal{R}_0$ (the number of newly infected individuals during the incubation period), which is different compared to that for the standard SIR model. If $\\\\mathcal{R}_0 >1$, then the number of latently infected individuals exponentially grows. However, if $\\\\mathcal{R}_0 <1$ (e.g.~due to quarantine measures and contact restrictions imposed by public authorities), then the number of infected decays exponentially. We then consider the available data on the disease development in different countries to show that there are three possible patterns: growth dynamics, growth-decays dynamics, and patchy dynamics (growth-decay-growth). Analysis of the data in China and Korea shows that the peak of infection (maximum of daily cases) is reached about 10 days after the restricting measures are introduced. During this period of time, the growth rate of the total number of infected was gradually decreasing. However, the growth rate remains exponential in Italy.

They are histopathologically classified according to the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification system. Although the final diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumor relies on histologic examination of biopsy or surgical specimens, both morphologic and functional imaging are crucial for patient care. Morphologic imaging with ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used for initial evaluation and staging of disease, as well as surveillance and therapy monitoring. Functional imaging techniques with somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) and positron emission tomography (PET) are used for functional and metabolic assessment that is helpful for therapy management and post-therapeutic re-staging. This article reviews the morphological and functional imaging modalities now available and the imaging features of panNENs. Finally, future imaging challenges, such as radiomics analysis, are illustrated.","output":"Imaging of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection requires medical personnel and is time consuming, and thus is poorly suited to mass screening. In June, 2020, a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA; Lumipulse G SARS-CoV-2 Ag kit, Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan) was developed that can detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleoproteins in NPS or saliva samples within 35 min. In this study, we assessed the utility of CLEIA in mass SARS-CoV-2 screening. Methods: We did a diagnostic accuracy study to develop a mass-screening strategy for salivary detection of SARS-CoV-2 by CLEIA, enrolling hospitalised patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, close contacts identified at community health centres, and asymptomatic international arrivals at two airports, all based in Japan. All test participants were enrolled consecutively. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CLEIA compared with RT-qPCR, estimated according to concordance (Kendall's coefficient of concordance, W), and sensitivity (probability of CLEIA positivity given RT-qPCR positivity) and specificity (probability of CLEIA negativity given RT-qPCR negativity) for different antigen concentration cutoffs (019 pg/mL, 067 pg/mL, and 400 pg/mL; with samples considered positive if the antigen concentration was equal to or more than the cutoff and negative if it was less than the cutoff). We also assessed a two-step testing strategy post hoc with CLEIA as an initial test, using separate antigen cutoff values for test negativity and positivity from the predefined cutoff values. The proportion of intermediate results requiring secondary RT-qPCR was then quantified assuming prevalence values of RT-qPCR positivity in the overall tested population of 10%, 30%, and 50%. Findings: Self-collected saliva was obtained from 2056 participants between June 12 and Aug 6, 2020. Results of CLEIA and RT-qPCR were concordant in 2020 (982%) samples (Kendall's W=099). Test sensitivity was 854% (76 of 89 positive samples; 90% credible interval [CrI] 780-903) at the cutoff of 019 pg/mL; 764% (68 of 89; 682-828) at the cutoff of 067 pg/mL; and 528% (47 of 89; 441-613) at the cutoff of 40 pg/mL. Test specificity was 913% (1796 of 1967 negative samples; 90% CrI 902-923) at the cutoff of 019 pg/mL, 992% (1952 of 1967; 988-995) at the cutoff of 067 pg/mL, and 1000% (1967 of 1967; 998-1000) at the cutoff of 400 pg/mL. Using a two-step testing strategy with a CLEIA negativity cutoff of 019 pg/mL (to maximise sensitivity) and a CLEIA positivity cutoff of 400 pg/mL (to maximise specificity), the proportions of indeterminate results (ie, samples requiring secondary RT-qPCR) would be approximately 11% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 10%, 16% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 30%, and 21% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 50%. Interpretation: CLEIA testing of self-collected saliva is simple and provides results quickly, and is thus suitable for mass testing. To improve accuracy, we propose a two-step screening strategy with an initial CLEIA test followed by confirmatory RT-qPCR for intermediate concentrations, varying positive and negative thresholds depending on local prevalence. Implementation of this strategy has expedited sample processing at Japanese airports since July, 2020, and might apply to other large-scale mass screening initiatives.

Thus, androgen deprivation therapy may reduce infection rates and improve outcomes for COVID-19. In the spring of 2020, Sweden was highly affected by COVID-19. The aim was to estimate the impact of androgen deprivation therapy on mortality from COVID-19 in men with prevalent prostate cancer by comparing all-cause mortality in the spring of 2020 to that in previous years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden all men with prostate cancer on March 1 each year in 2015C2020 were followed until June 30 the same year. Exposure to androgen deprivation therapy was ascertained from filled prescriptions for bicalutamide monotherapy, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH), or bilateral orchidectomy. RESULTS: A total of 9,822 men died in March-June in the years 2015C2020, of whom 5,034 men were on androgen deprivation therapy. There was an excess mortality in 2020 vs previous years in all men. The crude relative mortality rate ratio for 2020 vs 2015C2019 was 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.04) in men on GnRH, and 0.90 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.05) in men on bicalutamide monotherapy. After multivariable adjustment these ratios were attenuated to 1.00 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.12) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.12), respectively. When restricting the analysis to the regions with the highest incidence of COVID-19 or to the time period between 2 April to 10 June when mortality in 2020 was increased >30% compared to previous years, the results were similar to the main analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In this large national population-based cohort of men with prevalent prostate cancer, there was no clear evidence in support for an effect of androgen deprivation therapy on COVID-19 mortality.","output":"Androgen deprivation therapy and excess mortality in men with prostate cancer during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new viral disease and in a short period of time, the world has been affected in various economic, social, and health aspects. This disease has a high rate of transmission and mortality. The aim of this study is to investigate the factors affecting the survival of COVID-19 patients in Kurdistan province. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the data including demographic features and the patient's clinical background in terms of co-morbidities such as diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease (CLD), coronary heart disease (CHD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and weak immune system (WIS) were extracted from electronic medical records. We use Cox's regression proportional hazard (PH) to model. RESULTS: In this study, out of 1831 patients, 1019 were males (55.7%) and 812 were females (44.3%) with an average age of 52.74  22.16 years.

Chinese governments and scientists have implemented a series of rigorous measures and scientific research to prevent and control the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is still no specific antiviral drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. It has been proven that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) exerts an important role in the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 during the outbreak.

The Oxygen Efficient Respiratory Aid (OxEra(TM)) device has been granted SAPHRA approval for emergency COVID-19 pandemic use. The device has the potential to be used widely in the healthcare sector due to its efficient oxygen supply and adjustable wall positive expiratory pressure (PEP). OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether the OxEra(TM) device was safe to use in a healthy adult volunteer population. Our primary objective was to ensure there was no asphyxiation, as assessed by changes observed from baseline End Tidal Carbon Dioxide (ETCO(2)) exceeding 6.3 mmHg and above the 45 mmHg threshold. We also monitored changes in vital organ signs and assessed the pain and comfort of the participant at various intervals with changes in PEPs. METHODS: This was an experimental safety study of the OxEra(TM) Device on 30 healthy participants at the ICU training centre of Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa. Each participant had basic vital-signs, ETCO(2), and Oxygen saturation percentages (SpO(2)%) taken at baseline until the end of 2 h. In the first 20 min, the PEP was increased by 5 cmH(2)0 until 20 min, then continued for the rest of the time on a PEP of 5 cmH(2)0. At each interval, vital signs, subjective comfort, pain, and visual scores were measured. RESULTS: Thirty healthy participants were enrolled. There was no significant difference in ETCO(2) from baseline until 2 h. No participant experienced an increase in measured ETCO(2) greater than 45 mmHg and no increase in ETCO(2) from baseline was greater than 6.3 mmHg. The median increase in ETCO(2) over the study period was 2 mmHg. There were no significant changes in respiratory rate and blood pressure. The heart rate decreased significantly (73C68 bpm). The VAS and comfort score had a significant increase over the 2 h from baseline of 0C2 at maximum; however, the PAS scores showed no significant increase. CONCLUSION: Overall the OxEra(TM) device achieved the safety endpoints set out. There was no sign of asphyxiation and there were appropriate physiological responses to changes in PEP once applied. The comfort of the mask did worsen over the 2 h; however, the scores were minimally worse on PEP application but improved once-off PEP.

Rapid testing of a large number of subjects is essential for monitoring and delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in order to mitigate the pandemics consequences. People who do not know that they are infected may not stay in quarantine and, thus, risk infecting others. Unfortunately, the massive number of COVID-19 tests performed is challenging for both laboratories and the units that conduct throat swabs and communicate the results. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to reduce the communication burden for health care professionals. We developed a secure and easy-to-use tracking system to report COVID-19 test results online that is simple to understand for the tested subjects as soon as these results become available. Instead of personal calls, the system updates the status and the results of the tests automatically. This aims to reduce the delay when informing testees about their results and, consequently, to slow down the virus spread. METHODS: The application in this study draws on an existing tracking tool. With this open-source and browser-based online tracking system, we aim to minimize the time required to inform the tested person and the testing units (eg, hospitals or the public health care system). The system can be integrated into the clinical workflow with very modest effort and avoids excessive load to telephone hotlines. RESULTS: The test statuses and results are published on a secured webpage, enabling regular status checks by patients; status checks are performed without the use of smartphones, which has some importance, as smartphone usage diminishes with age.

The complexity of sequencing data obtained by bulk repertoire sequencing makes analysis challenging, but simple descriptive analyses, clonal analysis, searches for specific sequences associated with immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, motif-based analyses, and machine learning approaches have all been applied. TCR repertoire sequencing has demonstrated early expansion followed by contraction of SARS-CoV-2-specific clonotypes, during active infection. Maintenance of TCR repertoire diversity, including the maintenance of diversity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 response, predicts a favourable outcome. TCR repertoire narrowing in severe COVID-19 is most likely a consequence of COVID-19-associated lymphopenia. It has been possible to follow clonotypic sequences longitudinally, which has been particularly valuable for clonotypes known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide/MHC tetramer binding or with SARS-CoV-2 peptide-induced cytokine responses. Closely related clonotypes to these previously identified sequences have been shown to respond with similar kinetics during infection. A possible superantigen-like effect of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been identified, by means of observing V-segment skewing in patients with severe COVID-19, together with structural modelling. Such a superantigen-like activity, which is apparently absent from other coronaviruses, may be the basis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome and cytokine storms in COVID-19. Bulk TCR repertoire sequencing has proven to be a useful and cost-effective approach to understanding interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the human host, with the potential to inform the design of therapeutics and vaccines, as well as to provide invaluable pathogenetic and epidemiological insights.","output":"Utility of Bulk T-Cell Receptor Repertoire Sequencing Analysis in Understanding Immune Responses to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSES: Healthcare workers are at risk of stress-related disorders. Risk communication can be an effective preventive health measure for some health risks, but is not yet common in the prevention of stress-related disorders in an occupational healthcare setting. The overall aim is to examine whether risk communication was part of interventions aimed at the prevention of stress-related disorders in healthcare workers. METHOD: We performed a scoping review using the framework of Arksey and OMalley. We searched in Medline, Web of Science and PsychInfo for studies reporting on preventive interventions of stress-related disorders in healthcare workers between 2005 and December 2020. Studies were included when the intervention reported on at least one element of risk communication and one goal. We predefined four elements of risk communication: risk perception, communication of early stress symptoms, risk factors and prevention; and three goals: inform, stimulate informed decision-making and motivate action. RESULTS: We included 23 studies that described 17 interventions. None of the included interventions were primarily developed as risk communication interventions, but all addressed the goals. Two interventions used all four elements of risk communication. The prominent mode of delivery was face to face, mostly delivered by researchers. Early stress symptoms and risk factors were measured by surveys. CONCLUSIONS: Risk communication on risk factors and early signs of stress-related disorders is not that well studied and evaluated in an occupational healthcare setting. Overall, the content of the communication was not based on the risk perception of the healthcare workers, which limited the likelihood of them taking action.

A huge number of studies are published every day, and it is no longer possible to read all the relevant individual studies. Many physicians prefer attending continuing medical education (CME) to reading international scientific publications. Consequently, it is critical that CME is based on the best available evidence and presented in an unbiased manner free of conflicts of interest. Systematic reviews and Cochrane reviews in particular can thus provide a valuable resource of up-to-date and high-quality information on health care questions for CME providers. Of note, systematic reviews might become outdated quickly. Furthermore, some systematic reviews are fraught with limitations such as poor methodology and conduct or incomplete and misleading reporting.

METHODS: This study was based on a cross-sectional descriptive design in four universities in Baghdad, Iraq. Depression and anxiety were screened using an Arabic version of the HADS. An online survey was administered via Qualtrics to convenience samples of students at four colleges of pharmacy and a college of medicine between March and June 2018. Multiple linear regression was used to identify factors associated with depression and anxiety symptoms among the participants. RESULTS: The researchers received 750 usable surveys. The participating students spent more time browsing social media (6.64 hours/day) than studying (1.92 hours/day) and exercising (2.83 hours/week). Approximately forty-six percent (45.9%) of the participants had scores that indicated depression symptoms and one-quarter (24.8%) had scores that indicated depression borderline symptoms. More than one-half (52.1%) of the participants had scores that indicated anxiety symptoms, while 20.1% had scores that indicated anxiety borderline symptoms. According to the multiple linear regression analysis, more depression and anxiety symptoms were significantly (p-value <0.05) associated with higher study hours weekly and lower sleep hours at night, academic achievement, and colleagues and family social support during exams. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy and medical students may be vulnerable to depression and anxiety because of long study hours.. To reduce their levels of anxiety and depression, they may need more social support, more exercise, more sleep, less social media use and a lower academic workload.","output":"Measuring depression and anxiety prevalence among Iraqi healthcare college students using hospital anxiety and depression scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article offers information on the utilising of high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) fort used conventional breaths (CMV) on HFJV either to reverse atelectasis or for initial lung recruitment.

Chile has one of the largest proportions of older adults in Latin America and is currently facing an increase in the number of people with dementia. In this context, the Chilean government has launched a national strategy that involves actions in the health and social care system, including the promotion of DFC. From a multisectoral approach, social and environmental aspects involving engagement with local communities and access to social connections and services are directly related to urban policies. This perspective article focuses on urban aspects of social housing policy, such as placement, networks, affordability and the relationship between subsidy structure and adequate housing provision in a country with a qualitative housing deficit of around 1,200,000 units and where a large proportion of people with dementia and their families live in poverty. We identified several barriers to delivering appropriate environments for people living with dementia in relation to a two-fold problem: (a) the social housing subsidy displaces caregivers and/or older adults to satellite towns where social connections and access to services and urban equipment are lost; and (b) people resisting displacement live in overcrowded neighbourhoods where dementia is a common problem. In both scenarios, a detrimental environment and social conditions directly affect the quality of life of elderly people living with dementia and their caregivers.","output":"The Social Housing Crisis and the Barriers to Developing Dementia-Friendly Communities in Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rise of social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic, impressions from online content can affect behavioral changes resulting in exacerbating disparities in care. Thus, there exists a need to utilize social media platforms, like Twitter, to help augment preparedness, especially at the intersection between oncology and COVID-19, where tweets could help hint at potential biomolecular interactions. To address this, a study was developed to assess relationship and ontologies on the interaction between hematological malignancies and COVID-19 on Twitter. Ontologies are groupings of terms and related identifiers, such as genes, for general search terms, such as Blood Cancer, were found utilizing the Human Phenotype Ontology. These were combined with the term COVID-19 and used as search terms for Twitter's Standard Search API. The resulting tweets were cross-checked to assess if they included any of the other terms or genes related to the starting ontologies to then determine how many terms or genes each tweet was associated with. Once the most associated tweets to the ontologies were found, the genes related to those ontologies were utilized to find biological structures within the AlphaFold EMBL database, before being used in binding using HEX Docking software's shape based binding tool in 3D. Finally, Root Mean Square (RMS) Deviations were performed between the top 2000 conformations for each bound structure to determine if the binding was statistically significant. Results showed strong clustering of top tweets around keyword combinations. In the case of the starting entry, Blood COVID-19, the ontologies that were found were linked to 45 terms that each had 100 or more tweets linked to them (Figure 1a). One such term of significance was Acute Myeloid Leukemia, which was linked to the gene BRCA1. The biological significance of the molecular interaction between BRCA1 and SARS CoV-2 was determined using the predicted protein structure from the AlphaFold-EMBL database for BRCA1 and the RCSB Protein Bank structure for the SARS CoV-2 spike (PDB# 6VSB), which can be found in Figure 1b. This interaction was found to be significant based on the average RMS Deviation of 82.97 Angstroms that ranged across the top 2000 conformation. Each model had an average RMS of 85.05 Angstroms between BRCA1 and the COVID-19 spike, with binding occurring on the spike's carbohydrate recognition domain within its S1 segment that is typically used for cell entry. Thus, human phenotype ontology was effective in classifying tweets to specific biomolecular interactions. Therefore, this approach could be utilized to proactively influence treatment designs for blood cancer patients infected with COVID-19, as well as in other areas where medical illnesses are already well defined by ontologies or other literature data. Forward looking, future studies will help to ensure that terms that are not well characterized by ontologies can still be utilized in this type of analysis by employing de novo ontology production methods.

For a non-enveloped virus with a small genome (1.7 kb ssDNA), PCV2 is remarkably diverse, with eight genotypes (aCh). New genotypes of PCV2 can spread through the migration of wild boar, which are thought to infect domestic pigs and spread further through the domestic pig trade. Despite a large swine population, the diversity of PCV2 genotypes in Ukraine has been under-sampled, with few PCV2 genome sequences reported in the past decade. To gain a deeper understanding of PCV2 genotype diversity in Ukraine, samples of blood serum were collected from wild boars (n = 107) that were hunted in Ukraine during the NovemberCDecember 2012 hunting season. We found 34/107 (31.8%) prevalence of PCV2 by diagnostic PCR. For domestic pigs, liver samples (n = 16) were collected from a commercial market near Kharkiv in 2019, of which 6 out of 16 (37%) samples were positive for PCV2. We sequenced the genotyping locus ORF2, a gene encoding the PCV2 viral capsid (Cap), for 11 wild boar and six domestic pig samples in Ukraine using an Oxford Nanopore MinION device. Of 17 samples with resolved genotypes, the PCV2 genotype b was the most common in wild boar samples (10 out of 11, 91%), while the domestic pigs were infected with genotypes b and d. We also detected genotype b/d and b/a co-infections in wild boars and domestic pigs, respectively, and for the first time in Ukraine we detected genotype f in a wild boar from Poltava. Building a maximum-likelihood phylogeny, we identified a sublineage of PCV2 genotype b infections in both wild and domestic swine, suggesting a possible epizootic cluster and an ecological interaction between wild boar and domestic pig populations in northeastern Ukraine.","output":"Genetic Diversity of Porcine Circovirus 2 in Wild Boar and Domestic Pigs in Ukraine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rational: Interstitial brachytherapy (BT) is a promising radiation therapy for cancer; however, the efficacy of BT is limited by tumor radioresistance. Recent advances in materials science and nanotechnology have offered many new opportunities for BT. Methods: In this work, we developed a biomimetic nanotheranostic platform for enhanced BT. Core-shell Au@AuPd nanospheres (CANS) were synthesized and then encapsulated in platelet (PLT)-derived plasma membranes. Results: The resulting PLT/CANS nanoparticles efficiently evaded immune clearance and specifically accumulated in tumor tissues due to the targeting capabilities of the PLT membrane coating. Under endoscopic guidance, a BT needle was manipulated to deliver appropriate radiation doses to orthotopic colon tumors while sparing surrounding organs. Accumulated PLT/CANS enhanced the irradiation dose deposition in tumor tissue while alleviating tumor hypoxia by catalyzing endogenous H(2)O(2) to produce O(2). After treatment with PLT/CANS and BT, 100% of mice survived for 30 days.

Mostly, the comparisons have been performed on immunocompetent children with upper respiratory tract symptoms. The results range from a relatively poor sensitivity for the swabs to an even higher sensitivity than for the NPA. We aimed to investigate the sensitivity of a flocked nasal swab (fNS) on immunocompromised adults with febrile neutropenia. METHODS: During 16 months, adults with a hematological disorder presenting with febrile neutropenia were enrolled in the study. Paired samples of the fNS and NPA were collected in the outer part of the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx, respectively. The samples were analyzed regarding a panel of 15 respiratory viruses by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, as an indirect measure of cell yield by either method, the copy number of the human beta actin gene was also determined. Cohen's kappa was calculated as a measure of agreement of the results obtained from either method. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparison of cell yield. RESULTS: A total of 98 paired samples from a total of 89 patients were collected. Twenty of the pairs had virus detected in at least one of the specimens; 11 in both, 7 in NPA only, and 2 in fNS only. For the fNS, the overall sensitivity for any virus and for rhinovirus only was 65% and 78%, respectively. NPA was significantly superior to the fNS in collecting epithelial cells.

Psycholinguistic analysis of tweets from Twitter allows obtaining information about peoples emotional expression, analytical thinking, and somatosensory processes, which are particularly important in traumatic events contexts. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to analyze the influence of official Italian COVID-19 daily data (new cases, deaths, and hospital discharges) and the phase of managing the pandemic on how people expressed emotions and their analytical thinking and somatosensory processes in Italian tweets written during the first phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. METHODS: We retrieved 1,697,490 Italian COVID-19Crelated tweets written from February 24, 2020 to June 14, 2020 and analyzed them using LIWC2015 to calculate 3 summary psycholinguistic variables: emotional tone, analytical thinking, and somatosensory processes. Official daily data about new COVID-19 cases, deaths, and hospital discharges were retrieved from the Italian Prime Minister's Office and Civil Protection Department GitHub page. We considered 3 phases of managing the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. We performed 3 general models, 1 for each summary variable as the dependent variable and with daily data and phase of managing the pandemic as independent variables.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Are people with asthma at a higher risk of being infected, hospitalised or of poorer clinical outcomes from COVID-19? METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis based on five main databases including the WHO COVID-19 database between December 1, 2019 to July 11, 2021 on studies with a control (non-asthma) group was conducted. Prevalence and risk ratios were pooled using Sidik-Jonkman random effects meta-analyses. FINDINGS: Fifty-one studies with an 8.08% (95% CI 6.87C9.30) pooled prevalence of people with asthma among COVID-19 positive cases. The risk ratios were 0.83 (95% CI 0.73C0.95, p=0.01) for acquiring COVID-19; 1.18 (95% CI 0.98C1.42, p=0.08) for hospitalisation; 1.21 (95% CI 0.97C1.51, p=0.09) for ICU admission; 1.06 (95% CI 0.82C1.36, p=0.65) for ventilator use and 0.94 (95% CI 0.76C1.17; p=0.58) for mortality for people with asthma. Subgroup analyses by continent revealed a significant difference in risk of acquiring COVID-19, ICU admission, ventilator use and death between the continents.

We evaluated the impact of interleukin (IL)-6 blockade with tocilizumab on SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and the antibody response in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective cohort study in patients admitted with COVID-19. Serial nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were measured for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and S-IgG/N-IgG titers, respectively. FINDINGS: 138 patients with confirmed infection were included; 76 (55%) underwent IL-6 blockade. Median initial SOFA (p = 0a?016) and SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p<0a?001, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test) were significantly higher among anti-IL-6 users. Patients under IL-6 blockade showed delayed viral clearance in the Kaplan-Meier curves (HR 0a?35 [95%CI] [0a?15-0a?81], log-rank p = 0a?014), but an adjusted propensity score matching model did not demonstrate a significant relationship of IL-6 blockade with viral clearance (HR 1a?63 [0a?35-7a?7]). Cox regression showed an inverse association between SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and the initial viral load (HR 0a?35 [0a?11-0a?89]). Patients under the IL-6 blocker showed shorter median time to seropositivity, higher peak antibody titers, and higher cumulative proportion of seropositivity in the Kaplan Meier curves (HR 3a?1 [1a?9-5] for S-IgG; and HR 3a?0 [1a?9-4a?9] for N-IgG; log-rank p<0a?001 for both). However, no significant differences between groups were found in either S-IgG (HR 1a?56 [0a?41-6a?0]) nor N-IgG (HR 0a?96 [0a?26-3a?5]) responses in an adjusted propensity score analysis. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, IL-6 blockade does not impair the viral specific antibody responses. Although a delayed viral clearance was observed, it was driven by a higher initial viral load. The study supports the safety of this therapy in patients with COVID-19.

These uncertainties become even more phenomenal in the overwhelming mutation-dominated resurgences with vaccinated but still susceptible populations. Here we introduce a novel hybrid approach to (1) characterizing and distinguishing Undocumented (U) and Documented (D) infections commonly seen during COVID-19 incubation periods and asymptomatic infections by expanding the foundational compartmental epidemic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with two compartments, resulting in a new Susceptible-Undocumented infected-Documented infected-Recovered (SUDR) model;(2) characterizing the probabilistic density of infections by empowering SUDR to capture exogenous processes like clustering contagion interactions, superspreading and social reinforcement;and (3) approximating the density likelihood of COVID-19 prevalence over time by incorporating Bayesian inference into SUDR. Different from existing COVID-19 models, SUDR characterizes the undocumented infections during unknown transmission processes. To capture the uncertainties of temporal transmission and social reinforcement during the COVID-19 contagion, the transmission rate is modeled by a time-varying density function of undocumented infectious cases. We solve the modeling by sampling from the mean-field posterior distribution with reasonable priors, making SUDR suitable to handle the randomness, noise and sparsity of COVID-19 observations widely seen in the public COVID-19 case data.","output":"Modeling COVID-19 uncertainties evolving over time and density-dependent social reinforcement and asymptomatic infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare industry has been relegated to services of innovation and even we can say that healthcare industry has been slower to embrace the Internet of things (IoT) due to our earlier legitimate concern about security and privacy But in the recent years and according to Deloitte report, its been noted that more than 500,000 medical technologies are currently accessible to collect, analyze and transmit healthcare data;evolving the future of healthcare services by allocating end to end data encryption security and providing greater privacy options to patient And now when the whole world is facing the rapid expansion of COVID-19, where the social and physical distancing is a matter of concern for the frontline clinical healthcare provider and the patients, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) had played an indispensable role in tackling COVID-19 It not only accelerates our response to this widespread pandemic but also offers many innovative solutions to retaliate this global issue Remote monitoring and evaluating of large number COVID-19 patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or in ventilators by few medical health professionals, providing telemedicine services to the people dwelling in lockdown or quarantine, and encouraging behavioral modification of patients;has opened the door to more efficient healthcare delivery during this time of New Normal With new technology, however comes new challenges which have to fix together to make this technology works more efficiently, especially in the rural areas, where it needs the most ? 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"IoMT Potential Impact in COVID-19: Combating a Pandemic with Innovation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microtubules are intrinsically dynamic structures.

The primary end point was the rate of successful device implantation without major peri-device leak (>5 mm). Secondary end points included major adverse events, total procedural time, delivery sheath and devices used, risk of major peri-device leak and device-related thrombus at follow-up imaging. A single/anterior-curve delivery sheath was used more commonly in those who underwent CT imaging (35.9% versus 18.8%; P<0.001). Additional preprocedural CT planning was associated with a significantly higher successful device implantation rate (98.5% versus 94.9%; P=0.02), a shorter procedural time (median, 45.5 minutes versus 51.0 minutes; P=0.03) and a less frequent change of device size (5.6% versus 12.1%; P=0.01), particularly device upsize (4% versus 9.4%; P=0.02).

People around the world have reacted to these threats in seemingly unrelated ways: From stockpiling yeast and toilet paper to favoring nationalist ideas or endorsing conspiratorial beliefs. According to the General Process Model of Threat and Defense, the confrontation with a threat C a discrepant experience C makes humans react with both proximal and distal threat responses. While the proximal response manifests in behavioral inhibition that leads to heightened anxious arousal and vigilance, distal responses seek to lower behavioral inhibition and the associated state of anxiety and vigilance through engaging in distal defenses. In the present research, we propose that the reactions to COVID-19 may represent distal defense strategies to the pandemic and, therefore, can be explained and forecasted by the model. Thus, we hypothesized increased perceived COVID-19 threat to lead to a proximal threat response in the form of heightened behavioral inhibition. This, in return, should enhance the use of distal defenses (i.e., several ingroup biases, system justification, and conspiratorial beliefs) overlapping with the reactions observed as a response to COVID-19. This hypothesized mediated effect of increased perceived COVID-19 threat on distal defenses was tested in two preregistered studies: In Study 1 (N = 358), results showed perceived COVID-19 threat to be related to behavioral inhibition and, in turn, to be associated with increased distal defenses (i.e., higher entitativity, control restoration motivation, passive party support). In Study 2 (N = 348), we manipulated COVID-19 threat salience and found results suggesting the distal defenses of ingroup entitativity, system justification, and conspiratorial beliefs to be mediated by the proximal threat response. The results of the present research hint toward a common mechanism through which the seemingly unrelated reactions to COVID-19 can be explained. The results might help to predict future behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic and to design measures to counteract the detrimental effects of the pandemic.","output":"Between Conspiracy Beliefs, Ingroup Bias, and System Justification: How People Use Defense Strategies to Cope With the Threat of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We hereby report a case of a 55-year-old male with fever and difficulty breathing over several days who treated for presumed COVID-19 pneumonia despite testing negative thrice via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasal swab We explore several possible reasons for serially negative SARS-CoV-2 testing and other potential avenues of diagnosis","output":"A Case of Novel Corona Virus With Three Negative Nasopharyngeal Swabbings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Iran is one of the first few countries that was hit hard with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We aimed to estimate the total number of COVID-19 related infections, deaths, and hospitalizations in Iran under different physical distancing and isolation scenarios. METHODS: We developed a susceptible-exposed-infected/infectious-recovered/removed (SEIR) model, parameterized to the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. We used the model to quantify the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran and assess the effectiveness of isolation and physical distancing under five different scenarios (A: 0% isolation, through E: 40% isolation of all infected cases). We used Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate the 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). RESULTS: Under scenario A, we estimated 5 196 000 (UI 1 753 000-10 220 000) infections to happen till mid-June with 966 000 (UI 467 800-1 702 000) hospitalizations and 111 000 (UI 53 400-200 000) deaths. Successful implantation of scenario E would reduce the number of infections by 90% (ie, 550 000) and change the epidemic peak from 66 000 on June 9, to 9400 on March 1, 2020. Scenario E also reduces the hospitalizations by 92% (ie, 74 500), and deaths by 93% (ie, 7800). CONCLUSION: With no approved vaccination or therapy available, we found physical distancing and isolation that include public awareness and case-finding and isolation of 40% of infected people could reduce the burden of COVID-19 in Iran by 90% by mid-June.","output":"Estimating COVID-19-Related Infections, Deaths, and Hospitalizations in Iran Under Different Physical Distancing and Isolation Scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As the human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are detected in healthy oral mucosa as well as in oral lesions, dental practitioners have an important role in detecting any possible lesions that might be caused by this virus.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led the change in daily habits through the introduction of personal protective equipment (e.g., face mask) into everyday routine. The use of an instrumented face mask to monitor heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) of workers in occupational settings may be useful to better understand the physiological conditions and the presence of environmental and physical stressors.Among many methods used to estimate these two vital signs, photoplethysmography has gained broad acceptance in the scientific community. Several sites have been used to place the photoplethysmographic sensor (e.g., ear lobe and finger-tip) to estimate the above-mentioned physiological parameters. In this paper, we proposed a smart face mask (SFM) instrumented by a photoplethysmographic sensor. This configuration is particularly adequate to be used in those occupational settings which require the use of common input peripherals (e.g., mouse and keyboard) which prompt to fast movement of hands and fingers, limiting the performance of common measurement systems (e.g., smartwatches) due to motion artifacts. The proof of concept of SFM has been conducted by mimicking conditions close to the mentioned occupational settings through the use of a low computational power algorithm. The proposed system showed promising results by returning values in agreement with the reference system mimicking RR in a wide range of values. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"A smart face mask based on photoplethysmography for cardiorespiratory monitoring in occupational settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To develop prognostic models for survival (alive or deceased status) prediction of COVID-19 patients using clinical data (demographics and history, laboratory tests, visual scoring by radiologists) and lung/lesion radiomic features extracted from chest CT images. METHODS: Overall, 152 patients were enrolled in this study protocol. These were divided into 106 training/validation and 46 test datasets (untouched during training), respectively. Radiomic features were extracted from the segmented lungs and infectious lesions separately from chest CT images. Clinical data, including patients' history and demographics, laboratory tests and radiological scores were also collected. Univariate analysis was first performed (q-value reported after false discovery rate (FDR) correction) to determine the most predictive features among all imaging and clinical data. Prognostic modeling of survival was performed using radiomic features and clinical data, separately or in combination. Maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) and XGBoost were used for feature selection and classification. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were used to assess the prognostic performance of the models on the test datasets. RESULTS: For clinical data, cancer comorbidity (q-value < 0.01), consciousness level (q-value < 0.05) and radiological score involved zone (q-value < 0.02) were found to have high correlated features with outcome. Oxygen saturation (AUC = 0.73, q-value < 0.01) and Blood Urea Nitrogen (AUC = 0.72, q-value = 0.72) were identified as high clinical features. For lung radiomic features, SAHGLE (AUC = 0.70) and HGLZE (AUC = 0.67) from GLSZM were identified as most prognostic features. Amongst lesion radiomic features, RLNU from GLRLM (AUC = 0.73), HGLZE from GLSZM (AUC = 0.73) had the highest performance. In multivariate analysis, combining lung, lesion and clinical features was determined to provide the most accurate prognostic model (AUC = 0.95  0.029 (95%CI: 0.95-0.96), accuracy = 0.88  0.046 (95% CI: 0.88-0.89), sensitivity = 0.88  0.066 (95% CI = 0.87-0.9) and specificity = 0.89  0.07 (95% CI = 0.87-0.9)).

During that year we noticed an alarming increase in cases of nosocomial Candidemia: 26 versus an average of 2.8 cases per year over the previous 5 years. 19 of the 26 episodes (73%) of Candidemia occurred in patients who were admitted with acute COVID-19 infection. Recent reports suggest that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk for developing Candidemia, however their clinical characteristics, risk factors and outcomes have not been well described. We evaluated the risk factors and mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with Candidemia. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 19 patients with Candidemia and confirmed COVID-19 infection at a 292-bed community teaching hospital in Chicago, Illinois from January through December 2020. We report a descriptive analysis of the demographic characteristics, comorbidities, complications, and outcomes of these patients. RESULTS: The average age of our study population was 65 years; 68% were male. The average hospital length of stay (LOS) was 34 days. The mean time from admission to the development of Candidemia was 16 days. Associated co-morbidities included cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in 79%, diabetes mellitus (DM), in 68%, and obesity in 50%. Underlying kidney disease was present in 10%. Treatments for COVID-19 included convalescent plasma (53%), remdesivir (53%), steroids (52%) and tocilizumab (19%). All patients were managed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 95% required multiple central line (CL) placements. Most of the patients (58%) required hemodialysis (HD); all patients were treated with multiple antibiotics. The average LOS in the ICU was 25 days. Despite anti-fungal treatment, 68% expired. The 28-day mortality was 50%. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of Candidemia in our hospitalized patients with acute COVID-19 infection was associated with a history of CVD, DM, obesity, prolonged hospital LOS, requirement for multiple CL, HD, treatment with multiple antibiotics and a long stay in the ICU. The mortality of COVID-19 patients with Candidemia is high. The development of strategies to mitigate the occurrence of nosocomial Candidemia in this population of patients is urgently needed.

Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that binding of nargenicin to Mtb DnaE1 requires the DNA substrate such that nargenicin is wedged between the terminal base pair and the polymerase and occupies the position of both the incoming nucleotide and templating base.

However, no study to date has examined the association between CRF and COVID-19. The objectives of this study were to determine whether CRF is independently associated with testing positive with or dying from COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 2,690 adults from the UK Biobank Study that were followed from March 16(th), 2020 to July 26(th), 2020. Participants who were tested for COVID-19 and had undergone CRF assessment were examined. CRF was estimated (eCRF) and categorized as low (<20(th) percentile), moderate (20(th) to 80(th) percentile) and high (80(th) percentile) within sex and ten-year age groups (e.g. 50C60 years). Participants were classified as having COVID-19 if they tested positive (primarily PCR tests) at an in-patient or out-patient setting as of July 26, 2020. Participants were classified as having died from COVID-19 if the primary or underlying cause of death was listed ICD-10 codes U071 or U072 by June 30(th), 2020. Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and a forward model building approach used to identify covariates. FINDINGS: There was no significant association between eCRF and testing positive for COVID-19. Conversely, individuals with moderate (aRR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.75) and high fitness (aRR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.85) had a significantly lower risk of dying from COVID-19 than those with low fitness. CONCLUSIONS: While eCRF was not significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19, we observed a significant dose-response between having higher eCRF and a decreased risk of dying from COVID-19. This suggests that prior gains in CRF could be protective against dying from COVID-19 should someone develop the virus.","output":"The association of estimated cardiorespiratory fitness with COVID-19 incidence and mortality: A cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death worldwide. Bank workers are at higher risk of hypertension because of their work sedentary characteristics. However, little is known about the prevalence and determinants of hypertension among this group of population. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of hypertension among bank employees in metropolitan cities in Amhara Regional State of Ethiopia. METHOD: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 368 bank employees. A simple random sampling technique was used to select participants. A pretested self-administered questionnaire and biophysical measurements were employed to collect the data. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were done to summarize the data and identify factors associated with hypertension, respectively. RESULT: The overall prevalence of hypertension among bank employees was 52.4% (95% CI: 47.2, 57.7).

At this juncture, the respirators performance after various types of sterilization and usage condition is required to be analyzed in detail. With this motto, this work has proceeded. The filtration efficiency, pressure drop, and quality factor of the respirator are evaluated for two face velocities (5.8 and 26.4 cm/s) following different sterilization methods. Sterilization techniques used here are dry air oven heating, gamma irradiation, and immersing in a 10% concentration of liquid hydrogen peroxide. The particle filtration performance and electrostatic surface charge density measurement are used to determine the facemasks efficacy after sterilization. The methods recommended to sterilize N95 masks without affecting their performance are (i) using dry air heat at 80oC and (ii) H2O2 soaking. The highest reduction in filtration efficiency is observed to be 30-35% after gamma irradiation due to a change in the electrostatic properties of the respirator layers. However, the filtration efficiency does not change significantly for other sterilization methods despite a change in charge density, but there is no direct correlation with filtration efficiency. Electrostatic charge measurement of the filtration layer is a crucial indicator of filtration efficiency degradation.

In Europe, this sector is highly dependent on the aid provided under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Therefore, the distribution of this aid among the various recipients is crucial to maintaining a strong primary sector throughout the European Union (EU). This is especially true in light of the new funding for the period from 2021 to 2027 and the United Kingdom's departure from the EU. In this sense, the 93.5% of the first pillar of CAP aid consists of direct aid to farmers. The related literature has shown its effect on aspects such as sustainability and farmers' income, among others, and its distribution in specific geographical areas. In this vein, the present paper conducts a longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis of the distribution of aid across EU countries. The results show that the CAP reforms and the incorporation of countries into the EU influenced the distribution of aid. Moreover, there is a clear division between Eastern and Western EU countries, with a more equitable distribution of aid in the West.

OBJECTIVE: The effect of vitamin E and black seed oil on reproductive performance of Swiss albino mice was studied. METHODS: A total of 80 (40 male and 40 female) mice of 25C28 days old were randomly divided into four groups viz., A, B, C and D consisting of 10 mice in each group. Mice from the group A served as vehicle control and received normal mice ration whereas mice from the group B, C and D received feed supplemented with either black seed oil (0.5 ml/kg), vitamin E (200 mg/kg) or combination of black seed oil (0.5 ml/kg) and vitamin E (200 mg/kg), respectively daily for 16 weeks. At the end point of the study, blood samples were collected and sera were separated for hormonal analysis. At the same time, mice were sacrificed and testes and ovaries were collected for histomorphological examination. RESULTS: In male mice, the level of testosterone increased significantly in mice receiving black seed oil only, whereas the thyroxin increased significantly in all treated groups when compared to the control mice. Histomorphological examination revealed a significant increase in the diameter of seminiferous tubules in male mice fed with either black seed oil or vitamin E or both. On the other hand, the oestradiol and thyroxin concentration in female mice showed no significant changes in both control and treated groups. However, ovaries of mice fed with black seed oil or vitamin E or both showed an increased number of the follicles of different stages than the control mice.

English-language controlled and open trials were included if they reported: (a) administration of an eHealth intervention, and (b) stress or mental health outcomes such as self-report or clinical diagnosis of anxiety and depression, among (c) parents of children who were aged 1C5 years old. Non-human studies, case reports, reviews, editorials, letters, dissertations, and books were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Study Quality Assessment Tools. Random-effects meta-analyses of standardized mean differences (SMD) were conducted and meta-regressions tested potential moderators. 38 studies were included (N = 4360 parents), from 13 countries (47.4% USA). Meta-analyses indicated eHealth interventions were associated with better self-reported mental health among parents (overall SMD = .368, 95% CI 0.228, 0.509), regardless of study design (k = 30 controlled, k = 8 pre-post) and across most outcomes (k = 17 anxiety, k = 19 depression, k = 12 parenting stress), with small to medium effect sizes. No significant family- or program-level moderators emerged. Despite different types and targets, eHealth interventions offer a promising and accessible option to promote mental health among parents of young children. Further research is needed on moderators and the long-term outcomes of eHealth interventions. Prospero Registration: CRD42020190719.

However, there is evidence that such curfews have little or no effect on disease dynamics when other measures such as bans on gatherings or business and school closures are already in place. There are two possible explanations for this. First, nighttime curfews may elicit reactancea feeling of anger that drives non-adherence; second, nighttime curfews may motivate people to shift activities from night to daytime, thereby increasing contact density. METHODS: A survey experiment was conducted with German participants (N = 997) to investigate public perceptions of nighttime curfews and possible detrimental effects on contact behaviors. RESULTS: Most participants perceived nighttime curfews as ineffective. The introduction of a hypothetical curfew did not affect intentions to reduce private contacts but instead elicited reactance, motivating participants to violate curfew hours or to shift a fictitious dinner meeting to an earlier time rather than cancelling it. CONCLUSIONS: When people do not support nighttime curfews or do not understand the rationale behind them, introduction of this measure may fuel the spread of the disease. For that reason, nighttime curfews should be a measure of last resort and should be accompanied by a public communication campaign explaining the importance of contact reduction during both nighttime and daylight hours.","output":"Good night: Experimental evidence that nighttime curfews may fuel disease dynamics by increasing contact density"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Offering reflections and concluding remarks, this chapter highlights key themes from the book content, accompanied by observations about the future of the teaching, research, and practice of coaching psychology.

The high infectivity of the disease even from non-symptomatic infected patients, together with the lack of a definitive cure or preventive measures are all responsible for disease outbreak. The severity of COVID-19 seems to be mostly dependent on the patients own immune response. The over-activation of the immune system in an attempt to kill the virus, can cause a cytokine storm which in turn can induce acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as multi-organ damage, and ultimately may lead to death. Thus, harnessing the immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to ameliorate that cytokine-storm can indeed provide a golden key for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, especially severe cases. In fact, MSCs transplantation can improve the overall outcome of COVID-19 patients via multiple mechanisms; first through their immunomodulatory effects which will help to regulate the infected patient inflammatory response, second via promoting tissue-repair and regeneration, and third through their antifibrotic effects. All these mechanisms will interplay and intervene together to enhance lung-repair and protect various organs from any damage resulting from exaggerated immune-response. A therapeutic modality which provides all these mechanisms undoubtedly hold a strong potential to help COVID-19 patients even those with the worst condition to hopefully survive and recover.","output":"Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Their Extracellular Vesicles: A Potential Game Changer for the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In spring 2020, U.S. universities closed campuses to limit the transmission of COVID\\\\19, resulting in an abrupt change in residence, reductions in social interaction, and in many cases, movement away from a heavy drinking culture. The present mixed\\\\methods study explores COVID\\\\19\\\\related changes in college student drinking. We characterize concomitant changes in social and location drinking contexts and describe reasons attributed to changes in drinking. METHODS: We conducted two studies of the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on drinking behavior, drinking context, and reasons for both increases and decreases in consumption among college students. Study 1 (qualitative) included 18 heavy\\\\drinking college students (M (age) = 20.2; 56% female) who completed semi\\\\structured interviews. Study 2 (quantitative) included 312 current and former college students who reported use of alcohol and cannabis (M (age) = 21.3; 62% female) and who completed an online survey. RESULTS: In both studies, COVID\\\\19\\\\related increases in drinking frequency were accompanied by decreases in quantity, heavy drinking, and drunkenness. Yet, in Study 2, although heavier drinkers reduced their drinking, among non\\\\heavy drinkers several indices of consumption increased or remained stable . Both studies also provided evidence of reductions in social drinking with friends and roommates and at parties and increased drinking with family. Participants confirmed that their drinking decreased due to reduced social opportunities and/or settings, limited access to alcohol, and reasons related to health and self\\\\discipline. Increases were attributed to greater opportunity (more time) and boredom and to a lesser extent, lower perceived risk of harm and to cope with distress. CONCLUSION: This study documents COVID\\\\19\\\\related changes in drinking among college student drinkers that were attributable to changes in context, particularly a shift away from heavy drinking with peers to lighter drinking with family. Given the continued threat of COVID\\\\19, it is imperative for researchers, administrators, and parents to understand these trends as they may have lasting effects on college student drinking behaviors.","output":"Changes in Alcohol Use and Drinking Context due to the COVID\\\\19 Pandemic: A Multimethod Study of College Student Drinkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Dementia is one of the most relevant widespread diseases, with a prevalence of currently 50 million people with dementia worldwide.

However, the detailed association of thrombocytopenia with subsequent progression of organ functions and long-term prognosis in critically ill COVID-19 patients remains to be explored. METHODS: Medical records of 167 confirmed cases of critically ill COVID-19 from February 16 to March 21, 2020 were collected in this two-center retrospective study. 180-days outcome and clinical organ development in patients with thrombocytopenia and non-thrombocytopenia were analyzed. FINDINGS: Among all 167 patients, the median age was 66 years and 67.07% were male. Significant differences were noticed in laboratory findings including white blood cells, blood urea, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase and SOFA score between groups of thrombocytopenia and non-thrombocytopenia. Older age, lower platelet count and longer activated partial thromboplastin time at admission were determined to be risk factors of 28-day mortality, and all three, together with higher white blood cells were risk factors of 180-day mortality. Subsequent changes of six-point ordinal scale score, oxygenation index, and SOFA score in patients with thrombocytopenia showed marked worsening trends compared with patients without thrombocytopenia. Patients with thrombocytopenia had significantly higher mortality not only in 28 days, but also in 90 days and 180 days. The time-course curves in non-survival group showed a downtrend of platelet count and oxygenation index, while the curve of six-point ordinal scale kept an uptrend. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with thrombocytopenia had much lower probability of survival (p<0.01).

However, there are no studies examining the impact of more rapid and sensitive diagnosis by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in this population. We performed a prospective study to assess the impact of real time PCR diagnosis as well as protective isolation for community-acquired respiratory virus infections in pediatric patients undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS During a 2-year period, 39 pediatric patients undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplantation were analyzed for presence of respiratory viruses. Samples were taken at regular intervals and analyzed by culture and newly developed real time PCR methods. All patients were cared for in protective isolation. RESULTS Respiratory symptoms were observed in 10 of the 39 cases (26%) and a virus was identified in 8 and 6 of these cases by PCR and culture, respectively. The PCR detected the respiratory infection a median of 8 days before culture. However, the morbidity of the respiratory infections was generally mild, and no mortality was observed. Additionally all infections were observed pretransplant or after discharge; no nosocomial infections were observed.

The influenza virus infects both humans and birds, and mutates using two mechanisms: antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Currently, the H5N1 avian flu virus is limited to outbreaks among poultry and persons in direct contact to infected poultry, but the mortality rate among infected humans is high. Avian influenza (AI) is endemic in Asia as a result of unregulated poultry rearing in rural areas. Such birds often live in close proximity to humans and this increases the chance of genetic re-assortment between avian and human influenza viruses which may produce a mutant strain that is easily transmitted between humans. Once this happens, a global pandemic is likely. Unlike SARS, a person with influenza infection is contagious before the onset of case-defining symptoms which limits the effectiveness of case isolation as a control strategy. Researchers have shown that carefully orchestrated of public health measures could potentially limit the spread of an AI pandemic if implemented soon after the first cases appear. To successfully contain and control an AI pandemic, both national and global strategies are needed. National strategies include source surveillance and control, adequate stockpiles of anti-viral agents, timely production of flu vaccines and healthcare system readiness. Global strategies such as early integrated response, curbing the disease outbreak at source, utilization of global resources, continuing research and open communication are also critical.","output":"Avian Influenza: a global threat needing a global solution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been challenging human health worldwide.

However, the vast majority of these LAMP-based assays depend on the non-specific detection of LAMP products, which can not discern the undesirable amplificons, likely to yield unreliable results. Herein, a sequence-specific LAMP assay was reported to detect SARS-CoV-2 using proofreading enzyme-mediated probe cleavage (named Proofman), which could realize real-time and visual detection without uncapping. This assay, introducing a proofreading enzyme and the fluorogenic probe to reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-Proofman-LAMP), can specifically detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA with a detection limit of 100 copies. In addition to the real-time analysis, the assay is capable of endpoint visualization under a transilluminator within 50 min, providing a convenient reporting manner under the setting of point-of-care testing (POCT). In combination with different fluorophores, the one-pot multiplex assay was successfully achieved to detect multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2 and inner control simultaneously.

The aim of this study was to compare patient-performed testing based on a morning saliva sample with the current standard testing method, healthcare worker-collected sampling via a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). METHODS: This was a prospective single center study which recruited 217 asymptomatic adult male participants in a COVID-19 quarantine center who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 8-10 days prior isolation. Paired NPS and saliva specimens were collected and processed within 5 hours of sample collection. Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting Envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes was performed and the results were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 160 of the 217 (74%) participants tested positive for Covid-19 based on saliva, NPS, or both testing methods. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher in saliva compared to NPS testing (93.1%, 149/160 vs 52.5%, 84/160, p<0.001).

In this framework, the study seeks to assess the role of population density as a predictor of Covid-19 cases and deaths in Saudi Arabia and China during the Covid-19 pandemic. With high infectivity and mortality being a definitive characteristic of overpopulated regions, the authors propose that Henry Kissinger's population reduction theory can be applied as a control measure to control future pandemics and alleviate social concerns. If high-density Chinese regions are more susceptible to Covid-19 than low-density Saudi cities, the authors argue that Neo-Malthusian models can be used as a basis for reducing the impacts of the coronavirus disease on the economic growth in countries with low population density. However, the performed correlation analysis and simple linear regression produced controversial results with no clear connection between the three studied variables.

The sudden outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during Spring 2020 may have been a common focus of co-rumination. Conceptualized within a contextual behavioral science framework, the current study examined pandemic-focused co-rumination and its components: co-brooding (i.e., passively dwelling on concerns and associated consequences and negative emotions in a dyadic context) and co-reflection (i.e., repetitively discussing problems dyadically to enhance insight). A total of 320 undergraduates (62 %, female, 37 % male, 1 % non-binary gender) completed an online survey from late April-early May 2020 shortly after their universities abruptly ended in-person instruction and removed students from campus. COVID-19-focused co-rumination (specifically co-brooding) was associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms. Co-brooding and co-reflection each moderated the association between COVID-19 stress exposure and a) internalizing symptoms (COVID-related fears and depressive symptoms) and b) committed action, but in opposite directions, with co-brooding predicting increased symptoms and decreased committed action, and co-reflection predicting the opposite. Results suggest that when the nature of social support-seeking discussions promote psychological flexibility via increased perspective and understanding (vs. dwelling on negative content of experiences), they may ameliorate emotional distress and promote committed action following stress exposure. ? 2021 Association for Contextual Behavioral Science","output":"Does it help to talk about it?

Currently, RT-PCR and IgM/IgG antibody assays have been recommended for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. However, the correlation between RT-PCR status and antibody (IgG, IgM) response remains unknown. Methods: : Consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to our department between February 10, 2020 and March 10, 2020, were diagnosed by guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and included in this study. RT-PCR and antibody (IgM/IgG) assays for COVID-19 infection were performed for all patients according to the manufactures protocols. Other data, such as demographic, clinical, laboratory, as well as treatment and outcome, were collected using data collection tables from electronic medical records. Results: : During the study period, a total of 103 patients were diagnosed as having a moderate type of COVID-19 at our department, including 55 males and 48 females, with an average age of 57.53  1.65 years old (range 23 to 90 years old). The peak level of SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody (243.10  89.84 AU/ml) was reported 4 days after the negative RT-PCR (-) (all P < 0.05). Subsequently, the IgM decreased to 42.69  22.39 AU/ml 21 days after RT-PCR (-). However, the IgG was maintained at a high level 4 days before RT-PCR (-) and later. The lymphocyte count was at the lowest level on day7 before the RT-PCR(-) result (P<0.05), and then elevated after RT-PCR conversion (viral clearance). Conclusions: : SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG levels did not correlate with RT-PCR status in our study sample.

While in nursing, the use of simulation is not new, virtual simulation or virtual patients represent relatively new educational modalities. The aim of this literature review was to examine the most recent empirical evidence on the efficacy or effectiveness of using virtual simulation or virtual patients in nursing education around the world. Methods: Scholarly articles published between 2016 and 2021 in the CINAHL, MEDLINE, ERIC and COBIB bibliographic databases were reviewed. The review included articles which focused on student nurses using virtual simulation or virtual patients as a method of learning rather than as a way of assessing students' knowledge acquired through a different learning method. A thematic analysis was used to synthesise the results. Results: Twelve studies were included in the review, most of which were conducted in developed countries. The results showed that the use of virtual simulation or virtual patients has a positive effect on the acquisition of cognitive and affective knowledge, practical implementation of interventions, assessment of self-efficacy and competence, and student satisfaction. Discussion and conclusion: In situations where clinical training is not possible for nursing students, the use of virtual simulation or virtual patients can replace the clinical setting for the purposes of practising clinical decisions, but it cannot replace the clinical education and experience students obtain when working with actual patients.","output":"The use of virtual simulation or virtual patients in nursing education: An integrative literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper addresses the highly relevant and timely issues of global trade and food security by developing an empirically grounded, relation-driven agent-based global trade model. Contrary to most price-driven trade models in the literature, the relation-driven agent-based global trade model focuses on the role of relational factors such as trust, familiarity, trade history and conflicts in countries' trade behaviour. Moreover, the global trade model is linked to a comprehensive nutrition formula to investigate the impact of trade on food and nutrition security, including macro and micronutrients. Preliminary results show that global trade improves the food and nutrition security of countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Trade also promotes a healthier and more balanced diet, as countries have access to an increased variety of food. The effect of trade in enhancing nutrition security, with an adequate supply of macro and micronutrients, is universal across nutrients and countries. As researchers call for a holistic and multifactorial approach to food security and climate change (Hammond and Dub 2012 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 109, 12 356C12 363. (doi:10.1073/pnas.0913003109)), the paper is one of the first to develop an integrated framework that consists of socio-economic, geopolitical, nutrition, environmental and agri-food systems to tackle these global challenges. Given the ongoing events of Brexit, the USCChina trade war and the global COVID-19 pandemic, the paper will provide valuable insights on the role of trade in improving the food and nutrition security across countries.","output":"Food and nutrition security under global trade: a relation-driven agent-based global trade model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding of the pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) remains incomplete, particularly in respect to the multi-organ dysfunction it may cause. We were the first to report the analogous biological and physiological features of COVID-19 pathogenesis and the harmful amplification loop between inflammation and tissue damage induced by the dysregulation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation. Given the rapid evolution of this disease, the nature of its symptoms, and its potential lethality, we hypothesize that COVID-19 progresses under just such an amplifier loop, leading to a massive, uncontrolled inflammation process. Here, we describe in-depth the correlations of COVID-19 symptoms and biological features with those where uncontrolled NET formation is implicated in various sterile or infectious diseases. General clinical conditions, as well as numerous pathological and biological features, are analogous with NETs deleterious effects. Among NETs by-products implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis, one of the most significant appears to be elastase, in accelerating virus entry and inducing hypertension, thrombosis and vasculitis. We postulate that severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) may evade innate immune response, causing uncontrolled NETs formation and multi-organ failure. In addition, we point to indicators that NETS-associated diseases are COVID-19 risk factors. Acknowledging that neutrophils are the principal origin of extracellular and circulating DNA release, we nonetheless, explain why targeting NETs rather than neutrophils themselves may in practice be a better strategy. This paper also offers an in-depth review of NET formation, function and pathogenic dysregulation, as well as of current and prospective future therapies to control NETopathies. As such, it enables us also to suggest new therapeutic strategies to fight COVID-19. In combination with or independent of the latest tested approaches, we propose the evaluation, in the short term, of treatments with DNase-1, with the anti-diabetic Metformin, or with drugs targeting elastase (i.e., Silvelestat). With a longer perspective, we also advocate a significant increase in research on the development of toll-like receptors (TLR) and C-type lectin-like receptors (CLEC) inhibitors, NET-inhibitory peptides, and on anti-IL-26 therapies.","output":"Neutrophil Extracellular Traps and By-Products Play a Key Role in COVID-19: Pathogenesis, Risk Factors, and Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a homo-dimeric enzyme has been widely used in various bioassays as disease markers and enzyme probes. Recent advancements of digital bioassay revolutionized ALP-based diagnostic assays as seen in rapid growth of digital ELISA and the emerging multiplex profiling of single-molecule ALP isomers. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity found among ALP molecules hampers the ALP-based quantitative digital bioassays. This study aims quantitative analysis of single-molecule activities of ALP from Escherichia coli and reveals the static heterogeneity in catalytic activity of ALP with two distinct populations: half-active and fully-active portions. Digital assays with serial buffer exchange uncovered single-molecule Michaelis-Menten kinetics of ALP; half-active molecules have halved values of the catalytic turnover rate, kcat , and the rate constant of productive binding, kon , of the fully active molecules. These findings suggest that half-active ALP molecules are heterogenic dimers composed of inactive and active monomer units, while fully active ALP molecules comprise two active units. Static heterogeneity was also observed for ALP with other origins: calf intestine or shrimp, showing how the findings can be generalized across species. Cell-free expression of ALP with disulfide bond enhancer and spiked zinc ion resulted in homogenous population of ALP of full activity, implying that inactive monomer units of ALP are deficient in correct disulfide bond formation and zinc ion coordination. These findings provide basis for further study on molecular mechanism and biogenesis of ALP, and also offer the way to prepare homogenous and active populations of ALP for highly quantitative and sensitive bioassays with ALP.

Because SARS CoV-2 virus is spread via respiratory droplets, bag-mask ventilation, intubation, and extubation may place health care workers (HCW) at risk. While existing recommendations address airway management in patients with COVID-19, no guidance exists specifically for difficult airway management. Some strategies normally recommended for difficult airway management may not be ideal in the setting of COVID-19 infection. To address this issue the Society for Airway Management (SAM) created a task force to review existing literature and current Practice Guidelines for management of the difficult airway by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Management of the Difficult Airway. SAM task force created recommendations for management of known or suspected difficult airway in the setting of known or suspected COVID-19 infection. The goal of the task force was to optimize successful airway management while minimizing exposure risk. Each member conducted a literature review on specific clinical practice section utilizing standard search engines (PubMed, Ovid, Google Scholar). Existing recommendations and evidence for difficult airway management in COVID-19 context were developed. Each specific recommendation was discussed among task force members and modified until unanimously approved by all task force members. Elements of AGREE Reporting Checklist for dissemination of clinical practice guidelines were utilized to develop this statement. Airway management in the COVID-19 patient increases HCW exposure risk. and difficult airway management often takes longer, may involve multiple procedures with aerosolization potential, strict adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols is mandatory to reduce risk to providers. When patient's airway risk assessment suggests awake tracheal intubation is an appropriate choice of technique, procedures that may cause increased aerosolization of secretions should be avoided. Optimal preoxygenation before induction with tight seal facemask may be performed to reduce risk of hypoxemia. Unless the patient is experiencing oxygen desaturation, positive pressure bag-mask ventilation after induction may be avoided to reduce aerosolization. For optimal intubating conditions, patients should be anesthetized with full muscle relaxation. Videolaryngoscopy is recommended as first-line strategy for airway management. If emergent invasive airway access is indicated, we recommend a surgical technique such as scalpel-bougie-tube, rather than an aerosolizing generating procedure, such as transtracheal jet ventilation.

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named COVID-19. The main purpose of this review was to provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: The authors searched the MEDLINE database for clinical studies related to virus characteristics, pathogenesis, diagnosis, transmission mechanisms, and treatment options. RESULTS: As of January 27, 2021, the number of infected people and deaths associated with COVID-19 worldwide were approximately 100 million and 2 million, respectively. The manifestations of COVID-19 are variable, and the severity is affected by age and preexisting medical conditions. Children and adolescents are usually asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Older adults, in comparison, may experience severe illness and have disproportionally elevated mortality. Among those who survive, some may experience enduring deficits. The viral load is particularly elevated in saliva and oropharynx, which constitute potential sources of infection. The diagnosis of the disease may be confounded by factors related to the replicating cycle of the virus, viral load, and sensitivity of the diagnostic method used. As of January 2021, COVID-19 has no cure but can be prevented. Its treatment is based on supportive care along with antiviral medications and monoclonal antibodies. In severe cases with multiorgan involvement, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and hemodynamic support may be necessary. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a transmittable disease with a variable course. A substantial number of patients, particularly children, remain asymptomatic. Important advances have been made in the development of new treatments. However, the mortality in vulnerable populations remains elevated.

This study aimed to compare outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy for tandem and single occlusions of the anterior circulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study included consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke of the anterior circulation who had undergone mechanical thrombectomy performed with a stent retriever under conscious sedation within 6h of symptom onset. Data on clinical, imaging and endovascular findings were collected. In cases of tandem occlusion, distal thrombectomy (retrograde approach) was performed first whenever possible. Tandem and single occlusions were compared in terms of functional outcome and mortality at 3 months. RESULTS From May 2010 to April 2012, 42 patients with acute ischemic stroke attributable to MCA and/or ICA occlusion were treated. Eleven patients (26.2%) presented with tandem occlusions and 31 patients (73.8%) had a single anterior circulation occlusion. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Recanalization status also did not differ significantly (P=0.76), but patients with tandem occlusions had poorer functional outcomes (18.2% vs. 67.7% for single occlusions; P=0.01), a higher mortality rate at 3 months (45.5% vs. 12.9%, respectively; P=0.03) and more symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages at 24h (9.7% vs. 0%, respectively; P=0.01). A high rate of early proximal re-occlusion or severe residual stenosis (66%) was also observed in the tandem group. CONCLUSION Tandem occlusions had poor clinical outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy compared with single occlusions.

The Chinese public transportation system between over 340 prefectural-level cities is modeled as a multi-layer bi-partite network, with layers representing different means of transportation (airlines, railways, sail routes and buses), and nodes divided into two categories (central cities, peripheral cities). At each city, an open-system SEIR model tracks the local spread of the disease, with population in- and out-flow exchanging with the overlying transportation network. The model accounts for (1) different transmissivities of the epidemic on different transportation media, (2) the transit of inbound flow at cities, (3) cross-infection on public transportation vehicles due to path overlap, and the realistic considerations that (4) the infected population are not entering public transportation and (5) the recovered population are not subject to repeated infections. The model could be used to simulate the city-level spread in China (and potentially other countries) of an arbitrary epidemic, characterized by its basic reproduction number, incubation period, infection period and zoonotic force, originated from any Chinese prefectural-level city(s), during the period before effective government interventions are implemented.

In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is associated with higher rates of preterm birth, cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, lower APGAR scores, and neonatal resuscitation. Demographic factors and comorbidities were compared between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative groups. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in hospitalized patients who gave birth at Kings County Hospital from April 10 through June 10, 2020. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the electronic medical record. Patients were categorized based on SARS-CoV-2 infection status and peripartum outcomes were analyzed. We used the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. P < 0.05 was considered significant. There were no differences in obstetric or neonatal outcomes between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative cohorts. Most SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were asymptomatic on admission. The rates of maternal comorbidities were similar in the SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative groups.

The present study aims to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted adolescents'/young adults' (AYA) eating disorder (ED)-related care, and how access to, changes in, perceived disruptions to, and quality of care are associated with ED thoughts and behaviors. METHODS: AYA enrolled in the RECOVERY study, a pre-existing web-based longitudinal study, and completed a COVID-19-specific survey (n = 89). We examined bivariate associations of four markers of care: i) access to care, ii) changes in care, iii) perceived disruption to care, and iv) quality of care. Using multiple logistic regression, we examined the associations of pandemic-related markers of care with changes in ED thoughts and behaviors. We excluded those not engaged in treatment pre-pandemic (n = 16). RESULTS: In the remaining 73 participants, reported access to care was high, with 92% of respondents continuing care with at least one ED provider during the pandemic;however, 47% stopped some treatment during the pandemic. Nearly one-third (32%) perceived a disruption in treatment. Quality of care remained high with 67% reporting care to be better than or as good as pre-pandemic. Respondents acknowledged heightened symptomatology: 81% reported increased ED thoughts and 81% reported increased ED behaviors due to COVID-19-related factors. However, none of the markers of care described were significantly associated with ED thoughts or behaviors in regression analyses adjusting for demographic variables and baseline characteristics, except our quality of care measure which was approaching significance (p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show the majority of AYA who had care prior to the pandemic continued receiving some element of their multi-disciplinary ED treatment and perceived their care as high quality. None of the markers of care described were statistically associated with increased ED thoughts and behaviors.","output":"Access to care and worsening eating disorder symptomatology in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping the world and will feature prominently in all our lives for months and most likely for years to come.

Currently, there is no vaccine available to combat human NoV as it is not cultivable and lacks a small-animal model. Recently, we demonstrated that recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) expressing human NoV capsid protein (rVSV-VP1) induced strong immunities in mice (Y. Ma and J. Li, J. Virol. 85:2942-2952, 2011). To further improve the safety and efficacy of the vaccine candidate, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was inserted into the rVSV-VP1 backbone vector. A second construct was generated in which the firefly luciferase (Luc) gene was inserted in place of HSP70 as a control for the double insertion. The resultant recombinant viruses (rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1) were significantly more attenuated in cell culture and viral spread in mice than rVSV-VP1. At the inoculation dose of 1.0  10(6) PFU, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 triggered significantly higher vaginal IgA than rVSV-VP1 and significantly higher fecal and vaginal IgA responses than rVSV-Luc-VP1, although serum IgG and T cell responses were similar. At the inoculation dose of 5.0  10(6) PFU, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 stimulated significantly higher T cell, fecal, and vaginal IgA responses than rVSV-VP1. Fecal and vaginal IgA responses were also significantly increased when combined vaccination of rVSV-VP1 and rVSV-HSP70 was used. Collectively, these data indicate that (i) insertion of an additional gene (HSP70 or Luc) into the rVSV-VP1 backbone further attenuates the VSV-based vaccine in vitro and in vivo, thus improving the safety of the vaccine candidate, and (ii) HSP70 enhances the human NoV-specific mucosal and T cell immunities triggered by a VSV-based human NoV vaccine. IMPORTANCE Human norovirus (NoV) is responsible for more than 95% of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine for this virus. Development of a live attenuated vaccine for human NoV has not been possible because it is uncultivable. Thus, a live vector-based vaccine may provide an alternative vaccine strategy. In this study, we developed a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based human NoV vaccine candidate. We constructed rVSV-HSP70-VP1, coexpressing heat shock protein (HSP70) and capsid (VP1) genes of human NoV, and rVSV-Luc-VP1, coexpressing firefly luciferase (Luc) and VP1 genes. We found that VSVs with a double gene insertion were significantly more attenuated than VSV with a single VP1 insertion (rVSV-VP1). Furthermore, we found that coexpression or coadministration of HSP70 from VSV vector significantly enhanced human NoV-specific mucosal immunity. Collectively, we developed an improved live vectored vaccine candidate for human NoV which will be useful for future clinical studies.","output":"Heat shock protein 70 enhances mucosal immunity against human norovirus when coexpressed from a vesicular stomatitis virus vector."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing on data from STEM teacher education programs collected during museum closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this article examines the shifts that a large natural history museum made in educational programming.

This study aims to evaluate the significance of splenic volume during COVID-19 infection with or without cytokine storm and correlates splenic volume to the volume of pathological lung changes through linear regression analysis. RESULTS: A retrospective study collected 509 polymerase chain reaction proved COVID-19 patients (399 males, 110 females; mean age 48 years, age range 24C78 years) between June and November 2021, without a history of splenic pathology. A control group of age and sex-matched 509 healthy subjects was used and analyzed according to the splenic volume. Five consulting radiologists evaluated initial and follow-up computed tomography (CT) examinations using lung CT volumetry and splenic volume calculation in consensus. Three consulting pulmonologists correlated the severity of clinical and laboratory findings, including oxygen requirements and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. The T test results for comparison between the COVID-19 patients and the healthy subjects control group regarding the splenic volume were significant (T value was ? 4.731452 and p value was 0.00002). There was no significant correlation between the severity of the disease and normal-sized spleen (26% of patients, p = 0.916) or splenomegaly (24% of patients, p = 0.579). On the other hand, all patients with a small spleen or progressive splenomegaly during serial follow-up imaging had clinically severe disease with a statistically significant correlation (p = 0.017 and 0.003, respectively). Ninety-seven percent of patients with clinically mild disease and splenomegaly had 0C20% lung involvement (CT-severity score 1) while all patients with clinically severe disease and splenomegaly had 27C73% lung involvement (CT-severity score 2 and 3) (r = 0.305, p = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Splenomegaly is a non-specific sign that may be found during mild and severe COVID-19 infection, it was not statistically correlated with the clinical severity and a weak positive relationship was found between the splenic size and the CT-severity score of the pathological lung volume. On the other hand, the presence of splenic atrophy or progressive splenomegaly was correlated with severe COVID-19 presentation and cytokine storm. Therefore, the splenic volume changes should not be overlooked in COVID-19 serial CT examinations, particularly in severe or critically ill patients with cytokine storms.","output":"Splenomegaly versus pathological lung volume during COVID-19 infection with or without cytokine storm; a linear regression analysis using CT volumetry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The French society of clinical biology \\"Biochemical markers of COVID-19\\" has set up a working group with the primary aim of reviewing, analyzing and monitoring the evolution of biological prescriptions according to the patient's care path and to look for markers of progression and severity of the disease This study covers all public and private sectors of medical biology located in metropolitan and overseas France and also extends to the French-speaking world This article presents the testimonies and data obtained for the \\"Overseas and French-speaking countries\\" sub-working group made up of 45 volunteer correspondents, located in 20 regions of the world In view of the delayed spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the overseas regions and the French-speaking regions have benefited from feedback from the first territories confronted with COVID-19 Thus, the entry of the virus or its spread in epidemic form could be avoided, thanks to the rapid closure of borders The overseas territories depend very strongly on air and/or sea links with the metropolis or with the neighboring continent The isolation of these countries is responsible for reagent supply difficulties and has necessitated emergency orders and the establishment of stocks lasting several months, in order to avoid shortages and maintain adequate patient care In addition, in countries located in tropical or intertropical zones, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is complicated by the presence of various zoonoses (dengue, Zika, malaria, leptospirosis, etc )","output":"Management of a global health crisis: first COVID-19 disease feedback from Overseas and French-speaking countries medical biologists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 epidemic and government intervention measures may have adverse effects on people's mental health.

OBJECTIVE: Although health care professionals (HCPs) can provide counseling, no method of providing individualized information on the expected bleeding pattern or continued support is currently available for women experiencing postplacement bleeding changes. We aim to develop a mobile phoneCbased medical app (MyIUS) to meet this need and provide a digital companion to women after the placement of the intrauterine system. METHODS: The MyIUS app is classified as a medical device and uses an artificial intelligenceCbased bleeding pattern prediction algorithm to estimate a womans future bleeding pattern in terms of intensity and regularity. We developed the app with the help of a multidisciplinary team by using a robust and high-quality design process in the context of a constantly evolving regulatory landscape. The development framework consisted of a phased approach including ideation, feasibility and concept finalization, product development, and product deployment or localization stages. RESULTS: The MyIUS app was considered useful by HCPs and easy to use by women who were consulted during the development process.

Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the associations between ESKD status and outcomes. RESULTS: 73% of ESKD and 47% of non-ESKD patients identified as Black (p = 0.002). ESKD patients were older and had higher rates of comorbidities. Admission ferritin was approximately 6-fold higher in ESKD patients. During hospitalization, the rise in white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin and C-reactive protein, and the decrease in platelet count and serum albumin were all significantly greater in ESKD patients. The in-hospital mortality was higher for ESKD [18% vs. 10%; multivariable adjusted odds ratio 1.5 (95% CI, 0.48C4.70)], but this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ESKD patients had more co-morbidities and more robust inflammatory response than non-ESKD patients. The odds ratio point estimate for death was higher in ESKD patients, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.","output":"End-stage kidney disease and COVID-19 in an urban safety-net hospital in Boston, Massachusetts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the first months of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in 2020, Spain implemented an initial lockdown period on 15 March followed by a strengthened lockdown period on 30 March when only essential workers continued to commute to work. However, little is known about the epidemic dynamics in different age groups during these periods.We used the daily number of coronavirus 2019 cases (by date of symptom onset) reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network among individuals aged 15-19 years through 65-69 years. For each age group g, we computed the proportion PrE(g) of individuals in age group g among all reported cases aged 15-69 years during the pre-lockdown period (1-10 March 2020) and the corresponding proportion PrL(g) during two lockdown periods (initial: 25 March-3 April; strengthened: 8-17 April 2020). For each lockdown period, we computed the proportion ratios PR(g) = PrL(g)/PrE(g). For each pair of age groups g1, g2, PR(g1)>PR(g2) implies a relative increase in the incidence of detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in the age group g1 compared with g2 for the lockdown period vs. the pre-lockdown period.For the initial lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 50-54 years (PR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.12,1.30) and 55-59 years (PR = 1.19; 1.11,1.27). For the second lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 15-19 years (PR = 1.26; 0.95,1.68) and 50-54 years (PR = 1.20; 1.09,1.31).Our results suggest that different outbreak control measures led to different changes in the relative incidence by age group. During the initial lockdown period, when non-essential work was allowed, individuals aged 40-64 years, particularly those aged 50-59 years, had a higher relative incidence compared with the pre-lockdown period. Younger adults/older adolescents had an increased relative incidence during the later, strengthened lockdown.

These proteins recognize a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within cargo proteins and import them into the nucleus through nuclear pores, in a process mediated by importin-. Recent studies have shown that importin- proteins specifically recognize the NLS of several cellular factors and viral proteins, thus regulating their movement. Dysregulation of importin- is a common hallmark of many pathologies including, multiple cancers. In this study, we isolated aptamers 76 and 72, which bind specifically and efficiently to KPNA2, a member of a subfamily of importin-1. Both of these aptamers bind to KPNA2 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) of 150 nM and discriminate between KPNA2 and other sub-family members of importin-, such as KPNA1 and KPNA3. These aptamers specifically interfere with the nuclear transport of cargo proteins mediated by KPNA2 but neither with KPNA1 nor KPNA3, which belongs to other subfamily of importins. These results suggest that the selected aptamers (76 and 72) warrant further study to explore not only their application in cancer diagnosis but also their use as a specific reagent to potentially block KPNA2-dependent nuclear transport of macromolecules across the nuclear membrane.","output":"Aptamers that bind specifically to human KPNA2 (importin-1) and efficiently interfere with nuclear transport"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advances in mobile device technology and internet connectivity have created powerful new mobile health (mHealth) and telemedicine capabilities.

Clinical trials are a key element of comprehensive cancer care. Ensuring the continuing safe conduct of cancer clinical trials in the context of a pandemic is challenging. METHODS: We aimed to describe the COVID-19 pandemic response of a Cancer Care Clinical Research Unit (CRU) of a tertiary hospital in Queensland, Australia. We used a mixed methods approach for this case study. Emailed directives from CRU managers to all CRU staff sharing were qualitatively analysed and mapped against our unit activities over longitudinal time points. Data from patient recruitment and protocol deviations were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Mapping activity from 11 March to 30 September 2020 revealed rapid change during the first 2 weeks. Four key strategies to accommodate change were identified: supporting patients and families, introduction of telehealth, accessing investigational product, and social distancing. Early in the pandemic we recognised that our core key stakeholders were integral to our response. When compared to the previous 12 months, our recruitment numbers dropped markedly in early phases of the response but recovered over time, as we accommodated internal and external impacts. CONCLUSION: Our experience of agility as a necessity, adapting to support patients, and managing both clinical research activity and sponsors during the height of the pandemic response is presented here in order to inform future disaster response planning by clinical trial organisations.","output":"Resilience and ongoing quality care for cancer clinical trials during COVID-19: Experience from a tertiary hospital in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endangered species, despite often living at low population densities, may undergo unexpected density-dependent feedbacks in the case of successful recovery or marked reduction in range. Because density-dependence dynamics can increase risk of extinction, these effects can hamper conservation efforts. In this study, we analyse the dynamics of the largest population of the tamaraw (Bubalus mindorensis), a Critically Endangered species endemic to the Philippines. The population is located within a < 3,000ha area in Mounts Iglit-Baco Natural Park (MIBNP), with limited expansion possibilities. We took advantage of a 21 year time series of tamaraw counts to estimate annual population growth rate and possible density-dependence using state-space models in a Bayesian framework, hence accounting for sampling errors in the counts. We found that the MIBNP tamaraw population has been increasing in size at an average rate of +5% per year, as would be expected given its protected status by law. However, this growth rate is relatively low compared to other similar-sized Bovinea species. Population growth showed strong spatial structuring, with a population growth close to +14% in the core area of protection, and a reduction of abundance of ?27% at the periphery of its range inside MIBNP. That the annual population growth rate has progressively decreased since 2008 is concerning, and we interpret this result to be a sign of density-dependence. The isolated tamaraw population in MIBNP is currently experiencing a contraction of its range, likely caused by anthropogenic pressures forcing tamaraw to live at relatively high densities in the core zone where protection is most effective. Our study highlights the fact that, despite the encouraging results as indicated by continuous population growth over the last two decades, the long-term viability of the MIBNP tamaraw population remains uncertain.","output":"Cast away on Mindoro island: could density dependence threaten tamaraw (Bubalus mindorensis) on the long term?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sensor, wearable, and remote patient monitoring technologies are typically used in conjunction with video and/or in-person care for a variety of interventions and care outcomes.

The literature search focused on four concept areas: (1) competencies; (2) sensors, wearables, and remote patient monitoring; (3) mobile, asynchronous, and synchronous technologies; and (4) behavioral health. From 2846 potential references, two authors assessed abstracts for 2828 and, full text for 521, with 111 papers directly relevant to the concept areas.

OBJECTIVE: To assess prognostic value of vWF:Ag for COVID-19 inpatients. DESIGN: Citrated plasma samples collected from COVID-19 inpatients for D-dimer measurement were tested for vWF:Ag. Measurements of vWF:Ag and common acute phase reactants (APRs) were correlated with clinical outcomes and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: We included 333 samples from a diverse group of 120 COVID-19 inpatients. There was a clear association of higher peak measurements of vWF:Ag and other APRs with adverse clinical outcomes. Peak vWF:Ag >300% was associated with a 5-fold increased risk of death (Odds Ratio 5.08, P<.001) and a 30-fold increased risk of prolonged (>4 days) LOS (OR 29.65, P =.001). Peak D-dimer >3.8 FEU mg/L was associated with a 15-fold increase in risk of death (OR 14.73, P <.001) and a 5-fold increased risk of prolonged LOS (OR 4.55, P=.02). Using the earliest paired measurements of vWF:Ag and D-dimer from each patient and the same cut-offs, vWF:Ag was associated with a 3.5-fold increase in risk of death (OR 3.54, P=.004) and a 20-fold risk of prolonged LOS (OR 20.19, P=.004). Yet D-dimer was not significantly associated with either death (OR 1.9, P=.29) or prolonged LOS (OR 1.02, P=.98). CONCLUSIONS: Both peak and early post-admission vWF:Ag >300% were highly predictive of death and prolonged length of stay among COVID-19 inpatients.

We examined the role of endothelial cell (EC)-specific eNAMPT in experimental PH and an eNAMPT-neutralizing mAb as a therapeutic strategy to reverse established PH. Hemodynamic/echocardiographic measurements and tissue analyses were performed in Sprague Dawley rats exposed to 10% hypoxia/Sugen (three weeks) followed by return to normoxia and weekly intraperitoneal delivery of the eNAMPT mAb (1 mg/kg). WT C57BL/6J mice and conditional EC-cNAMPT(ec?/?) mice were exposed to 10% hypoxia (three weeks). Biochemical and RNA sequencing studies were performed on rat PH lung tissues and human PAH PBMCs. Hypoxia/Sugen-exposed rats exhibited multiple indices of severe PH (right ventricular systolic pressure, Fulton index), including severe vascular remodeling, compared to control rats. PH severity indices and plasma levels of eNAMPT, IL-6, and TNF- were all significantly attenuated by eNAMPT mAb neutralization. Compared to hypoxia-exposed WT mice, cNAMPT(ec?/?)

Healthcare teleconsultation networks are one of the potentially powerful systems to overcome this problem. Medical pathology can hugely benefit from teleconsultation networks because having second opinions is precious for many cases; however, resource planning (i.e., assignment and distribution of pathology consultation requests) is challenging due to bulky medical images of patients. This results in high setup and operational costs. The aim of this study is to design an optimal teleconsultation network for pathology labs under the supervision of medical sciences universities in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: To avoid the setup cost, we first propose a modified hybrid peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay architecture for our telepathology network, using Irans National Healthcare Information Network (SHAMS) as the underlying infrastructure. Then we apply optimization techniques to solve the request assignment and distribution problems in the network. Finally, we present a novel mathematical model with the objective of minimizing the variable operational costs of the system. RESULTS: The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated by a set of practical-sized network instances simulated based on the characteristics of SHAMS. The results show that the presented model and architecture can obtain optimal solutions for network instances up to 350 nodes, which covers our target network. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the proposed method can be beneficial for designing large-scale medical teleconsultation networks by adjusting the constraints according to the rules and conditions of each country. Our findings showed that teleconsultation networks in countries with strong information technology (IT) infrastructures are under the influence of consultation fees, while in countries with weak IT infrastructure, the transmission costs are more critical.

Successful recanalization was achieved in 14 patients (77.7%) after intra-arterial injection of tirofiban and subsequent Solitaire thrombectomy. Three patients without successful recanalization after rescue method received angioplasty with stenting. Overall, successful recanalization (TICI grades 2b and 3) was achieved in 17 (94.4%) of 18 patients. Periprocedural complications occurred in 5 patients: distal migration of emboli in 5 patients and vessel perforation in 1. Three patients died. Good functional outcome (mRS  2) was achieved in 9 patients (50.0%) at 3 months. CONCLUSION Rescue intra-arterial injection of tirofiban through a temporarily deployed Solitaire stent may facilitate further recanalization in cases of failed mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke.","output":"Adjuvant Tirofiban Injection Through Deployed Solitaire Stent As a Rescue Technique After failed Mechanical Thrombectomy in Acute Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Caffeine and orexin can affect awakening, neuroendocrine, and sympathetic nerve function.

The aim of this study was to systematically review studies that apply multilevel modeling approach in examining the relationships between SRI and neighborhood-level risk factors. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of peer reviewed English language articles was conducted in four electronic databases including PubMed (1992-2020), CINAHL (2000-2020), Sports Medicine and Education Index (1996-2020), and Web of Science (1991-2020). STUDY SELECTION Selected studies were observational or experimental studies of people of all ages across the world that assessed neighborhood risk factors for SRI (or all injuries including SRI) using multilevel regression analysis. DATA SYNTHESIS Nine studies-five cross-sectional, two prospective cohort, and two incidence studies-were selected out of a potential 1510. Six studies used secondary data and three used primary data. Only three studies examined SRI as the main or one of the main outcomes. These studies showed that neighborhood-level factors, such as higher socioeconomic context, lower street connectivity, and living or attending schools in urban communities, were associated with increased risk of SRI. Most studies did not provide a justification for the use of multilevel regression and the multilevel analytical procedure employed and quantities reported varied. The Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies (National Institutes of Health) was used to assess the quality or risk of bias of each study. Four quality assessment criteria out of 15 were met by all nine studies. The quality assessment ratings of the reviewed studies were not correlated with the quality of information reported for the multilevel models. CONCLUSION Findings from this review provide evidence that neighborhood-level factors, in addition to individual-level factors, should be taken into consideration when developing public health policies for injury prevention. Considering the limited numbers of studies that were identified by this systematic review, more multilevel studies are needed to strengthen this evidence in order to better inform SRI prevention policy decisions.","output":"Neighborhood risk factors for sports and recreational injuries: a systematic review of studies applying multilevel modeling techniques."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Just before Christmas, Congress passed a $2 3 trillion spending package that included $1 4 trillion in appropriations for fiscal year 2021 and $900 billion for COVID-19 relief (another ?stimulus? bill) The appropriations bill level-funded the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment block grant (SAPT BG) at $1 858 billion, and level-funded the State Opioid Response (SOR) grant at $1 5 billion (this grant program includes stimulants as of last year) However, the COVID-19 relief part of the law gave the SAPT BG an extra $1 65 billion for FY 2021","output":"$2.3 trillion spending bill includes COVID-19 relief, adding $1.65 billion to SAPT BG"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Realizing the topological bands of helical states poses a challenge in studying ultracold atomic gases.

Accordingly, concentration 90% (EC90 ) values recalculated from in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) at an approved dose in humans (Cmax /EC90 ratio). Only 14 of the 56 analyzed drugs achieved a Cmax /EC90 ratio above 1. A more in-depth assessment demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (ritonavir-boosted), and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval. An unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (Kp Ulung ) was also simulated to derive a lung Cmax /half-maximal effective concentration (EC50 ) as a better indicator of potential human efficacy.

Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 may be accelerated by making a multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences using the CPA (combining pairwise alignments) method, in which a pairwise alignment is made for a reference and each of other sequences, and the pairwise alignments are combined into a multiple alignment. Here it is shown from the analysis of 3729 genomic sequences for SARS-CoV-2 and outgroup strains that the CPA method can produce a multiple alignment with an elevated or a reduced number of variable sites depending on the reference compared to the OMA (ordinary multiple alignment) method, which was considered to be the most reliable. In particular, the topology of the phylogenetic tree constructed from the multiple alignment made using the CPA method adopting the outgroup sequence as the reference was considerably different from that using the OMA method, suggesting that the outgroup sequence may not be suitable as the reference in the CPA method.","output":"Methods for making multiple alignment of genomic sequences for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical material from avian species was examined directly by electron microscopy for the presence of viruses.

It is unknown whether there is also higher mortality after the first month from documented infection. MethodsWe extended the follow-up period to 8 months of a previous, retrospective cohort study based on the Swedish Senior Alert register. 3731 LTC residents infected with SARS-CoV-2 were matched to 3731 uninfected controls using time-dependent propensity scores on age, sex, body mass index, health status, comorbidities, and prescription medication use. In a sensitivity analysis, residents were also matched on geographical region and time of Senior Alert registration. ResultsMedian age was 87 years (65% women). Excess mortality was highest 5 days after documented infection (hazard ratio 19.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.6-24.8); subsequently excess mortality decreased rapidly. After the second month, mortality rate became lower in infected residents than in controls. Median survival of uninfected controls was 577 days (1.6 years), much lower than national life expectancy in Sweden at age 87 (5.05 years in men, 6.07 years in women).

One strain (A/shanghai/1/2013) contained the R294K substitution in the neuraminidase (NA) gene, indicating resistance to oseltamivir.

Only one isolate containing the E120V heterogenic mutation was detected by pyrosequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. However, this mutation was not detected in the original clinical specimen. Since virus isolation might lead to the selection of variants that might not fully represent the virus population in the clinical specimens, we suggest that using pyrosequencing to detect NAI resistance in H7N9 viruses directly from clinical specimens rather than from cultured isolates.

Here, we aimed to report our burn care experience during the six months COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated our ambulatory and hospitalized burn patients during the six months COVID-19 pandemic (from March to September 2020) with respect to the demographic data, wound care, surgery, intensive care management. Based on the model of our infection control team, we formed first to third degree prevention methods while contacting with burn patients in our outpatient clinic, semi-sterile ward (with beds) and intensive care unit (with 4 beds) which were sterilized and ventilated regularly. During hospitalization, we restricted the degree of interaction during multidisciplinary rounds. To screen for nosocomial infections, patients were routinely tested with PCR test. RESULTS: 402 burn patients (158 paediatric, 244 adults) were managed as outpatients (n=332;82%) and in patients (n=70; 18%) in our burn centre. Total body surface area percentage of burn in hospitalized patients were 9, 952, 76 % in paediatric and 25, 343, 49 in adult group.

Most physicians have a limited lifetime experience with cricothyrotomy, and it is unclear what method should be taught for this lifesaving procedure. The aim of this study is to compare the performance of medical personnel, naive to surgical airway techniques, in establishing an emergency surgical airway in cadavers using three commonly used cricothyrotomy techniques. METHODS Twenty medical students, without previous knowledge of surgical airway techniques, were randomly selected from their class. After training, they performed cricothyrotomy by three techniques (surgical, Melker, and QuickTrach II) in a random order on 60 cadavers with comparable biometrics. The time to complete the procedure, rate of success, and number of complications were recorded. A success was defined as the correct placement of the cannula within the trachea in 3 min. RESULTS The success rates were 95, 55, and 50% for surgical cricothyrotomy, QuickTrach, and Melker, respectively (P = 0.025). The majority of failures were due to cannula misplacement (15 of 20).

In contrast BKVN is rarely been reported in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Renal dysfunction after HCT is common and often attributed to total body irradiation, drug toxicity, hypertension or microangiopathy. As kidney biopsies are rarely performed after HCT, BKVN may be underdiagnosed. We report a Single-center experience of BKVN in HCT recipients. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of HCT recipients from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017. Only cases of BKVN confirmed by immunohistochemical stain on renal biopsy are included. Urine and blood BKV PCR was performed at Viracor Eurofins (Lees Summit, MO). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2017, 320 patients received HCT and 6 patients underwent kidney biopsy and 4 had BKVN. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Three patients (75%) received ex vivo T-cell depleted (CD34+ selected) peripheral blood (PB) HCT and did not receive pharmacologic GVHD prophylaxis; one patient received cord blood allograft. All patients had BKV viruria with a median BKV viral load of 9.3 log(10) copies/mL (range, 8.6C10.0) and median onset 18 days (range 6C41) post HCT. BKVN was diagnosed at a median of 275.5 days post-HCT (range, 141C637). All patients presented with decreased GFR (median 47.5% reduction, range 16C75%) from GFR at transplant. One patient had proteinuria (3 g over 24 hours); one patient had hydronephrosis. At BKVN diagnosis plasma BKV viral load was a median of 6.2 log(10) copies/mL; range, 6.0C6.3), absolute lymphocyte count median 1027 (range 335C2,536) and CD4+ lymphocyte count median 145 (range 64C172). CONCLUSION: (1) BKVN should be considered in HCT recipients with worsening renal function and high BKV viremia. (2) Early, noninvasive predictors of BKVN could aid in identifying high-risk patients for early intervention prior to irreversible loss of kidney function. (3) Reduction of immunosuppression is often not feasible in HCT. The role of preemptive antiviral therapy and/or adoptive cell therapy for BKV viremia in HCT should be evaluated in clinical trials.

The evolutionary distances are obtained through measuring the differences among the three-dimensional Z-curves. The Z-curve is approximately described by its geometric center and the associated three eigenvectors, which indicate the center position and the trend of the Z-curve, respectively. Although some information is lost due to the approximate description of the Z-curve, the phylogenetic tree constructed based on these parameters is consistent with those of previous analyses. The present method has the merits of simplicity and intuitiveness, but it is still in its premature stage.

All items were highlighted according to conventional scores corresponding to the different answers (yes/no) given by the child's parents. This system has been implemented with large diffusion of computer programs and applications by the availability of a computer station in every ED room. RESULTS The system allows healthcare workers to establish the medical check-up urgency which may be immediate, within the next 24 hours or scheduled in the pediatric ward. Therefore, it has been implemented a telephone triage consultation with a standardized method. CONCLUSIONS Telephone consultation during outbreaks, considering the risks of contagion, allows healthcare workers to decrease the concern of families and to reduce indiscriminate access to ED. The remote approach will not solve logistic and setting problems related to COVID-19 outbreak17, but it would be a valid tool to improve medical evaluation without deep change in infrastructure and clinical organization.","output":"Telephone consultation during Coronavirus outbreak in a Pediatric Emergency Department: methodological approach of a tertiary care center in a COVID-19 hospital setting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the United States, non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Hispanic, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native (NHAIAN) populations experience excess COVID-19 mortality, compared to the non-Hispanic White (NHW) population, but racial/ethnic differences in age at death are not known. The release of national COVID-19 death data by racial/ethnic group now permits analysis of age-specific mortality rates for these groups and the non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander (NHAPI) population. Our objectives were to examine variation in age-specific COVID-19 mortality rates by racial/ethnicity and to calculate the impact of this mortality using years of potential life lost (YPLL). METHODS AND FINDINGS: This cross-sectional study used the recently publicly available data on US COVID-19 deaths with reported race/ethnicity, for the time period February 1, 2020, to July 22, 2020. Population data were drawn from the US Census. As of July 22, 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths equaled 68,377 for NHW, 29,476 for NHB, 23,256 for Hispanic, 1,143 for NHAIAN, and 6,468 for NHAPI populations; the corresponding population sizes were 186.4 million, 40.6 million, 2.6 million, 19.5 million, and 57.7 million. Age-standardized rate ratios relative to NHW were 3.6 (95% CI 3.5, 3.8; p < 0.001) for NHB, 2.8 (95% CI 2.7, 3.0; p < 0.001) for Hispanic, 2.2 (95% CI 1.8, 2.6; p < 0.001) for NHAIAN, and 1.6 (95% CI 1.4, 1.7; p < 0.001) for NHAP populations. By contrast, NHB rate ratios relative to NHW were 7.1 (95% CI 5.8, 8.7; p < 0.001) for persons aged 25-34 years, 9.0 (95% CI 7.9, 10.2; p < 0.001) for persons aged 35-44 years, and 7.4 (95% CI 6.9, 7.9; p < 0.001) for persons aged 45-54 years. Even at older ages, NHB rate ratios were between 2.0 and 5.7. Similarly, rate ratios for the Hispanic versus NHW population were 7.0 (95% CI 5.8, 8.7; p < 0.001), 8.8 (95% CI 7.8, 9.9; p < 0.001), and 7.0 (95% CI 6.6, 7.5; p < 0.001) for the corresponding age strata above, with remaining rate ratios ranging from 1.4 to 5.0. Rate ratios for NHAIAN were similarly high through age 74 years. Among NHAPI persons, rate ratios ranged from 2.0 to 2.8 for persons aged 25-74 years and were 1.6 and 1.2 for persons aged 75-84 and 85+ years, respectively. As a consequence, more YPLL before age 65 were experienced by the NHB and Hispanic populations than the NHW population-despite the fact that the NHW population is larger-with a ratio of 4.6:1 and 3.2:1, respectively, for NHB and Hispanic persons. Study limitations include likely lag time in receipt of completed death certificates received by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for transmission to NCHS, with consequent lag in capturing the total number of deaths compared to data reported on state dashboards. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed racial variation in age-specific mortality rates not fully captured with examination of age-standardized rates alone. These findings suggest the importance of examining age-specific mortality rates and underscores how age standardization can obscure extreme variations within age strata. To avoid overlooking such variation, data that permit age-specific analyses should be routinely publicly available.","output":"Variation in racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 mortality by age in the United States: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Though COVID vaccines have been available since December 2020, the rate at which they are administered remains slow, and in the meantime the pandemic continues to claim about as many lives every day as the 9/11 tragedy.

Pharmacologically induced autophagy with rapamycin increased the expression of PDCoV N, while pharmacologically inhibited autophagy with wortmannin decreased the expression of PDCoV N, suggesting that PDCoV-induced autophagy facilitates virus replication. Further experiments showed that PDCoV infection activated p38 signaling pathway to trigger autophagy. Besides, ergosterol peroxide (EP) alleviated PDCoV-induced activation of p38 to suppress autophagy, thus exerting its antiviral effects. Finally, we employed a piglet model of PDCoV infection to demonstrate that EP prevented PDCoV infection by suppressing PDCoV-induced autophagy via p38 signaling pathway in vivo. Collectively, these findings accelerate the understanding of the pathogenesis of PDCoV infection and provide new insights for the development of EP as an effective therapeutic strategy for PDCoV.","output":"Ergosterol peroxide suppresses porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV)-induced autophagy to inhibit virus replication via p38 signaling pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Consumer-based physical activity trackers have increased in popularity. The widespread use of these devices and the long-term nature of the recorded data provides a valuable source of physical activity data for epidemiological research. The challenges include the large heterogeneity between activity tracker models in terms of available data types, the accuracy of recorded data, and how this data can be shared between different providers and third-party systems. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop a system to record data on physical activity from different providers of consumer-based activity trackers and to examine its usability as a tool for physical activity monitoring in epidemiological research. The longitudinal nature of the data and the concurrent pandemic outbreak allowed us to show how the system can be used for surveillance of physical activity levels before, during, and after a COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: We developed a system (mSpider) for automatic recording of data on physical activity from participants wearing activity trackers from Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Oura, Polar, Samsung, and Withings, as well as trackers storing data in Google Fit and Apple Health. To test the system throughout development, we recruited 35 volunteers to wear a provided activity tracker from early 2019 and onward. In addition, we recruited 113 participants with privately owned activity trackers worn before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown in Norway. We examined monthly changes in the number of steps, minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and activity energy expenditure between 2019 and 2020 using bar plots and two-sided paired sample t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Compared to March 2019, there was a significant reduction in mean step count and mean activity energy expenditure during the March 2020 lockdown period. The reduction in steps and activity energy expenditure was temporary, and the following monthly comparisons showed no significant change between 2019 and 2020. A small significant increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was observed for several monthly comparisons after the lockdown period and when comparing March-December 2019 with March-December 2020.

Anecdotally, patient perspectives on telemedicine differ widely, with variation in whether patients feel remote consultations are beneficial. By means of a patient-driven survey, we aimed to formally evaluate patient perspectives on its benefits and pitfalls, focusing on patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Methods: An e-survey was developed by two patient representatives on the BritPACT steering committee, with a view to determining unmet needs and the perceived impact on clinical care of virtual consultations amongst patients with PsA. Results: 128 patients responded to the e-survey. 109 patients rated the effectiveness of their telemedicine appointment and, of these, 18% felt their virtual consultation was very/extremely effective compared to a face-to-face consultation and 49% felt it was somewhat/equally as effective;furthermore, 48% (51/107) felt that such virtual consultations would be of benefit to them after the pandemic. 36% of respondents felt their virtual consultation was not as effective as a face-to-face review. Themes identified from open-ended questions included the lack of visual cues, lack of physical examination and effect on rapport and ease of open communication as the main pitfalls of virtual consultations. Patients with well-controlled symptoms appeared more satisfied with remote reviews compared to those with active disease, though on the whole respondents recognised the benefits, such as saving travel time and costs. Those who had an established relationship with their health professional appeared less concerned regarding virtual consultations though a recurring view was that newly diagnosed patients should have face-to-face appointments to build rapport and improve symptom control at an early stage. Conclusions: Overall patients perspectives on virtual consultations varied widely though patients with well-controlled symptoms and those who had a previously established relationship with their healthcare professionals and well-controlled disease appeared more satisfied with remote reviews. Patient-driven surveys may improve our true understanding of patients perspectives by improving engagement and honesty compared to surveys constructed by healthcare providers.","output":"Patients Perspectives of Telemedicine Appointments for Psoriatic Arthritis During The COVID-19 Pandemic: Results of a Patient-Driven Pilot Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic in early 2020.

Evidence-informed interventions that can be rapidly implemented under pandemic conditions to support mental health during such times are urgently needed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the acceptability and preliminary outcomes of a daily online mental health promotion program for tertiary education staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Victoria University (VU) Elevenses program was delivered as an uncontrolled intervention at Victoria University (VU) in the western metropolitan region of Melbourne, Australia. In April 2020, an email invitation was sent to all academic and professional staff inviting them to: (1) participate in the program and (2) opt-in to the research component. The VU Elevenses program provided 10-15Cminute microinterventions comprising lifestyle and well-being strategies to promote mental health via an online meeting platform at 11 AM each weekday. A mixed methods approach was used to evaluate the program, combining structured questionnaires with semistructured interviews to investigate the experiences of staff who participated in the program. RESULTS: Between 16 and 90 participants provided weekly program feedback. A total of 106 university staff opted into the longitudinal research component and 10 staff participated in the interviews. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with sessions and perceived benefits for mental health. Approximately one quarter of participants reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress at baseline, with significant reductions in these symptoms in the first 7 weeks of the program, corresponding with easing in mandatory isolation (lockdown) restrictions. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress all increased when lockdown measures were reintroduced, but not to the same levels as found during the initial lockdown period. Overall changes in depression and anxiety from baseline to the end of the program were explained by changes in COVID-19Crelated distress, whereas changes in self-compassion explained changes in stress. CONCLUSIONS: We show that it is feasible and acceptable to develop and deliver a program of brief interventions in a timely manner, using a simple and accessible online platform. Although participation in the program was initially associated with reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, participants mental health worsened with the reintroduction of a lockdown period. However, as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress did not return to levels observed at the start of the VU Elevenses program, participation in the uncontrolled intervention may have offered a protective benefit against the impact of the second significant lockdown period.","output":"A Brief, Daily, Online Mental Health and Well-being Intervention for University Staff During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Program Description and Outcomes Using a Mixed Methods Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emotional eating is associated with a number of negative outcomes in children and adolescents, including higher levels of loss of control eating (i.e., the inability to control the amount of food consumed).

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the convergent and discriminant validity of the 10-item Emotional Eating Scale Adapted for Children and Adolescents (EES-C) Short-Form in a community sample of adolescents. We also sought to assess the reliability and structural validity of this measure. METHODS: Participants were 128 adolescents ages 13 to 19 years (mean age = 15.10 years; SD = 2.09; 53.9% female). Most participants fell within the healthy BMI range (58.6%). Participants completed the EES-C Short-Form, the loss of control eating section of the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns-Adolescent Version 5, the Gratitude Questionnaire-Six-Item Form, and a demographic questionnaire. RESULTS: Convergent validity of the EES-C Short-Form was supported in that adolescents who endorsed loss of control eating reported significantly greater levels of emotional eating (mean = 24.37; SD = 8.94) compared to adolescents who did not endorse loss of control eating (mean = 19.42; SD = 7.33; p &#8804; .01; d = 0.61).

Among younger participants (18 to 35 years old), a significant decrease in weekly alcohol consumption was found during COVID-19 lockdown, which was not significant in older individuals. For the younger age cohort (18 to 35 years old), increased stress significantly correlated to increased weekly alcohol consumption (r = 0.163, p = 0.003), which in turn, correlated significantly to reporting a poorer perceived immune fitness (r = ?0.165, p = 0.002).

We hypothesized that patients with primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after lung transplantation would have higher RAGE levels in plasma than patients without PGD. OBJECTIVES To test the association of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) levels with PGD in a prospective, multicenter cohort study. METHODS We measured plasma levels of sRAGE at 6 and 24 hours after allograft reperfusion in 317 lung transplant recipients at seven centers. The primary outcome was grade 3 PGD (Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)) < 200 with alveolar infiltrates) within the first 72 hours after transplantation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patients who developed PGD had higher levels of sRAGE than patients without PGD at both 6 hours (median 9.3 ng/ml vs. 7.5 ng/ml, respectively; P = 0.028) and at 24 hours post-transplantation (median 4.3 ng/ml vs. 1.9 ng/ml, respectively; P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that the relationship between levels of sRAGE and PGD was attenuated by elevated right heart pressures and by the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Median sRAGE levels were higher in subjects with cardiopulmonary bypass at both 6 hours (P = 0.003) and 24 hours (P < 0.001). sRAGE levels at 6 hours were significantly associated with intraoperative red cell transfusion (Spearman's rho = 0.39, P = 0.002 in those with PGD), and in multivariable linear regression analyses this association was independent of confounding variables (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Elevated plasma levels of sRAGE are associated with PGD after lung transplantation.

Outcomes of ICU and non-ICU patients were compared, and a simple nomogram for predicting the probability of ICU transfer after hospital admission was developed based on initial laboratory data using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Differences in laboratory indices were observed between patients admitted to the ICU and those who were not admitted.

Whether it had any impact on coronary angiography (CA) volume or on mechanical support device use for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and post-STEMI mechanical complications in Canada is unknown. Methods: We administered a Canada-wide survey to all Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Directors seeking the volume of CA for STEMI performed during 01/03/2020-31/05/2020 (pandemic period) and from two control periods (01/03/2019-31/05/2019 and 01/03/2018-31/05/2018). The number of left ventricular support devices used, as well as the number of ventricular septal defects or papillary muscle rupture cases diagnosed, were also recorded. We also assessed if the number of COVID-19 cases recorded in each province was associated with STEMI CA volume. Results: Forty-one out of 42 Canadian catheterization laboratories (98%) provided data. There was a modest but statistically significant 16% reduction (Incidence Rate Ratio or IRR 0.84; 95%CI 0.80-0.87) in CA for STEMI during the first wave of the pandemic compared to control periods. IRR was not associated with provincial COVID-19 caseload. We observed a 26% reduction (IRR 0.74; 95%CI 0.61-0.89) in the use of intra-aortic balloon pump in STEMI. Use of Impella? and mechanical complications from STEMI were exceedingly rare. Conclusion: We observed a modest 16% decrease in CA for STEMI during the pandemic first wave in Canada, lower than reported in other countries.

Methods: We collated numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths among patients who were receiving routine treatment for HD at six centres across Brazil (Belem, Bauru, Brasilia, Vitoria, Petrolina, Palmas) between 1st March and 10th December 2020. Results: Of 1,333 HD patients receiving treatment, 70 (5.2%) reported having had COVID-19. Almost all patients (97% (1,296/1,333)) including all but one of the COVID-19 cases were receiving MDT comprising rifampicin (600mg once per month), dapsone (100mg daily), and clofazimine (50 mg daily plus 300 mg once per month). Four patients died, including a patient in their 30's on MDT who had a severe type 2 HD reaction (erythema nodosum leprosum) and who was taking clofazimine 100mg daily.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 613 patients hospitalized (integrated health system involving three hospitals) for RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection between March 1, 2020 and April 25, 2020. Intervention was treatment with HCQ-AZM in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Outcomes of interest were in-hospital all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, non-lethal arrhythmias, and length of hospital stay. Secondary measures included in-hospital corrected QT (QTc) interval parameters and serum biomarkers levels. RESULTS: Propensity-matched groups were composed of 173 patients given HCQ-AZM and 173 matched patients who did not receive treatment. There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-2.89; p = 0.2), PEA arrest (OR 1.68, CI 0.68-4.15; p = 0.27), or incidence of non-lethal arrhythmias (10.4% vs. 6.8%; p = 0.28).

Older adults, including people with dementia, want to live independently and feel in control of their lives for as long as possible. Assistive technologies powered by artificial intelligence and internet of things devices are being proposed to provide living environments that support the users safety, psychological, and medical needs through remote monitoring and interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the functional, psychosocial, and environmental needs of people living with dementia, their caregivers, clinicians, and health and social care service providers toward the design and implementation of smart home systems. METHODS: We used an iterative user-centered design approach comprising 9 substudies. First, semistructured interviews (9 people with dementia, 9 caregivers, and 10 academic and clinical staff) and workshops (35 pairs of people with dementia and caregivers, and 12 health and social care clinicians) were conducted to define the needs of people with dementia, home caregivers, and professional stakeholders in both daily activities and technology-specific interactions. Then, the spectrum of needs identified was represented via patientCcaregiver personas and discussed with stakeholders in a workshop (14 occupational therapists; 4 National Health Service pathway directors; and 6 researchers in occupational therapy, neuropsychiatry, and engineering) and 2 focus groups with managers of health care services (n=8), eliciting opportunities for innovative care technologies and public health strategies. Finally, these design opportunities were discussed in semistructured interviews with participants of a smart home trial involving environmental sensors, physiological measurement devices, smartwatches, and tablet-based chatbots and cognitive assessment puzzles (10 caregivers and 2 people with dementia). A thematic analysis revealed factors that motivate household members to use these technologies. RESULTS: Outcomes of these activities include a qualitative and quantitative analysis of patient, caregiver, and clinician needs and the identification of challenges and opportunities for the design and implementation of remote monitoring systems in public health pathways.

However, when the virus enters the body it also interacts with the micro-organisms already inhabiting the host. Understanding the virus-host-microbiome interactions can yield additional insights into the biological processes perturbed by viral invasion. Alterations in the gut microbiome species and metabolites have been noted during respiratory viral infections, possibly impacting the lungs via gut-lung microbiome crosstalk. To better characterize microbial functions in the lower respiratory tract during COVID-19 infection, we carry out a functional analysis of previously published metatranscriptome sequencing data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from eight COVID-19 cases, twenty-five community-acquired pneumonia patients, and twenty healthy controls. The functional profiles resulting from comparing the sequences against annotated microbial protein domains clearly separate the cohorts. By examining the associated metabolic pathways, distinguishing functional signatures in COVID-19 respiratory tract microbiomes are identified, including decreased potential for lipid metabolism and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism pathways, and increased potential for carbohydrate metabolism pathways. The results include overlap between previous studies on COVID-19 microbiomes, including decrease in the glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway and increase in carbohydrate metabolism.

Methods All the outpatient clinical activities during the 4 weeks following the national lockdown (March 9-April 3, 2020) in the Department of Urology of the Trento Province, Italy, were reviewed and categorized. Expert staff members examined the electronic records, selecting whether the clinic appointments should be canceled or confirmed (via telephone consultation or face-to-face visit). The rate, indication, and modality of visits were investigated. Results Overall, 415 of 928 (45%) scheduled patients canceled their clinic appointment themselves or were canceled by staff members without rescheduling. The remaining 523 (55%) cases were screened undergoing telephone consultation in 295 (56%) and face-to-face visit in 228 (44%). The rate of face-to-face visit decreased from 63% to 9% during week 1 and 4, respectively. Seventy-four percent of face-to-face visits regarded suspected recurrent or new onset malignancy or potentially dangerous clinical conditions (severe urinary symptoms or complicated urinary stones or infection). The median age of patients in the face-to-face and telephone groups was 59 (range 20-69) and 65 years old (range 37-88), respectively. Conclusion A pandemic is a dynamic scenario, requiring reorganization and flexibility of the healthcare delivery. Forty-five percent visits were canceled without rescheduling. Although a minimum portion of face-to-face visit (<10% 1 month after the lockdown) was preserved mostly for suspected malignancy or potentially life-threatening conditions, telemedicine proved a pragmatic approach allowing efficient screening of cases and adequate protection for patients and clinicians.","output":"Teleurology in the Time of Covid-19 Pandemic: Here to Stay?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Testing individuals for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen of COVID-19, is critical for mitigating and containing COVID-19. Many countries are implementing group testing strategies against COVID-19 to improve testing capacity and efficiency while saving required workloads and consumables. A group of individuals nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swab samples is mixed to conduct one test. However, existing group testing methods neglect the fact that mixing samples usually leads to substantial dilution of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) of SARS-CoV-2, which seriously impacts the sensitivity of tests. In this paper, we aim to screen individuals infected with COVID-19 with as few tests as possible, under the premise that the sensitivity of tests is high enough. To achieve this goal, we propose an Adaptive Group Testing (AdaGT) method. By collecting information on the number of positive and negative samples that have been identified during the screening process, the AdaGT method can estimate the ratio of positive samples in real-time. Based on this ratio, the AdaGT algorithm adjusts its testing strategy adaptively between an individual testing strategy and a group testing strategy. The group size of the group testing strategy is carefully selected to guarantee that the sensitivity of each test is higher than a predetermined threshold and that this group contains at most one positive sample on average. Theoretical performance analysis on the AdaGT algorithm is provided and then validated in experiments. Experimental results also show that the AdaGT algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of efficiency and sensitivity. Note to PractitionersReal-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests provide scope for automation and are one of the most widely used laboratory methods for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This paper is motivated by the following challenges: (1) Many countries are experiencing an acute shortage of professionals and consumables for conducting rRT-PCR tests;(2) Group sizes of existing group testing methods against COVID-19 may not be optimal, which adversely impacts the efficiency of the screening of the SARS-CoV-2 virus;(3) Existing group testing methods do not consider the fact that the sensitivity of rRT-PCR tests usually decreases with the group size. The objective of this paper is to improve the efficiency and sensitivity of large-scale screening against COVID-19. For achieving this goal, we propose an Adaptive Group Testing (AdaGT) algorithm, which has the following advantages: (1) It can improve the efficiency for screening the SARS-CoV-2 virus, mainly by adaptively adjusting its testing strategy between an individual testing strategy and a group testing strategy based upon an estimated ratio of positive samples during the screening process;(2) It can guarantee a high sensitivity of the rRT-PCR tests by determining the group sizes of the group testing strategy based upon some constraints;(3) We derive an appropriate threshold for the estimated ratio of positive samples such that the AdaGT algorithm can achieve a minimum average number of rRT-PCR tests and can be directly employed in practical applications.

In this prospective observational study, we evaluated the ability of long PP sessions to improve oxygenation in awake ICU patients with moderate or severe ARDS due to COVID-19. METHODS: The study was approved by the ethics committee of Galicia (code No. 2020-188), and all patients provided informed consent. In this case series, awake patients with moderate or severe ARDS by COVID-19 admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at University Hospital of Santiago from March 21 to April 5, 2020 were prospectively analyzed. Patients were instructed to remain in PP as long as possible, until the patient felt too tired to maintain that position. Light sedation was administered with dexmedetomidine. The following information were collected: number and duration of PP sessions, StO2 and blood gases before, during and following a PP session, need of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU admission and ICU outcome. Linear mixed effects models (LMM) were fit to estimate changes from baseline with a random effect for patient. RESULTS: Seven patients with moderate or severe ARDS by COVID 19 were included. All patients received at least one PP session. A total of 16 PP sessions were performed in the 7 patients during the period study. The median duration of PP sessions was 10 hours. Dexmedetomidine was used in all PP sessions. Oxygenation increased in all sixteen sessions performed in the seven patients. The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) significantly increased during PP (change from baseline and CI 97.5%: 110 [19; 202]) and after PP, albeit not significantly (change from baseline and CI 97.5%: 38 [-9.2; 85]) compared with previous supine position. Similarly, tissue oxygenation underwent a small improvement during PP (change from baseline and CI 97.5%: 2.6% [0.69; 4.6]) without significant changes after PP. Two patients required intubation. All patients were discharged from the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: We found that PP improved oxygenation in ICU patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS.

The scarce evidence published to date suggests that perinatal mental health has deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the few studies published so far have some limitations, such as a cross-sectional design and the omission of important factors for the understanding of perinatal mental health, including governmental restriction measures and healthcare practices implemented at the maternity hospitals. Within the Riseup-PPD COST Action, a study is underway to assess the impact of COVID-19 in perinatal mental health. The primary objectives are to (1) evaluate changes in perinatal mental health outcomes; and (2) determine the risk and protective factors for perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we will compare the results between the countries participating in the study. METHODS: This is an international prospective cohort study, with a baseline and three follow-up assessments over a six-month period. It is being carried out in 11 European countries (Albania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Israel, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom), Argentina, Brazil and Chile. The sample consists of adult pregnant and postpartum women (with infants up to 6 months of age). The assessment includes measures on COVID-19 epidemiology and public health measures (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker dataset), Coronavirus Perinatal Experiences (COPE questionnaires), psychological distress (BSI-18), depression (EPDS), anxiety (GAD-7) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSD checklist for DSM-V). DISCUSSION: This study will provide important information for understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health and well-being, including the identification of potential risk and protective factors by implementing predictive models using machine learning techniques. The findings will help policymakers develop suitable guidelines and prevention strategies for perinatal mental health and contribute to designing tailored mental health interventions.

However, few studies have compared these tools in a multiple trauma cohort and investigated the influence of nighttime admission on the performance of these tools. This retrospective study was aimed at evaluating and comparing the performance of MEWS, NEWS, SEWS, mREMS, and RTS for identifying the mortality risk and trauma severity of patients with multiple trauma admitted to the ED during the daytime and nighttime. Retrospective data were collected from the medical records of patients with multiple trauma admitted in the daytime or nighttime to calculate scores for each triage tool. Logistic regression analysis was conducted on each triage tool for identifying in-hospital mortality and severe trauma (injury severity score > 15) in the daytime and nighttime. The performance of the tools was evaluated and compared by calculating area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the retrospective logistic model of each tool. We collected data for 1,818 admissions, including 1,070 daytime and 748 nighttime admissions. A comparison of performance for identifying in-hospital mortality between daytime and nighttime yielded the following results (AUROC): MEWS (0.95 vs. 0.93, p = 0.384), NEWS (0.95 vs. 0.94, p = 0.708), SEWS (0.95 vs. 0.94, p = 0.683), mREMS (0.94 vs. 0.92, p = 0.286), and RTS (0.93 vs. 0.93, p = 0.87).

The intrinsic catalytic activity of BMCs combined with outstanding electron transfer ability of conductive polymer enables the nanosensors to sensitively and selectively detect various biomolecules. Further application of sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine functionalized nanosensors achieves real-time electrochemical monitoring of intracellular glutathione levels and its redox homeostasis in single living cells for the first time.","output":"Versatile Construction of Biomimetic Nanosensors for Electrochemical Monitoring of Intracellular Glutathione."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim was to determine how the learning about protective factors from previous pandemics was implemented and the impact of this on nurses experience. METHODS: Secondary data analysis of semistructured interview transcripts exploring the barriers and facilitators to changes implemented to support the surge of COVID-19 related admissions in wave 1 of the pandemic. Participants represented three-levels of leadership: whole hospital (n=17), division (n=7), ward/department-level (n=8) and individual nurses (n=16). Interviews were analysed using framework analysis. RESULTS: Key changes that were implemented in wave 1 reported at whole hospital level included: a new acute staffing level, redeploying nurses, increasing the visibility of nursing leadership, new staff well-being initiatives, new roles created to support families and various training initiatives. Two main themes emerged from the interviews at division, ward/department and individual nurse level: impact of leadership and impact on the delivery of nursing care. CONCLUSIONS: Leadership through a crisis is essential for the protective effect of nurses emotional well-being. While nursing leadership was made more visible during wave 1 of the pandemic and processes were in place to increase communication, system-level challenges resulting in negative experiences existed. By identifying these challenges, it has been possible to overcome them during wave 2 by employing different leadership styles to support nurse's well-being. Challenges and distress that nurses experience when making moral decisions requires support beyond the pandemic for nurses well-being. Learning from the pandemic about the impact of leadership in a crisis is important to facilitate recovery and lessen the impact in further outbreaks.","output":"Impact of leadership on the nursing workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eukaryotic mRNAs are 5 end capped with a 7-methylguanosine, which is important for processing and translation of mRNAs. Cap methyltransferase 1 (CMTR1) catalyzes 2-O-ribose methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide (N1 2-O-Me) to mask mRNAs from innate immune surveillance by retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I). Nevertheless, whether this modification regulates gene expression for neuronal functions remains unexplored. Here, we find that knockdown of CMTR1 impairs dendrite development independent of secretory cytokines and RIG-I signaling. Using transcriptomic analyses, we identify altered gene expression related to dendrite morphogenesis instead of RIG-I-activated interferon signaling, such as decreased calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (Camk2). In line with these molecular changes, dendritic complexity in CMTR1-insufficient neurons is rescued by ectopic expression of CaMK2 but not by inactivation of RIG-I signaling. We further generate brain-specific CMTR1-knockout mice to validate these findings in vivo. Our study reveals the indispensable role of CMTR1-catalyzed N1 2-O-Me in gene regulation for brain development.","output":"CMTR1-Catalyzed 2-O-Ribose Methylation Controls Neuronal Development by Regulating Camk2 Expression Independent of RIG-I Signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Lindemnisation des accidents mdicaux sans faute des professionnels ou des tablissements est prvue par larticle L.1142-1 du code de la sant publique cr par la loi du 4 mars 2002 relative aux droits des malades et  la qualit du systme de sant.

But many patients could decline the vaccine for several reasons including safety concerns. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the proportion of patients with RA who are favourable to COVID-19 vaccination, to know the reasons to decline and to analyse the characteristics of these patients. Methods: We included patients with RA from the UCLouvain Brussels cohort who met the ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria. A simple and standard questionnaire was distributed to patients who attended rheumatology out patient and day care clinic from 14 december 20 to 14 januari 21. All patient and RA characteristics (Age, gender, education, smoking habits, disease duration, ACPA, RF, DAS28-CRP, HAQ and therapies) were collected at the same time. Results: Data from 460 eligible RA patients were analyzed. The average age of the population is 58.21 years. 72% of the patients are women. 21% are smokers and 65% are positive for anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) with a mean DAS28-CRP of 2.39 and a mean HAQ of 0.821. 281 patients (61%) indicated they would receive the vaccine as soon as it is available. For the 179 patients (39%) who decline, the reasons for not having vaccine were no trust in the vaccine at this time (53%), fear of side effects (28%), opposition to vaccine (4%), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (2%) and unknown (5%), Interestingly, there were differences among RA patients not willing to receive the vaccine. Patient under the age of 50, women, low education grade, smokers, presence of RF/ACPA and treatment with a bioDMARD were less willing to receive the vaccine. No differences were observed for RA disease duration, HAQ and DAS28-CRP (see Table 1). Conclusion: In our RA cohort, the rates of willingness to receive the vaccine are promising.

Enabling clinicians to set up remote patient ECG monitoring easily and determining how to classify the ECG signals accurately so relevant alerts are sent in a timely fashion is an urgent problem to be addressed for remote patient monitoring (RPM) to be adopted widely. Hence, a new technique is required to enable routine and widespread use of RPM, as is needed due to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this research is to create a robust and easy-to-use solution for personalized ECG monitoring in real-world settings that is precise, easily configurable, and understandable by clinicians. METHODS: In this paper, we propose a Personalized Monitoring Model (PMM) for ECG data based on motif discovery. Motif discovery finds meaningful or frequently recurring patterns in patient ECG readings. The main strategy is to use motif discovery to extract a small sample of personalized motifs for each individual patient and then use these motifs to predict abnormalities in real-time readings of that patient using an artificial logical network configured by a physician. RESULTS: Our approach was tested on 30 minutes of ECG readings from 32 patients. The average diagnostic accuracy of the PMM was always above 90% and reached 100% for some parameters, compared to 80% accuracy for the Generalized Monitoring Models (GMM). Regardless of parameter settings, PMM training models were generated within 3-4 minutes, compared to 1 hour (or longer, with increasing amounts of training data) for the GMM. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed PMM almost eliminates many of the training and small sample issues associated with GMMs. It also addresses accuracy and computational cost issues of the GMM, caused by the uniqueness of heartbeats and training issues. In addition, it addresses the fact that doctors and nurses typically do not have data science training and the skills needed to configure, understand, and even trust existing black box machine learning models.","output":"Personalized Monitoring Model for Electrocardiogram Signals: Diagnostic Accuracy Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Closure of the duodenal stump using a stapling device is commonly applied in Roux-en-Y reconstruction after gastrectomy. However, serious and possibly fatal duodenal stump perforation can develop in extremely rare cases.

A 79-year-old man with a long history of diabetes and hypertension was admitted to our institution with epigastralgia and right hypochondralgia. Computed tomography and an upper gastrointestinal imaging series revealed remarkable wall thickening of the gastric antrum and corpus. Upper endoscopy also showed a giant ulcerative lesion in the same area. The lesion was confirmed by histology to be poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent open subtotal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction. However, duodenal stump perforation occurred repeatedly on postoperative days 1, 3, and 19, which caused peritonitis. The patient was kept alive through duodenal stump repair, an additional resection using a stapling device, and repeated drainage treatments; but he suffered considerable morbidity due to these complications. We report a case of a life-threatening duodenal stump perforation after subtotal gastrectomy, highlighting lessons learned from the profile and clinical course.

OBJECTIVES: To present a model for rapid palliative care workforce expansion under crisis conditions, using supervised advanced psychiatry trainees to provide primary palliative services in the acute care and emergency setting. METHODS: In response to the New York City COVID-19 surge, advanced psychiatry trainees at New York-Presbyterian Columbia University Irving Medical Center were rapidly trained and redeployed to a newly formed psychiatry-palliative care liaison team. Under the supervision of consultation-liaison psychiatrists (who also served as team coordinators), these trainees provided circumscribed palliative care services to patients and/or their families, including goals-of-care discussions and psychosocial support. Palliative care attendings remained available to all team members for more advanced and specialized supervision. RESULTS: The psychiatry-palliative care liaison team effectively provided palliative care services during the early phase and peak of New York City's COVID-19 crisis, managing up to 16 new cases per day and provided longitudinal follow-up, thereby enabling palliative care specialists to focus on providing services requiring specialist-level palliative care expertise. CONCLUSION: By training and supervising psychiatrists and advanced psychiatry trainees in specific palliative care roles, palliative care teams could more effectively meet markedly increased service needs of varying complexity during the COVID-19 crisis.

According to the diagnostic criteria, three groups of patients with different subtypes of cytokine storm syndrome were identified: MAS, CRS or sepsis. In the MAS and CRS groups, treatment results were assessed depending on whether or not tocilizumab was used. Results: MAS was diagnosed in 9.1% of the patients examined, CRS in 81.8%, and sepsis in 9.1%.

Its impact on Milky Way (MW)-mass systems, however, remains comparatively unexplored. In this work, we use the Auriga simulations to probe the impact of AGN feedback on the dynamical and structural properties of galaxies, focussing on the bar, bulge, and disc. We analyse three galaxies -- two strongly and one unbarred/weakly barred -- using three setups: (i) the fiducial Auriga model, which includes both radio and quasar mode feedback, (ii) a setup with no radio mode, and (iii) one with neither the radio nor the quasar mode. When removing the radio mode, gas in the circumgalactic medium cools more efficiently and subsequently settles in an extended disc, with little effect on the inner disc. Contrary to previous studies, we find that although the removal of the quasar mode results in more massive central components, these are in the form of compact discs, rather than spheroidal bulges. Therefore, galaxies without quasar mode feedback are more baryon-dominated and thus prone to forming stronger and shorter bars, which reveals an anti-correlation between the ejective nature of AGN feedback and bar strength. Hence, we report that the effect of AGN feedback (i.e. ejective or preventive) can significantly alter the dynamical properties of MW-like galaxies. Therefore, the observed dynamical and structural properties of MW-mass galaxies can be used as additional constraints for calibrating the efficiency of AGN feedback models.","output":"The effects of AGN feedback on the structural and dynamical properties of Milky Way-mass galaxies in cosmological simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review covers the hard to heal wounds which appear frequently and require a complex time-consuming and resource-demanding treatment.

Although intestinal IR has been studied extensively in animals, results remain inconclusive and data on human intestinal IR are scarce. Therefore, an experimental harmless model for human intestinal IR was developed, enabling us to clarify the sequelae of human intestinal IR for the first time. METHODS AND FINDINGS In 30 patients undergoing pancreatico-duodenectomy we took advantage of the fact that in this procedure a variable length of jejunum is removed. Isolated jejunum (5 cm) was subjected to 30 minutes ischemia followed by reperfusion. Intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein (I-FABP) arteriovenous concentration differences across the bowel segment were measured before and after ischemia to assess epithelial cell damage. Tissue sections were collected after ischemia and at 25, 60 and 120 minutes reperfusion and stained with H&E, and for I-FABP and the apoptosis marker M30. Bonferroni's test was used to compare I-FABP differences. Mean (SEM) arteriovenous concentration gradients of I-FABP across the jejunum revealed rapidly developing epithelial cell damage. I-FABP release significantly increased from 290 (46) pg/ml before ischemia towards 3,997 (554) pg/ml immediately after ischemia (p<0.001) and declined gradually to 1,143 (237) pg/ml within 1 hour reperfusion (p<0.001). Directly after ischemia the intestinal epithelial lining was microscopically normal, while subepithelial spaces appeared at the villus tip. However, after 25 minutes reperfusion, enterocyte M30 immunostaining was observed at the villus tip accompanied by shedding of mature enterocytes into the lumen and loss of I-FABP staining. Interestingly, within 60 minutes reperfusion the epithelial barrier resealed, while debris of apoptotic, shedded epithelial cells was observed in the lumen. At the same time, M30 immunoreactivity was absent in intact epithelial lining. CONCLUSIONS This is the first human study to clarify intestinal IR induced cell damage and repair and its direct consequences. It reveals a unique, endogenous clearing mechanism for injured enterocytes: rapid detachment of damaged apoptotic enterocytes into the lumen. This process is followed by repair of the epithelial continuity within an hour, resulting in a normal epithelial lining.","output":"Rapid reversal of human intestinal ischemia-reperfusion induced damage by shedding of injured enterocytes and reepithelialisation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To compare the inactivation rates of male\\\\specific bacteriophage\\\\2 (MS2), hepatitis A HM\\\\175/18f (HM\\\\175) and reovirus T1 Lang (T1 L) during alkaline stabilization of wastewater residues.

Stabilization was performed in triplicate at 28 and 4C for both viral combinations. During stabilization at 28 and 4C, MS2 and T1 L concentrations were similar at each time point (t = 01, 2, 12 and 24 h). MS2 and HM\\\\175 concentrations were also similar at each time point during stabilization at 28C. At 4C, MS2 and HM\\\\175 concentrations were not similar at the first two time points (t = 01 and 2 h), but were similar at later time points (t = 12 and 24 h). Conclusions: The inactivation rates of T1 L at 4C and both T1 L and HM\\\\175 at 28C were similar to the inactivation rate of MS2 at all time points. At 4C, MS2 was inactivated at a faster rate during the first two time points (t = 01 and 2 h) than HM\\\\175, but was inactivated similarly at later time points (t = 12 and 24 h). Significance and Impact of the Study: Phages, such as MS2, would be ideal indicators for the presence of enteric viruses in wastewater residues because of their ubiquity, nonpathogenic nature, low cost and time associated with their detection. The findings of this study suggest that MS2 could serve as an indicator for monitoring the persistence of enteric viruses, such as HM\\\\175 and T1 L, during alkaline stabilization performed at moderate temperatures (28C), but may not serve as an indicator for HM\\\\175 at reduced temperature (4C). The utility of MS2 as an indicator of viral persistence during biosolids treatment should be further evaluated, as the increased efficiency and frequency of pathogen monitoring associated with their use may reduce the potential public health risk associated with biosolids, facilitating a greater acceptance for their land application.","output":"Inactivation of hepatitis A HM\\\\175/18f, reovirus T1 Lang and MS2 during alkaline stabilization of human biosolids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple studies have reported a high prevalence of mental health problems among male and female physicians.

ResultsAs many as 40,640 reproductive age women hospitalized for COVID-19 were identified: 3,372 were pregnant, 794 were puerperal, and 36,474 were neither pregnant nor puerperal. Groups were significantly different in terms of demographic data and comorbidities. Pregnant and puerperal women were less likely to be symptomatic than the women who were neither one nor the other. Pregnant women, however, had a higher frequency of cough, anosmia, and ageusia. Puerperal women had a worse prognosis than pregnant women with respect to admission to the ICU, invasive ventilatory support, and death. ConclusionPuerperal women were at a higher risk for serious outcomes (need for the ICU, need for invasive and noninvasive ventilatory support, and death) than pregnant women.","output":"COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized puerperal, pregnant, and neither pregnant nor puerperal women: a population study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: It is unclear whether and to what extent COVID-19 infection poses health risks and a chronic impairment of performance in athletes.

This study aimed to compare outcomes following laparoscopic versus open gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma at a Western center. METHODS Eighty-seven consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy from November 2005 to April 2013 were compared with 87 patients undergoing open resection during the same time period. Patients were matched for age, stage, body mass index, and procedure (distal subtotal vs. total gastrectomy). Endpoints were short- and long-term perioperative outcomes. RESULTS Overall, 65 patients (37 %) had locally advanced disease, and 40 (23 %) had proximal tumors. The laparoscopic approach was associated with longer operative time (median 240 vs.165 min; p < 0.01), less blood loss (100 vs.150 mL; p < 0.01), higher rate of microscopic margin positivity (9 vs.1 %; p = 0.04), decreased duration of narcotic and epidural use (2 vs. 4 days, p = 0.04, and 3 vs. 4 days, p = 0.02, respectively), decreased minor complications in the early (27 vs. 16 %) and late (17 vs. 7 %) postoperative periods (p < 0.01), decreased length of stay (5 vs. 7 days; p = 0.01), and increased likelihood of receiving adjuvant therapy (82 vs. 51 %; p < 0.01).

A safe, effective vaccine is urgently needed and remains a global health priority. Subunit vaccines are used successfully against other viruses when administered in the presence of an effective adjuvant. METHODS: We evaluated three different clinically tested adjuvant systems in combination with the SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion stabilized (S-2P) spike protein using a one-dose regimen in mice. FINDINGS: Whilst spike protein alone was only weakly immunogenic, the addition of either Aluminum hydroxide, a squalene based oil-in-water emulsion system (SE) or a cationic liposome-based adjuvant significantly enhanced antibody responses against the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). Kinetics of antibody responses differed, with SE providing the most rapid response. Neutralizing antibodies developed after a single immunization in all adjuvanted groups with ID(50) titers ranging from 86C4063. Spike-specific CD4 T helper responses were also elicited, comprising mainly of IFN- and IL-17 producing cells in the cationic liposome adjuvanted group, and more IL-5- and IL-10-secreting cells in the AH group. INTERPRETATION: These results demonstrate that adjuvanted spike protein subunit vaccine is a viable strategy for rapidly eliciting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and CD4 T cell responses of various qualities depending on the adjuvant used, which can be explored in further vaccine development against COVID-19.

A shortage of face masks and respirators has been widely reported across the world. A concerted effort to manufacture high volumes has not unsurprisingly put pressure on the supply chain and the important certification processes. PPE procured or donated as uncertified stock requires rigorous, expedient and scientifically informed evidence before decisions can be made regarding suitable deployment, expensive certification, return or possible destruction of stock. This paper reports a series of experiments devised in reaction to this situation. In this study, an experimental methodology for the assessment of the filtration performance of samples of real-world, uncertified, fluid resistant surgical masks (FRSM type IIR) was evaluated in the resource limited (lockdown) environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. A steady-state flow rig was adapted to incorporate a bespoke filter flow chamber for mounting face masks in order to evaluate the resistance to air flow as an indicator of mask inhalation performance. Pure air was drawn through a specified control surface area at known flow rate conditions; the resistance to the air flow through the masks was measured as the resulting pressure drop. Over 60 tests were performed from 4 different, randomly sampled batches and compared to a control sample of EN Type IIR certified FRSM masks. Steady-state volumetric airflow rates of 30 and 95 lmin-1 were chosen to represent deep breathing and vigorous exercise conditions respectively. The results showed that the sample masks produced a pressure drop of between 26% to 58% compared to the control batch at the lower flow rate and 22% to 55% at the higher rate. The results for each sample were consistent across both flow rates. Within the group of masks tested, two sets (between 48% and 58% of the reference set) showed the potential to be professionally assessed for appropriate deployment in a suitable setting. Although the absolute values of pressure drop measured by this method are unlikely to correlate with other testing approaches, the observed, indicative trends and relative performance of the masks is key to this approach. Critically, this method does not replace certification but it has enabled a public body to quickly make decisions; certify, re-assign, refund, thus saving time and resources. The total time spent conducting the tests was less than 8 hours and the low cost method proposed can be repurposed for low resource regions.","output":"Can we use these masks?

However, currently Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend serological testing either before or after vaccination to assess immune status. Given the 27% occurrence of breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated (FV) group with many being asymptomatics and still a larger fraction of the general mass remaining unvaccinated, the relaxed mask mandate and distancing by CDC can drive resurgence. Thus, we believe it is a key time to focus on asymptomatics (no symptoms) and oligosymptomatics (so mild that the symptoms remain unrecognized) as they can be silent reservoirs to propagate the infection.

We explore and discuss the potential of sequencing and other effective tools to geographically trace rickettsial disease agents, and develop control strategies to better mitigate the rickettsioses.","output":"A Brief History of the Major Rickettsioses in the AsiaCAustraliaCPacific Region: A Capstone Review for the Special Issue of TMID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging health concern due to its high mortality rate of 35%. At present, no vaccine is available to protect against MERS-CoV infections. Therefore, an in silico search for potential antigenic epitopes in the non-redundant proteome of MERS-CoV was performed herein. First, a subtractive proteome-based approach was employed to look for the surface exposed and host non-homologous proteins. Following, immunoinformatics analysis was performed to predict antigenic B and T cell epitopes that were used in the design of a multi-epitopes peptide. Molecular docking study was carried out to predict vaccine construct affinity of binding to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and understand its binding conformation to extract ideas about its processing by the host immune system. We identified membrane protein, envelope small membrane protein, non-structural protein ORF3, non-structural protein ORF5, and spike glycoprotein as potential candidates for subunit vaccine designing. The designed multi-epitope peptide then linked to -defensin adjuvant is showing high antigenicity. Further, the sequence of the designed vaccine construct is optimized for maximum expression in the Escherichia coli expression system. A rich pattern of hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions of the construct was observed with the TLR3 allowing stable binding of the construct at the docked site as predicted by the molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA binding energies. We expect that the panel of subunit vaccine candidates and the designed vaccine construct could be highly effective in immunizing populations from infections caused by MERS-CoV and could possible applied on the current pandemic COVID-19.","output":"Towards a novel peptide vaccine for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and its possible use against pandemic COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: For patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) which cannot be controlled by continuous therapy with intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) and systemic corticosteroids and/or surgical treatment, there were no approved curative options for a long time. For CRSwNP treatment with T2-addressing biologics is possible. On October 24, 2019, the European Commission granted extended approval for dupilumab as the first biological agent for treatment of insufficiently controlled severe CRSwNP. The Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) evaluates the benefits of reimbursable drugs with new active ingredients. This includes assessment of the additional benefit and its therapeutic relevance. METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed using individual patient data based on two phase III studies. Both studies examined the safety and efficacy of dupilumab as an add-on therapy to INCS for treatment of CRSwNP in adults inadequately controlled with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery compared to INCS alone. RESULTS: Based on the present data, the G-BA decided that there is an indication of a considerable additional benefit of dupilumab compared to mometasone furoate.

The aim of this study is to identify patient- and family-related factors associated with dissatisfaction with shared decision-making support among families of neuro-critically ill patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study using survey data that had been collected from a consecutive sample of family members of patients in the neuro-ICU (one family member per patient) at two US academic centers. Satisfaction with shared decision-making support on ICU discharge had been measured among family members using one specific Likert scale item on the Family Satisfaction in the ICU 24 survey, a validated survey instrument for families of patients in the ICU. We dichotomized top-box responses for this particular item as an outcome variable and identified available patient- and family-related covariates associated with dissatisfaction (i.e., less than complete satisfaction) via univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Among 355 surveys, 180 (49.5%) of the surveys indicated dissatisfaction with support during decision-making. In a multivariate model, no preexisting characteristics of families or patients ascertainable on ICU admission were predictive of dissatisfaction. However, among family factors determined during the ICU course, experiencing three or fewer formal family meetings (odds ratio 1.93 [confidence interval 1.13C3.31]; p = 0.01) was significantly predictive of dissatisfaction with decisional support in this cohort with an average patient length of stay of 8.6 days (SD 8.4). There was also a trend toward a familys decision to keep a patient as full code, without treatment limitations, being predictive of dissatisfaction (odds ratio 1.80 [confidence interval 0.93C3.51]; p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Family dissatisfaction with neuro-ICU shared decision-making support is not necessarily predicted by any preexisting family or patient variables but appears to correlate with participating in fewer formal family meetings during ICU admission. Future studies to improve family satisfaction with neurocritical care decision-making support should have broad inclusion criteria for participants and should consider promoting frequency of family meetings as a core strategy.

Whilst food safety regulations have been introduced over the past few years to maintain the microbial safety of foods sold from these wet markets, it remains unclear whether the hygiene maintenance that is performed on the wooden cutting boards used for meat-processing is effective. In fact, hygiene maintenance may often be overlooked, and hygiene standards may be insufficient. If so, this may lead to the spread of harmful pathogens through cross-contamination, thereby causing severe risks to public health. The aim of this study was to determine the level of microbial transfer between wooden cutting boards and swine meat of various qualities, using 16S metagenomic sequencing, strain identification and biofilm screening of isolated strains. The results established that: (a) the traditional hygiene practices used for cleaning wooden cutting boards in Hong Kongs wet markets expose the surfaces to potentially harmful microorganisms; (b) the processing of microbially contaminated meat on cutting boards cleaned using traditional practices leads to cross-contamination; and (c) several potentially pathogenic microorganisms found on the cutting boards have good biofilm-forming abilities. These results reinforce the need to review the traditional methods used to clean wooden cutting boards after the processing of raw meat in Hong Kong wet markets so as to prevent cross-contamination events. The establishment of proper hygiene protocols may reduce the spread of disease-causing microorganisms (including antibiotic-resistant microorganisms) in food-processing environments.","output":"Insights into the Microbiological Safety of Wooden Cutting Boards Used for Meat Processing in Hong Kongs Wet Markets: A Focus on Food-Contact Surfaces, Cross-Contamination and the Efficacy of Traditional Hygiene Practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To recognize most common patterns of upper extremity (UE) injuries in victims of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). METHODS: Radiological review of 308 patients who reported physical IPV at our institution from January 2013 to June 2018, identified 55 patients with 88 unique UE injuries. Demographic data and injury patterns and associations were collected from the electronic medical records. RESULTS: The cohort included 49 females and 6 males (age 19C63, mean 38). At the time of injury, IPV was reported in 15/88 (17%) and IPV screening was documented for 22/88 (25%) injuries. There were 46 fractures, 8 dislocations or subluxations, and 34 isolated soft tissue injuries, most commonly involving the hand (56/88). Fractures most commonly involved the fingers (21/46, 46%) and the 5th digit (8/27, 30%). Medial UE fractures (5th digit, 4th digit) constituted 44% of hand and finger fractures (12/27) and 26% of all fractures (12/46). Comminuted and displaced fractures were rare (8/46, 17%). Head and face injuries were the most common concomitant injuries (9/22, 41%) and subsequent injuries (21/61, 35%). Of 12 patients with recurrent UE injuries, 6 had recurrent injuries of the same hand. Five of 6 non-acute fractures (83%) were of the hand.

An increasing body of evidence argues for a direct implication of vitamin D deficiency, low serum calcium on poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between these two factors and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. MATERIALS: This is a prospective study, including 120 severe cases of COVID-19, admitted at the department of Reanimation-Anesthesia. Vitamin D was assessed by an immuno-fluoroassay method. Total serum calcium by a colorimetric method, then, corrected for serum albumin levels. The association with in-hospital mortality was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, proportional Cox regression analyses and the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: Hypovitaminosis D and hypocalcemia were very common, occurring in 75% and 35.8% of patients. When analyzing survival, both were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in a dose-effect manner (p(Log-Rank) = 0.009 and 0.001 respectively). A cutoff value of 39 nmol/l for vitamin D and 2.05 mmol/l for corrected calcemia could predict poor prognosis with a sensitivity of 76% and 84%, and a specificity of 69% and 60% respectively.

It does so through ethnographic observation, photo-documentation, and participatory action research at three sites in Oakland, California, on which unhoused people (and some housed members of the surrounding community) have demonstrated bold forms of grassroots placemaking on public land. The first site, which came to be known as Housing and Dignity Village, was a small intentionally organized community of unhoused women and families that existed for 41 politically charged days in a low-income residential neighborhood before being cleared by authorities in 2018. The second, a highly visible piece of desirable city-owned land, has been occupied by unhoused people to varying degrees since 2016 while being considered for various housing development proposals. The third is the Wood Street Encampment, Oaklands largest encampment and one of its longest standing, which has survived numerous partial evictions and a web of jurisdictional authority to become home to an extensive and innovative informal community-building effort. Despite their differences, each offers a powerful case of place-based bottom-up community organizing among unhoused people, in which placemaking becomes part of a subtle politics of visibility, being, and legitimacy. The study argues that these instances and others not only demonstrate a different sort of placemaking, but demand that we reconsider and reclaim the concept itself.","output":"Reclaiming Placemaking for an Alternative Politics of Legitimacy and Community in Homelessness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using crip theory, specifically Barounis' formulation of antiprophylactic citizenship, Piepzna-Samarasinha's conceptualisation of care work, and Shotwell's calls against purity, this paper analyses the making of the film HIV in the Rust Belt during the COVID-19 crisis.

Additionally, spatial repellents have the potential of being critical tools in the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases in contexts where typical vectors control efforts such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spray (IRS) are inaccessible or underutilized such as among displaced populations or in emergency relief settings. To address this knowledge gap, Kolondieba District, Sikasso Region, Mali was selected as a site to estimate the impact of the Mosquito Shield?, a spatial repellent that incorporates transfluthrin on a plastic sheet, on malaria-related outcomes. Over the past decade, the Region of Sikasso, Health districts of Kadiolo, Yorosso, and Kolondieba have remained among the most afflicted, characterized by an annual parasite incidence of more than 116 cases per 1000 population [1] and a Plasmodium falciparum prevalence rate of 29.7% [2]. METHODS: Cluster-randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial, whereby children  6 months to < 10 years old will be enrolled and followed to determine the time to malaria infection with monthly blood samples for microscopic diagnosis. A total of 1920 subjects (HHs) will be enrolled in 60 clusters (30 spatial repellent, 30 placebo). Malaria incidence will be estimated and compared to demonstrate and quantify the protective efficacy (PE) of a spatial repellent, in reducing malaria infection. Monthly mosquito collections using CDC light traps will be conducted to determine if there are entomological correlates of spatial repellent efficacy that may be useful for the evaluation of new spatial repellents. Quarterly human landing catches (HLC) will assess the behavioral effects of the intervention. DISCUSSION: Findings will serve as an efficacy trial of spatial repellent products for sub-Saharan Africa. Findings will be submitted to the World Health Organization Vector Control Advisory Group (WHO VCAG) for assessment of whether spatial repellents have public health value. Entomological outcomes will also be measured as proxies of malaria transmission to help develop guidelines for the evaluation of future spatial repellent products.

In our region the pandemic temporal trend was sinusoidal with peaks and valleys. A first outbreak (phase-peak 1 P-P1) was in March 2020 (248.12 cases for 100,000 inhabitants), a reduction (phase-valley 1 P-V1) in May 2020 (16.68 cases for 100,000 inhabitants) and a second outbreak (phase-peak 2 P-P2) in November 2020 (540.17 cases for 100,000 inhabitants; data from Italian Health Ministry). Our hospital was reorganized as one of the 13 Macro-Hubs identified in Lombardy for the treatment of STEMI. Here we describe our experience in the treatment of STEMI patients in the three different phases of COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In the three different phases the groups were superimposable for mean characteristics, but they differ for COVID-19 infection incidence (table). At multivariate analysis for the entire population COVID-19 infection (OR 45.8 [95% CI] 1.39C1511.79; p=0.03) was the only independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. Focusing on COVID-19 patients (figure) they experienced a 5-time increased incidence of in-hospital mortality (COVID-19pos vs COVID-19neg, 50% vs 11.1%; p=0.02). Moreover, the compresence of COVID-19 infection induced an 8 times increased risk of death (OR 8; [95% CI] 1.85C34.60; p=0.005) determined by a higher incidence respiratory complications (COVID-19pos vs COVID-19neg, 33.3% vs 8.9%; p=0.03) with a similar incidence of cardiac death (COVID-19pos vs COVID-19neg, 16.7% vs 11.17%; p=0.60).

Medical fields of POCUS application included obstetrics, gynecology, emergency medicine, infectious diseases, and cardiac, abdominal, and pulmonary conditions. POCUS was performed by midwives, nurses, clinical officers, physicians, technicians, and community health workers following varying periods of short-term training and using different ultrasound devices. Benefits of POCUS were yields of diagnostic images with adequate interpretation impacting patient management and outcome. High cost of face-to-face training, poor internet connectivity hindering telemedicine components, and unstable electrici'ty were among reported drawbacks for successful implementation of task shifting POCUS.

Participants were asked to complete the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y1 (STAI Y1), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). There were no significant differences in depressive symptoms and PTSS scores reported by participants between T0 and T1, with single-case analysis revealing that in 71% and 69% of the participants, depressive symptoms and PTSS symptoms, respectively, remained stable during this period. On the contrary, mean scores comparison showed a significant decrease in anxiety levels, with 19% of participants in whom anxiety symptoms improved at single-case analysis. Taken together, these results suggest that depressive symptoms and PTSS not only occurred in a high percentage of participants but also tended to remain stable over time, thus warranting the importance of large-scale psychological screening and interventions to prevent the chronicization of these symptoms and their evolution to psychopathological disorders.","output":"From the First to the Second Wave of COVID-19: Anxiety, De-Pressive, and Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms in the Italian Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We sought to understand the association between heavy alcohol and frequent drug use and non-adherence to recommended social distancing and personal hygiene guidelines for preventing the spread of COVID-19 early in the US pandemic.

Methods A questionnaire was circulated via social media to UK-based GDPs. The questionnaire examined GDPs' likelihood of issuing an inappropriate AB in two hypothetical clinical scenarios. Results A total of 205 questionnaires were completed, of which 198 were included for analysis. The resulting data were analysed to try and identify factors that correlated with an increased likelihood of an inappropriate AB prescription being issued for each clinical scenario. The results suggested the following factors as being associated with a statistically greater chance of the survey respondent issuing an inappropriate AB prescription: no postgraduate qualification; received their primary dental qualification from a non-UK university; scheduled appointments of less than 20 minutes; and low confidence in their ability to provide adequate local anaesthesia for the patients in the clinical scenario. Conclusions Four factors were shown to be associated with dentists' stated intention to prescribe ABs for acute dental pain, not in accordance with guidance. These results should guide further research to understand the significance of appropriate AB prescribing on the quality of urgent dental care.

HO activity is represented by two distinct isozymes, the inducible form, HO-1, and a constitutive form, HO-2, encoded by distinct genes (HMOX1, HMOX2, respectively). HO-1 responds to transcriptional activation in response to a wide variety of chemical and physical stimuli, including its natural substrate heme, oxidants, and phytochemical antioxidants. The expression of HO-1 is regulated by NF-E2-related factor-2 and counter-regulated by Bach-1, in a heme-sensitive manner. Additionally, HMOX1 promoter polymorphisms have been associated with human disease. The induction of HO-1 can confer protection in inflammatory conditions through removal of heme, a pro-oxidant and potential catalyst of lipid peroxidation, whereas iron released from HO activity may trigger ferritin synthesis or ferroptosis. The production of heme-derived reaction products (i.e., BV, BR) may contribute to HO-dependent cytoprotection via antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects. Additionally, BVR and BR have newly recognized roles in lipid regulation. CO may alter mitochondrial function leading to modulation of downstream signaling pathways that culminate in anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory effects. This review will present evidence for beneficial effects of HO-1 and its reaction products in human diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), metabolic conditions, including diabetes and obesity, as well as acute and chronic diseases of the liver, kidney, or lung. Strategies targeting the HO-1 pathway, including genetic or chemical modulation of HO-1 expression, or application of BR, CO gas, or CO donor compounds show therapeutic potential in inflammatory conditions, including organ ischemia/reperfusion injury. Evidence from human studies indicate that HO-1 expression may represent a biomarker of oxidative stress in various clinical conditions, while increases in serum BR levels have been correlated inversely to risk of CVD and metabolic disease. Ongoing human clinical trials investigate the potential of CO as a therapeutic in human disease.","output":"Heme Oxygenase-1: An Anti-Inflammatory Effector in Cardiovascular, Lung, and Related Metabolic Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To assess the determinants and reasons for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy in Croatia.

Bivariate ((2) test) and multivariate (binary logistic regression) statistical methods were used. RESULTS: The rate of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was relatively high (35%), with unequal distribution across demographic groups. Binary logistic regression with demographic characteristics as predictors showed that women, younger age groups (especially 25-34-year-olds), persons residing in households with children, inhabitants of smaller settlements, and persons with lower levels of education had higher odds of vaccine hesitancy. Trust in the five main actors responding to the COVID-19 pandemic (the National Civil Protection Headquarters, Government, health care system, scientists-researchers, and media) was also a significant predictor of vaccine hesitancy. Risk perception was an even stronger predictor: persons who perceived SARS-CoV-2 infection as a small risk were more than ten times likelier to be vaccine hesitant than those who perceived it as a great risk.

This transition, HN  SF, due to removal of significant number of the highest degree hubs, leads to relatively decrease in information processing efficiency, cost effectiveness of signal propagation, compactness, clustering of nodes and energy distributions. A systematic transition from a diassortative PCa PPI network to assortative networks after the removal of top 50 hubs then again reverting to disassortativity nature on further removal of the hubs was also observed indicating the dominance of the largest hubs in PCa network intergration. Further, functional classification of the hubs done by using within module degrees and participation coefficients for PCa network, and leading hubs knockout experiments indicated that kinless hubs serve as the basis of establishing links among constituting modules and heterogeneous nodes to maintain network stabilization. We, then, checked the essentiality of the hubs in the knockout experiment by performing Fisher's exact test on the hubs, and showed that removal of kinless hubs corresponded to maximum lethality in the network. However, excess removal of these hubs essentially may cause network breakdown.","output":"Kinless hubs are potential target genes in prostate cancer network."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is a ubiquitously distributed peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) that possesses diverse biological functions. Extracellular CyPA is a potent chemokine, which can directly induce leukocyte chemotaxis and contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammation-mediated diseases. Although it has been identified that the chemotaxis activity of CyPA is mediated through its cell surface signaling receptor CD147, the role of CyPA PPIase activity in this process is disputable, and the underlying molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. In this study, we present the first evidence that CyPA induces leukocyte chemotaxis through a direct binding with the ectodomain of CD147 (CD147(ECT)), independent of its PPIase activity. Although NMR study indicates that the CD147(ECT) binding site on CyPA overlaps with the PPIase active site, the PPIase inactive mutant CyPA(R55A) exhibits similar CD147(ECT) binding ability and chemotaxis activity to those of CyPA(WT). Furthermore, we have identified three key residues of CyPA involved in CD147(ECT) binding and found that mutations H70A, T107A, and R69A result in similar levels of reduction in CD147(ECT) binding ability and chemotaxis activity for CyPA, without affecting the PPIase activity. Our findings indicate that there exists a novel mechanism for CyPA to regulate cellular signaling processes, shedding new light on its applications in drug development and providing a new targeting site for drug design.","output":"Cyclophilin A (CyPA) induces chemotaxis independent of its peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity: direct binding between CyPA and the ectodomain of CD147."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutations in PITX2 have been implicated in several genetic disorders, particularly Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. In order to determine the most reliable bioinformatics tools to assess the likely pathogenicity of PITX2 variants, the results of bioinformatics predictions were compared to the impact of variants on PITX2 structure and function. The MutPred, Provean, and PMUT bioinformatic tools were found to have the highest performance in predicting the pathogenicity effects of all 18 characterized missense variants in PITX2, all with sensitivity and specificity >93%. Applying these three programs to assess the likely pathogenicity of 13 previously uncharacterized PITX2 missense variants predicted 12/13 variants as deleterious, except A30V which was predicted as benign variant for all programs. Molecular modeling of the PITX2 homoedomain predicts that of the 31 known PITX2 variants, L54Q, F58L, V83F, V83L, W86C, W86S, and R91P alter PITX2s structure. In contrast, the remaining 24 variants are not predicted to change PITX2s structure. The results of molecular modeling, performed on all the PITX2 missense mutations located in the homeodomain, were compared with the findings of eight protein stability programs. CUPSAT was found to be the most reliable in predicting the effect of missense mutations on PITX2 stability.

Several vascular registries responded quickly by insertion of COVID-19 variables into their data collection forms. More than 80% of clinical trials have been reported delayed or not started due to factors that included loss of enrollment from patient concerns or mandated institutional shutdowns, weighing the risk of trial participation on patient safety.

This study examined the impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on air pollution levels and the subsequent reductions in mortality for urban areas in 10 US states and the District of Columbia. We calculated changes in levels of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter no larger than 2.5 m (PM(2.5)) during mitigation period versus the baseline period (pre-mitigation measure) using the difference-in-difference approach and the estimated avoided total and cause-specific mortality attributable to these changes in PM(2.5) by state and district. We found that PM(2.5) concentration during the mitigation period decreased for most states (except for 3 states) and the capital. Decreases of average PM(2.5) concentration ranged from 0.25 g/m(3) (4.3%) in Maryland to 4.20 g/m(3) (45.1%) in California. On average, PM(2.5) levels across 7 states and the capital reduced by 12.8%. We estimated that PM(2.5) reduction during the mitigation period lowered air pollution-related total and cause-specific deaths.

The effect this has on urologists and the patients they care for is not fully understood and presents the challenge of prioritizing the most urgent cases. We aim to review the impact on urology services and evaluate strategies to minimize disruption. RECENT FINDINGS: Various healthcare systems have been forced to postpone treatment for many urological conditions as resources are dedicated to the treatment of COVID-19. Training has been postponed as staff are reallocated to areas of need. Face-to-face contact is largely minimized and innovative, virtual communication methods are used in the outpatient setting and multidisciplinary team meetings. Surgical practice is changing because of the risks posed by COVID-19 and procedures can be prioritized in a nonurgent, low priority, high priority or emergency category. SUMMARY: Although the COVID-19 pandemic will inevitably affect urological services, steps can be taken to mitigate the impact and prioritize the patients most in need of urgent care.

More women are surviving breast cancer, yet, survivors live with side effects for years after treatments have ended. The benefits of exercise for women with breast cancer are well established and include improvement in treatment-related physical and emotional side effects. Despite these benefits, few survivors meet exercise guidelines. Exercise programmes are needed within the cancer institution in Canada to bridge the current knowledge to practice gap. The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a novel implementation strategy that includes institution-based exercise plus self-management (SM) or SM alone versus usual care in improving exercise level, quality of life, aerobic capacity, muscle strength and use of healthcare services over 12 months for women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Participants: Women with stages ICIII breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Intervention: Group 1: institution-based exercise and SM (8 exercise sessions plus 8 SM modules); Group 2: SM alone; Group 3: usual care. Outcomes: The primary effectiveness outcome is minutes per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, aerobic capacity, muscle strength, and use of healthcare services. Randomisation: Participants will be randomised (1:1:1) to one of the three groups by a blinded statistician and will be stratified based on age of participant (<40, 40C60, and >60 years). Statistical analysis: Outcomes will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, 6-month and 12-month follow-up using an analysis of covariance to test changes between groups over time adjusted for age. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study addresses a long-standing need to help women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy become and stay more active by implementing novel rehabilitation strategies into real-world practice. This is vital in order for this population to minimise the lingering side effects of treatment, improve function and quality of life and prevent cancer recurrence.

O-GlcNAc turnover influences the dynamic interactions of CAPs with chromatin and thereby regulates gene expression. Therefore, both global profiling of O-GlcNAc chromatin-associated proteins (OCAPs) and genome-wide mapping of their DNA binding sites are invaluable for understanding the functions of OCAPs and the regulatory machinery of O-GlcNAcylation on gene transcription. However, it is difficult to conduct genome- and proteome-wide OCAP studies using the widely adopted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) method due to the lack of highly O-GlcNAc-specific panantibodies. Therefore, we developed a chemical enrichment method (AFT-OCAP) for simultaneously profiling OCAPs and mapping their binding DNA via mass spectrometry (MS) analysis and DNA sequencing. In our method, we developed an alkynyl-functionalized trimethylpiperidine (AFT) reagent to perform highly efficient chemical derivatizations of azide-labeled OCAP-DNA complexes. The reversible affinity between the immobilized anti-trimethylpiperidine antibody resin and AFT reagent leads to specific enrichment and efficient elution of the OCAP-DNA complexes for both MS identification and sequencing. Deep coverage of OCAPs was achieved from HeLa cells, including 1951 O-GlcNAc peptides from 1136 O-GlcNAc chromatin-associated transcription factors and cofactors (TFCs) using HCD fragmentation and 669 O-GlcNAc sites using EThcD fragmentation. In addition, the distributions of O-GlcNAcylation across the genome and the dynamic interactions of OCAPs upon O-GlcNAc regulation were obtained.","output":"A chemical method for genome- and proteome-wide enrichment and O-GlcNAcylation profiling of chromatin-associated proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is leading to the discovery of hundreds of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants on a daily basis. While most variants do not impact the course of the pandemic, some variants pose significantly increased risk when the acquired mutations allow better evasion of antibody neutralisation in previously infected or vaccinated subjects, or increased transmissibility. Early detection of such high risk variants (HRVs) is paramount for the proper management of the pandemic. However, experimental assays to determine immune evasion and transmissibility characteristics of new variants are resource-intensive and time-consuming, potentially leading to delayed appropriate responses by decision makers. Here we present a novel in silico approach combining Spike protein structure modelling and large protein transformer language models on Spike protein sequences, to accurately rank SARS-CoV-2 variants for immune escape and fitness potential. We validate our immune escape and fitness metrics with in vitro pVNT and binding assays. These metrics can be combined into an automated Early Warning System (EWS) capable of evaluating new variants in minutes and risk monitoring variant lineages in near real-time. The EWS flagged 12 out of 13 variants, designated by the World Health Organisation (WHO, Alpha-Omicron) as potentially dangerous, on average two months ahead of them being designated as such, demonstrating its ability to help increase preparedness against future variants. Omicron was flagged by the EWS on the day its sequence was made available, with immune evasion and binding metrics subsequently confirmed through our in vitro experiments.

The deltoid skin microvascular complement screen has been applied to patients with various systemic complement-mediated microvascular syndromes best exemplified by atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. In 21/23 cases, substantial microvascular deposition of complement components was identified. The two patients without significant complement deposition included one patient with moderate disease and a severely ill patient who although on a ventilator for a day was discharged after 3 days. The dominant microvascular complement immunoreactant identified was the terminal membranolytic attack complex C5b-9. Microvascular complement deposition strongly co-localized in situ with the SARS CoV-2 viral proteins including spike glycoproteins in the endothelial cells as well as the viral receptor ACE2 in lesional and non-lesional skin; viral RNA was not evident. Microvascular SARS CoV-2 viral protein, complement and ACE2 expression was most conspicuous in the subcutaneous fat. Although the samples from severely ill patients with COVID-19 were from grossly normal skin, light microscopically focal microvascular abnormalities were evident that included endothelial cell denudement, basement membrane zone reduplication and small thrombi. It is concluded that complement activation is common in grossly normal skin, primarily in the subcutaneous fat which may provide a link between severe disease and obesity, in people with severe COVID-19 and the strong co-localization with the ACE2 receptor and viral capsid proteins without viral RNA suggests that circulating viral proteins (i.e. pseudovirions) may dock onto the endothelial of these microvessels and induce complement activation.","output":"Docked SARS CoV-2 Proteins within the Cutaneous and Subcutaneous Microvasculature and their Role in the Pathogenesis of Severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has motivated the researchers to use artificial intelligence techniques for potential alternatives to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) due to the limited scale of testing.

The use of the convolution layer from COVIDNet ensures the extraction of representations relevant to the CXR modality.

Although predominantly a pandemic of acute respiratory disease, corona virus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19) results in multi-organ damage that impairs cardiopulmonary (CP) function and reduces cardiorespiratory fitness. Superimposed on the CP consequences of COVID-19 is a marked reduction in physical activity that exacerbates CP disease (CPD) risk. CP exercise testing (CPET) is routinely used in clinical practice to diagnose CPD and assess prognosis; assess cardiovascular safety for rehabilitation; and delineate the physiological contributors to exercise intolerance and exertional fatigue. As such, CPET plays an important role in clinical assessments of convalescent COVID-19 patients as well as research aimed at understanding the long-term health effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, due to the ventilatory expired gas analysis involved with CPET, the procedure is considered an aerosol generating procedure. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken by health care providers and exercise physiologists performing these tests.

Here we demonstrate the capacity of a subunit vaccine, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain displayed on a protein nanoparticle (RBD-NP), to stimulate robust and durable neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates. We evaluated five adjuvants including Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion; AS03, an alpha-tocopherol-containing oil-in-water emulsion; AS37, a TLR-7 agonist adsorbed to Alum; CpG1018-Alum, a TLR-9 agonist formulated in Alum; and Alum. RBD-NP immunization with AS03, CpG1018-Alum, AS37 or Alum induced substantial nAb and CD4 T cell responses, and conferred protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pharynges, nares and bronchoalveolar lavage. Live-virus nAb response was maintained up to 180 days post-vaccination with RBD/AS03, and correlated with protection. RBD-NP immunization cross-neutralized the B.1.1.7 variant efficiently but showed a reduced response against the B.1.351 variant. While RBD-NP/AS03 demonstrated a 4.5-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.351, the RBD-NP/AS37 group showed a 16-fold reduction, suggesting differences in the breadth of the nAb response induced by these adjuvants. Furthermore, RBD-NP/AS03 was as immunogenic as a prefusion stabilized Spike immunogen (Hexapro) adjuvanted with AS03. These data highlight the efficacy of the adjuvanted RBD-NP vaccine in promoting protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, and have paved the way for the clinical evaluation of this vaccine in Phase I/II clinical trials (NCT04742738 and NCT04750343).","output":"Adjuvanting a subunit COVID-19 vaccine to induce protective immunity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analyse susceptibility/risk of suffering COVID-19 among adults with distinct underlying medical conditions.

Risk of suffering COVID-19 was evaluated by Cox regression, estimating multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for age/sex and pre-existing comorbidities. RESULTS: Across study period, 536 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were observed (mean incidence: 39.5 cases per 100,000 persons-week). In multivariable-analysis, increasing age/years (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.02), nursing-home (HR: 20.19; 95% CI: 15.98-25.51), neurological disease (HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.03-1.77), taking diuretics (HR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.10-1.75), antiplatelet (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.05-1.76) and benzodiazepines (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.00-1.53) increased risk; conversely, taking angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61-1.00), angiotensin-receptor-blockers (HR: 0.70; 95%CI: 0.51-0.96) and statins (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58-0.96) were associated with reduced risk.

There are currently many approaches for its management, using both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The National Institute of Health - Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score is a validated measure commonly used to measure CP/CPPS symptoms. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of non-pharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). SEARCH METHODS We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases, trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with a diagnosis of CP/CPPS. We included all available non-pharmacological interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies, performed statistical analyses and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to the GRADE methods. MAIN RESULTS We included 38 unique studies with 3290 men with CP/CPPS across 23 comparisons.1. Acupuncture: (three studies, 204 participants) based on short-term follow-up, acupuncture probably leads to clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with sham procedure (mean difference (MD) in total NIH-CPSI score -5.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.32 to -4.26, high QoE). Acupuncture may result in little to no difference in adverse events (low QoE). Acupuncture may not reduce sexual dysfunction when compared with sham procedure (MD in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Scale -0.50, 95% CI -3.46 to 2.46, low QoE). Acupuncture may also lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with standard medical therapy (MD -6.05, 95% CI -7.87 to -4.24, two studies, 78 participants, low QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety.2. Lifestyle modifications: (one study, 100 participants) based on short-term follow-up, lifestyle modifications may be associated with a reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (risk ratio (RR) for improvement in NIH-CPSI scores 3.90, 95% CI 2.20 to 6.92, very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety.3. Physical activity: (one study, 85 participants) based on short-term follow-up, a physical activity programme may cause a small reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH-CPSI score MD -2.50, 95% CI -4.69 to -0.31, low QoE). This programme may not reduce anxiety or depression (low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction or quality of life.4. Prostatic massage: (two studies, 115 participants) based on short-term follow-up, we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases prostatitis symptoms compared with control (very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety.5. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy: (three studies, 157 participants) based on short-term follow-up, extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH-CPSI score MD -6.18, 95% CI -7.46 to -4.89, high QoE). These results may not be sustained at medium-term follow-up (low QoE). This treatment may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events (low QoE). This treatment probably improves sexual dysfunction (MD in the IIEF Scale MD 3.34, 95% CI 2.68 to 4.00, one study, 60 participants, moderate QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety.6. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy: (two studies, 237 participants) based on short-term follow-up, transrectal thermotherapy alone or in combination with medical therapy may decrease prostatitis symptoms slightly when compared with medical therapy alone (NIH-CPSI score MD -2.50, 95% CI -3.82 to -1.18, low QoE). One included study reported that participants may experience transient adverse events. We found no information regarding sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety.7. Other interventions: there is uncertainty about the effects of most of the other interventions included in this review. We found no information regarding psychological support or prostatic surgery. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Based on the findings of moderate quality evidence, this review found that some non-pharmacological interventions such as acupuncture and extracorporeal shockwave therapy are likely to result in a decrease in prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse event. The QoE for most other comparisons was predominantly low. Future clinical trials should include a full report of their methods including adequate masking, consistent assessment of all patient-important outcomes including potential treatment-related adverse events and appropriate sample sizes.","output":"Non-pharmacological interventions for treating chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of mortality in infants and young children. Despite the RSV disease burden, no vaccine is available, and treatment remains nonspecific. New drug candidates are needed to combat RSV. Toward this goal, we screened over 2,000 compounds to identify approved drugs with novel anti-RSV activity. Cardiac glycosides, inhibitors of the membrane-bound Na+/K+-ATPase, were identified to have anti-RSV activity. Cardiac glycosides diminished RSV infection in human epithelial type 2 cells and in primary human airway epithelial cells grown at an air-liquid interface. Digoxin, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved cardiac glycoside, was also able to inhibit infection of primary nasal epithelial cells with community isolates of RSV. Our results suggest that the antiviral effects of cardiac glycosides may be dependent on changes in the intracellular Na+ and K+ composition. Consistent with this mechanism, we demonstrated that the ionophoric antibiotics salinomycin, valinomycin, and monensin inhibited RSV in human epithelial type 2 cells and primary nasal epithelial cells. Our data indicate that the K+/Na+-sensitive steps in the RSV life cycle occur within the initial 4 hours of viral infection but do not include virus binding/entry. Rather, our findings demonstrated a negative effect on the RSV transcription and/or replication process. Overall, this work suggests that targeting intracellular ion concentrations offers a novel antiviral strategy.","output":"Targeting Intracellular Ion Homeostasis for the Control of Respiratory Syncytial Virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal forms of adult cancer, with a median survival of 15 mo. Targeting glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) at the origin of tumor formation and relapse may prove beneficial. In situ, GSCs are nested within the vascular bed in tight interaction with brain endothelial cells, which positively control their expansion. Because GSCs are notably addicted to apelin (APLN), sourced from the surrounding endothelial stroma, the APLN/APLNR nexus has emerged as a druggable network. However, how this signaling axis operates in gliomagenesis remains underestimated. Here, we find that the glycoprotein GP130 interacts with APLNR at the plasma membrane of GSCs and arbitrates its availability at the surface via ELMOD1, which may further impact on ARF-mediated endovesicular trafficking. From a functional standpoint, interfering with GP130 thwarts APLNR-mediated self-renewal of GSCs ex vivo. Thus, GP130 emerges as an unexpected cicerone to the G protein-coupled APLN receptor, opening new therapeutic perspectives toward the targeting of cancer stem cells.","output":"The glycoprotein GP130 governs the surface presentation of the G protein-coupled receptor APLNR."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Measurement-based care (MBC) is an evidence-based practice in which patients routinely complete standardized measures throughout treatment to help monitor clinical progress and inform clinical decision-making. Despite its potential benefits, MBC is rarely used in community-based substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. In this pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility of incorporating a digital and remotely delivered MBC system into SUD treatment within a community setting by characterizing patients and clinicians engagement with and usability ratings toward the MBC system that was piloted. METHODS: A pilot study was conducted with 30 patients receiving SUD treatment and eight clinicians providing SUD treatment in a large, publicly funded addiction and mental health treatment clinic. Services as usual within the clinic included individual psychotherapy, case management, group therapy, peer support, and medication management for mental health and SUD, including buprenorphine. Patients who enrolled in the pilot continued to receive services as usual and were automatically sent links to complete a 22-item questionnaire, called the weekly check-in, via text message or email weekly for 24 weeks. Results of the weekly check-in were summarized on a clinician-facing web-based dashboard. Engagement was characterized by calculating the mean number of weekly check-ins completed by patients and the mean number times clinicians logged into the MBC system. Ratings of the MBC systems usability and clinical utility were provided by patients and clinicians. RESULTS: Patient participants (53.3% male, 56.7% white, 90% Medicaid enrolled) completed a mean of 20.60 weekly check-ins (i.e., 85.8% of the 24 expected per patient). All but one participating clinician with a patient enrolled in the study logged into the clinician-facing dashboard at least once, with an average of 12.20 logins per clinician. Patient and clinician ratings of usability and clinical utility were favorable: most patients agreed with statements that the weekly check-in was easy to navigate and aided self-reflection. All clinicians who completed usability questionnaires agreed with statements indicating that the dashboard was easy to navigate and that it provided meaningful information for SUD treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A digital and remotely delivered MBC system can yield high rates of patient and clinician engagement and high ratings of usability and clinical utility when added into SUD treatment as usual. The success of this clinical pilot may be attributable, in part, to the user-centered design processes that were used to develop and refine the MBC system that was piloted. Future efforts may focus on strategies to test whether MBC can be sustainably implemented and offers clinical benefits to patients in community SUD treatment settings.","output":"Delivering Remote Measurement-Based Care in Community Addiction Treatment: Engagement and Usability Over a 6-Month Clinical Pilot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) include a sequence of events that connect a molecular-level initiating event with an adverse outcome at the cellular level for human health endpoints, or at the population level for ecological endpoints. When there is enough quantitative understanding of the relationships between key events in an AOP, a mathematical model may be developed to connect key events in a quantitative AOP (qAOP). Ideally, a qAOP will reduce the time and resources spent for chemical toxicity testing and risk assessment and enable the extrapolation of data collected at the molecular-level by in vitro assays, for example, to predict whether an adverse outcome may occur. Here, we review AOPs in the AOPWiki, an AOP repository, to determine best practices that would facilitate conversion from AOP to qAOP. Then, focusing on a particular case study, acetylcholinesterase inhibition leading to neurodegeneration, we describe specific methods and challenges. Examples of challenges include the availability and collection of quantitative data amenable to model development, the lack of studies that measure multiple key events, and model accessibility or transferability across platforms.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays are the gold standard for detecting viral RNA in patient samples and are used extensively in clinical settings. Most currently used quantitative PCR (RT-qPCRs) rely upon real-time detection of PCR product using specialized laboratory equipment. To enable the application of PCR in resource-poor or non-specialist laboratories, we have developed and evaluated a nested PCR method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using simple agarose gel electrophoresis for product detection. Using clinical samples tested by conventional qPCR methods and RNA transcripts of defined RNA copy number, the nested PCR based on the RdRP gene demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in clinical samples, but showed variable and transcript length-dependent sensitivity for RNA transcripts. Samples and transcripts were further evaluated in an additional N protein real-time quantitative PCR assay. As determined by 50% endpoint detection, the sensitivities of three RT-qPCRs and nested PCR methods varied substantially depending on the transcript target with no method approaching single copy detection. Overall, these findings highlight the need for assay validation and optimization and demonstrate the inability to precisely compare viral quantification from different PCR methodologies without calibration.","output":"Evaluation of Different PCR Assay Formats for Sensitive and Specific Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) launched the Human Proteome Project (HPP) in 2010, creating an international framework for global collaboration, data sharing, quality assurance and enhancing accurate annotation of the genome-encoded proteome.

Here, we present our experience with venovenous ECMO to support patients with COVID-19 and compare it to historic patients supported with VV-ECMO for other causes of respiratory failure. Methods: Patients admitted to our tertiary academic medical center in 2019 and 2020 who received VV ECMO support were included in this retrospective chart review. We examined patients with and without COVID-19 infection. We placed COVID-19 patients on ECMO who failed supportive care with mechanical ventilation using a high PEEP low tidal volume strategy, prone positioning, and neuromuscular blockade. Data analysis were done in Excel and Prism. Non-parametric data were compared with unpaired, two-tailed Mann-Whitney tests. Results: ECMO was provided to 26 COVID-19 patients and 38 patients without COVID-19.

The difference-in-difference-in-difference (ethod was further used to analyze the heterogeneous effects of gender, age, occupation and education. Second, a logit model was used to examine the impact of WPP on blood donation behavior under emergency scenarios (i.e. COVID-19). Findings: The research shows that following WPP has a positive impact on donation volume. For each donor, the average blood donation volume after following WPP increased by 12.94% compared to before following. The WPP has a greater impact on groups with males, medical staff, middle-aged individuals and those with primary school education. Following WPP also enhanced blood donation behavior in emergency scenarios. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the probability of fans donating blood was 2.6% higher than non-fans, and the average blood donation volume of fans was 7.04% higher than non-fans, which was 5.9% lower than in normal scenarios.

An analysis of the effects of pressure and heat on powder fusion was completed using the compression strength as a quantitative measure. A processing map was created to provide a preliminary understanding of the relationship between the combination of heat and pressure and selective fusion of powder. Test cases were printed to show the capabilities of the developed process. A prediction of the parts compressive strength was done based on previous data collected. Results proved that an increase in temperature culminates a higher compression strength. Results also showed that an increase in pressure contributes to a postponed evaporation of water in the part; once the evaporation has taken place, a denser part has a more dramatic increase in compressive strength.","output":"Hydrothermal Assisted Transient Jet Fusion of Ceramics: A Test Case Using Bentonite Clay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative etiology of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19); formerly referred as novel-Coronavirus-2019.

RESULTS: In this paper, we introduce a new Viral Spectrum Assembler (ViSpA) method for quasispecies spectrum reconstruction and compare it with the state-of-the-art ShoRAH tool on both simulated and real 454 pyrosequencing shotgun reads from HCV and HIV quasispecies. Experimental results show that ViSpA outperforms ShoRAH on simulated error-free reads, correctly assembling 10 out of 10 quasispecies and 29 sequences out of 40 quasispecies. While ShoRAH has a significant advantage over ViSpA on reads simulated with sequencing errors due to its advanced error correction algorithm, ViSpA is better at assembling the simulated reads after they have been corrected by ShoRAH. ViSpA also outperforms ShoRAH on real 454 reads. Indeed, 7 most frequent sequences reconstructed by ViSpA from a real HCV dataset are viable (do not contain internal stop codons), and the most frequent sequence was within 1% of the actual open reading frame obtained by cloning and Sanger sequencing. In contrast, only one of the sequences reconstructed by ShoRAH is viable. On a real HIV dataset, ShoRAH correctly inferred only 2 quasispecies sequences with at most 4 mismatches whereas ViSpA correctly reconstructed 5 quasispecies with at most 2 mismatches, and 2 out of 5 sequences were inferred without any mismatches. ViSpA source code is available at http://alla.cs.gsu.edu/~software/VISPA/vispa.html. CONCLUSIONS: ViSpA enables accurate viral quasispecies spectrum reconstruction from 454 pyrosequencing reads. We are currently exploring extensions applicable to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data from bacterial metagenomic samples and ecological samples of eukaryote populations.","output":"Inferring viral quasispecies spectra from 454 pyrosequencing reads"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, the kinetic parameters belonging to the cross-linking process of a modified epoxy resin, Aerotuf 275-34?, were investigated. Resin curing kinetics are crucial to understanding the structure-property-processing relationship for manufacturing high-performance carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer composites (CFRPCs). The parameters were obtained using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements and the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Kissinger, Borchardt-Daniels, and Friedman approaches. The DSC thermograms show two exothermic peaks that were deconvoluted as two separate reactions that follow autocatalytic models. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of produced carbon fiber/Aerotuf 275-34? laminates using thermosetting polymers such as epoxies, phenolics, and cyanate esters were evaluated as a function of the conversion degree, and a close correlation was found between the degree of curing and the ultimate tensile strength (UTS). We found that when the composite material is cured at 160 C for 15 min, it reaches a conversion degree of 0.97 and a UTS value that accounts for 95% of the maximum value obtained at 200 C (180 MPa). Thus, the application of such processing conditions could be enough to achieve good mechanical properties of the composite laminates. These results suggest the possibility for the development of strategies towards manufacturing high-performance materials based on the modified epoxy resin (Aerotuf 275-34?) through the curing process.","output":"Influence of Epoxy Resin Curing Kinetics on the Mechanical Properties of Carbon Fiber Composites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the results of operating an in-hospital coronavirus disease 2019 screening station on an outpatient basis and to identify the effectiveness and necessity of such a screening station. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1345 individuals who were tested for COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at an in-hospital screening station on an outpatient basis. The subjects were healthcare workers (HCWs) with suspected COVID-19 symptoms or exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19, caregivers at the hospital for complete enumeration, and patients who were scheduled to be admitted to a nonrestricted area in the hospital or to visit for outpatient treatment, but had suspected COVID-19 symptoms. The subjects were divided and compared as follows: HCW versus non-HCW groups and RT-PCR positive versus negative groups. RESULTS: A total of 140 had symptoms, 291 wanted to be tested, and 664 were asymptomatic but were screened. Seven subjects had positive results for COVID-19. Compared with the non-HCWs, the HCWs were younger and had a lower rate of underlying medical conditions. In addition, there were more women, individuals with exposure to confirmed cases, and individuals with symptoms or those who just wanted to be tested. The frequency of all symptoms was high among the HCWs. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the HCWs were significantly associated with the presence of symptoms, having an odds ratio of 23.317 (confidence interval, 15.142C35.907L; P < 0.001). The positive group had a high rate of exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19 and had more subjects with symptoms or those who wanted to be tested. CONCLUSION: In-hospital screening stations are a relatively safe way to protect and support HCWs and to reduce and manage the spread of infection within the hospital effectively during an outbreak in the community.","output":"Safety and Effectiveness of an In-Hospital Screening Station for Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Response to the Massive Community Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanotechnology has revolutionized novel drug delivery strategies through establishing nanoscale drug carriers, such as niosomes, liposomes, nanomicelles, dendrimers, polymeric micelles, and nanoparticles (NPs). Owing to their desirable cancer-targeting efficacy and controlled release, these nanotherapeutic modalities are broadly used in clinics to improve the efficacy of small-molecule inhibitors. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family members engage in various intracellular processes, including DNA repair, gene transcription, signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, cell division, and antioxidant response. PARP inhibitors are synthetic small-molecules that have emerged as one of the most successful innovative strategies for targeted therapy in cancer cells harboring mutations in DNA repair genes. Despite these advances, drug resistance and unwanted side effects are two significant drawbacks to using PARP inhibitors in the clinic. Recently, the development of practical nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems has tremendously improved the efficacy of PARP inhibitors. NPs can specifically accumulate in the leaky vasculature of the tumor and cancer cells and release the chemotherapeutic moiety in the tumor microenvironment. On the contrary, NPs are usually unable to permeate across the bodys normal organs and tissues; hence the toxicity is zero to none. NPs can modify the release of encapsulated drugs based on the composition of the coating substance. Delivering PARP inhibitors without modulation often leads to the toxic effect; therefore, a delivery vehicle is essential to encapsulate them. Various nanocarriers have been exploited to deliver PARP inhibitors in different cancers. Through this review, we hope to cast light on the most innovative advances in applying PARP inhibitors for therapeutic purposes.","output":"Active Targeted Nanoparticles for Delivery of Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitors: A Preliminary Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibiotic resistance is an urgent public health threat that has received substantial attention from the worlds leading health agencies and national governmental bodies alike.

Teachers' phono trauma is well-known as a serious occupational hazard, and online education was the primary mode of delivering instruction to students during COVID-19. METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among teachers in the Eastern Province area of Saudi Arabia. Teachers completed a self-administered questionnaire via an online platform, which included socio-demographic data, academic status, and the Voice Handicap Index - 10 (VHI-10) questionnaire, which assessed their vocal difficulties. RESULTS: A total of 335 teachers responded to the survey (78.2% females vs. 21.8% males). Nearly half (48.7%) were primary school teachers. 45.7% were currently teaching distance learning. Earphones and microphones (49.3%) were the most commonly used distance learning accessories. Noise in the classroom was a very much disturbing factor in teaching implied by 44.8% of the teachers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the vocal handicap index-10 was significantly higher among females (p=0.007), primary school teachers (p<0.001), moreover those currently teaching distance learning (p=0.001) and those who perceived that there is more work in distance teaching (p<0.001).

Although they still accounted for a small share of total travel, the shared modes were growing in availability and popularity. They showed potential to serve many societal goals to further mobility, equity, and sustainability, especially if carefully combined with public transit and scaled up substantially. The pandemic led to unprecedented drops in travel demand and deep uncertainty about when and how demand will rebound.

In this study, we analyzed the hour-by-hour pedestrian flow data of key locations in Beijing before, during, and after the strict epidemic prevention and control period, and we found that the pedestrian flow patterns differed greatly in different periods by using a composite clustering index;we interpreted the clustering results from two perspectives: groups of pedestrian flow patterns and functional categories. The results show that depending on the specific stage of epidemic prevention and control, the number of unique pedestrian flow patterns decreased from four before the epidemic to two during the strict control stage and then increased to six during the initial resumption of work. The restrictions on movement are correlated with most of the visitations, and the release of restrictions led to an increase in the variety of unique pedestrian flow patterns compared to that in the pre-restriction period, even though the overall number of visitations decreased, indicating that social restrictions led to differences in the flow patterns of POIs and increased social distance.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Pedestrian Flow Patterns in Urban POIsAn Example from Beijing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This paper presents a newborn (G2P2, gestational age of 39+6 weeks, birth weight of 3,200 g, with normal fetal amniotic fluid) with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to our hospital on February 10, 2020, at the birth age of 16 hours and 34 minutes. The Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min were 9 and 10 points, respectively. PATIENTS AND METHODS The mother of the newborn was exposed to a patient with COVID-19 five days before delivery.

OBJECTIVE To assess the association between various physician compensation incentives on technical indicators of primary care quality. DESIGN Cross-sectional, nationally representative retrospective analysis. PARTICIPANTS Visits by adults to primary care physicians in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2012-2016. We analyzed 49,580 sampled visits, representing 1.45 billion primary care visits. MAIN MEASURES We assessed the association between 5 compensation incentives - quality measure performance, patient experience scores, individual productivity, practice financial performance, or practice efficiency - and 10 high-value and 7 low-value care measures as well as high-value and low-value care composites. KEY RESULTS Quality measure performance was an incentive in 22% of visits; patient experience scores, 17%; individual productivity, 57%; practice financial performance, 63%; and practice efficiency, 12%. In adjusted models, none of the compensation incentives were consistently associated with individual high- and low-value measures. None of the compensation incentives were associated with high- or low-value care composites. For example, quality measure performance compensation was not significantly associated with high-value care (visits with quality incentive, 47% of eligible measures met; without quality incentive, 43%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.15) or low-value care (aOR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.82-1.19). Physician compensation incentives that might be expected to increase low-value care did not: patient experience (aOR for low-value care composite, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.65-1.05), individual productivity (aOR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.88-1.22), and practice financial performance (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.81-1.36).

The study showed that in-service EFL university teachers actual use of synchronous online teaching was subject to social (i.e. social norms), institutional (i.e. facilitating conditions), and individual (i.e. perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, and attitudes toward use) levels. The main change of teachers synchronous online teaching beliefs, due to the Covid-19, was that perceived usefulness became a significant predictor of teachers actual use of synchronous online teaching, whereas perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness changed to be insignificant predictors of teachers attitudes toward use of synchronous online teaching.

Genetic analyses of ACE2 have identified several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) specific to different human populations. Molecular dynamics simulations have indicated that several of these SNPs could affect interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, thereby providing a partial explanation for the regional differences observed in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and severity. However, the significance of population-specific ACE2 SNPs in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is unknown, as no in vitro validation studies have been performed. Here, we analyzed the impact of eight SNPs found in specific populations on receptor binding and cell entry in vitro. Except for a SNP causing a nonsense mutation that reduced ACE2 expression, none of the selected SNPs markedly altered the interaction between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-2-S), which is responsible for receptor recognition and cell entry, or the efficiency of viral cell entry mediated by SARS-2-S. Our findings indicate that ACE2 polymorphisms have limited impact on the ACE2-dependent cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 and underscore the importance of future studies on the involvement of population-specific SNPs of other host genes in susceptibility toward SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Population-Specific ACE2 Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Have Limited Impact on SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity In Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reports the treatment outcomes of 167 COVID-19 positive patients who were treated with stand-alone Ayurvedic therapeutic intervention.

We aimed to examine how evidence of zero-events studies was utilized in the meta-analyses of systematic reviews of adverse events. METHODS: We conducted a survey of systematic reviews published in two periods: January 1, 2015, to January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2008, to April 25, 2011. Databases were searched for systematic reviews that conducted at least one meta-analysis of any healthcare intervention and used adverse events as the exclusive outcome. An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject in healthcare practice. We summarized the frequency of occurrence of zero-events studies in eligible systematic reviews and how these studies were dealt with in the meta-analyses of these systematic reviews. RESULTS: We included 640 eligible systematic reviews. There were 406 (63.45%) systematic reviews involving zero-events studies in their meta-analyses, among which 389 (95.11%) involved single-arm-zero-events studies and 223 (54.93%) involved double-arm-zero-events studies. The majority (98.71%) of these systematic reviews incorporated single-arm-zero-events studies into the meta-analyses. On the other hand, the majority (76.23%) of them excluded double-arm-zero-events studies from the meta-analyses, of which the majority (87.06%) did not discuss the potential impact of excluding such studies. Systematic reviews published at present (2015-2020) tended to incorporate zero-events studies in meta-analyses than those published in the past (2008-2011), but the difference was not significant (proportion difference=?0.09, 95% CI ?0.21 to 0.03, p = 0.12). CONCLUSION: Systematic review authors routinely treated studies with zero-events in both arms as non-informative carriers and excluded them from their reviews. Whether studies with no events are informative or not largely depends on the methods and assumptions applied, thus sensitivity analyses using different methods should be considered in future meta-analyses.

In this paper, we present a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to capture the longitudinal interactions participants had with a teleoperated robot coach (RC) delivering mindfulness sessions. The DBN model is used to study complex, temporal interactions between the participants self-reported personality traits, weekly baseline wellbeing scores, session ratings, and facial AUs elicited during the sessions in a 5-week longitudinal study. DBN modelling involves learning a graphical representation that facilitates intuitive understanding of how multiple components contribute to the longitudinal changes in session ratings corresponding to the perceptions of the RC, and participants relaxation and calm levels. The learnt model captures the following within and between sessions aspects of the longitudinal interaction study: influence of the 5 personality dimensions on the facial AU states and the session ratings, influence of facial AU states on the session ratings, and the influences within the items of the session ratings. The DBN structure is learnt using first 3 time points and the obtained model is used to predict the session ratings of the last 2 time points of the 5-week longitudinal data. The predictions are quantified using subject-wise RMSE and R2 scores. We also demonstrate two applications of the model, namely, imputation of missing values in the dataset and estimation of longitudinal session ratings of a new participant with a given personality profile. The obtained DBN model thus facilitates learning of conditional dependency structure between variables in the longitudinal data and offers inferences and conceptual understanding which are not possible through other regression methodologies.","output":"Dynamic Bayesian Network Modelling of User Affect and Perceptions of a Teleoperated Robot Coach during Longitudinal Mindfulness Training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVIDC19 continues to disrupt social lives and the economy of many countries and challenges their healthcare capacities. InGermany, the number of cases increased exponentially in early March 2020. As a political reaction, social restrictions wereimposed by closing e.g. schools, shops, cafs and restaurants, as well as borders for travellers. This reaped success as theinfection rate descended significantly in early April. In mid July, however, the numbers started to rise again. Of particularreasons was that from 15 June onwards, the travel ban has widely been cancelled or at least loosened. Methods: Here, we present an extended susceptibleCexposedCinfectedCrecoveredCdeceased (SEIRD) model to describe the diseasedynamics in Germany, taking into account German travellers which returned infected from abroad. Epidemiological parameterslike transmission rate, lethality or detection rate of infected individuals, as well as a rate measuring the impact of these travellers,were estimated by fitting the model output to available data. Parameter estimation was performed via Bayesian inference withthe aid of the MonteCCarloCbased Metropolis algorithm. Results: We found that travellers had a strong impact on the overall infection cases. Until the end of August, roughly 50,000 casesdirectly or indirectly related to travellers were estimated. These obviously caused even higher infection cases later on, whichamong other causes lead to a second wave of infection cases in late 2020.

While these measures were imposed with the intention of controlling the pandemic, they were also associated with severe psychosocial, societal, and economic implications on a societal level. One setting affected heavily by these measures is the school setting. By mid-April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world's student population. In consideration of the adverse consequences of school closures, many countries around the world reopened their schools in the months after the initial closures. To safely reopen schools and keep them open, governments implemented a broad range of measures. The evidence with regards to these measures, however, is heterogeneous, with a multitude of study designs, populations, settings, interventions and outcomes being assessed. To make sense of this heterogeneity, we conducted a rapid scoping review (8 October to 5 November 2020). This rapid scoping review is intended to serve as a precursor to a systematic review of effectiveness, which will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and was registered with the Open Science Framework. OBJECTIVES: To identify and comprehensively map the evidence assessing the impacts of measures implemented in the school setting to reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, with particular focus on the types of measures implemented in different school settings, the outcomes used to measure their impacts and the study types used to assess these. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the CDC COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database for preprints, and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 8 October 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies that assessed the impact of measures implemented in the school setting. Eligible populations were populations at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, or developing COVID-19 disease, or both, and included people both directly and indirectly impacted by interventions, including students, teachers, other school staff, and contacts of these groups, as well as the broader community. We considered all types of empirical studies, which quantitatively assessed impact including epidemiological studies, modelling studies, mixed-methods studies, and diagnostic studies that assessed the impact of relevant interventions beyond diagnostic test accuracy. Broad outcome categories of interest included infectious disease transmission-related outcomes, other harmful or beneficial health-related outcomes, and societal, economic, and ecological implications. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data from included studies in a standardized manner, and mapped them to categories within our a priori logic model where possible. Where not possible, we inductively developed new categories. In line with standard expectations for scoping reviews, the review provides an overview of the existing evidence regardless of methodological quality or risk of bias, and was not designed to synthesize effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterize strength of evidence (GRADE). MAIN RESULTS: We included 42 studies that assessed measures implemented in the school setting. The majority of studies used mathematical modelling designs (n = 31), while nine studies used observational designs, and two studies used experimental or quasi-experimental designs. Studies conducted in real-world contexts or using real data focused on the WHO European region (EUR; n = 20), the WHO region of the Americas (AMR; n = 13), the West Pacific region (WPR; n = 6), and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR; n = 1). One study conducted a global assessment and one did not report on data from, or that were applicable to, a specific country. Three broad intervention categories emerged from the included studies: organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 36), structural/environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 11), and surveillance and response measures to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections (n = 19). Most studies assessed SARS-CoV-2 transmission-related outcomes (n = 29), while others assessed healthcare utilization (n = 8), other health outcomes (n = 3), and societal, economic, and ecological outcomes (n = 5). Studies assessed both harmful and beneficial outcomes across all outcome categories.

This review is an important first step in understanding the available evidence and will inform the development of rapid reviews on this topic.","output":"Measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are traumatic events that occur before 18 years. ACEs, associated with increased health-risk behaviors and chronic health disorders, disproportionately impact people from marginalized communities. Evidence shows that toxic stress from ACEs and adverse social determinants of health can be prevented and treated with trauma-informed care (TIC). The purpose of this educational program was to train a maternal and child health workforce to bring evidence-based trauma-informed care to all impacted people. METHODS: Participants were professionals recruited from Federally Qualified Health Centers, community behavioral health organizations, educational institutions, and agencies serving low-income children and families. 100 unique participants representing 3 counties and 54 agencies joined sessions. Twelve virtual educational sessions were convened over 6 months using the Project ECHO? model via Zoom technology. Sessions consisted of didactic lectures and case-based discussions. RESULTS: After completion of the series, participants reported high satisfaction and increased knowledge and confidence in using TIC best practice skills. After participation, a significant number of participants voluntarily completed an additional online training about the specific TIC best practices that had been taught in the ECHO. Participants rated the opportunity for interprofessional collaboration and peer support for vicarious trauma as program strengths. DISCUSSION: This project demonstrated feasibility and effectiveness in delivery of a curriculum on trauma-informed care to cross-sector, multi-agency maternal and child health workforce professionals using the Project ECHO? model.

METHODS: The study was conducted between February 10 and 15, 2020, in a non-probabilistic way. The survey included questions regarding the risk of exposure, sociodemographics, perceived stress [10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)], resilience [10-item ConnorCDavidson Psychological Resilience (CD-RISC-10)], social support [Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)], and psychological distress [12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12)]. We applied the PROCESS macro for SPSS to test the hypotheses that resilience and social support moderated the stress response. In addition, a simple slope analysis was conducted when the interaction effect was statistically significant. RESULTS: Some 33.6% of participants suffered from psychological distress (GHQ-12  12). Perceived stress was positively related to psychological distress (r = 0.42, p < 0.001). In addition, resilience (R(2) = 0.03, p for interaction < 0.001) and social support (R(2) = 0.01, p for interaction <0.01) moderated the stress response. The impact of perceived stress on psychological distress was attenuated when subjects who were resilient (high  = 0.15, p < 0.001; low  = 0.36, p < 0.001), and perceived stress had less impact on psychological distress when social support was high ( = 0.24, p < 0.001) rather than low ( = 0.34, p < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional design led to a lack of causal relationships between variables.

Results here suggest that countries with a shorter period of lockdown (about 15 days) have confirmed cases divided by population higher than countries with a longer period of lockdown (about 60 days, i.e., 2 months); moreover, countries with a shorter period of lockdown have average fatality rate (5.45%) lower than countries with a longer length of lockdown (12.70%), whereas variation of fatality rate from March to August 2020 (first pandemic wave of COVID-19) suggests a higher reduction in countries with a longer period of lockdown than countries with a shorter duration (?1.9% vs. -0.72%). Independent Samples Test reveals that the fatality rate of countries with a shorter period of lockdown was significantly lower than countries with a longer period of lockdown (5.4% vs. 12.7%, p-value<.05). The Mann-Whitney Test confirms that fatality rate of countries with a shorter period of lockdown is significantly lower than countries having a longer period of lockdown (U = 0, p-value = .005). In addition, lockdowns of longer duration have generated negative effects on GDP growth: contraction of GDP (index 2010 = 100) from second quarter 2019 to second quarter of 2020 in countries applying a longer period of lockdown (i.e., about two months) is about ?21%, whereas it is ?13% in countries applying a shorter period of lockdown of about 15 days (significant difference with Independent Samples Test: t4 = ?2.274, p-value < .085).

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a mixed methodology approach to analyze tweets with COVID-19-related hashtags. First, a social network analysis was conducted to identify social media users who initiate the information diffusion process, followed by a quantitative content analysis of tweets by users with more than 5K retweets to identify what COVID-19 claims, factual information, misinformation and disinformation was shared on Twitter. Findings: Results found very little misinformation and disinformation distributed widely. While health experts and journalists shared factual COVID-19-related information, they were not receiving optimum engagement. Tweets by citizens focusing on personal experience or opinions received more retweets and likes compared to any other sender type. Similarly, celebrities received more replies than any other sender type. Practical implications: This study helps medical experts and government agencies understand the type of COVID-19 content and communication being shared on social media for population health purposes.

Residual blood samples were collected for serology testing over 5-day periods monthly from June 2020 to January 2021 from six clinical laboratories across the province of Alberta, Canada. A total of 93,993 individual patient samples were tested with a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody assay with positives confirmed using a spike antibody assay. Population-adjusted SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity was 0.92% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91 to 0.93%) shortly after the first COVID-19 wave in June 2020, increasing to 4.63% (95% CI: 4.61 to 4.65%) amid the second wave in January 2021. There was no significant difference in seropositivity between males and females (1.39% versus 1.27%; P = 0.11). Ages with highest seropositivity were 0 to 9 years (2.71%, 95% CI: 1.64 to 3.78%) followed by 20 to 29 years (1.58%, 95% CI: 1.12 to 2.04%), with the lowest rates seen in those aged 70 to 79 (0.79%, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.93%) and >80 (0.78%, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.97%). Compared to the seronegative group, seropositive patients inhabited geographic areas with lower household income ($87,500 versus $97,500; P < 0.001), larger household sizes, and higher proportions of people with education levels of secondary school or lower, as well as immigrants and visible minority groups (all P < 0.05). A total of 53.7% of seropositive individuals were potentially undetected cases with no prior positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test (NAAT). Antibodies were detectable in some patients up to 9 months post positive NAAT result. This seroprevalence study will continue to inform public health decisions by identifying at-risk demographics and geographical areas. IMPORTANCE Using SARS-CoV-2 serology testing, we assessed the proportion of people in Alberta, Canada (population 4.4 million) positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating previous infection, during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic (prior to vaccination programs). Linking these results with sociodemographic population data provides valuable information as to which groups of the population are more likely to have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus to help facilitate public health decision-making and interventions. We also compared seropositivity data with previous COVID-19 molecular testing results. Absence of antibody and molecular testing were highly correlated (95% negative concordance). Positive antibody correlation with a previous positive molecular test was low, suggesting the possibility of mild/asymptomatic infection or other reasons leading individuals from seeking medical attention. Our data highlight that the true estimate of population prevalence of COVID-19 is likely best informed by combining data from both serology and molecular testing.","output":"Pre-Vaccine Positivity of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Alberta, Canada during the First Two Waves of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of effective vaccines to combat infectious diseases is a complex multi-year and multi-stakeholder process.

Methods: In this pilot study, the frequencies of six polymorphisms in the ACE1, ACE2, AGT and AGTR1 genes were analysed in symptomatic patients affected by COVID-19 and compared with the results obtained from asymptomatic subjects. Results: Thus, we have identified that rs2074192 (ACE2), rs1799752 (ACE1) and rs699 (AGT) SNPs could potentially be a valuable tool for predicting the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. A genetic predisposition may be prospected for severe internal organ damages and poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 disease, as observed in symptomatic vs asymptomatic.

This stress leads to weakening of the immune system thus leading to higher susceptibility to other infections as well. This also includes the weakening of the respiratory tract leading to increased susceptibility of viral infections as in the case of COVID-19. Treatment for any kind of abnormality requires the identification of the key target proteins and pathways that are being altered. Withania somnifera is being used in the traditional medicinal system to improve health and longevity thus creating a sense of mental as well as physical well being. The present study utilises network pharmacological approach to predict the potential oxidative stress targets of the three major withanolides: Withanolide A, withaferin A and withanone. Primarily, the targets of the individual withanolides were obtained from the Swiss target and DIGEP-pred databases and the GO terms and lead hits related to oxidative stress were retrieved from AMIGO2 database. Totally 40 correlative hits were obtained as anti stress targets of the withanolides, which were subjected to functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction analysis to study the enriched pathways underlying oxidative stress response. Further the eleven crucial targets of the four selected pathways were analysed using molecular docking analysis. A total of forty protein hits were obtained as oxidative stress targets of the withanolides. Further, the pathway enrichment of these forty target genes showed the AGE RAGE signalling pathway as highly enriched pathway. Therefore, the AGE RAGE signalling pathway along with its underlying pathways namely MAPK signalling pathway, FOXO pathway and PI3-AKT pathway were chosen among all the other enriched pathways. Further the molecular docking analysis of the eleven target proteins falling under these four pathways showed good docking scores of the withanolides with all the eleven targets with highest interaction against BCL2. From the above study, the biological targets and associated pathways of the withanolides have been retrieved. Thus the in silico approach undertaken in this study explores the role of the key withanolides in the antioxidant potential of the traditional medicinal plant Withania somnifera. ?

Certain regions of the globe were severely affected in terms of prevalence and mortality than other. Although the cause for this pattern is not clearly understood, lessons learned from previous epidemics and emerging evidences suggest the major role of ecological factors like ambient air pollutants (AAP) and meteorological parameters in increased COVID-19 incidence. The present study aimed to understand the impact of these factors on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and their associated mortality in major cities of India. Methods: : This study used secondary AAP, meteorological and COVID-19 data from official websites for the period January-November 2020, which were divided into Pre-lockdown (January-March 2020), Phase I (April to June 2020) and Phase II (July to November 2020). After comprehensive screening, five major cities that includes 48 CPCB monitoring stations collecting daily data of ambient temperature, particulate matter PM 2.5 and 10 were analysed. Spearman and Kendalls rank correlation test was performed to understand the association between SARS-CoV-2 transmission and AAP and, meteorological variables. Similarly, case fatality rate (CFR) was determined to compute the correlation between AAP and COVID-19 related morality. Results: : The level of air pollutants in major cities were significantly reduced during Phase I compared to Pre-lock down and increased upon Phase II in all the cities. During the Phase II in Delhi, the strong significant positive correlation was observed between the AAP and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai AAP levels were moderate and no correlation was noticed. The relation between AT and SARS-CoV-2 transmission was inconclusive as both positive and negative correlation observed. In addition, Delhi and Kolkata showed a positive association between long-term exposure to the AAP and COVID-19 CFR. Conclusion: Our findings support the hypothesis that the particulate matter upon exceeding the satisfactory level serves as an important cofactor in increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and related mortality. These findings would help public health experts to understand the SARS-CoV-2 transmission against ecological variables in India and provides supporting evidence to healthcare policymakers and government agencies for formulating strategies to combat the COVID-19.","output":"Association Between Ambient Air Pollutants and Meteorological Factors With SARS-CoV-2 Transmission and Mortality in India: an Exploratory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To observe the effect of combination treatment with Chaihu Droplet pill (CHDP) and Huoxiang Zhengqi Droplet pill (HZDP) in treating severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in early stage.

METHODS: An exploratory qualitative inquiry via at-a-distance semi-structured interviews and group discussions engaged a purposefully selected sample of oral health care workers and patients in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Participants were asked to appraise a preparedness model by considering how to prepare for oral care during a pandemic, while answering open-ended questions about the model content and visual presentation. Interviews and group discussions occurred between April 2020 and January 2021, were audio recorded, and transcribed verbatim. An inductive coding process was used to identify themes, subthemes, and categories of information until saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Seventy-four participants, including 19 dentists, 15 dental hygienists, 10 certified dental assistants, 9 administrators, and 21 patients, suggested modifications to the recently developed preparedness model. Individual interviews (41 participants) and group discussions (33 participants in groups ranging from 2 to 9 attendees each) lasted for an average of 53 min. Eighty-four hours of audio recordings led to more than 1110 single-spaced pages of transcripts. The thematic analysis identified 82 codes, 12 categories, and four main themes: life-long learning, critical thinking, personal and professional risk, and patient-centred care. These themes were understood within provider characteristics and social and environmental contexts. Participants highlighted the need for the model to focus on information and communication, developing awareness and understanding, inferring risks, and performing oral health care during a threat such as a pandemic or disease outbreak. A modified portrayal of the model was suggested to better represent participants' perspectives. CONCLUSION: A recently developed preparedness model for the provision of dental care during an unfolding threat like the COVID-19 pandemic was appraised and modified by oral health care workers.

Later on, a condition with similar characteristics has also been reported in adults.1,2 Case report: 26-year-old male patient with obesity and arterial hypertension presented to the emergency department with 3 days history of fever, chills, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, headache, dry cough, nasal discharge and diarrhea approximately six weeks after he has been diagnosed with mild COVID-19. Initial blood tests showed markedly elevated laboratory inflammatory markers. CT scan showed enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and small areas of residual ground-glass opacities in the lungs. Pulmonary thromboembolism was ruled out. He was admitted to the infectious disease clinic and was started on cloxacillin, ceftriaxone, antipyretics and appropriate rehydration. On the third day of hospital treatment, the patient complained of chest and neck pain and severe dyspnea. His general condition deteriorated rapidly, and he was transferred to the intensive care unit due to the development of cardiogenic shock. Inotropic and vasopressor support was initiated. Echocardiography showed mildly dilated left ventricle with severe impairment of global systolic function (LVEF 20 %). High-sensitivity troponin I and NT-proBNP were markedly elevated with a peak concentration of 792 and 18200 ng/l, respectively. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the tertiary center coronary care unit (CCU). Pulse steroid therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin were immediately initiated, while heart failure therapy was gradually introduced in the following days. Seven days after admission to CCU, multiparametric cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed preserved LVEF with diffusely prolonged myocardial T1 relaxation time and T2 relaxation time, confirming myocardial injury and edema, respectively. There was no late gadolinium enhancement (Figure 1). Updated Lake-Louise criteria for myocarditis have been fulfilled.3 The following criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) were met: age over 21 years, a positive test result for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, documented fever &gt;38.0C for 24 hours, laboratory evidence of inflammation, involvement of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system, and severe illness requiring hospitalization. Conclusion: This case indicates that there is a vast diversity of clinical presentation and underlying mechanisms of COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 syndromes with myocardial injury. Recently described MIS-A is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinicians should be aware of this syndrome in order to recognize it on time and start with appropriate treatment.

This investigation of Rt estimations was conducted to guide the national COVID-19 response in Qatar, from the onset of the epidemic until August 18, 2021. Methods: Real-time empirical RtEmpirical was estimated using five methods, including the Robert Koch Institute, Cislaghi, Systrom-Bettencourt and Ribeiro, Wallinga and Teunis, and Cori et al. methods. Rt was also estimated using a transmission dynamics model (RtModel-based). Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Agreements between different Rt estimates were assessed by calculating correlation coefficients. Results: RtEmpirical captured the evolution of the epidemic through three waves, public health response landmarks, effects of major social events, transient fluctuations coinciding with significant clusters of infection, and introduction and expansion of the B.1.1.7 variant. The various estimation methods produced consistent and overall comparable RtEmpirical estimates with generally large correlation coefficients. The Wallinga and Teunis method was the fastest at detecting changes in epidemic dynamics. RtEmpirical estimates were consistent whether using time series of symptomatic PCR-confirmed cases, all PCR-confirmed cases, acute-care hospital admissions, or ICU-care hospital admissions, to proxy trends in true infection incidence. RtModel-based correlated strongly with RtEmpirical and provided an average RtEmpirical. Conclusions: Rt estimations were robust and generated consistent results regardless of the data source or the method of estimation. Findings affirmed an influential role for Rt estimations in guiding national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, even in resource-limited settings.","output":"Characterizing the effective reproduction number during the COVID-19 epidemic: Insights from Qatar experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This paper aims to discuss the effects of COVID-19 on hotel marketing and management practices and outlines a three-pronged research agenda to stimulate knowledge development in the hotel sector Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on an overview of the relevant literature on hotel marketing and management and the hotel guest behavior The authors also investigated hospitality service trends to propose a research agenda Findings This paper presents a research agenda from three dimensions - artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, hygiene and cleanliness and health and health care First, different types of AI (mechanical, thinking and feeling) might open up distinct research streams at the intersection of health crises and hotel management, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic Additionally, this paper recommends that researchers move beyond typical perspectives on the antecedents and outcomes of hotel hygiene and cleanliness to delve into guests' perceptions of the cleanliness of specific hotel surfaces Furthermore, a more in-depth analysis is warranted about the evolving relationship between hotels and the health-care sector Practical implications The recommended research areas are intended to advance the knowledge base to help hotels recover from the COVID-19 pandemic The suggested research streams are expected to provide actionable insights to promote the development and sustainability of the hotel sector Originality/value This paper appears to be a frontier study, critically examining possible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on hotel marketing and management practices and how hoteliers may respond to such challenges to recover after this pandemic","output":"Effects of COVID-19 on hotel marketing and management: a perspective article"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The bioethics literature reflects significant interest in and concern with the use of genetic and genomic information in various settings. Because psychiatric treatment and research raises unique ethical, legal, and social issues, we conducted a scoping review of the biomedical, bioethics, and psychology literature regarding the application of genetic and genomic tools to psychiatric disorders (as listed in the DSM-5) and two associated behaviors or symptoms to provide a more detailed overview of the state of the field. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to examine the available bioethics, biomedical, and psychology literature on applying genetic and genomic tools to psychiatric disorders (other than neurodevelopmental disorders) and two behaviors or symptoms sometimes associated with them (aggression or violence and suicidality) to identify the disorders to which these tools have been applied, the contexts in or purposes for which they have been applied, the ethical, legal, or social concerns associated with those uses, and proposed recommendations for mitigating those concerns. METHODS: We used Arksey and OMalleys scoping review framework: (1) identify the research question; (2) identify relevant studies; (3) select studies; (4) chart the data; and (5) collate, summarize, and report results (2005). We relied on Levac et al. to inform our application of the framework (2010). The PRISMA extension for scoping reviews checklist informed our reporting (2018). We searched three electronic databases MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, and PsycInfo (EbscoHost) for peer-reviewed journal articles in English to identify relevant literature. One author screened the initial results and additional screening was done in consultation with other authors. A data extraction form using DSM-5 diagnostic categories (excluding neurodevelopmental disorders) was developed and two authors independently each reviewed approximately half of the articles. Inter-rater reliability was ensured by double-coding approximately 10% of the papers. An additional author independently coded 10% of the articles to audit the data. RESULTS: In 365 coded publications, we identified 15 DSM-5 diagnostic categories in addition to the two pre-selected behaviors or symptoms (aggression or violence and suicidality) to which genetic or genomic tools have been applied. We identified 11 settings in or purposes for which these tools were applied. Twenty-two types of ethical, legal, or social concerns associated with the application of genetic or genomic tools to these disorders or behaviors/symptoms were identified along with 13 practices or policies that could mitigate these concerns. CONCLUSION: Genetic and genomic tools have been applied to a wide range of psychiatric disorders. These raise a range of ethical, legal, and social concerns. Additional research is warranted to better understand the concerns and effective ways to address them. Advancing the literature to identify relevant ethical, legal, or social concerns and solutions to those problems likely requires greater attention to specific applications of genetic or genomic tools to particular psychiatric disorders and associated behaviors/symptoms as well as broad stakeholder engagement.

The review protocol was published on PROSPERO. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 checklist was followed. Following database search, a narrative synthesis was performed. Data pertaining symptom scores, pain levels, and voiding frequency following surgery were summarized by calculating percentage change in these parameters. Multiple surgical treatments were identified. These included injections of hyaluronic acid (HA), botulinum toxin A (Botox A), triamcinolone, resiniferatoxin (RTX), platelet-rich plasma, and 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution, neuromodulation, hydrodistension (HD), resection/fulguration of Hunner lesions, resection of ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves, reconstructive surgery, and cystectomy. This review found no evidence suggesting that HD and RTX injections can ameliorate IC/BPS symptoms. Current evidence suggests that sacral neuromodulation, cystectomy, and transurethral resection/fulguration of Hunner lesions could lead to symptomatic relief in IC/BPS. Further research into the efficacy of Botox A, triamcinolone, 50% DMSO solution, and HA instillations is required. However, the best treatment options cannot be reliably stated due to the low level of evidence of the studies identified. Further research should report outcomes for Hunner-type IC and BPS separately given their differing histopathological characteristics. Performing high-quality randomized controlled trials could be hindered by the low prevalence of the condition and a small proportion of patients progressing to surgery.","output":"Comparing surgical interventions for interstitial cystitis: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report documents a rare case of COVID-19-associated constrictive pericarditis (CP) in the setting of a recent COVID-19 infection.

METHODS Altogether, 21 patients with mallet finger deformity (16 men, 5 women; average age 31 years, range 19-47 years) were treated with a modified palmaris longus tendon graft through a bone tunnel during 18 months (2014-2016). Four index fingers, seven middle fingers, eight ring fingers, and two little fingers were treated for four cutting injuries, eleven finger sprains, four crush injuries, and two twist injuries (7 open and 14 closed injuries). Duration from injury to surgery was 9 h to 13 weeks. Three patients underwent surgery after 6 weeks of unsuccessful conservative treatment. No tendon was attached to the extensor tendon insertion in 16 patients, and 5 had residual tendon of <0.2 cm attached. All patients had distal segment flexion deformity and dorsiflexion disorder. Surgery comprised transverse penetration and vertical drilling of the base of the distal phalanx (2.0 and 2.5 mm diameter drills). Equal shallow semitendinosus pieces of the palmaris longus tendon (4 cm) were obtained from the sagittal end and were passed through a dorsal bone hole, emerging from a transverse bone hole. The two bundles were sutured to the main tendon. Tension was adjusted, and the broken ends were sutured. The distal interphalangeal joints were fixed in hyperextension. RESULTS All patients were followed for 7-16 months (average 6.0  0.3 months) postoperatively. All 21 patients had grade A wound healing, with no complications (e.g., necrotic wound, recurrence, joint stiffness). The mallet finger deformity was corrected with good appearance, no obvious abnormalities, and satisfactory flexion and extension. Two patients had a superficial wound infection. Each recovered after symptomatic treatment. One patient had a mild result, with limited extension. There were no recurrences. Results were evaluated according to Patel et al.'s system, which revealed 15 excellent and 5 good results (combined 95.23% rate), with 1 mild result (limited extension). Patients were satisfied with the appearance and function of the affected fingers, and the desired surgical end result was achieved.

This constant pressure and friction against the skin may contribute to increased wearer pain, irritation, and discomfort. The purpose of this work is to report a modified 3D printed mask extender to alleviate discomfort and increase mask wearability by relieving posterior auricular pressure from isolation masks.Methods : Our institutional review board designated this project as non-human research and exempt. As part of resourcing 3D printing laboratories along with individual 3D printers to provide resources to healthcare workers, mask extenders were printed to relieve posterior auricular pressure from individuals wearing isolation masks. The authors modifed an existing mask extender, increasing its length with accompanying peripheral rungs for isolation mask securement. 3D printing was performed with Ultimaker S5 (Ultimaker B.V.;Geldermalsen, Netherlands) and CR-10 (Creality3D;Shenzhen, China) 3D printers using polylactic acid filaments. The authors modified extended mask extenders were printed and freely delivered to healthcare workers (physicians, nurses, technologists, and other personnel) at the authors institution. Results: The final mask extender design was printed with the two 3D printers with a maximum 7 straps printed simultaneously on each 3D printer.

We found that, while the new behavior was acquired, the old behavior persisted and coexisted with the new. Critically, inhibition hindered both overcoming the old behavior and establishing the new one. Our findings highlight that suppressing unwanted behaviors is not only ineffective but may even further strengthen them.

RESULTS: Unanimous consensus about the presence or absence of dystonia was achieved for 34 out of 40 videos. Two main themes were present during consensus-building discussions as videos were evaluated for dystonia: (1) unilateral leg or foot adduction that was variable over time, and (2) difficulty in identifying dystonia.

Taiwan has been successful in countering the COVID-19 outbreak, however, the potential risk for asymptomatic infections and the prevalence rates remain unknown. We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Taiwan via serologically testing hospital patients with neither symptoms indicative of nor positive nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Residual specimens from laboratory blood tests for outpatient and emergency department patients visiting a medical centre in Taipei, Taiwan, within one week in May and another in July, 2020, were collected. We used Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Assay to screen and further validated cases with high cutoff index by a confirmatory ELISA assay. We also analysed antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 along disease progression in four nucleic acid test confirmed COVID-19 patients. Findings Blood samples from a total of 14,765 patients were tested. The unweighted seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 0?07% [95% CI, 0?04%-0?13%]; after weighting with the population demographics of Taiwan, the estimated overall seroprevalence was 0?05% [95% CI, 0?02%-0?10%]. Furthermore, based on data of the four COVID-19 cases, the seroconversion dates for IgM were as early as 9 days and that for IgG 11 days after symptoms onset. Interpretation We screened the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a small-scale population-based study and observed an approximately 0?05% seroprevalence of COVID-19, indicating that the current containment protocols emphasising mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing and mandatory quarantine for all incomers are effective in Taiwan.

Our aim is to measure the impact of the pandemic at different levels in Spanish ICUs. Methods: : On-line survey, conducted in April 2021, among members of the Sociedad Espa?ola de Medicina Intensiva, Crtica y Unidades Coronarias . Results: : We received 246 answers from 157 hospitals. 67.7% of the ICUs were expanded during the pandemic, with an overall increase in beds of 58.6%. The ICU medical staff increased by 6.1% and there has been a nursing shortage in 93.7% of units. In 88% of the hospitals the collaboration of other specialists was necessary to manage the patient overload, which exceeded 200% of the pre-pandemic ICU capacity. The predominant collaboration model consisted of the intensive care medicine specialist being responsible for triage and coordinating the care of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Despite that 53.2% centres offered training for critically ill patient care, a deterioration in the quality of care was perceived. 84.2% hospitals drew up a Contingency Plan and in 77.8% of the hospitals a multidisciplinary committee was set up to agree on decision-making. Self-evaluation of the work performed was outstanding and 91.9% felt proud of what they had achieved. 16.7%, however, regretted becoming intensivist and up to 15% considered leaving their job. 61.8%, 79.3% and 89.4% of the participants have the feeling that the opinion about the ICU has improved for hospital management, for other specialists and for the general population (respectively). In 75.3% of the hospitals, at least one member of the ICU medical team has been infected with COVID-19. Conclusions: : The Spanish ICUs assumed an unprecedented increase in the number of patients.

Although transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising non-invasive brain stimulation method, its effect in patients with AN remains unclear. Objective: This study investigated changes in maladaptive eating behavior, body mass index (BMI), and depression after 10 sessions of anodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Methods: In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 43 inpatients with AN were divided to receive either active (n = 22) or sham (n = 21) tDCS over the left DLPFC (anode F3/cathode Fp2, 2 mA for 30 min). All patients filled the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZUNG), and their BMI was measured. These values were obtained repeatedly in four stages: (1) before tDCS treatment, (2) after tDCS treatment, (3) in the follow-up after 2 weeks, and (4) in the follow-up after 4 weeks. Results: Primary outcomes (EDE-Q) based on the ANOVA results do not show any between-group differences either after the active part of the study or in the follow-up. Secondary analysis reveals a reduction in some items of EDE-Q. Compared with sham tDCS, active tDCS significantly improved self-evaluation based on body shape (p < 0.05) and significantly decreased the need of excessive control over calorie intake (p < 0.05) in the 4-week follow-up. However, the results do not survive multiple comparison correction. In both sham and active groups, the BMI values improved, albeit not significantly. Conclusion: We did not observe a significant effect of tDCS over the left DLPFC on complex psychopathology and weight recovery in patients with AN. tDCS reduced the need to follow specific dietary rules and improved body image evaluation in patients with AN.

In this paper, I argue that echo chambers are not to blame for this polarization, even if they are causally responsible for it. They are not to blame, because belief calibration in an echo chamber is a rational process;moreover, the epistemically constitutive properties of echo chambers are not optional for epistemically social animals like us. There is no special problem of echo chambers;rather, there is a problem of misleading evidence (especially higher-order evidence). Accordingly, we ought to respond to misinformation about COVID neither by attempting to dismantle echo chambers nor by attempting to make people more rational, but rather by attempting to supplant unreliable higher-order evidence with better evidence.

This guidance will go through causes of adrenal insufficiency, groups at risk of an adrenal crisis, emergency management and management for surgical procedures. A new NHS Steroid Emergency Card has been developed to be carried by patients at risk of adrenal crisis. We hope the new emergency card and this guidance will increase awareness of the need to start steroids promptly in patients at risk of an adrenal crisis, particularly those presenting in the emergency department or to acute medicine teams and those undergoing surgery or invasive procedures.","output":"Guidance for the prevention and emergency management of adult patients with adrenal insufficiency."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To characterize the arthritis-modulating effects of 3 non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in rat experimental arthritis in the disease-resistant E3 strain, and to investigate the disease-modulating effects of the MHC region (RT1) in various genetic backgrounds. METHODS A congenic fragment containing Ncf1 along with congenic fragments containing the strongest remaining loci, Pia5/Cia3 and Pia7/Cia13 on chromosome 4, were transferred from the arthritis-susceptible DA strain into the background of the completely resistant E3 strain. The arthritis-regulatory potential of the transferred alleles was evaluated by comparing the susceptibility to experimental arthritis in congenic rats with that in E3 rats. The RT1(u) haplotype from the E3 strain was transferred into the susceptible DA strain (RT1(av1)), and various F(1) and F(2) hybrids were generated to assess the effects of RT1 on arthritis susceptibility. RESULTS The DA allele of Ncf1 did not break the arthritis resistance of the E3 rats, although it led to enhanced autoimmune B cell responses, as indicated by significantly elevated levels of anticollagen antibodies in congenic rats. Introgressing Pia5 and Pia7 loci on chromosome 4 broke the resistance to arthritis, and the MHC locus on chromosome 20 in DA rats enhanced arthritis when RT1 interacted with E3 genes. CONCLUSION The findings in these congenic lines confirm the existence of 3 major QTLs that regulate the severity of arthritis and are sufficient to induce the transformation of a completely arthritis-resistant rat strain into an arthritis-susceptible strain. This study also reveals a dramatic difference in the arthritis-regulatory potential of the rat MHC depending on genetic background, suggesting that strong epistatic interactions occur between MHC and non-MHC genes.","output":"Detection of arthritis-susceptibility loci, including Ncf1, and variable effects of the major histocompatibility complex region depending on genetic background in rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate the predictive value of hyponatremia as a new biochemical marker for the early and accurate preoperative diagnosis of complicated appendicitis in the adult population. METHODS: 732 patients who were operated for acute appendicitis (AA) and diagnosed as perforation intraoperatively were evaluated retrospectively. Serum sodium, C-reactive protein (CRP), and leukocyte levels of patients with perforated and nonperforated appendicitis were compared. RESULTS: Perforated appendicitis patients had statistically lower serum Na values (p<0.001). Similarly, patients without perforated appendicitis had higher serum CRP values (p<0.001). In patients diagnosed with perforated AA, the sensitivity of plasma sodium concentration was 63%, and the specificity was 66%. The threshold value of plasma sodium concentration 137.5 mEq/L had the best possible sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: Hyponatremia is a new marker of perforated appendicitis and therefore, serum sodium level measurement should be considered in patients with a clinical presentation consistent with appendicitis if complications are suspected.","output":"Predictive value of serum sodium level in determining perforated appendicitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The importance of integrating the social sciences in epidemic preparedness and response has become a common feature of infectious disease policy and practice debates. However to date, this integration remains inadequate, fragmented and under-funded, with limited reach and small initial investments. Based on data collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, in this paper we analysed the variety of knowledge, infrastructure and funding gaps that hinder the full integration of the social sciences in epidemics and present a strategic framework for addressing them. METHODS: Senior social scientists with expertise in public health emergencies facilitated expert deliberations, and conducted 75 key informant interviews, a consultation with 20 expert social scientists from Africa, Asia and Europe, 2 focus groups and a literature review of 128 identified high-priority peer reviewed articles. We also analysed 56 interviews from the Ebola 100 project, collected just after the West African Ebola epidemic. Analysis was conducted on gaps and recommendations. These were inductively classified according to various themes during two group prioritization exercises. The project was conducted between February and May 2019. Findings from the report were used to inform strategic prioritization of global investments in social science capacities for health emergencies. FINDINGS: Our analysis consolidated 12 knowledge and infrastructure gaps and 38 recommendations from an initial list of 600 gaps and 220 recommendations. In developing our framework, we clustered these into three areas: 1) Recommendations to improve core social science response capacities, including investments in: human resources within response agencies; the creation of social science data analysis capacities at field and global level; mechanisms for operationalizing knowledge; and a set of rapid deployment infrastructures; 2) Recommendations to strengthen applied and basic social sciences, including the need to: better define the social science agenda and core competencies; support innovative interdisciplinary science; make concerted investments in developing field ready tools and building the evidence-base; and develop codes of conduct; and 3) Recommendations for a supportive social science ecosystem, including: the essential foundational investments in institutional development; training and capacity building; awareness-raising activities with allied disciplines; and lastly, support for a community of practice. INTERPRETATION: Comprehensively integrating social science into the epidemic preparedness and response architecture demands multifaceted investments on par with allied disciplines, such as epidemiology and virology. Building core capacities and competencies should occur at multiple levels, grounded in country-led capacity building. Social science should not be a parallel system, nor should it be siloed into risk communication and community engagement. Rather, it should be integrated across existing systems and networks, and deploy interdisciplinary knowledge transversally across all preparedness and response sectors and pillars. Future work should update this framework to account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the institutional landscape.","output":"Integrating the social sciences in epidemic preparedness and response: A strategic framework to strengthen capacities and improve Global Health security"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of respiratory illness caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 associated with multiple organ failures is spreading rapidly due to its contagious human-to-human transmission and inadequate global healthcare systems.

To date, knowledge on the prevalence, risk of hospital and intensive care units (ICU) admissions and mortality is limited. Therefore, systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using a preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guideline. AIM: The study aimed to address the prevalence, risk of hospital and ICU admissions and mortality among patients with COVID-19 and obesity. METHODS: The NewcastleCOttawa scale was used to assess the quality of a study. Primary outcomes were the prevalence and risk of hospitalization, and secondary outcomes were the risk of ICU admissions and mortality risk. MantelCHaenszel with random effects was applied, and the effect measure was odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the systematic review, and only four studies for meta-analysis. Among 29,776 patients with COVID-19, obesity was identified as the second-highest comorbidity. The prevalence rates of obesity and severe obesity among patients with COVID-19 were 26.1% and 15.5%, respectively. Obesity resulted in significantly increased risk of hospital admission (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.12C3.53, p = 0.02) and ICU admission (OR = 1.77, 95% = CI 1.52C2.06, p < 0.00001). Severe obesity had a significantly increased risk of ICU admission (OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.42C2.25, p < 0.00001). The mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 and obesity was about 30.5% (438/1,434), and 19.7% (2,777/14,095) of them recovered from COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Obesity poses as nearly twice the risk of hospital and ICU admissions, and severe obesity contributes to almost twice the risk of ICU admissions.","output":"Are patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and obesity at a higher risk of hospital and intensive care unit admissions?

Over recent years, arts-based interventions have helped in a wide range of crisis situations, being recommended to support the workforce during and after complex crisis but there has been no systematic review of the role of arts-based crisis interventions and whether there are cogent themes regarding practice elements and outcomes. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review to (i) define the arts-based change process used during and after crisis events, and (ii) explore the perceptions of intermediate and long-term mental health benefits of arts-based interventions for professionals in caring roles. Our search yielded six studies (all qualitative). All data were thematically aggregated and meta-synthesized, revealing seven practice elements (a safe place, focusing on strengths and protective factors, developing psychosocial competencies to support peers, emotional expression and processing, identifying and naming the impact of the crisis, using an integrative creative approach, and cultural and organizational sensitivity) applied across all six studies, as well as a range of intermediate and long-term benefits shared common features (adapting, growing, and recovering; using the community as a healing resource; reducing or preventing symptoms of stress or trauma reactions, psychophysiological homeostasis). The ways in which these studies were designed independently from one another and yet used the same practice elements in their crisis interventions indicates that there is comparability about how and why the arts-based practice elements are being used and to what effect. Our findings provide a sound basis and meaningful parameters for future research incorporating quantitative and qualitative approaches to firmly establish the effectiveness of art-based interventions, and how arts can support cultural sensitivity, acceptability and indicated outcomes, particularly those relating to stress and trauma during or following a crisis.","output":"Arts-Based Interventions for Professionals in Caring Roles During and After Crisis: A Systematic Review of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented use of telehealth, including by primary care professionals (PCPs) who serve adolescents. OBJECTIVE: To inform future practice and policies, we sought to characterize PCPs recent experience using adolescent telehealth as well as their support for it after the COVID-19 pandemic is over. METHODS: From February to March 2021, we conducted a web-based survey of 1047 PCPs in the United States. Our national sample included physicians (747/1047, 71%), advanced practice providers (177/1047, 17%), and nurses (123/1047, 12%) who provided primary care to adolescents aged 11-17 years. RESULTS: Most PCPs reported using telehealth for a low, moderate, or high proportion of their adolescent patients in the three months prior to the survey (424/1047, 40%, 286/1047, 27%, and 219/1047, 21%, respectively); only 11% (118/1047) reported no use. A majority of respondents agreed that adolescent telehealth increases access to care (720/1047, 69%) and enables them to provide high-quality care (560/1047, 53%). Few believed that adolescent telehealth takes too much time (142/1047, 14%) or encourages health care overuse (157/1047, 15%). Most supported giving families the option of adolescent telehealth for primary care after the pandemic is over (683/1047, 65%) and believed that health insurance plans should continue to reimburse for telehealth visits (863/1047, 82%). Approximately two-thirds (702/1047, 67%) wanted to offer adolescent telehealth visits after the pandemic, with intentions being higher among those with recent telehealth experience (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: PCPs in our national sample reported widespread use of and predominantly positive attitudes toward adolescent telehealth.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 91 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from January 22 to 30, 2020 was performed including 39 males and 52 females, with a median age of 50 (33-62) years,then their clinical features and HRCT characteristics were analyzed. Results: The main clinical presentations included fever in 70 cases and cough in 57 cases(mainly dry cough in 39 cases). The first time HRCT showed that 24 cases with COVID-19 were normal, however other 67 cases were abnormal. The ground glass opacity in the lung on HRCT was found in 65 cases, including 64 cases with dilated blood vessel crossing the lesion, 50 cases with thickened adjacent pleura, and 47 cases with thickening of interstitial septum. The patchy opacity was seen in 42 cases, and no enlarged lymph nodes were observed in all patients. As for the lesion distribution, there were two cases with bilateral diffuse changes, 57 cases with multiple lesions, 8 cases with the lesion in only one lobe. The lesions were mainly located under the pleura area in 46 cases, including 39 cases in the lower lobe and other 7 cases in the upper lobe. And there were 13 cases without characteristic distribution in the lung.

This study examined sociodemographic and risk factors of PCV13 infant primary series vaccination completion, before and during COVID. Methods Retrospective data from the Optums de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database were used to create 3 cohorts: C1, Pre-COVID;C2, During COVID;C3, Cross-COVID (Figure 1). C1 and C3 (C1&3) were combined and compared with C2 for primary dosing completion before and during COVID according to infant/caregiver characteristics. Full completion (FC) was defined as receipt of 3 doses of PCV13 within 8 months of birth. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare FC vs. partial completion or no vaccine. Descriptive analyses were used to compare FC before and during COVID within subgroups. Figure 1: Study population and inclusion criteria Results A total of 132,183 and 16,522 infants with at least 8 months of follow up time were enrolled in C1&3 and C2, respectively. FC was significantly higher before COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.07-1.17). Adjusting for COVID, FC was significantly lower in infants who were Black, with co-morbidities or risk factors, living in households with >1 children or no children, household annual income < &99k, residing in a neighborhood with median education of high school or below, and whose primary caregiver was aged <25 years (Table 1). Comparing FC before and during COVID, the % decline relative to pre-COVID was > 2% among infants who were White, residing in the Mountain, New England or Pacific regions, in a household with 2 children, >&100k annual income, employer-based insurance or HMO, and median neighborhood education of bachelor degree plus (Table 2).

These mental health issues confronting young people are of public concern. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the associations between loneliness and gaming addiction behaviors among young people in Hong Kong and to investigate how familial factors, psychological distress, and gender differences moderate these relationships. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in June 2020 when schools reopened after 6 months of school closures. Participants included 2863 children and adolescents in primary (Grades 4 to 6) and secondary (Grades 7 and 8) schools (female participants: 1502/2863, 52.5%). Chi-square tests, one-way analyses of variance, and independent-samples t tests were performed to compare the differences of distribution in gaming addiction behaviors across gender, age, and other sociodemographic characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors that relate to excessive or pathological gaming behaviors separately, in comparison with leisure gaming. RESULTS: A total of 83.0% (2377/2863) of the participants played video games during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of excessive and pathological game addiction behaviors was 20.9% (597/2863) and 5.3% (153/2863), respectively. More male students had gaming addiction symptoms than female students. The multinomial logistic regressions showed that feeling lonely was associated with more problematic gaming behaviors, and the association was stronger for older female students. Low socioeconomic status, less parental support and less supervision, and poor mental health were risk factors for gaming addiction behaviors, especially among primary school students. CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness was associated with gaming addiction behaviors; the findings from this study suggested that this association was similar across gender and age groups among young people. Familial support and supervision during school closures can protect young people from developing problematic gaming behaviors.

While the relaxation of these control measures has varied geographically, it is widely agreed that contact tracing efforts will play a major role in the successful reopening of businesses and schools. As the volume of positive cases has increased in the United States, it has become clear that there is room for digital health interventions to assist in contact tracing. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of a mobile-friendly app designed to supplement manual COVID-19 contact tracing efforts on a university campus. Here, we present the results of a development and validation study centered around the use of the MyCOVIDKey app on the Vanderbilt University campus during the summer of 2020. METHODS: We performed a 6-week pilot study in the Stevenson Center Science and Engineering Complex on Vanderbilt University's campus in Nashville, TN. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty, and staff >18 years who worked in Stevenson Center and had access to a mobile phone were eligible to register for a MyCOVIDKey account. All users were encouraged to complete regular self-assessments of COVID-19 risk and to key in to sites by scanning a location-specific barcode. RESULTS: Between June 17, 2020, and July 29, 2020, 45 unique participants created MyCOVIDKey accounts. These users performed 227 self-assessments and 1410 key-ins. Self-assessments were performed by 89% (n=40) of users, 71% (n=32) of users keyed in, and 48 unique locations (of 71 possible locations) were visited. Overall, 89% (202/227) of assessments were determined to be low risk (ie, asymptomatic with no known exposures), and these assessments yielded a CLEAR status. The remaining self-assessments received a status of NOT CLEAR, indicating either risk of exposure or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (7.5% [n=17] and 3.5% [n=8] of self-assessments indicated moderate and high risk, respectively). These 25 instances came from 8 unique users, and in 19 of these instances, the at-risk user keyed in to a location on campus. CONCLUSIONS: Digital contact tracing tools may be useful in assisting organizations to identify persons at risk of COVID-19 through contact tracing, or in locating places that may need to be cleaned or disinfected after being visited by an index case. Incentives to continue the use of such tools can improve uptake, and their continued usage increases utility to both organizational and public health efforts. Parameters of digital tools, including MyCOVIDKey, should ideally be optimized to supplement existing contact tracing efforts. These tools represent a critical addition to manual contact tracing efforts during reopening and sustained regular activity.","output":"Understanding On-Campus Interactions With a Semiautomated, Barcode-Based Platform to Augment COVID-19 Contact Tracing: App Development and Usage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic since December 2020. It has not only associated with physiological disorder but also with psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness. Whether the vaccines and antivirals can provide protects remains unknown. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is recommended as an alternative and significant way of preventing and treating COVID-19 in China. However, few studies have assessed the benefits of this treatment and mental health after they recover. Our study is designed to investigate effects and safety when using TCM on the course of this disease and the impact of COVID-19 on pandemic-related anxiety. METHOD: For this prospective cohort study, we will enroll 300 COVID-19 patients aged 18 to 80 years at 4 centers. We divide them into 2 groups, according to whether they use Baidu Jieduan Granule at a ratio of 1:1. We will compare treatments combined Baidu Jieduan Granule with conventional Western medicine (experimental group) vs treatment of conventional Western medicine only (control group). The basic information of patients including demographic, general condition, primary diseases, and complications will be assessed. Related examines will be conducted at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days. The primary outcomes are clinical outcome. A follow-up time of 1 year (to June 30, 2021) allow us to evaluate the psychiatric disorder after recovery. We will monitor adverse events throughout the trial. DISCUSSION: It will be the first prospective cohort study which uses Baidu Jieduan Granule, based on the innovation traditional Chinese medicine strategy of \\" Internal and External Relieving -Truncated Torsion \\" to treat the common type of COVID-19.

More than 22% of Canadians reported that they had felt depressed in the last week, in response to a December 2020 national survey. Given the need to physically distance during the pandemic, and the increase in demand for mental health services, digital interventions that support mental health and wellness may be beneficial. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to identify digital interventions that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives were to identify (1) the populations these interventions were developed for, inclusive of exploring areas of equity such as socioeconomic status, sex/gender, race/ethnicity and culture, and relevance to Indigenous peoples and communities; (2) the effect of the interventions; and (3) any barriers or facilitators to the use of the intervention. METHODS: This study was completed using a Cochrane Rapid Review methodology. A search of Embase, PsycInfo, Medline, and Web of Science, along with Google, Million Short, and popular mobile app libraries, was conducted. Two screeners were involved in applying inclusion criteria using Covidence software. Academic articles and mobile apps identified were screened using the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields resource, the American Psychiatric Association App Evaluation Framework, and the Mental Health Commission of Canada's guidance on app assessment and selection. RESULTS: A total of 31 mobile apps and 114 web-based resources (eg, telemedicine, virtual peer support groups, discussion forums, etc) that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian population during the pandemic were identified. These resources have been listed on a publicly available website along with search tags that may help an individual make a suitable selection. Variability exists in the populations that the interventions were developed for, and little assessment has been done with regard to areas of equity. The effect of the interventions was not reported for all those identified in this synthesis; however, for those that did report the effect, it was shown that they were effective in the context that they were used. A number of barriers and facilitators to using these interventions were identified, such as access, cost, and connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: A number of digital interventions that could support population mental health in Canada during the global COVID-19 pandemic were identified, indicating that individuals have several options to choose from. These interventions vary in their purpose, approach, design, cost, and targeted user group. While some research and digital interventions addressed equity-related considerations, more research and focused attention should be given to this area.","output":"Digital Interventions to Support Population Mental Health in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Rapid Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Until now, no antiviral treatment has been proven to be effective for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The timing of oxygen therapy was considered to have a great influence on the symptomatic relief of hypoxemia and seeking medical intervention, especially in situations with insufficient medical resources, but the evidence on the timing of oxygen therapy is limited. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Medical charts review was carried out to collect the data of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed in Tongji hospital, Wuhan from 30th December 2019 to 8th March 2020. In this study, the appropriate timing of oxygen therapy and risk factors associated with severe and fatal illness were identified and the effectiveness of antivirus on disease progression was assessed. Among 1362 patients, the prevalence of hypoxia symptoms was significantly higher in those patients with severe and fatal illness than in those with less severe disease. The onset of hypoxia symptoms was most common in the second to third week after symptom onset, and patients with critical and fatal illness experienced these symptoms earlier than those with mild and severe illness. In multivariable analyses, the risk of death increased significantly when oxygen therapy was started more than 2 days after hypoxia symptoms onset among critical patients (OR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.20 to 3.10). Compared to the critically ill patients without IFN-a, the patients who were treated with IFN-a had a lower mortality (OR, 0.60; 95%CI, 0.39 to 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of oxygen therapy was associated with lower mortality among critical patients. This study highlighted the importance of early oxygen therapy after the onset of hypoxia symptoms.

Several studies report on the importance of peoples sense of coherence (SOC) or control over work for dealing with burnout. SOC implicates a stress-coping capacity involving comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. However, little is known on how SOC cognitively modulates burnout experiences.ObjectivesTo investigate neurocognitive mechanisms of SOC and burnout in medical professionals.MethodsForty-one registered nurses were enrolled. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and measured resting-state brain activity. We identified brain regions associated with SOC and burnout levels by correlating these trait scores to regional fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF). Subsequently, we investigated whether participants levels of SOC impacted their fALFF-burnout association by mediation analysis.ResultsSOC and depersonalization dimension of burnout were negatively correlated (p < 0.01). The fALFF in the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) correlated positively with SOC scores, and negatively with depersonalization dimension of burnout (p < 0.05). Furthermore, SOC mediated the negative relationship between DLPFC activity and burnout severity (p < 0.05).ConclusionsOur data suggested that SOC alleviates burnout experience and supports prefrontal activity to prompt cognitive control;they may facilitate flexible shifting of perspective and optimistic reappraisal of work-stress. In effect, workplace-stressors may be acknowledged as being more meaningful than distressing. Without sufficient SOC, frequent exposures to stressors can lead to maladaptive coping to exhibit emotional numbing or depersonalization.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","output":"Sense of coherence, spontaneous brain activity, and burnout severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To prevent the spread of the The novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV), some classic public health measures are being taken, such as social distancing and quarantine METHOD: Studies were identified using large-circulation international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase.

We retrospectively observed the applicability of the NUTRIC score for predicting outcomes in coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. METHODS: All adult COVID-19 ARDS patients admitted to the intensive care unit and requiring various forms of oxygen therapy were included in the study. The demographic characteristics and clinical information about the patients were obtained from the hospital's medical records department. The nutritional risk for each patient was assessed using the NUTRIC score at 72 hours of ICU admission. The discriminating power and ability of NUTRIC score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, age and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II to predict the 28-day mortality and need for mechanical ventilation (MV) was calculated using receiver operating characteristic curves and area under this curve. RESULTS: A total of 80 COVID-19 ARDS patients fitted into the inclusion criteria.

However, there are concerns about FFP respirators causing hypercapnia via rebreathing carbon dioxide (CO(2)). Most previous studies measured the physiological effects of FFP respirators on treadmills or while resting, and such measurements may not reflect the physiological changes of HCWs working in the emergency department (ED). OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the physiological and clinical impacts of FFP type II (FFP2) respirators on HCWs during 2 h of their day shift in the ED. METHODS: We included emergency HCWs in this prospective cohort study. We measured end-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)), mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate values and dyspnea scores of subjects at two time points. The first measurements were carried out with medical masks while resting. Subjects then began their day shift in the ED with medical mask plus FFP2 respirator. We called subjects after 2 h for the second measurement. RESULTS: The median age of 153 healthy volunteers was 24.0 years (interquartile range 24.0C25.0 years). Subjects MAP, RR, and ETCO(2) values and dyspnea scores were significantly higher after 2 h. Median ETCO(2) values increased from 36.4 to 38.8 mm Hg. None of the subjects had hypercapnia symptoms, hypoxia, or other adverse effects. CONCLUSION: We did not observe any clinical reflection of these changes in physiological values. Thus, we evaluated these changes to be clinically insignificant.

The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model. The results demonstrate that both data series plausibly follow from the transmission model specified, and suggest that the detection of viral RNA in sewage sludge leads hospital admissions by 4.6 days on average.","output":"Aligning SARS-CoV-2 Indicators via an Epidemic Model: Application to Hospital Admissions and RNA Detection in Sewage Sludge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The preservice teacher education assumes a predominant role in the quality of the educational process that must be assumed in public education policies, noting the importance of reflection on a variety of aspects, including the curriculum, teaching and learning methods, and pedagogical practices.

Unfortunately, there is lack of clearly defined AEs associated with given procedures, and their reporting is non-uniform and often arbitrary. However, with an increasing number of neurosurgical procedures performed, there is a need for standardization of AEs for systematic tracking. Such a system would establish a baseline for future quality improvement strategies. OBJECTIVE: To review our institutional AEs and devise standardized titles specific to the spine, tumor, functional, and vascular neurosurgery divisions. METHODS: A review of prospective monthly-reported morbidity and mortality (M&M) conference data within the Department of Neurological Surgery was conducted from January 2017 to December 2019. An AE was defined as any mortality, an \\"unintended and undesirable diagnostic or therapeutic event\\", \\"an event that prolongs the patient's hospital stay\\", or an outcome with permanent or transient neurologic deficit. RESULTS: A total of 1096 AEs from 7418 total procedures (14.8 %) were identified. Of those, 418 (5.6 %) were in cerebrovascular, 249 (3.4 %) were in neuro-oncology and 429 (5.8 %) were in the spine & functional divisions. The most common AEs across all divisions were infection (17 %), hemorrhage (11 %) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak (7.8 %). Other AEs were indirectly related to the neurosurgical procedure, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (2.7 %), or pneumothorax (0.3 %).

We performed a retrospective chart review of adult patients admitted to a tertiary care center with moderate to critical SARS-CoV-2 infection. Disease severity was based on maximum oxygen requirement during hospital stay to maintain SpO2 > 93% (moderate, 0C3 L NC; severe, 4C6 L NC or non-rebreather; critical, HFNC, NIPPV, or MV). All patients were treated using the institutions treatment algorithm, which included consideration of tocilizumab for severe and critical disease. The most common cytokine elevations among all patients included IL-6, sIL2R, IFN-, and IL-10; patients who received tocilizumab had higher incidence of IL-6 and sIL2R elevations. Pre-tocilizumab IL-6 levels increased with disease severity (p = .0151). Both IL-6 and sIL2R levels significantly increased after administration of tocilizumab in all severity groups; IL-10 levels decreased in severe (p = .0203), but not moderate or critical, patients after they received tocilizumab.

METHODS The search method of this systematic synthesis without meta-analysis was guided by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews (PRISMA) and the new reporting guideline synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) in systematic reviews. A coherent search strategy was designed to retrieve articles in databases such as PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to June 2020. We excluded articles with eligibility criteria of the age of under 50 years old and studies conducted on patients with gestational diabetes. The outcomes were categorized into biomedical, behavioural, and psychosocial outcomes.

This report aimed to identify the main challenges faced by COVID-19 case investigators in Qatar and to suggest possible solutions to improve the case investigation process in managing future pandemics. Methods: Purposive sampling was used to select 40 COVID-19 case investigators posted at the Ministry of Public Health, Qatar. Interviewees were from diverse educational and cultural backgrounds and had been investigating COVID-19 cases for more than 6 months, at the time of interview. Face-toface semi-structured interviews were done to collect data which was anonymized before analyzing for the purpose of this qualitative study. Results: The most common concern faced in conducting case investigations was language barrier, given the multinational and diverse diasporas Qatar is host to. Authenticity of the investigation was a matter of suspicion for many patients;whereas the majority of the investigators opined that multiple calls received from different healthcare departments asking for information overwhelmed many patients. Laborers/migrant workers often did not divulge information due to fear of repercussions from their supervisors. Social stigma associated with COVID-191 caused reluctance to reveal the index case and close contacts. Information regarding social gatherings attended and public places visited was often concealed (Figure 1). Cultural differences as well hindered smooth investigation in a few cases. Rising case load at times put restraints on improved coordination between different health departments2 and structured guidance for investigators3 about the pandemic response system, which could help to deliver appropriate health services more efficiently.

It can be followed by adaptive focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of the study was to determine the expression pattern of lipid metabolism and selected kidney damage markers in obese adolescents and to identify potential factors which can predict CKD. METHODS: The study group consisted of 142 adolescents with a BMI z-score > 2. Sixty-two healthy and normal-weight individuals served as controls. The factors associated with the rate of glomerular filtration in obese adolescents were assessed by linear regression methods using univariate and multivariate analyses. The risk of developing CKD was estimated using the Fishers exact test. RESULTS: The study group was divided into elevated, normal, and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) patients. Increased urine galectin-3 (Gal-3) concentration was diagnosed in all patients. Decreased GFR subjects expressed increased urine concentration of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and daily megalin excretion. Thirty-nine study participants developed CKD. Increased uric acid (UA) concentration was associated with CKD development both in normal and decreased GFR patients. Additionally, in normal GFR patients, increased concentrations of cholesterol (Ch), triglycerides (TG), and NGAL were associated with CKD. CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum concentrations of Ch, TG, and UA and increased urine concentration of NGAL might predict CKD development in obese adolescents with normal and decreased GFR.

Since then, Australia has experienced unprecedented warming related to climate change and an associated increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, droughts, storms, bushfires and air pollution. These events have had major impacts on community physical and mental health. OBJECTIVE The aim of this article is to describe the health impacts of climate change and the role of general practitioners (GPs) in responding to these impacts. DISCUSSION While the clinical skills that underpin general practice have not changed, the environmental and planetary context has shifted. A 'planetary health' approach is required. Climate change should now be considered a health emergency. GPs have a critical role in mitigation and adaptation. Responding to climate change aligns with principles of preventive health and can produce 'co-benefits' for individual and population health.","output":"General practice in the era of planetary health: Responding to the climate health emergency."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cerebrovascular disease involves various medical disorders that obstruct brain blood vessels or deteriorate cerebral circulation, resulting in ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Nowadays, platinum coils with or without biological modification have become routine embolization devices to reduce the risk of cerebral aneurysm bleeding. Additionally, many intracranial stents, flow diverters, and stent retrievers have been invented with uniquely designed structures. To accelerate the translation of these devices into clinical usage, an in-depth understanding of the mechanical and material performance of these metal-based devices is critical. However, considering the more distal location and tortuous anatomic characteristics of cerebral arteries, present devices still risk failing to arrive at target lesions. Consequently, more flexible endovascular devices and novel designs are under urgent demand to overcome the deficiencies of existing devices. Herein, the pros and cons of the current structural designs are discussed when these devices are applied to the treatment of diseases ranging broadly from hemorrhages to ischemic strokes, in order to encourage further development of such kind of devices and investigation of their use in the clinic. Moreover, novel biodegradable materials and drug elution techniques, and the design, safety, and efficacy of personalized devices for further clinical applications in cerebral vasculature are discussed.","output":"Endovascular Metal Devices for the Treatment of Cerebrovascular Diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We explored the impact of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) emergency on the health of people with epilepsy (PwE) We also investigated their attitude toward telemedicine Methods: The PubMed database up to September 10, 2020 was searched for questionnaire-based studies conducted in PwE during the COVID-19 emergency, and the literature retrieved was reviewed In addition, all patients who had a telephone consultation with our center between May 7 and July 31, 2020 were invited to fill in a 57-item online questionnaire focusing on epilepsy and comorbidities, any changes in lifestyle or clinical conditions and any emergency-related problems arising during the COVID-19 emergency, and their views on telemedicine Associations between variables were detected through X (2) test and Fisher's exact test Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the effects of different factors on clinical conditions Results: Twelve studies met the literature search criteria They showed that the rate of seizure worsening during the emergency ranged from 4 to 35% and was mainly correlated with epilepsy severity, sleep disturbances and COVID-19-related issues Our questionnaire was filled in by 222 PwE or caregivers One hundred (76 6%) reported unchanged clinical conditions, 25 (11 3%) an improvement, and 27 (12%) a deterioration Reported clinical worsening was associated with a psychiatric condition and/or medication (OR = 12 59, p &lt; 0 001), sleep disorders (OR = 8 41, p = 0 001), limited access to healthcare (OR = 4 71, p = 0 016), and experiencing seizures during the emergency (OR = 4 51, p = 0 007) Telemedicine was considered acceptable by 116 subjects (52 3%) Conclusions: Most PwE did not experience a significant change in their clinical conditions during the COVID-19 emergency However, severity of epilepsy, concomitant disability, comorbid psychiatric conditions, sleep disorders and limited access to healthcare may affect their health","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on People With Epilepsy.

From early scattered regional outbreaks to current country-wide spread, and from rural areas to highly populated cities, the contagion exhibits diverse patterns at various timescales and locations. We thus conduct a graph frequency analysis to investigate the spread patterns of COVID-19 in different US counties. The commute flows between all 3142 US counties were used to construct a graph capturing the population mobility. The numbers of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases per county were collected and represented as graph signals, which were then mapped into the frequency domain via the graph Fourier transform. The concept of graph frequency in Graph Signal Processing (GSP) enables the decomposition of graph signals (i.e., daily confirmed cases) into modes with smooth or rapid variations with respect to the underlying mobility graph. These different modes of variability are shown to relate to COVID-19 spread patterns within and across counties. Changes in the nature of spread within geographical regions are also revealed by graph frequency analysis at finer temporal scales.

Whether they occur more frequently among persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those without is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of new diagnoses of select symptoms and conditions between 31 and 150 days after testing among persons who tested positive vs negative for SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study analyzed aggregated electronic health record data from 40 health care systems, including 338 024 persons younger than 20 years and 1 790 886 persons aged 20 years or older who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during March to December 2020 and who had medical encounters between 31 and 150 days after testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes were used to capture new symptoms and conditions that were recorded 31 to 150 days after a SARS-CoV-2 test but absent in the 18 months to 7 days prior to testing. The prevalence of new symptoms and conditions was compared between persons with positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 tests stratified by age (20 years or older and young than 20 years) and care setting (nonhospitalized, hospitalized, or hospitalized and ventilated). RESULTS: A total of 168 701 persons aged 20 years or older and 26 665 younger than 20 years tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 1 622 185 persons aged 20 years or older and 311 359 younger than 20 years tested negative. Shortness of breath was more common among persons with a positive vs negative test result among hospitalized patients (20 years: prevalence ratio [PR], 1.89 [99% CI, 1.79-2.01]; <20 years: PR, 1.72 [99% CI, 1.17-2.51]). Shortness of breath was also more common among nonhospitalized patients aged 20 years or older with a positive vs negative test result (PR, 1.09 [99% CI, 1.05-1.13]). Among hospitalized persons aged 20 years or older, the prevalence of new fatigue (PR, 1.35 [99% CI, 1.27-1.44]) and type 2 diabetes (PR, 2.03 [99% CI, 1.87-2.19]) was higher among those with a positive vs a negative test result. Among hospitalized persons younger than 20 years, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (PR, 2.14 [99% CI, 1.13-4.06]) was higher among those with a positive vs a negative test result; however, the prevalence difference was less than 1%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, among persons hospitalized after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, diagnoses of certain symptoms and conditions were higher than among those with a negative test result.

Some individuals are asymptomatic while others succumb to virus infection within days. Presently, the factors responsible for disease severity are not fully understood. One factor that may influence virus control is pre-existing immunity conferred by an individuals past exposures to common cold human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Here, we describe previous literature and a new, murine study designed to examine cross-reactive immune responses between SARS-CoV-2 and common cold HCoVs (represented by prototypes OC43, HKU1, 229E, and NL63). Experimental results have been mixed. In SARS-CoV-2-unexposed humans, cross-reactive serum antibodies were identified toward nucleocapsid (N) and the spike subunit S2. S2-specific antibodies were in some cases associated with neutralization. SARS-CoV-2-unexposed humans rarely exhibited antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit S1, and when na?ve mice were immunized with adjuvanted S1 from either SARS-CoV-2 or common cold HCoVs, S1-specific antibodies were poorly cross-reactive. When humans were naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2, cross-reactive antibodies that recognized common cold HCoV antigens increased in magnitude. Cross-reactive T cells, like antibodies, were present in humans prior to SARS-CoV-2 exposures and increased following SARS-CoV-2 infections. Some studies suggested that human infections with common cold HCoVs afforded protection against disease caused by subsequent exposures to SARS-CoV-2. Small animal models are now available for the testing of controlled SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Methods: We used a case-control design to compare HCW deaths related to COVID-19 (laboratory-confirmed) with three control groups (i.e., Non-HCW deaths, HCW non-deaths, and non-HCW non-deaths). Patient-level data with 33 variables, including COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, demographics, and various specific COVID symptoms reported by all states in the US, have been obtained from the Restricted Access Dataset by the US CDC since January 2020. A logistic regression model was used by regressing the outcome variable against each predictor while controlling for gender, age group, race, and ethnicity. Results: The percentages of 50-69 years old, Hispanics (8.7%), Black (32%), and Asian (23.1%) in HCW death were significantly higher than in their respective controls. The fatality and all severe indicators were higher among the deaths than non-deaths, but not different for HCWs than non-HCWs.

The insertion of a bronchoscope into an endotracheal tube (ETT) affects resistance, flow, and alveolar pressure. To improve airway management and ventilation during percutaneous tracheostomy, we developed a double lumen endotracheal tube (DLET). The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the linear constant of the Rohrer equation (K1), the nonlinear constant of the Rohrer equation (K2), the inspiratory and expiratory airway resistance, and ventilatory and airway pressures using the DLET with different standard sized ETTs. METHODS A trachea and lung model was used to compare the DLET to ETTs with 7, 7.5, and 8 mm inner diameters with and without a bronchoscope (4.5 mm external diameter), and 4 and 5 mm inner diameter ventilation tubes (F4, F5) of a translaryngeal tracheostomy. For each device, the pressure drop across the device and the Rohrer equation linear constant (K1) and nonlinear constant (K2) were calculated during a continuous flow of 10-90 L/min, the inspiratory and expiratory airway resistance values were calculated during volume controlled mechanical ventilation, and respiratory airway pressure values were calculated during volume and pressure controlled mechanical ventilation. RESULTS DLET had lower K2, pressure drop, and inspiratory and expiratory airway resistance compared with conventional ETTs plus fiberoptic bronchoscope. Furthermore, during mechanical ventilation, DLET had a lower value of peak pressure, mean pressure, and intrinsic PEEP than the other ETTs plus fiberoptic bronchoscope. CONCLUSIONS Use of the DLET during percutaneous dilational tracheostomy allows fiberoptic bronchoscopy without imposing excessive airway resistance.

However, direct evidence regarding the antiviral activities of this product still remains poorly documented. VERO E6 and CALU3 cell lines were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and cultured in the presence of 12.5 or 25 g/ml of a standardized Hydroalcoholic Extract acronym (sHEP) of Eurasian poplar type propolis and analyzed for viral RNA transcription, for cell damage by optical and electron microscopy, and for virus infectivity by viral titration at 2, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection. The three main components of sHEP, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, galangin, and pinocembrin, were tested for the antiviral power, either alone or in combination. On both cell lines, sHEP showed significant effects mainly on CALU3 up to 48 h, i.e., some protection from cytopathic effects and consistent reduction of infected cell number, fewer viral particles inside cellular vesicles, reduction of viral titration in supernatants, dramatic drop of N gene negative sense RNA synthesis, and lower concentration of E gene RNA in cell extracts. Interestingly, pre-treatment of cells with sHEP before virus inoculation induced these same effects described previously and was not able to block virus entry. When used in combination, the three main constituents of sHEP showed antiviral activity at the same levels of sHEP. sHEP has a remarkable ability to hinder the replication of SARS-CoV-2, to limit new cycles of infection, and to protect host cells against the cytopathic effect, albeit with rather variable results. However, sHEP do not block the virus entry into the cells. The antiviral activity observed with the three main components of sHEP used in combination highlights that the mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of sHEP is probably the result of a synergistic effect. These data add further emphasis on the possible therapeutic role of this special honeybees product as an adjuvant to official treatments of COVID-19 patients for its direct antiviral activity.","output":"In vitro Evaluation of Antiviral Efficacy of a Standardized Hydroalcoholic Extract of Poplar Type Propolis Against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Surgical Ambulatory Units have emerged to refine the management of unscheduled care with the aim of reducing admissions and offering timely, accurate treatment strategies.

The aim of the study is to analyze CT score in COVID-19 patients and explore its predictive value. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among confirmed COVID -19 patients with available CT images between February 8, 2020 and March 7, 2020. The lung was divided into six zones by the level of tracheal carina and the level of inferior pulmonary vein bilaterally on CT. Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy-paving pattern and overall lung involvement were rated by Likert scale of 0-4 or binary as 0 or 1. Global severity score for each targeted pattern was calculated as total score of six zones. RESULTS: There were 53 patients and 137 CT scans included in the study. There were 18(34%) of the patients classified as moderate cases while 35(66%) patients were severe/critical cases. Severe/critical patients had higher CT scores in several types of abnormalities than moderate patients from the second week to the fourth week post symptom onset. Overall lung involvement score in the second week demonstrated predictive value for severity with a sensitivity of 81.0% and specificity of 69.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Our modified semi-quantitative CT scoring system for COVID-19 patients demonstrated feasibility.

To investigate the effect of SIV and Bbr coinfection on cytokine and viral RNA expression, we performed a study in which pigs were inoculated with SIV, Bbr or both pathogens (SIV/Bbr). Our results indicate that Bbr infection alters SIV clearance. Pulmonary lesions in the SIV/Bbr group were more severe when compared to SIV or Bbr groups and Bbr did not cause significant lesions. Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was examined for inflammatory mediators by qPCR. Interferon (IFN)-, interleukin IL-8, IL-1 peaked in BALF at 2 DPI, while the virus titres and severity of clinical signs were maximal at the same time. Despite its increased expression in co-infected pigs, interferon- did not enhance SIV clearance, since the viral replication was detected at the same day as the highest IFN levels. The mRNA levels for IFN-, IL-1 and IL-8 were significantly higher in BALF of co-infected pigs and correlated with enhanced viral RNA titers in lungs, trachea and nasal swabs. Transcription of mRNA for IL-1 was stable in SIV and SIV/Bbr groups throughout all the study. In Bbr group, the levels of mRNAs for IL-1 were significantly higher at 2, 4 and 9 DPI. The mean levels of mRNAs for TNF- were lower than the levels of other chemokines and cytokines in all infected groups. Transcript levels of IL-10 and IL-4 did not increase at each time points.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 15 April and 14 May 2020, a multicentre cross-sectional survey was performed to study depression, anxiety and resilience in a sample of Spanish pregnant women during the lockdown set up by the Government in response to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. We designed an anonymous online self-administered questionnaire (https://bit.ly/34RRpq1) that included the Spanish validated versions of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Connor-Davidson Resilience 10-items Scale (CD-RISC-10). RESULTS: A total of 514 pregnant women completed the survey. 72.8% had been confined < 40 days and 27.2% between 41 and 60 days. 182 (35.4%) participants scored over 10, with 21.3% scoring over 13 (75th Percentile) in depressive symptoms rates. We found high trait and anxiety scores, with 223 (43.4%) and 227 (44.2%) pregnant women scoring over the trait and state mean scores.

Hence, we aimed to evaluate the impacts of vaccine characteristics, information on herd immunity, and general medical practitioner (GP) recommendation on vaccine hesitancy in a working-age population in Kolhapur, a town in Central Maharashtra in Western India. Methods & Materials In this survey, adults aged 18-64 years residing in Kolhapur, with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, were randomly selected in April-2021. Participants completed a questionnaire on their background and vaccination behavior-related variables, and were then randomly assigned according to a full factorial design to one of three groups to receive differing information on herd immunity and to one of two groups regarding GP recommendation of vaccination. Participants then completed a series of eight discrete choice tasks designed to assess vaccine acceptance or refusal based on hypothetical vaccine characteristics, risk of serious side-effects, location of manufacture, and place of administration. Responses were statistically analyzed. Results Responses were collected from 843 working-age adults, of whom 163 (19.33%) opted for no vaccination (outright vaccine refusal) and 680 (80.66%) did not. Here, outright vaccine refusal was associated with a lower perceived severity of COVID-19, whereas vaccine hesitancy was lower when herd immunity benefits were communicated and in working versus non-working individuals, and those with experience of COVID-19. For a mass vaccination campaign involving mass vaccination centers and communication of herd immunity benefits, our results predicted outright vaccine refusal in 23.6% (95% CI 19?7-28?4) of the Kolhapur working-age population. Predicted hesitancy was highest for vaccines manufactured in China with 50% efficacy and a 1 in 10,000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 27?4% [26?8-28?0]), and lowest for a vaccine manufactured in the USA with >90% efficacy and a 1 in 1,00,000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 73?6% [69.6-78?1]). Conclusion COVID-19 vaccine acceptance depends on the characteristics of vaccines and the national vaccination strategy, amongst various other factors, in the working-age population in Kolhapur.","output":"Hesitancy of COVID-19 vaccine in a working-age population in a town in Central Maharashtra in Western India: A survey based on vaccine characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes the clinical features, and diagnostic findings of a chronic respiratory condition in 29 West Highland white terriers. Typically, the dogs were coughing chronically, had dyspnoea and tachypnoea of varying severity, and had deteriorated progressively over months to years. The mean (sem) survival time in months from the clinical signs being first noted by the owners was 17.9 (2.3). Most cases had a combination of respiratory signs, but coughing was the predominant sign in 18 cases. Inspiratory crackles were audible on chest auscultation in 28 cases, 10 of which were also wheezing. Rhonchi were the predominant sound in the remaining case. The main radiographic changes were mild to severe increased Interstitial markings in all cases, with additional bronchial markings in 14 of the dogs. Right-sided cardiomegaly (cor pulmonale) was recorded in 15. Bronchoscopic findings in 17 of the dogs were either normal or involved a mild airway mucoid reaction in eight. Chronic mucosal changes were observed in eight, but in two this finding was equivocal. Dynamic changes to the lumen of the airway were present in seven cases. No significant haematological or biochemical changes could be detected in 20 cases, but four cases were hypercholestrolaemic. A histopathological assessment of four cases revealed alveolar septal fibrosis to be the predominant change. Prednisolone, with or without bronchodilators, was the most commonly used therapy, and the response was variable.

Maternal diet plays a key role in shaping children's diets; however, many mothers have poor diet quality, especially those living in low-income households. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is a federal nutrition assistance program that provides mothers and children with nutrient-dense foods, and those who participate have better diet quality. However, many mothers do not redeem all their WIC-approved foods. Thus, there is a need to create effective interventions to improve diet quality, especially among low-income children and families. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to describe the development and protocol for a study to evaluate the feasibility, satisfaction, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated text messaging intervention as a strategy to improve maternal diet quality and the redemption of WIC-approved foods. METHODS: We describe the use of the framework developed for the description of nonrandomized feasibility studies. Using an observational, prospective cohort study design, we will recruit mothers enrolled in WIC with a child aged 2 years. Participants will receive automated SMS text messages aimed at improving the redemption of WIC-approved foods to improve the participants diet quality for 12 weeks. All outcome measures will be analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Data collection for this study began in March 2021. We expect the study results to be available within 9 months of study commencement. The results will shed light on the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of using automated text messages as a behavior change strategy for mothers enrolled in WIC. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study will explore whether this digital behavioral intervention, which will deliver nutrition guidance in accordance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans using interactive self-monitoring and feedback, is feasible and acceptable. This will lay the foundation for a larger evaluation to determine efficacy for improving diet quality in those most at risk for obesity.

In Ghana, these measures are mandatory in public places and underpin COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC). We assessed adherence and appropriate performance of these measures among patrons of community convenience shops in selected hotspots. METHODS: we conducted a non-intrusive observation of patrons of convenience shops in COVID-19 burden hotspots. We observed patrons as they entered and exited the shops and collected data on their gender, adherence and appropriate use of face covering and hand hygiene facilities. Data were analyzed descriptively and inferentially to determine factors associated with adherence to IPC guidelines. RESULTS: of 800 patrons observed from eight community shops, 481 (60.1%) were males. Of these, 653 (81.6%) wore face covering and 98 (12.3%) performed hand hygiene; with 92 (11.5%) adhering to both measures. Patrons who wore face mask appropriately were 578; comprising 299 (92.3%) of patrons who wore face mask before entering the shops. Of 89 patrons who washed their hands, appropriate handwashing was recorded among nine (10.1%). Compared to inappropriate handwashing, appropriate handwashing was negatively associated with adherence to IPC guidelines [aOR=0.1 (95% CI=0.01-0.59)]. CONCLUSION: adherence to and appropriate performance of IPC measures of handwashing and use of face covering in the selected shops was low. There is the need to complement availability of IPC measures with intensification of risk communication messaging targeted at ensuring their appropriate use.","output":"Hand hygiene and face mask wearing practices for COVID-19 prevention: a non-intrusive observation of patrons of community convenience shops in Accra, Ghana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Standard hemodynamic monitoring such as blood pressure and pulse oximetry may only provide a crude estimation of organ perfusion in the critical care setting.

One of the options in the treatment is Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy when there is presence of required amount of neutralizing antibodies in the plasma of recovered COVID patients. Our objective was to analyze the challenges and the constraints encountered in motivation of COVID 19 recovered persons to come for the screening procedures and to convince the selected persons to come for Plasma donation voluntarily. MATERIAL & METHODS: The present retrospective observational study was conducted for a period of five and half months. Out of 1515 number of persons contacted telephonically for Plasma donation, 1291 persons came for screening of whom 1028 persons were eligible for donation, 263 cases were deferred and 966 persons finally donated. RESULTS: Maximum number of acceptance cases were from males-(98.7%). Of the accepted cases, (41.73%) were from the 18-30 years' age group. 33.94% were from blood group 'O' Rh D positive giving maximum contribution from any blood group. 38.3% of the accepted cases had resolution of all COVID symptoms within time period of 28-40 days.

Among informal working women, the CSG is an important source of income after childbirth when informal workers are unable to work, but reports suggest that women experience delays in accessing the CSG. We explore experiences and challenges of accessing the CSG among informal workers in Durban, South Africa. METHODS: We undertook a longitudinal mixed-methods cohort study. Women informal workers were recruited during pregnancy and followed-up for up to one year after the baby was born. Quantitative questionnaires and semi-structured in-depth interviews were used to collect data about womens plans for applying for the CSG, the application process, use of the CSG in the household, and household food insecurity. Interviews were conducted in IsiZulu by experienced researchers. Descriptive analysis of quantitative data used SPSS v26, and framework analysis using NVIVO v12.3 was used for qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-four informal working women were enrolled. The CSG received for older children was reported as an important and reliable source of income for mothers after childbirth. However, delays receiving the CSG for the new baby meant this support was unavailable to first-time mothers. The complex application process for the CSG required mothers to travel to various government departments to complete the required documentation, often taking the baby with them. This was costly and time-consuming for mothers who were already vulnerable, and led to delays in obtaining CSG funds. Many women experienced moderate or severe food insecurity before and after the baby was born. As a result, some mothers had to return to work earlier than planned, disrupting childcare and breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: Cash transfer programmes can effectively support low income households and improve outcomes for mothers and children. In South Africa there is a need for innovative approaches to streamline CSG applications, so women can access the funds immediately post-delivery to fill a resource gap and provide support at a vulnerable time for mothers and their children.","output":"Does the unconditional cash transfer program in South Africa provide support for women after child birth?

Telemedicine, virtual meetings and the strengthening of national and international networks, through research projects, were the nodal and common points. Due to their complexity, neuromuscular diseases had already taught clinicians the importance of multidisciplinary confrontation. COVID-19 has further strengthened the need to create links between clinicians and experts, even of different nationalities, in order to guarantee to patients the best possible care, but above all, access and continuity of care even in critical periods.

Design and Methods: Patients included in the study underwent a clinical evaluation and rapid antibody analysis on capillary blood for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus. Symptomatic patients were not included in the screening and immediately referred to local hospitals for further evaluation. Results: One-hundred seventy-three patients of both sexes were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection through rapid serological test.

This study assesses the effects of setting characteristics and the sociodemographic composition of crowds on group-level masking rates. METHODS: We conducted 123 site observations of masking behavior at public locations across Oklahoma (USA) between June and September 2020. We used analyses of variance and t-tests to examine variation in masking and ordinary least squares regression to model the effect of setting and sociodemographic characteristics on site-level masking rates. RESULTS: The masking rate across all sites averaged 34% but varied widely. Site-level masking rates were higher at metropolitan sites and sites with a store or municipal masking mandate. The masking rate at sites where women or older adults (60+) were the predominant group did not differ significantly from other sites. Ethnically diverse sites exhibited significantly higher masking rates compared with predominantly white sites. Findings indicate that setting characteristics explained a greater amount of variation in collective masking rates than sociodemographic differences. CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the importance of place and policy for mask adherence. In the absence of state-level mandates, masking policies at a more local level may be effective.","output":"Collective health behavior and face mask utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic in Oklahoma, USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to investigate the possible relationship between worse clinical outcomes and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A total of 247 adult patients (154 males, 93 females; mean age: 51.3  14.2 years) hospitalized for COVID-19 as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic and clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters were analyzed using various statistical modeling. Primary outcomes were defined as the need for intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, or occurrence of death. Of the patients, 48 were treated in the ICU with a high flow oxygen/noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV, n = 12) or mechanical ventilation (n = 36). Median length of ICU stay was 13 (range, 7C18) days. Mortality was seen in four of the ICU patients. Other patients were followed in the COVID-19 services for a median of 7 days.

Double reading of CT could increase the diagnostic confidence of radiological interpretation in COVID-19 patients in a pandemic area. Using second readers and a structured report for COVID-19 diagnosis could reduce the rate of discrepant cases between RT-PCR result and CT diagnosis for COVID-19 viral pneumonia. ABSTRACT: To assess the performance of the second reading of chest compute tomography (CT) examinations by expert radiologists in patients with discordance between the reverse transcription real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 viral pneumonia and the CT report. Three hundred and seventy-eight patients were included in this retrospective study (121 women and 257 men; 71 years median age, with a range of 29C93 years) and subjected to RT-PCR tests for suspicious COVID-19 infection. All patients were subjected to CT examination in order to evaluate the pulmonary disease involvement by COVID-19. CT images were reviewed first by two radiologists who identified COVID-19 typical CT patterns and then reanalyzed by another two radiologists using a CT structured report for COVID-19 diagnosis. Weighted k values were used to evaluate the inter-reader agreement. The median temporal window between RT-PCRs execution and CT scan was zero days with a range of (?9, 11) days. The RT-PCR test was positive in 328/378 (86.8%). Discordance between RT-PCR and CT findings for viral pneumonia was revealed in 60 cases. The second reading changed the CT diagnosis in 16/60 (26.7%) cases contributing to an increase the concordance with the RT-PCR. Among these 60 cases, eight were false negative with positive RT-PCR, and 36 were false positive with negative RT-PCR. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of CT were respectively of 97.3%, 53.8%, 89.0%, and 88.4%.

Little is known about how postpartum women who gave birth during the early months of the pandemic were impacted. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the associations between potential risk, protective factors, and psychological distress among postpartum women who gave birth during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Postpartum women over the age of 18 years who gave birth in the US hospitals between March and July of 2020 and spoke English completed a survey about their experiences. Demographic and health variables were measured via self-report. Stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale-10. Mastery was measured with the Pearlin Mastery Scale. Resilience was measured with the ConnorCDavidson Resilience Scale-2. RESULTS: This study included 885 women. Participants had higher stress and lower resilience relative to pre-pandemic norms. Participants had high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Women who had an infant admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit had more stress. Income, full-time employment, and partnered relationships were associated with lower stress. Resilience and mastery were related to lower stress, depression, and anxiety. Black, Indigenous, or People of Color women showed higher stress and lower resiliency. Single women were likely to report lower levels of mastery than partnered women. CONCLUSION: Stress, depression, and anxiety were high in postpartum women in this study. Income, partnered relationships, and employment security, along with protective traits such as mastery and resilience, may reduce the impact of stress on postpartum women in a pandemic. Care models should be modified to support women during a pandemic. Health disparities exist in postpartum stress. Future interventions should focus on building resiliency and mastery and ensuring appropriate resources are available to postpartum women in a pandemic.","output":"Postpartum stress and protective factors in women who gave birth in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the fashion and retail industry, a group of startups, referred to as Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) brands, are proliferating.

Akin to such reorganization efforts as creating patient-centered medical homes and primary care behavioral health integration, the WHS goes beyond by transforming the entire system to one that takes a proactive approach to support patient and employee health and wellness. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic disrupted the VAs healthcare system and added stress for staff and patients, creating an exogenous shock for this transformation towards a WHS. Objective: We examined the relationship between VAs WHS transformation and the pandemic to understand if transformation was sustained during crisis and contributed to VAs response. Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted as part of a multi-year study of WHS transformation. A single multi-person interview was conducted with 61 WHS leaders at 18 VA Medical Centers, examining WH transformation and use during the pandemic. Data were analyzed using rapid directed content analysis. Results: While the pandemic initially slowed transformation efforts, sites intentionally embraced a WH approach to support patients and employees during this crisis. Efforts included conducting patient wellness calls, and, for patients and employees, promoting complementary and integrative health therapies, self-care, and WH concepts to combat stress and support wellbeing. A surge in virtual technology use facilitated innovative delivery of complementary and integrative therapies and promoted continued use of WH activities. Conclusion: The pandemic called attention to the need for healthcare systems to address the wellbeing of both patients and providers to sustain high quality care delivery. At a time of crisis, VA sites sustained WH transformation efforts, recognizing WH as one strategy to support patients and employees. This response indicates cultural transformation is taking hold, with WH serving as a promising approach for promoting wellbeing among patients and employees alike.","output":"Leaning Into Whole Health: Sustaining System Transformation While Supporting Patients and Employees During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID19 has forced a sea change in the practice of dermatology across the world in 2020.

OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the organisation and the characteristics of consultations in Belgian out-of-hours primary care during five weekends at the peak of a COVID-19 outbreak and compares it to a similar period in 2019. METHODS: Real-time observational study using pseudonymised routine clinical data extracted out of reports from home visits, telephone- and physical consultations (iCAREdata). Nine general practice cooperatives (GPCs) participated covering a population of 1 513 523. RESULTS: All GPCs rapidly re-organised care in order to handle the outbreak and provide a safe working environment. The average consultation rate was 222 per 100 000 citizens per weekend. These consultations were handled by telephone alone in 40% (N = 6293). A diagnosis at risk of COVID-19 was registered in 6692 (43%) consultations,. Out of 5311 physical consultations, 1460 were at risk of COVID-19 of which 443 (30%) did not receive prior telephone consultation to estimate this risk. Compared to 2019, the workload initially increased due to telephone consultations but afterwards declined drastically. The physical consultation rate declined by 45% with a marked decline in diagnoses unrelated to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: General practitioners can rapidly re-organise out-of-hours care to handle patient flows during a COVID-19 outbreak. Forty percent of the out-of-hours primary care contacts are handled by telephone consultations alone.

Dual platelet/leukocyte G(13) knockout inhibited septic thrombosis and inflammation, further improving survival similar to MB2mP6.

Instead, the rate of transmission is significative higher, with a faster spread of the virus responsible of the worldwide outbreak and a significative higher mortality rate due to the development of a severe lung injury. Most noteworthy is the distribution of death rate among age groups. Children and younger people are almost protected from severe clinical presentation. Possible explanation of this phenomenon could be the ability of past vaccinations (especially tetanic, diphtheria toxoids and inactivated bacteria as pertussis) to stimulate immune system and to generate a scattered immunity against non-self antigens in transit, as coronaviruses and other community-circulating viruses and make immune system readier to develop specific immunity against Covid-19. The first support to this hypothesis is the distribution of mortality rate during historical pandemics (\\"Spanish flu\\" 1918, \\"Asian flu\\" 1956 and \\"the Hong Kong flu\\" 1968) among age groups before and after the introduction of vaccines. The immunological support to the hypothesis derives from recent studies about immunotherapy for malignancies, which propose the use of oncolytic vaccines combined with toxoids in order to exploit CD4 + memory T cell recall in supporting the ongoing anti-tumour response. According to this hypothesis vaccine formulations (tetanus, diphtheria, Bordetella pertussis) could be re-administrate after the first contact with Covid-19, better before the development of respiratory severe illness and of course before full-blown ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The CD4 + memory exploiting could help immune system to recall immunity of already know antigens against coronaviruses, avoiding or limiting \\"lung crash\\" until virus specific immunity develops and making it faster and prolonged. Finally, this administration could be helpful not only in already infected patients, but also before infection. In fact, people could have an immune system more ready when the contact with the Covid-19 will occur.","output":"SARS - CoV-2: Reasons of epidemiology of severe ill disease cases and therapeutic approach using trivalent vaccine (tetanus, diphtheria and Bordetella pertussis)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Combination therapy with peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis (PD+HD) is an alternative dialysis method for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

Methods: Randomized controlled study on 70 COVID-19 patients (48 mild-moderate, 11 severe, and 11 critical patients) treated with 200ug/kg PO of Ivermectin per day for 2-3 days along with 100mg PO doxycycline twice per day for 5-10 days plus standard therapy; the second arm is 70 COVID-19 patients (48 mild-moderate and 22 severe and zero critical patients) on standard therapy. The time to recovery, the progression of the disease, and the mortality rate were the outcome-assessing parameters. Results: among all patients and among severe patients, 3/70 (4.28%) and 1/11 (9%), respectively progressed to a more advanced stage of the disease in the Ivermectin-Doxycycline group versus 7/70 (10%) and 7/22 (31.81%), respectively in the control group (P>0.05). The mortality rate was 0/48 (0%), 0/11 (0%), and 2/11 (18.2%) in mild-moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 patients, respectively in Ivermectin-Doxycycline group versus 0/48 (0%), and 6/22 (27.27%) in mild-moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, respectively in standard therapy group (p=0.052).

It has created an unanticipated global public health crisis that is spreading rapidly in India as well, posing a serious threat to 1350 million persons. Among the factors, population density is foremost in posing a challenge in controlling the COVID-19 contagion. In such extraordinary times, evidence-based knowledge is the prime requisite for pacifying the effect. In this piece, we have studied the district wise transmissions of the novel coronavirus in five south Indian states until 20th July 2020 and its relationship with their respective population density. The five states are purposefully selected for their records in better healthcare infrastructure vis--vis other states in India. The study uses Pearson's correlation coefficient to account for the direct impact of population density on COVID-19 transmission rate. Response surface methodology approach is used to validate the correlation between density and transmission rate and spatiotemporal dynamics is highlighted using Thiessen polygon method. The analysis has found that COVID-19 transmission in four states (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana) strongly hinges upon the spatial distribution of population density. In addition, the results indicate that the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are likely to differ with demographic density.

Research into the human-nature relationship often considers how visits or time in nature are related to human wellbeing. Recently, the closeness of the human-nature relationship measured by nature connectedness, and built through noticing nature, has also been considered, although rarely in concert with nature visits. Further, the reciprocal benefits of pro-nature behaviours are often overlooked. Natural Englands People and Nature Survey (PANS) in the UK was conducted during the initial pandemic response and allows further analysis of these factors. Using PANS data we assessed a number of wellbeing outcomes (loneliness, life satisfaction, worthwhile life and happiness) and pro-nature behaviours as a function of longer-term physical time in nature and psychological connectedness to nature and shorter-term visits and noticing of nature. In a baseline analysis of longer-term factors nature connectedness and time in nature were both consistent significant predictors of wellbeing measures (apart from loneliness) and pro-nature conservation behaviours. Considered alone, without controlling for longer-term measures, short-term visits and noticing were again consistent and significant predictors of three wellbeing measures. There was also a weak significant association between increased noticing of nature and increased loneliness and recent visits to nature were not associated with pro-nature conservation behaviours. A combined regression highlighted the importance of a longer-term relationship with nature in all outcomes apart from loneliness, but also revealed that, even when considered in concert with longer-term factors, currently noticing nature had a role in feeling ones life was worthwhile life, pro-nature behaviours and loneliness.","output":"Nature Engagement for Human and Natures Wellbeing during the Corona Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) causes high amounts of morbidity and mortality worldwide every year. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a major pathogen of ARTIs in children. In this study, we aimed to investigate the epidemiology and genotypic diversity of HMPV in children hospitalized with ARTIs in Beijing, China. METHODS: Hospitalized children aged < 14 years with ARTIs were enrolled from April 2017 to March 2018; nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected and subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for HMPV. HMPV-positive samples were genotyped based on a partial N gene. Whole genome sequences were determined for samples with high viral loads. RESULTS: 4.08% (52/1276) enrolled paediatric patients were identified as having HMPV infection. The epidemic season is winter and early spring, children aged &#8804; 4 years were more susceptible to HMPV infection (47/52, 90.38%). The co-infection rate were 36.54% (19/52), the most common co-infected virus were influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. The main diagnoses of HMPV infection were pneumonia (29/52, 55.77%) and bronchitis (23/52, 44.23%), while the main clinical manifestations were cough, fever, rhinorrhoea, and sneeze. Among 48 HMPV-positive specimens, A2b (19/48, 39.58%) and B1 (26/48, 54.17%) were the main epidemic subtypes. Patients with HMPV genotype A infection had a higher viral load compared to genotype B patients (6.07 vs. 5.37 log10 RNA copies/ml). Five complete sequences of HMPV were obtained. This is the first report of a whole genome sequence of HMPV-B1 isolated in China. CONCLUSIONS: HMPV is an important respiratory pathogen in paediatric patients.

This systematic review evaluates the published literature on seasonal variation in surgical outcomes worldwide. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINHAL, and Web of Science were searched for studies on major surgical procedures, examining mortality or other patient-relevant outcomes, across seasonal periods up to February 2019. Major surgery was defined as a procedure requiring an overnight stay in an inpatient medical facility. We included studies exploring variation according to calendar and meteorological seasons and recurring annual events including staff turnover. Quality was assessed using an adapted Downs and Black scoring system. RESULTS The literature search identified 82 studies, including 22 210 299 patients from four continents. Because of the heterogeneity of reported outcomes and literature scope, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Mass staff changeover was investigated in 37 studies; the majority (22) of these did not show strong evidence of worse outcomes. Of the 47 studies that examined outcomes across meteorological or calendar seasons, 33 found evidence of seasonal variation. Outcomes were often worse in winter (16 studies). This trend was particularly prominent amongst surgical procedures classed as an 'emergency' (five of nine studies). There was evidence for increased postoperative surgical site infections during summer (seven of 12 studies examining this concept). CONCLUSION This systematic review provides tentative evidence for an increased risk of postoperative surgical site infections in summer, and an increased risk of worse outcomes after emergency surgery in winter and during staff changeover times.

The objective of the work is to identify SARS-CoV2 spike variants that emerged during the pandemic and evaluate their binding affinity with ACE2. Evolutionary analysis of 2178 SARS-CoV2 genomes identifies RBD variants that are under selection bias. The binding efficacy of these RBD variants to the ACE2 has been analyzed by using protein-protein docking and binding free energy calculations. Pan-proteomic analysis reveals 113 mutations among them 33 are parsimonious. Evolutionary analysis reveals five RBD variants A348T, V367F, G476S, V483A, and S494P are under strong positive selection bias. Variations at these sites alter the ACE2 binding affinity. A348T, G476S, and V483A variants display reduced affinity to ACE2 in comparison to the Wuhan SARS-CoV2 spike protein. While the V367F and S494P population variants display a higher binding affinity towards human ACE2. Reorientation of several crucial residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface facilitates additional hydrogen bond formation for the V367F variant which enhances the binding energy during ACE2 recognition. On the other hand, the enhanced binding affinity of S494P is attributed to strong interfacial complementarity between the RBD and ACE2.","output":"Evolutionary and structural analysis elucidates mutations on SARS-CoV2 spike protein with altered human ACE2 binding affinity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Preventive measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 are essential, but often cause social isolation, affecting the physical and mental health of older adults. Patients with dementia are likely to have worsening behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) owing to pandemic restrictions. To examine this, we described BPSD before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We identified patients at a memory clinic in Japan between October 2018 and December 2019 (15 months before the pandemic began, n = 1,384) and between April 2020 and June 2021 (15 months after the State of Emergency was declared;n = 675 patients). A propensity score was used to match 576 patients from each group. The Mini-Mental State Exam was used to classify cognitive function into mild and moderate/severe. Dementia Behavioral Disturbance Scale was used to evaluate BPSD. The association between BPSD before and during the pandemic was evaluated using binomial logistic regression models. Results The levels of frequent night waking were higher in individuals before the pandemic than in those evaluated during the pandemic in both the mild group [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.82, 95% CI 1.02C3.23] and the moderate/severe group (AOR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.19C3.23).

Following the state of emergency declaration, state governors began to issue stay at home orders to prevent the spread of the virus within the community. These Executive Orders raised constitutional questions. Many challenges to these Orders stemmed from houses of worship. Based on the concept of neutral and generally applicable laws, the Supreme Court has upheld these Executives Orders.

We recorded information pertaining to patient demographics (age, gender), smoking history, comorbid conditions (such as cancer, cardiovascular and other diseases), vital signs (temperature, oxygen saturation), and available laboratory data (such as WBC count and CRP). Two thoracic radiologists performed the qualitative assessment of all CXRs based on the RALE score for assessing the severity of lung involvement. All CXRs were processed with a commercial AI algorithm to obtain the percentage of the lung affected with findings related to COVID-19 (AI score). Independent t- and chi-square tests were used in addition to multiple logistic regression with Area Under the Curve (AUC) as output for predicting disease outcome and the need for mechanical ventilation. The RALE and AI scores had a strong positive correlation in CXRs from each site (r2 = 0.79-0.86; p < 0.0001). Patients who died or received mechanical ventilation had significantly higher RALE and AI scores than those with recovery or without the need for mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001).

To elucidate the effect of type I IFN on the Jak/stat pathway in salmonid alphavirus subtype 3 (SAV3) infected macrophage/dendritic like TO-cells derived from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L) headkidney leukocytes, we used a differential transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGGs) pathway analysis to generate a repertoire of de novo assembled genes from type I IFN treated and non-treated TO-cells infected with SAV3. RESULTS: Concurrent SAV3 infection with type I IFN treatment of TO-cells suppressed SAV3 structural protein (SP) expression by 2log(10) at 2 days post infection compared to SAV3 infection without IFN treatment which paved way to evaluating the impact of type I IFN on expression of Jak/stat pathway genes in SAV3 infected TO-cells. In the absence of type I IFN treatment, SAV3 downregulated several Jak/stat pathway genes that included type I and II receptor genes, Jak2, tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2), Stat3 and Stat5 pointing to possible failure to activate the Jak/stat signaling pathway and inhibition of signal transducers caused by SAV3 infection. Although the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) genes 1 and 3 were upregulated in the IFN treated cells, only SOCS3 was downregulated in the SAV3 infected cells which points to inhibition of SOCS3 by SAV3 infection in TO-cells. CONCLUSION: Data presented in this study shows that SAV3 infection downregulates several genes of the Jak/stat pathway, which could be an immune evasion strategy, used to block the transcription of antiviral genes that would interfere with SAV3 replication in TO-cells. Overall, we have shown that combining de novo assembly with pathway based transcriptome analyses provides a contextual approach to understanding the molecular networks of genes that form the Jak/stat pathway in TO-cells infected by SAV3.","output":"A de novo transcriptome analysis shows that modulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway by salmonid alphavirus subtype 3 favors virus replication in macrophage/dendritic-like TO-cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID\\\\19 emergency, people around the world are debating concepts like physical distancing, lockdown, and sheltering in place.

The EDNA-22 tablet is a portable virtual rehabilitation-based system that provides a viable option for home-based rehabilitation using a suite of tailored movement tasks, and performance monitoring via cloud computing data storage. The study reported here aimed to compare use of the EDNA system with an active control (Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary ProgramGRASP training) group using a parallel RCT design. METHODS: Of 19 originally randomized, 17 acute-care patients with upper-extremity dysfunction following unilateral stroke completed training in either the treatment (n = 10) or active control groups (n = 7), each receiving 8-weeks of in-home training involving 30-min sessions scheduled 3C4 times weekly. Performance was assessed across motor, cognitive and functional behaviour in the home. Primary motor measures, collected by a blinded assessor, were the Box and Blocks Task (BBT) and 9-Hole Pegboard Test (9HPT), and for cognition the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Functional behaviour was assessed using the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) and Neurobehavioural Functioning Inventory (NFI). RESULTS: One participant from each group withdrew for personal reasons. No adverse events were reported. Results showed a significant and large improvement in performance on the BBT for the more-affected hand in the EDNA training group, only (g = 0.90). There was a mild-to-moderate effect of training on the 9HPT for EDNA (g = 0.55) and control (g = 0.42) groups, again for the more affected hand. In relation to cognition, performance on the MoCA improved for the EDNA group (g = 0.70). Finally, the EDNA group showed moderate (but non-significant) improvement in functional behaviour on the SIS (g = 0.57) and NFI (g = 0.49). CONCLUSION: A short course of home-based training using the EDNA-22 system can yield significant gains in motor and cognitive performance, over and above an active control training that also targets upper-limb function. Intriguingly, these changes in performance were corroborated only tentatively in the reports of caregivers. We suggest that future research consider how the implementation of home-based rehabilitation technology can be optimized. We contend that self-administered digitally-enhanced training needs to become part of the health literacy of all stakeholders who are impacted by stroke and other acquired brain injuries.

The extent to which neighborhood characteristics and comorbidity explain these disparities is unclear. Outcomes in Asian American populations have not been explored. OBJECTIVE: To compare COVID-19 outcomes based on race and ethnicity and assess the association of any disparities with comorbidity and neighborhood characteristics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted within the New York University Langone Health system, which includes over 260 outpatient practices and 4 acute care hospitals. All patients within the systems integrated health record who were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between March 1, 2020, and April 8, 2020, were identified and followed up through May 13, 2020. Data were analyzed in June 2020. Among 11 547 patients tested, outcomes were compared by race and ethnicity and examined against differences by age, sex, body mass index, comorbidity, insurance type, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. EXPOSURES: Race and ethnicity categorized using self-reported electronic health record data (ie, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian, and multiracial/other patients). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The likelihood of receiving a positive test, hospitalization, and critical illness (defined as a composite of care in the intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice, or death). RESULTS: Among 9722 patients (mean [SD] age, 50.7 [17.5] years; 58.8% women), 4843 (49.8%) were positive for COVID-19; 2623 (54.2%) of those were admitted for hospitalization (1047 [39.9%] White, 375 [14.3%] Black, 715 [27.3%] Hispanic, 180 [6.9%] Asian, 207 [7.9%] multiracial/other). In fully adjusted models, Black patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6) and Hispanic patients (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7) were more likely than White patients to test positive. Among those who tested positive, odds of hospitalization were similar among White, Hispanic, and Black patients, but higher among Asian (OR, 1.6, 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) and multiracial patients (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9) compared with White patients. Among those hospitalized, Black patients were less likely than White patients to have severe illness (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.8) and to die or be discharged to hospice (hazard ratio, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients in a large health system in New York City, Black and Hispanic patients were more likely, and Asian patients less likely, than White patients to test positive; once hospitalized, Black patients were less likely than White patients to have critical illness or die after adjustment for comorbidity and neighborhood characteristics. This supports the assertion that existing structural determinants pervasive in Black and Hispanic communities may explain the disproportionately higher out-of-hospital deaths due to COVID-19 infections in these populations.","output":"Assessment of Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Hospitalization and Mortality in Patients With COVID-19 in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 has been noted to be one of major calamity the world over, in which the majority of efforts in research and development have been dedicated towards combating the threat of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).

With regard to the current and future complicated conditions, health system financing is also likely to succeed if it can anticipate the impacts of effective factors in the future and further plan appropriate interventions ahead of time. Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop scenarios for the health system financing in Iran. METHODS This mixed-design research of exploratory future studies type was conducted using the scenario method. In this respect, the key variables were evaluated using a questionnaire from two aspects of importance and uncertainty as well as formation of a future studies group (focus group). Finally, sensitivity analysis was carried out through cross-impact balance (CIB) analysis using the Scenario Wizard (Version 4.31) software. RESULTS A total of 25 factors were selected based on the type and the position of the variables (driving force, bi-dimensional, risk, secondary leverage or modifiable-to-secondary leverage) over the diameter of the MICMAC chart. Considering the degree of significance and uncertainty, eight variables including all four driving force variables (oil sales and economic blockade, leadership and advocacy, bureaucracy and corruption, and possibility of using information technology in providing services), as well as the variables of resource sustainability, natural disasters, regional security, and specialization culture were chosen. Then, five variables were finalized as the key changes that would create the scenario based on sensitivity analysis and final expert opinions. According to the defined conditions, 270 scenarios were developed, of which fourteen scenarios were identified as poorly adaptable and five cases as highly adaptable. CONCLUSION The best scenario identified in this study based on the degree of adaptation included the use of massive technology and oil sales, mediocre economic conditions with high probability of occurrence, strong leadership and advocacy, high regional security, as well as bureaucracy and low corruption with medium probability of occurrence.","output":"Future Financing Scenarios for Iran's Healthcare System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fast testing can help mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

The resulting disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019), soon became a pandemic. This study aims to characterize key attributes of the epidemiology of this infection in China. Methods: An age-stratified mathematical model was constructed to describe the transmission dynamics and estimate the age-specific differences in the biological susceptibility to the infection, age-assortativeness in transmission mixing, case fatality rate (CFR), and transition in rate of infectious contacts (and reproduction number R0) following introduction of mass interventions. Results: The model estimated the infectious contact rate in early epidemic at 0.59 contacts per day (95% uncertainty interval (UI)=0.48-0.71). Relative to those 60-69 years of age, susceptibility to the infection was only 0.06 in those 19 years, 0.34 in 20-29 years, 0.57 in 30-39 years, 0.69 in 40-49 years, 0.79 in 50-59 years, 0.94 in 70-79 years, and 0.88 in 80 years. The assortativeness in transmission mixing by age was very limited at 0.004 (95% UI=0.002-0.008). Final CFR was 5.1% (95% UI=4.8-5.4%).

Using whole blood SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation assays, IFN- ELISPOT assays, flow cytometry, ex vivo viral-specific T-cell expansion assays and deep T-cell receptor (TCR)  sequencing, we found that exercise robustly mobilized highly functional SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells to the blood compartment that recognized spike protein, membrane protein, nucleocapsid antigen and the B.1.1.7 -variant, and consisted mostly of CD3+/CD8+ T-cells and double-negative (CD4-/CD8-) CD3+ T-cells. The magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell mobilization with exercise was intensity dependent and robust when compared to T-cells recognizing other viruses (e.g. CMV, EBV, influenza). Vaccination enhanced the number of exercise-mobilized SARS-CoV-2 T-cells recognizing spike protein and the -variant only.

METHODS: Male rats (226?301 g, n = 49) under isoflurane anesthesia had their tail vein cannulated for drug administration and their tail artery cannulated for analysis of mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse rate (PR), and arterial blood gases (PaO(2), PaCO(2), pH). After recovery, one set of rats received normal saline for control recording and was then divided into three experimental groups, two receiving dexmedetomidine (5 or 50 gkg(?1)) and one receiving normal saline (n = 7 per group). Another set of rats was divided into four groups receiving dexmedetomidine (50 gkg(?1)) followed 5 min later by 0.5 or 1 mg?kg(?1) atipamezole (selective (2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) or efaroxan ((2)-adrenoceptor/I(1) receptor antagonist) (n = 6 or 8 per group). Recordings were performed 15 min after normal saline or dexmedetomidine administration. RESULTS: Compared with normal saline, dexmedetomidine (5 and 50 gkg(?1)) decreased respiratory frequency (f(R), p = 0.04 and < 0.01, respectively), PR (both p < 0.01), and PaO(2) (p = 0.04 and < 0.01), and increased tidal volume (both p = 0.049). Dexmedetomidine at 5 gkg(?1) did not significantly change minute ventilation (V(E)) (p = 0.87) or MAP (p = 0.24), whereas dexmedetomidine at 50 gkg(?1) significantly decreased V(E) (p = 0.03) and increased MAP (p < 0.01). Only dexmedetomidine at 50 gkg(?1) increased PaCO(2) (p < 0.01). Dexmedetomidine (5 and 50 gkg(?1)) significantly increased blood glucose (p < 0.01), and dexmedetomidine at 50 gkg(?1) increased hemoglobin (p = 0.04). Supplemental atipamezole or efaroxan administration similarly prevented the 50 gkg(?1) dexmedetomidine-related cardiorespiratory changes.

Having little access to their social networks and support systems, people have had to turn to digital tools and spaces to cope with their experiences of anxiety and loss. With no clear end to the pandemic in sight, many of us are likely to remain reliant upon DMH for the foreseeable future. As such, it is important to articulate some of the specific ways in which the pandemic is affecting our self and world-relation, such that we can identify how DMH services are best able to accommodate some of the newly emerging needs of their users. In this paper I will identify a specific type of loss brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and present it as an important concept for DMH. I refer to this loss as loss of perceptual world-familiarity. Loss of perceptual world-familiarity entails a breakdown in the ongoing effortless responsiveness to our perceptual environment that characterizes much of our everyday lives. To cash this out I will turn to insights from the phenomenological tradition. Initially, my project is descriptive. I aim to bring out how loss of perceptual world-familiarity is a distinctive form of loss that is deeply pervasive yet easily overlookedhence the relevance of explicating it for DMH purposes. But I will also venture into the space of the normative, offering some reasons for seeing perceptual world-familiarity as a component of well-being. I conclude the paper with a discussion of how loss of perceptual world-familiarity affects the therapeutic setting now that most if not all therapeutic interactions have transitioned to online spaces and I explore the potential to augment these spaces with social interaction technologies. Throughout, my discussion aims to do justice to the reality that perceptual world-familiarity is not an evenly distributed phenomenon, that factors like disability, gender and race affect its robustness, and that this ought to be reckoned with when seeking to incorporate the phenomenon into or mitigate it through DMH services.","output":"Perceptual breakdown during a global pandemic: introducing phenomenological insights for digital mental health purposes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We previously reported that in mice with large progressing T\\\\cell lymphoma tumours, dysfunctions in the antitumour CTL activity occur, associated with an accumulation of splenic arginase\\\\producing myeloid suppressor cells (MSCs).

Currently, there is no specific treatment for Hashimoto thyroiditis. We hypothesize that acupuncture can halt or delay the progression of HT and improve fertility in child-bearing period female. We therefore designed a randomized controlled trial to test this hypothesis by comparing the therapeutic effect of acupuncture vs sham acupuncture in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis. METHODS: In this randomized controlled study, a total of 284 eligible patients will be assigned to acupuncture group (na??=a??142) or sham acupuncture group (na??=a??142) in a 1:1 ratio. All patients will receive 36 sessions in total for 12 consecutive weeks with the same acupoint prescription (RN23, ST9, RN17, RN4, RN6, ST36, SP6, KI6). The primary assessment is the titers of thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb). Secondary outcomes include the thyroid function, ovarian function, the rate of primary ovarian insufficiency, and pregnancy outcome. The thyroid function and thyroid antibodies tests will be measured at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 after randomization. The ovarian function will be examined on the 2nd to 4th day of the menstrual period in the 1st month, 2nd month and 3rd month compared with baseline.

A novel SARS-associated coronavirus was identified as its principal etiologic agent; however, the immunopathogenesis of SARS and the role of special CTLs in virus clearance are still largely uncharacterized. In this study, potential HLA-A*0201-restricted spike (S) and nucleocapsid protein-derived peptides were selected from an online database and screened for potential CTL epitopes by in vitro refolding and T2 cell-stabilization assays. The antigenicity of nine peptides which could refold with HLA-A*0201 molecules was assessed with an IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay to determine the capacity to stimulate CTLs from PBMCs of HLA-A2(+) SARS-recovered donors. A novel HLA-A*0201-restricted decameric epitope P15 (S411-420, KLPDDFMGCV) derived from the S protein was identified and found to localize within the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor-binding region of the S1 domain. P15 could significantly enhance the expression of HLA-A*0201 molecules on the T2 cell surface, stimulate IFN-gamma-producing CTLs from the PBMCs of former SARS patients, and induce specific CTLs from P15-immunized HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice in vivo. Furthermore, significant P15-specific CTLs were induced from HLA-A2.1-transgenic mice immunized by a DNA vaccine encoding the S protein; suggesting that P15 was a naturally processed epitope.

METHODS: We compared clinical and laboratory results from 719 influenza and 973 COVID-19 patients from January to April 2020. We compiled laboratory results from the first 14 days of the hospitalized patients using parameters that are most significantly different between COVID-19 and influenza and hierarchically clustered COVID-19 patients. FINDINGS: Compared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 exhibited a continued increase in white blood cell count, rapid decline of hemoglobin, more rapid increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and D-dimer, and higher level of alanine transaminase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and fibrinogen. COVID-19 patients were sub-classified into 5 clusters through a hierarchical clustering analysis. Medical records were reviewed and patients were risk stratified based on the clinical outcomes. The cluster with the highest risk showed 278% fatality, 94% ICU admission, 94% intubation, and 28% discharge rates compared to 0%, 38%, 22%, and 88% in the lowest risk cluster, respectively. Patients in the highest risk cluster had leukocytosis including neutrophilia and monocytosis, severe anemia, increased red blood cell distribution width, higher BUN, creatinine, D-dimer, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and troponin.

Here, we show that the 'interleukin 1 (IL-1)-interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra)' axis regulates vaccine-mediated systemic inflammation in a host-specific manner. In human immune cells, RNA vaccines induce production of IL-1 cytokines, predominantly IL-1?, which is dependent on both the RNA and lipid formulation. IL-1 in turn triggers the induction of the broad spectrum of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-6). Unlike humans, murine leukocytes respond to RNA vaccines by upregulating anti-inflammatory IL-1ra relative to IL-1 (predominantly IL-1), protecting mice from cytokine-mediated toxicities at >1,000-fold higher vaccine doses. Thus, the IL-1 pathway plays a key role in triggering RNA vaccine-associated innate signaling, an effect that was unexpectedly amplified by certain lipids used in vaccine formulations incorporating N1-methyl-pseudouridine-modified RNA to reduce activation of Toll-like receptor signaling.","output":"IL-1 and IL-1ra are key regulators of the inflammatory response to RNA vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"About 15 years ago, Patient Blood Management (PBM) emerged as a new paradigm in perioperative medicine and rapidly found support of all major medical societies and government bodies.

Respiratory care, early mobilization, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation were started in the ad hoc isolation ward of our rehabilitation center. At baseline, muscle function was consistent with intensive care unit-acquired weakness and the patient still needed mechanical ventilation (MV) and oxygen support. During the first week of RRP in isolation, the patient was successfully weaned from MV, the tracheal cannula was removed, and the walking capacity was recovered. At the end of the RRP, continued in a standard department, respiratory muscles strength increased by 7% and muscle function improved as indicated by the quadriceps size enlargement of 13% and the change of the Medical Research Council sum score from 48/60 to 58/60.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All queries spontaneously delivered through the WhatsApp instant messaging system commonly used by patients to communicate with oncology units were collected and grouped by homology in five categories. Responses to the queries were given according to recommendations by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology through WhatsApp and by subsequent phone calls. Patients were also classified according to the site of the primary tumor, stage of disease, and current treatments. Analysis of the association between these data and queries was carried out. RESULTS: The social scenario in Italy is a nationwide lockdown except for hospitals, pharmacies, and food supplies. Overall, 446 different patients' WhatsApp conversations were analyzed between March 1 and March 13 and comprised the following: requirement of visit delay by patients undergoing oral therapies or in follow-up, delays in chemotherapy or immunotherapy administration, queries about possible immunosuppression, and changes in lifestyle or daily activities.

An ongoing randomized, parallel group, non-inferiority trial comparing surgery and non-operative treatment for unstable Weber B-type ankle fractures with allocation ratio 1:1. The rationale for non-inferiority design is as follows: By being able to prove non-inferiority of non-operative treatment, we would be able to avoid complications related to surgery. However, the primary concern related to non-operative treatment is increased risks of ankle mortise incongruency, leading to secondary surgery, early post-traumatic osteoarthritis and poor function.

In the present study, we aim to explore the role and mechanism of MBD2 in the pathogenesis of ALI. We have found that MBD2 expression, in parallel to apoptosis, increased in alveolar epithelial cells of mice treated with LPS, knockout of MBD2 reduced apoptosis and protected mice from LPS-induced ALI. In MLE-12 cells, a cell line of murine alveolar epithelial cells, LPS induced MBD2 expression and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Knockdown of MBD2 with shRNA alleviated, while overexpression of MBD2 increased LPS-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, intracellular zinc level decreased when MLE-12 cells were treated with LPS. MBD2 knockdown restored intracellular zinc level after LPS treatment, and MBD2 overexpression further aggravated LPS-induced intracellular zinc loss. Metal transcription factor 1 (MTF1) is a critical transcription factor in charge of intracellular zinc efflux. LPS treatment induced MTF1 expression both in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of MTF1 reduced LPS-induced apoptosis in MLE-12 cells. MBD2 could bind to the promoter region of MTF1 and promote MTF1 expression.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions in health care services, which led to the increase in adoption of digital health technologies, mostly arising out of need and necessity. OBJECTIVE: Focusing on the prevailing situations (increasing reliance on digital health services), this study investigates the impact of digital health technologies from the perspectives of policymakers and citizens. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was adopted. Twenty-seven semi-structured online interviews were conducted with experts and policymakers for assessing the impact from policymakers' perspectives. An online survey questionnaire instrument was used to collect the responses from 1698 Saudi Arabian citizens in relation to the various aspects of digital health applications. RESULTS: Health care expenditures increased during the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in launch of various digital health applications. While policymakers defended their stand in improving health care services and accessibility; citizens reflected inability to book medicines/personal medical equipment online (Mean=2.4) and suffered a lack of personalized care (Mean=2.9) through digital health applications. Moreover, disparities exist between the population groups with respect to the accessibility, utilization, and perceptions of digital health technologies. CONCLUSION: Policymakers have to consider and address these differences in formulating digital health policies and implementing them.","output":"Understanding the Impact of Digital Health Strategies During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Investigations into new technologies, employment and working conditions are timeless and consequently have occupied research, public policy, and popular fiction for centuries. However, in addition to the uncertainty created by the introduction of new technologies, the current coronavirus pandemic, with its associated impact on health and the economy, has led to increased volatility across the globe. The global medical crisis arising from the worldwide spread of COVID-19 is predicted to lead to a global economic crisis and subsequent deep depression. The resultant economic, social and political repercussions are likely to be felt for years or even decades to come, equalling the great depression of the last century. Consequently, it is difficult to make long-term accurate predictions about the impact of new technologies on industry, society, and labour. In this context, the aim of this introductory article to the themed volume is to consider the potential challenges and opportunities associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and potential impacts on work and workplaces.

Although much has been learned about COVID-19, we do not know much about its neurological features and their outcome. This observational study was conducted on the patients of Imam Hossein Hospital, and 361 adult patients (214 males) with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 5, 2020 to April 3, 2020, were enrolled. Data was gathered on age, sex, comorbidities, initial symptoms, symptoms during the disease course, neurological symptoms, and outcome. The mean age of the patients was 61.90  16.76 years. The most common initial symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea. In 21 patients (5.8%), the initial symptom was neurological. History of dementia was associated with severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio = 1.28). During the course of the disease, 186 patients (51.52%) had at least one neurological symptom, the most common being headache (109 [30.2%]), followed by anosmia/ageusia (69, [19.1%]), and dizziness (54, [15%]). Also, 31 patients had neurological complications (8.58%). Anosmia, ageusia, dizziness, and headache were associated with favorable outcome (P < 0.001), while altered mental status and hemiparesis were associated with poor outcome. The mortality rate of patients who had neurological complications was more than twice than that of patients without neurological complication (P = 0.008). Almost half of the patients experienced at least one neurological symptom, which may be the initial presentation of COVID-19. Dementia appears to be associated with severe COVID-19.

METHODS: 251 TAVR procedures with the implantation of self-expanding valves after predilatation were analyzed. SCB systems were used in 166 and NCB systems in 85 patients. The primary endpoint was defined as device success, a composite endpoint comprising the absence of procedural mortality, correct valve positioning, adequate valve performance and the absence of more than a mild paravalvular leak. The secondary endpoints were chosen in accordance with the valve academic research consortium (VARC-2) endpoint definitions. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed with regard to procedural device success between the SCB- and NCB cohort (SCB: 142 [85.5%%] vs. NCB: 77 [90.6%]; P = .257). There was a notable difference between the rates of conversion to open surgery and the postdilatation rate, both of which were higher for the NCB group (SCB: 1 [0.6%] vs. NCB: 4 [5.1%]; P = .042; SCB: 30 [18.1%] vs. NCB: 34 [40%]; P < .001). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the use of semi-compliant balloon systems for predilatation was associated with a lower risk for postdilatation (OR: 0.296; 95% CI: 0.149-0.588) and conversion to open surgery (OR: 0.205; 95% CI: 0.085-0.493; P = .001) but not for device success. CONCLUSION: While the balloon compliance did not affect the procedural mortality, device success or the rate of paravalvular leakage, the use of semi-compliant balloons for predilatation during TAVR should be investigated in larger randomized trials in the light of the lower rates of postdilatation and conversion to open surgery compared to their non-compliant counterparts.","output":"The use of semi-compliant versus non-compliant balloon systems for predilatation during the implantation of self-expandable transcatheter aortic valves: Data from the VIenna CardioThOracic Aortic Valve RegistrY (VICTORY)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This review describes the considerations for the design and implementation of a hybrid cardiac rehabilitation (HYCR) program, a patient-individualized combination of facility-based cardiac rehabilitation (FBCR) with virtual cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and/or remote CR. REVIEW METHODS To help meet the goal of the Millions Hearts Initiative to increase CR participation to 70% by 2022, a targeted review of the literature was conducted to identify studies pertinent to the practical design and implementation of an HYCR program. Areas focused upon included the current use of HYCR, exercise programming considerations (eligibility and safety, exercise prescription, and patient monitoring), program assessments and outcomes, patient education, step-by-step instructions for billing and insurance reimbursement, patient and provider engagement strategies, and special considerations. SUMMARY A FBCR is the first choice for patient participation in CR, as it is supported by an extensive evidence base demonstrating effectiveness in decreasing cardiac and overall mortality, as well as improving functional capacity and quality of life. However, to attain the CR participation rate goal of 70% set by the Million Hearts Initiative, CR programming will need to be expanded beyond the confines of FBCR. In particular, HYCR programs will be necessary to supplement FBCR and will be particularly useful for the many patients with geographic or work-related barriers to participation in an FBCR program.

This study aimed to assess refugee clinician perspectives on mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically access to and delivery of community mental health care services. We utilized a mixed methods design. We surveyed members of a national network of Canadian clinicians caring for refugees and migrants. Seventy-seven clinicians with experience caring for refugee populations, representing an 84% response rate, participated in the online survey, 11 of whom also participated in semi-structured interviews. We report three major themes: exacerbation of mental health issues and inequities in social determinants of health, and decreased access to integrated primary care and community migrant services. Clinicians reported major challenges delivering care during the first 6 months of the pandemic related to access to care and providing virtual care. Clinicians described perspectives on improving the management of refugee mental health, including increasing access to community resources and virtual care. The majority of clinicians reported that technology-assisted psychotherapy appears feasible to arrange, acceptable and may increase health equity for their refugee patients. However, major limitations of virtual care included technological barriers, communication and global mental health issues, and privacy concerns. In summary, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated social and health inequities within refugee and migrant populations in Canada and challenged the way mental health care is traditionally delivered.

A region of the Spike protein (S) of the virus, identified as the fusion peptide (FP), is liberated at its N-terminal site by a specific cleavage occurring in concert with the interaction of the receptor binding domain of the Spike. Studies have shown that penetration is enhanced by the required binding of Ca2+ ions to the FPs of corona viruses, but the mechanisms of membrane insertion and destabilization remain unclear. We have predicted the preferred positions of Ca2+ binding to the SARS-CoV-2-FP, the role of Ca2+ ions in mediating peptide-membrane interactions, the preferred mode of insertion of the Ca2+-bound SARS-CoV-2-FP and consequent effects on the lipid bilayer from extensive atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and trajectory analyses. In a systematic sampling of the interactions of the Ca2+-bound peptide models with lipid membranes SARS-CoV-2-FP penetrated the bilayer and disrupted its organization only in two modes involving different structural domains. In one, the hydrophobic residues F833/I834 from the middle region of the peptide are inserted. In the other, more prevalent mode, the penetration involves residues L822/F823 from the LLF motif which is conserved in CoV-2-like viruses, and is achieved by the binding of Ca2+ ions to the D830/D839 and E819/D820 residue pairs. FP penetration is shown to modify the molecular organization in specific areas of the bilayer, and the extent of membrane binding of the SARS-CoV-2 FP is significantly reduced in the absence of Ca2+ ions. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights regarding the role of Ca2+ in mediating SARS-CoV-2 fusion and provide a detailed structural platform to aid the ongoing efforts in rational design of compounds to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, penetrates host cell membranes and uses viral-to-cellular membrane fusion to release its genetic material for replication. Experiments had identified a region termed fusion peptide (FP) in the Spike proteins of coronaviruses, as the spearhead in these initial processes, and suggested that Ca2+ is needed to support both functions. Absent structure and dynamics-based mechanistic information these FP functions could not be targeted for therapeutic interventions. We describe the development and determination of the missing information from analysis of extensive MD simulation trajectories, and propose specific Ca2+-dependent mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-FP membrane insertion and destabilization. These results offer a structure-specific platform to aid the ongoing efforts to use this target for the discovery and/or of inhibitors.","output":"Ca2+-dependent mechanism of membrane insertion and destabilization by the SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel disease.

Here we have discussed our learning experience in managing and tackling the COVID-19 pandemic at our institute which will set an example for other hospitals as well as instill confidence in our primary care physicians who are the frontline warriors. METHODS AND RESULTS: For combating COVID-19, dedicated teams for its management including logistic support was streamlined. Our capacity was built up for 200 isolation beds including 40 ventilator equipped beds and 645 defined quarantine rooms, to be implemented in phased manner. Till date more than 200 COVID-19 patients have been admitted here. Fever and cough were common presentations. Mortality was high in patients with advanced age or who had multiple co-morbid conditions. Efficient training and infection prevention control have resulted in a satisfactory outcome. CONCLUSION: In the wake of this pandemic all hospital setup, with collective responsibility should follow a specified protocol so that our hospital is not converted to the hotspot. COVID-19 has imposed a new challenge where not only patients have to be managed but our health care workers also need to be protected.

The new generation of employees (Y and Z generations), contemporary political, social, and economic challenges, and the COVID-19 pandemic have raised new issues in human resource management (HRM), especially concerning turnover intentions. In such situations, companies need to create working conditions that will attract, motivate, and retain employees. One possible response is the usage of flexible working arrangements (FWAs) as a more flexible way of organizing traditional jobs and working positions;these arrangements allow employees more possibilities to maintain workClife balance. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between FWAs and turnover intentions of employees, and the mediating effect of job satisfaction. The theoretical research is based on the literature review. The empirical part of the paper is based on the analysis of a sample of 219 employees from organizations in Serbia. The authors used descriptive statistics and the PLS-SEM method to investigate proposed relations. The results pointed to the positive effects of FWAs and job satisfaction on turnover intentions. In addition, there is an indirect effect of FWAs on turnover intentions through job satisfaction. FWAs may contribute to increasing job satisfaction and, in turn, job satisfaction contributes to decreasing turnover intentions. Job satisfaction mediates this relationship, and employees that are offered FWAs may experience a lower level of turnover intentions when they are satisfied on the job.","output":"The Mediating Role of Job Satisfaction in the Relationship between FWAs and Turnover Intentions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Previous systematic review indicated the prevalence of prenatal anxiety as 14-54% Pregnant women are a high-risk population for COVID-19 However, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and related factors is unknown in Chinese pregnant women during COVID-19 outbreak Objective: To investigate the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and the related factors in Chinese pregnant women who were attending crisis intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Association of Stress-Related Factors With Anxiety Among Chinese Pregnant Participants in an Online Crisis Intervention During COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis study aims to estimate the timeCfrequency connectedness among global financial markets.

It is important to capture differences in anxiety levels among populations, groups, and the gender-related variation. Therefore, the present study had two main purposes: (1) to characterize the levels of state anxiety and trait anxiety by examining gender-related, sleep-related, and physical activity-related variations in a nonrepresentative sample of the Portuguese population during the first weeks of lockdown; and (2) to explore the possible relationship between trait anxiety and state anxiety and the possible role of gender as a moderator. This cross-sectional study comprised 1,332 Portuguese adults (aged 18C55 years old) recruited online during COVID-19 outbreak measures. Participants answered to sociodemographic data and the Portuguese version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Gender differences were found in both state anxiety (p = < 0.001; d = 0.385) and trait anxiety (p = < 0.001; d = 0.467) with females presenting higher values. People reporting doing more physical activity than usual during COVID-19 lockdown presented lower levels of state anxiety (p = < 0.001; d = 0.200). People reporting more satisfaction with the quality of sleep presented lower levels of both state anxiety (p = < 0.001; d = 0.701) and trait anxiety (p = < 0.001; d = 0.899). Variation associated with the physical activity level (low, moderate, and high) was significantly different among groups in both state anxiety (p = < 0.001) and trait anxiety (p = < 0.001). When analyzing in more detail separating the levels of physical activity, participants performing moderate and high physical activity showed lower values of state and trait anxiety compared to participants with low physical activity. Participants performing high physical activity also showed lower values of state anxiety compared to participants performing moderate physical activity. Higher levels of trait anxiety were related to higher levels of state anxiety, but this association was not moderated by gender.

While models' abilities to influence outcomes has been studied in the context of economic models, often under the label 'per-formativity', we argue that this phenomenon also pertains to epidemiological models, such as those used for forecasting the trajectory of the Covid-19 pandemic. After identifying three ways in which a model by the Covid-19 Response Team at Imperial College London (Ferguson et al. 2020) may have influenced scientific advice, policy, and individual responses, we consider the implications of epidemiological models' performative capacities. We argue, first, that performativity may impair models' ability to successfully predict the course of an epidemic;but second, that it may provide an additional sense in which these models can be successful, namely by changing the course of an epidemic.","output":"Three Ways in Which Pandemic Models May Perform a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused unprecedented research activity all around the world but publications from Central-Eastern European countries remain scarce. Therefore, our aim was to characterise the features of the pandemic in the intensive care units (ICUs) among members of the SepsEast (Central-Eastern European Sepsis Forum) initiative. Methods: : We conducted a retrospective, international, multicentre study between March 2020-February 2021. All adult patients admitted to the ICU with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 were enrolled. Data on baseline and treatment characteristics, organ support and mortality were collected. Results: : Eleven centres from six countries provided data from 2139 patients. Patient characteristics were;median 68, [IQR 60-75] years of age;males: 67%;body mass index: 30.1 [27.0-34.7];and 88% comorbidities. Overall mortality was 55%, which increased from 2020 to 2021 (p=0.004). The major causes of death were respiratory (37%), cardiovascular (26%) and sepsis with multiorgan failure (21%). 1061 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (mortality: 66%) without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n=54). The rest of the patients received non-invasive ventilation (n=129), high flow nasal oxygen (n=317), conventional oxygen therapy (n=122), as the highest level of ventilatory support, with mortality of 50%, 39% and 22%, respectively. Conclusions: : This is the largest COVID-19 dataset from Central-Eastern European ICUs to date. The high mortality observed especially in those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation renders the need of establishing national-international ICU registries and audits in the region that could provide high quality, transparent data, not only during the pandemic, but also on a regular basis.","output":"Results of the SepsEast Registry to define the Characteristics in Coronavirus Disease in Central-Eastern Europe between March 2020-February 2021: an international, multicentre retrospective study of the SEARCH-COVID-19 Study Group (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM OF THE STUDY: High-speed bone machining devices with irrigation fluid were used in surgery to spread aerosols and toss tissue particles of varying morphology into the operating room. Based on measurements taken on a phantom object, the shape, size, and spatial contamination distribution of such particles were assessed. METHOD: Cadaveric femoral heads were continuously machined with a spherical bur, manually held at a fixed attack angle. The irrigation fluid used during bone machining was enriched with bacteria to act as a tracer to quantify the spatial contamination. A vertical board equipped with snippets served as a phantom object to assess contamination load and morphology of airborne particles. RESULTS: Eight-nine percent of the particles had a non-circular cross section. The detected particle size ranged across six orders of magnitude, from 0.006 to 4 mm2 with a median particle size of 0.125 mm2. The CFU counts observed after the standard machining time ranged from 7 to 240, with a median of 2 CFUs. The highest median contamination was seen at the upper right corner of the phantom. DISCUSSION: The experiments show that contaminating particles of a wide variety of shapes and sizes are part of the aerosol created by high-speed burring. While protection of personnel and equipment is always important, surgical helmets should be worn, especially at contamination hotspots, and gloves should be replaced at the end of machining. Sensitive instruments and measuring devicessuch as optical sensorsshould also be protected effectively, as the optical measurement may be obstructed by aerosol particles.","output":"Aerosol morphology and particle size distribution in orthopaedic bone machining: a laboratory worst-case contamination simulation.

As interaction of COVID-19 virus spike and ACE2 is essential for virus infection, COVID-19-specific vaccine based on spike protein, small molecule compound interrupting their interaction, human monoclonal antibody based on receptor-binding domain, and recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhuACE2) have aroused the interests of researchers. Meanwhile, ACE2 could catalyze angiotensin II (Ang II) to form angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), thus alleviates the harmful effect of Ang II and amplifies the protection effect of Ang1-7. ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) have been shown to increase the level of expression of ACE2 and could be potential strategies in protecting lungs, heart, and kidneys. ACE2 plays a very important role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection.

Nevertheless, aging also affects the ability of the auditory system to process temporal parameters of the sound stimulus. To explore the precision and reliability of auditory temporal processing during aging, responses to several types of sound stimuli were recorded from neurons of the auditory cortex (AC) of young and aged anaesthetized Fischer 344 rats. In response to broad-band noise bursts, the aged rats exhibited larger response magnitudes, a higher proportion of monotonic units, and also a larger variability of response magnitudes, suggesting a lower stability of the rate code. Of primary interest were the responses to temporally structured stimuli (amplitude-modulated (AM) noise, frequency-modulated (FM) tones, and click trains) recorded separately in the right and left AC. Significant differences of temporal processing were already found between the neuronal responses in the left and right AC in the young animals: for the click trains, the left hemisphere exhibited a greater responsiveness to higher repetition rates, lower vector strength values, and a lower similarity of responses. The two hemispheres were also affected differently by aging. In the right hemisphere, neurons in the aged animals displayed worse synchronization with the AM noise and clicks, but better synchronization with the FM tone. In the left hemisphere, neuronal synchronization with the stimulus modulation improved at a higher age for all three stimuli. The results show that the ability of the aging auditory system to process temporal parameters of the stimulus strongly depends on the stimulus type and on laterality. Furthermore, the commonly reported age-related decline in the temporal processing ability cannot be regarded as general as, at least at the neuronal level in the AC, objective measures of the temporal representation often exhibit age-related improvement instead of deterioration.","output":"Age-related changes in the temporal processing of acoustical signals in the auditory cortex of rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Near-ground air (26 substances) and surface seawater (55 substances) concentrations of persistent toxic substances (PTS) were determined in July 2012 in a coordinated and coherent way around the Aegean Sea based on passive air (10 sites in 5 areas) and water (4 sites in 2 areas) sampling.

Estimates of the economic burden associated with PD vary widely across existing studies due to differences in setting and study design. The prevalence and cost of care for PD in Luxembourg are currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to estimate (1) the prevalence of PD in Luxembourg and (2) the cost of care for PD to the national healthcare insurance based on routinely collected healthcare data. METHODS: This analysis was based on individual patient-level data collected by the national healthcare insurance in Luxembourg during 2007C2017, which covers over 95% of the resident population. People with PD were identified based on drug reimbursement profiles. Cost of care was estimated according to a comparative analysis of the healthcare resources consumed by people with PD compared with an age- and sex-matched control group. RESULTS: We determined a PD prevalence of 928 per 100,000 individuals aged 50 years and older in 2016, higher in men (1032 per 100,000) than in women (831 per 100,000). The total mean cost of care for PD was estimated at 22,673 per patient per year in 2016, with the highest costs being associated with long-term care (69%). CONCLUSION: This was the first attempt to estimate the prevalence and cost of care of PD in Luxembourg. The work demonstrated the usefulness of routinely collected data in Luxembourg for such analyses. Our study confirms the significant burden of PD to the healthcare system, especially on long-term care.

Due to their immunomodulatory functions, micronutrient supplements such as vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc have been used for the management of viral illnesses. Furthermore, recent studies have shown low serum vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc levels in critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, the role of these micronutrients in reducing mortality in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to provide a quantitative assessment of the effect of vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc on mortality in COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from inception through April 24, 2021. All the studies that compared adding micronutrient supplements such as vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc versus standard-of-care (SOC) in patients with COVID-19 were included. The outcome of interest was the mortality rate. All statistical analyses were performed using the Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3). Pooled risk ratios (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the random-effects model. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Four studies evaluated vitamin C in 390 patients (201 in vitamin C and 189 in SOC). Seven studies assessed vitamin D in 1251 patients (457 in vitamin D and 794 in SOC). Five evaluated zinc in 1506 patients (776 in zinc and 730 in SOC). Both vitamin C (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.27-1.36, P = 0.22) and vitamin D (RR 0.94, 955 CI 0.46-1.94, P = 0.87) did not significantly reduce mortality. However, zinc was associated with an 33% reduction in mortality compared to SOC (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54-0.84, P = 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that zinc reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients. However, vitamin C and D did not show significant improvemnt in mortality. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Micronutrient supplements, especially zinc, may play a role in the treatment of COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the magnitude of the effects of these micronutrients are clinically meaningful. Further research is needed to better evaluate the utility of these micronutrient supplements in the management of COVID-19.

Secondly, we identify many important master regulators [e.g. STAT1/STAT2 and zinc finger (ZNF) proteins], in particular female patients can express more ZNF proteins and stronger transcriptional activities than male patients in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirdly, we discover that ZNF protein activity is significantly negative correlation with the SARS-CoV-2 load of COVID-19 patients, and ZNF proteins as transcription factors can also activate their target genes to participate in anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourthly, we demonstrate that ZNF protein activity is positive correlation with the abundance of multiple immune cells of COVID-19 patients, implying that the highly ZNF protein activity might promote the abundance and the antiviral activity of multiple immune cells to effectively suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Like influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be mainly transmitted by droplets and direct contact, and COVID-19 has a similar disease presentation to influenza. Here we present a case of influenza A and COVID-19 co-infection in a 60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man with ESRD on hemodialysis presented for worsening cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The patient first developed a mild fever (37.8 C) during hemodialysis 3 days prior to presentation and has been experiencing worsening flu-like symptoms, including fever of up to 38.6 C, non-productive cough, generalized abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and liquid green diarrhea. He lives alone at home with no known sick contacts and denies any recent travel or visits to healthcare facilities other than the local dialysis center. Rapid flu test was positive for influenza A. Procalcitonin was elevated at 5.21 ng/mL with a normal white blood cell (WBC) count. Computed tomography (CT) chest demonstrated multifocal areas of consolidation and extensive mediastinal and hilar adenopathy concerning for pneumonia. He was admitted to the biocontainment unit of Nebraska Medicine for concerns of possible COVID-19 and was started on oseltamivir for influenza and vancomycin/cefepime for the probable bacterial cause of his pneumonia and diarrhea.

Since vaccinations were not available until the end of 2020 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) remained the only strategies to mitigate the pandemic spread at that time. Belarus in Europe is one of a few countries with a high Human Development Index where no lockdowns have ever been implemented and only limited NPIs have taken place for a period of time. Therefore, the Belarusian case was evaluated and compared in terms of the mortality burden. Since the COVID-19 mortality was low, the excess overall mortality was studied for Belarus. Since no overall mortality data have been reported past June 2020 the analysis was complemented by the study of Google Trends funeral-related search queries up until August 2021. Depending on the model, the Belarusian mortality for June of 2020 was 29 to 39% higher than otherwise expected with the corresponding estimated excess death was from 2953 to 3690 while the reported COVID-19 mortality for June 2020 was only 157 cases.

Method We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane review database for studies published between 1. November 2019 and 23rd of April 2020. We included studies that reported individual viral data over time measuring negative conversion by two consecutive negative tests, individual clinical severity and age. We excluded studies that reported viral data as patient fraction, reported only baseline data, included solely asymptomatic patients or were interventional studies. Extracted data included author, title, design, sample size, thresholds and genes of RT-PCR, patient age, COVID-19 severity, clinical characteristics, treatment, location of viral sampling, duration of viral detection, and viral load. We pooled the data of selected studies to determine effect estimates of duration of viral detection. Combined viral load was visualized over time. Findings Out of 7226 titles screened, 37 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative analysis and 22 studies in the quantitative analysis comprising 650 COVID-19 patients. The pooled estimate of the duration of positive detection of the virus was in mild adult patients 12.1 days (CI: 10.12, 14.05) after symptom onset in the upper respiratory tract (URT), 24.1 days (CI: 10.02, 38.19) in lower respiratory tract (LRT), and 15.5 days (CI: 8.04, 22.88) in faeces. Further, in mild adult patients, the maximum viral load was ~ 6.61 x 108 viral copies/mL in the URT and ~ 2.69 x 108 viral copies/mL in the LRT, within the first week of symptom onset. The maximum viral load in faeces was reported as ~ 3.55 x 107 copies/mL on Day 9. In moderate-severe adult patients, the pooled estimate of mean duration of positive viral detection in the URT was 15.8 days (CI: 11.12, 20.56) after symptom onset, 23.2 days (CI: 21.49, 24.97) in the LRT, 20.8 days (CI: 16.40, 25.17) in faeces. The maximum viral load was 4.60 x 109 copies/mL on Day 8 in the URT, 3.45 x 108 copies/mL on Day 11 in the LRT, 2.76 x 106 copies/mL on Day 18 in faeces and 1 x 104 copies/mL on Day 3 in blood. In children with mild symptoms, the pooled estimate of the mean duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 viral detection was 11.1 days (CI: 7.14, 15.11) in the URT and 16.0 days (CI: 11.49, 20,47) in the faeces, without reporting quantitative viral data. Viral positivity was detected in the urine and eye in one patient. Interpretation Our analysis showed consistent viral detection from specimen from the URT, the LRT and faeces, irrespective of the clinical severity of COVID-19. Our analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 persists for a longer duration in the LRT compared to the URT, whereas the differences in the duration of viral detection between mild and moderate-severe patients is limited in the LRT, but an indication of longer duration of viral detection in feces and the URT for moderate-severe patients was shown. Further, viral load was demonstrated to peak in the URT within first weak of infection, whereas maximum viral load has been observed to occur later and within the second week of infection in the LRT.

In 2017 the Israeli Supreme Court ordered that a cells size must be at least 4.5m2 per prisoner in a multiple-occupancy cell. To comply with this order, Amendment 54 to the Prison Ordinance was legislated, extending the use of a tool called Administrative Release. The amended ordinance instructs the Israel Prison Service (IPS) to release prisoners earlier when the number of inmates (prisoners and detainees) exceeds the Incarceration Capacity Standard, which is currently set at 14,000 inmates nationwide. Hence, each morning, if the jails and prisons population exceeds the Incarceration Capacity Standard, the IPS releases groups of prisoners as prioritized by the law, until there are no more than 14,000 inmates in all of the jails and prisons in Israel. <p dir=\\"ltr\\">This article analyses the implications of this Administrative Release policy. Some of the implications are counterintuitive and surprising. For example, the correlation between the number of detainees and the number of prisoners, which is usually positive, was reversed because of the administrative release: when social unrest in May 2021 resulted in an increase of 400 detainees, the IPS had to reduce the number of prisoners by 400 to meet the Incarceration Capacity Standard;But when the number of detentions dropped following the COVID-19 outbreak, the IPS halted the Administrative Releases and the number of post-sentence prisoners increased. This mechanism also causes great uncertainty for prisoners, who are only notified of their release on the actual day of release. Hence, the prisoners cannot be prepared mentally or practically for their release from prison and their reintegration into society. <p dir=\\"ltr\\">More importantly, the method chosen to control prison population is detrimental to public safety, offender rehabilitation, and deterrence. Post-sentence prison terms of most inmates became very short due to the Administrative Release along with the credit for time spent in detention given to most convicts. This reduction in prison terms resulted in a decrease in the number of inmates who are eligible to participate in rehabilitation programs in prison, because most programs require at least six months. As a result, fewer prisoners are eligible for parole, and thus fewer convicts benefit from in-prison and post prison treatment. In addition, the level of risk an inmate poses to public safety is not considered as part of the Administrative Release process, meaning dangerous offenders may be released as easily as low-risk offenders. Thus, the limited prison capacity is not used efficiently to increase rehabilitation and to reduce crime. In this paper we suggest a better, more nuanced solution to control prison population. We propose to increase the number of defendants released on bail, and increase the use of non-incarceration sentences, in times when prison capacity is effectively limited. The paper discusses several tools that can help reduce the number of detainees and prisoners and thus substitute the Administrative Release.","output":"??   C ?? ??  ?? ??

For these communities, home garden produce favourably augments diets consisting predominantly of industrially produced staples and the surplus yield can be sold. Despite many campaigns to alleviate food insecurity - some aimed at developing industrial agriculture and others to establish and uplift home gardens - malnutrition and hunger still plague the impoverished. Dissection of these campaigns reveals common flaws in those that failed and key aspects related to those that succeeded, with successful projects even managing to provide a household's total supply of vegetables. One of the crucial failings was a 'top-down' approach that condescended to participants, ignoring existing knowledge, preferences and social consolidation whilst focusing on meticulously consistent packaged methodologies. Successful projects exalted recipients' own bid for food sovereignty and increased individual and community capacity by providing insightful consultation and access to requested necessary inputs. Obstacles especially present in South Africa include drought and collapse of social capital after withdrawal of institutional support. It has been proven possible that these can be overcome with application of technologies, such as rainwater harvesting, and the creation of common cause such as in national drives. This review of the literature clearly reveals that purposefully uplifted home and community gardens alleviate food insecurity. Significance: Citizens aim for food sovereignty in times of economic crises such as will be brought about by the novel coronavirus. We assess the potential of the establishment of home and community gardens to alleviate food insecurity in South Africa. Home gardens should mainly target the alleviation of malnutrition, producing vegetables to augment cereal-based diets. Protection of social capital by institutional networks ensures durability and long-term success of campaigns. Rainwater harvesting technology is immensely influential for the success of home gardens in a South African context.","output":"Can home gardening significantly reduce food insecurity in South Africa during times of economic distress?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to determine the impact of steroid use in COVID-19 in-hospital mortality, in a retrospective cohort study of the SEMICOVID19 database of admitted patients with SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed pneumonia from 131 Spanish hospitals. Patients treated with corticosteroids were compared to patients not treated with corticosteroids; and adjusted using a propensity-score for steroid treatment. From MarchCJuly 2020, 5.262 (35.26%) were treated with corticosteroids and 9.659 (64.73%) were not. In-hospital mortality overall was 20.50%; it was higher in patients treated with corticosteroids than in controls (28.5% versus 16.2%, OR 2.068 [95% confidence interval; 1.908 to 2.242]; p = 0.0001); however, when adjusting by occurrence of ARDS, mortality was significantly lower in the steroid group (43.4% versus 57.6%; OR 0.564 [95% confidence interval; 0.503 to 0.633]; p = 0.0001). Moreover, the greater the respiratory failure, the greater the impact on mortality of the steroid treatment. When adjusting these results including the propensity score as a covariate, in-hospital mortality remained significantly lower in the steroid group (OR 0.774 [0.660 to 0.907], p = 0.002).

Processes in software development demonstrate many problems relating to multidisciplinary collaboration. Communication has been recognized as an important factor for success in software development projects because previous researches on stakeholder analysis and collaboration has demonstrated the importance of communication. Hence, this study investigated and analyzed communication between stakeholders in collaborative software development projects with references to team activities as a social and intellectual practice. The objective of the study was to define factors that would influence and recognize the process of collaboration during software development. The study focused on communication between the software developers (Students) and project managers (lecturers) during the software requirements phase, interdisciplinary collaboration, team process, and inter-team, particularly between software engineers and technical communicators. First, a survey questionnaire was developed to gather data and analyze the effects and sources of communication among the involved stakeholders in software development projects. An experimental analysis was also performed to further test the supporting impact of client documents on requirements gathering. An experimental study was conducted to further test the supporting effect on requirement gathering of client documents. The results revealed that project managers are vital to software development progress, because they are the one that will provide the team with documents that support requirements gathering, thus improving team productivity and efficiency.

METHODS: This study used cohort and cross sectional data from an academic primary care division in Southcentral Pennsylvania that serves approximately 17,500 patients across 4 practice sites. Early season (prior to November 1) vaccination rates in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were recorded for children, age 6 months to 17 years. To explore the impact of COVID-19 on vaccination, we fit a model with a logit link (estimated via generalized estimating equations to account for clustering by patient over time) on calendar year, adjusted for race, ethnicity, age, and insurance type. We examined interaction effects of demographic covariates with calendar year. RESULTS: Early vaccination rates were lower in 2020 (29.7%) compared with 2018 and 2019 (34.2% and 33.3%). After adjusting for covariates and accounting for clustering over time, the odds of early vaccination in 2020 were 19% lower compared to 2018 (OR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.78-0.85). In 2020, children with private insurance were more likely to receive early vaccination than in 2018 (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.04-1.15), whereas children with public insurance were less likely to receive early vaccination in 2020 than in 2018 (OR 0.62, 95% CI: 1.38-1.65). CONCLUSIONS: Early influenza vaccination rates declined in a year with a concurrent COVID-19 pandemic. Modeling that accounts for individual trends and demographic variables identified specific populations with lower odds of early vaccination in 2020. Additional research is needed to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic impacted parental intent to obtain the influenza vaccine, or introduced barriers to healthcare access.","output":"Early influenza vaccination rates decline in children during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As concerns about Covid-19 rapidly escalated in March 2020 in the United States, all levels of education were impacted. A unique population (student teachers) faced challenges from two perspectives: as students and as teachers forced to teach and learn from a distance. Student Teachers, or preservice teachers (PST), are university students finishing a degree and/or teacher certification program by serving as an intern in a school setting. As schools were closed, these PSTs may not have been given access to the online learning platforms of their cooperating teachers (CT) and were no longer included in classroom instruction. The purpose of this study was to examine how the sudden shift away from traditional face-to-face instruction, co-teaching, and mentorship affected the involvement of music PSTs and their CT mentors in one region of the United States. Specifically, the research questions were: (1) How and in what ways were PSTs involved in planning, instruction, and/or assessment synchronously and asynchronously after school closures? (2) In what subdomains (performance, music theory/ear-training, etc.) were PSTs engaged in instruction and learning activities? (3) What challenges and solutions did PSTs report related to Covid-19 closures? A survey was sent, via email, to PSTs attending teacher preparation programs at universities in the state of Georgia at the end of the spring semester. Thirty-seven participants responded to the survey questions representing about 32% of all PSTs in Georgia in Spring 2020. Twenty-one were not given access to the online teaching platform of their placement school. A thematic analysis of the open-ended questions identified common themes including whether experiences were perceived as negative or positive. Of the PSTs given access, the majority of their responsibilities and experiences were creating assignments, additional help videos, participating in Zoom meetings, and assessing student assignment submissions. Of these experiences, interestingly, most were classified as positive by the PSTs. However, the importance of face-to-face interactions for both PST and the P-12 students was mentioned throughout survey responses. Approximately 10 PSTs mentioned their CT relationship/interaction and four of the respondents noted that their CT never reached out for help;however, six noted collaborative meetings or teaching with their CT. Importantly, some PSTs reported a lack of knowledge related to the planning and implementation of music instruction in the online modality. Therefore, teacher preparation programs should consider incorporating technology including online solutions into the music curriculum so that future music educators may more flexibly incorporate both in-person and distance learning.","output":"Online Involvement for Georgia Student Teachers During Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive literature review and a meta-analysis on team identification, particularly its relation to two outcome variables: intention to attend games and intention to purchase licensed merchandise.

Currently, there is no worldwide-approved effective treatment for COVID-19, urging the scientific community to intense efforts to accelerate the discovery and development of prophylactic and therapeutic solutions against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, effective antiviral drugs are urgently needed. With few exceptions, therapeutic approaches to combat viral infections have traditionally focused on targeting unique viral components or enzymes; however, it has now become evident that this strategy often fails due to the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses. Targeting host factors that are essential for the virus life cycle, but are dispensable for the host, has recently received increasing attention. The spike glycoprotein, a component of the viral envelope that decorates the virion surface as a distinctive crown (corona) and is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, represents a key target for developing therapeutics capable of blocking virus invasion.

Here, we present a detailed analysis of a previously proposed model that combines heterogeneity in the individuals with adaptive rewiring of the network structure in response to a disease. We show that in this model, qualitative changes in the dynamics occur in two phase transitions. In a macroscopic description, one of these corresponds to a local bifurcation, whereas the other one corresponds to a non-local heteroclinic bifurcation. This model thus provides a rare example of a system where a phase transition is caused by a non-local bifurcation, while both micro- and macro-level dynamics are accessible to mathematical analysis. The bifurcation points mark the onset of a behaviour that we call network inoculation. In the respective parameter region, exposure of the system to a pathogen will lead to an outbreak that collapses but leaves the network in a configuration where the disease cannot reinvade, despite every agent returning to the susceptible class. We argue that this behaviour and the associated phase transitions can be expected to occur in a wide class of models of sufficient complexity.","output":"Network inoculation: Heteroclinics and phase transitions in an epidemic model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Coronavirus Disease 2019 is a life-threatening disease, especially for people suffering from chronic diseases. As the vaccine is considered an essential tool to confront pandemics, many international medical institutions have developed vaccines. Countries around the world started immunizing their citizens. This study aims to assess the acceptance and barriers of COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Saudi Arabian people who suffer from chronic diseases. METHODOLOGY In February-March 2021, a cross-sectional study of Saudi Arabian people who have chronic diseases was undertaken. It was based on an Arabic self-administered online questionnaire and used a convenience sampling technique. 310 people were invited. The response rate was 97%. RESULTS 51.95% of the participants agreed to take the COVID-19 vaccine, 33.5% were unsure about being vaccinated, and 14.5% refused. The most frequent concerns between participants and receiving the vaccine were about the side effects and the perceived misconception that following preventative measures is enough to protect against the virus. Significant associations between age, education, and occupation with acceptance rate were found (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Although a higher acceptance for the targeted group was expected, the participants showed a moderate acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Biosimilars, which are biotechnologically manufactured products the same as reference biologicals, have actually now achieved a substantial proportion of the market in some regions but there are still doubters among patients and physicians who fear a loss of quality even if there is no evidence for this.

Psychosocial and context-related factors, such as the relationship between patient and physician, previous experience with treatment and treatment expectations can either improve or impair the efficacy of treatment interventions. These phenomena are commonly known as placebo and nocebo effects. As placebo and nocebo effects can influence the development of symptoms, the frequency of undesired events and the efficacy of treatment, it is decisive to know these effects and to develop strategies for prevention in order to optimize the treatment results.

We used Bayesian isotope mixing models to infer the relative contribution of the different plants to the diet of C. newmannii.Pre\\\\outbreak, C3 plants contributed strongly to the larval diet, whereas post\\\\outbreak, C4 plants were the largest component of their diet. There was some indication of C4 plants contributing to their diet pre\\\\outbreak.Our results suggest that the outbreak of this polyphagous beetle was not a dramatic host shift but rather a rapid increase in the proportion of C4 plants already in their diet.We concluded that plants from the families Fabaceae and Poaceae are the most likely host plants of this species.

Therefore, to tackle a pandemic and rapidly produce safer and more effective subunit vaccines based on protein assemblies, it is necessary to understand the basic structural features which drive protein self-assembly and functionalization of portions of pathogens. This review highlights recent developments and future perspectives in production of non-viral protein assemblies with essential structural features of subunit vaccines.","output":"The Versatile Manipulations of Self-Assembled Proteins in Vaccine Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Stroke is reported as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is a lack of regarding comprehensive stroke phenotype and characteristics Methods: We conducted a multinational observational study on features of consecutive acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and cerebral venous or sinus thrombosis (CVST) among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. We further investigated the association of demographics, clinical data, geographical regions, and countrie's health expenditure among AIS patients with the risk of large vessel occlusion (LVO), stroke severity as measured by National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS), and stroke subtype as measured by the TOAST criteria. Additionally, we applied unsupervised machine learning algorithms to uncover possible similarities among stroke patients. Results: Among the 136 tertiary centers of 32 countries who participated in this study, 71 centers from 17 countries had at least one eligible stroke patient. Out of 432 patients included, 323(74.8%) had AIS, 91(21.1%) ICH, and 18(4.2%) CVST. Among 23 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 16(69.5%) had no evidence of aneurysm. A total of 183(42.4%) patients were women, 104(24.1%) patients were younger than 55 years, and 105(24.4%) patients had no identifiable vascular risk factors. Among 380 patients who had known interval onset of the SARS-CoV-2 and stroke, 144(37.8%) presented to the hospital with chief complaints of stroke-related symptoms, with asymptomatic or undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among AIS patients 44.5% had LVO; 10% had small artery occlusion according to the TOAST criteria. We observed a lower median NIHSS (8[3-17], versus 11[5-17]; p=0.02) and higher rate of mechanical thrombectomy (12.4% versus 2%; p<0.001) in countries with middle to high-health expenditure when compared to countries with lower health expenditure. The unsupervised machine learning identified 4 subgroups, with a relatively large group with no or limited comorbidities. Conclusions: We observed a relatively high number of young, and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among stroke patients. Traditional vascular risk factors were absent among a relatively large cohort of patients. Among hospitalized patients, the stroke severity was lower and rate of mechanical thrombectomy was higher among countries with middle to high-health expenditure.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and Stroke Characteristics: A Report from the Multinational COVID-19 Stroke Study Group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Comparison of diagnoses of migrants and refugees arriving to Moria camps before and after a fire destroying the original sheltering facilities on Lesbos Island, after arrival of the first group of Covid-19 positive individuals;upheavals and unrest is discussed in this research pilot note Change of the spectrum was caused by fire related psycho-trauma and absence of housing for a week, until complementary sheltering facilities were arranged","output":"Comparison of the Spectrum of Outpatient visits before and after Fire in the Moria Camp after Arrival of Covid-19 Positive Refugees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The subcortical structures of the brain are relevant for many neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease (HD). Quantitative segmentation of these structures from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) has been studied in clinical and neuroimaging research. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used for many medical image analysis tasks, including subcortical segmentation. In this work, we propose a 2-stage cascaded 3D subcortical segmentation framework, with the same 3D CNN architecture for both stages. Attention gates, residual blocks and output adding are used in our proposed 3D CNN. In the first stage, we apply our model to downsampled images to output a coarse segmentation. Next, we crop the extended subcortical region from the original image based on this coarse segmentation, and we input the cropped region to the second CNN to obtain the final segmentation. Left and right pairs of thalamus, caudate, pallidum and putamen are considered in our segmentation. We use the Dice coefficient as our metric and evaluate our method on two datasets: the publicly available IBSR dataset and a subset of the PREDICT-HD database, which includes healthy controls and HD subjects. We train our models on only healthy control subjects and test on both healthy controls and HD subjects to examine model generalizability. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method has the highest mean Dice score on all considered subcortical structures (except the thalamus on IBSR), with more pronounced improvement for HD subjects.

ABSTRACT: Zinc (Zn) is an essential mineral element in many organisms. Zn deficiency in humans causes various health problems; therefore, an adequate dietary Zn intake is required daily. Rice, Oryza sativa, is one of the main crops cultivated in Asian countries, and one of the breeding scopes of rice is to increase the grain Zn levels. Previously, we found that an Australian wild rice strain, O. meridionalis W1627, exhibits higher grain Zn levels than cultivated rice, O. sativa Nipponbare, and identified responsible genomic loci. An increase in grain Zn levels caused by one of the loci, qGZn9a, is associated with fertility reduction, but how this negative effect on grain productivity is regulated remains unknown. In this study, we artificially trimmed spikelets on the flowering day and found that a reduction in number of seeds was associated with an increase in the grain Zn levels. We also found that a partial defect in anther dehiscence correlated with the increase in grain Zn levels in plants carrying the W1627 chromosomal segment at qGZn9a in a Nipponbare genetic background. Among eight candidate genes in the qGZn9a region, three were absent from the corresponding region of W1627; one of these, Os09g0384900, encoding a DUF295 protein with an unknown function, was found to be specifically expressed in the developing anther, thereby suggesting that the gene may be involved in the regulation of anther dehiscence. As fertility and grain Zn levels are essential agronomic traits in rice, our results highlight the importance of balancing these two traits.

This study was conducted to identify the epidemiologic data of acute and chronic toxicity by synthetic cannabinoids in Upper Egypt patients. RESULTS: All cases included in the presenting study were fifty males. Most users of synthetic cannabinoids were in the adolescence and middle age group (15C< 35) representing 68%. Curiosity was the most common motivator for using synthetic cannabinoids. Alteration of perception was reported in 68% of subjects after synthetic cannabinoids use. Additionally, dizziness, loss of consciousness, convulsion, and panic attacks were also reported. Cardiovascular adverse effects experienced by users were palpitations (76%) and chest pain (12%). Half of included subjects (50%) reported financial problems and about one-third (32%) got involved in domestic violence. Abnormal routine laboratory findings that were found in included cases were in the form of 12% anemia, 10% leukocytosis, and 6% leucopenia. Also, liver and kidney functions were elevated in 8% and 4% of the cases, respectively. While 22% and 4% of cases were positive for hepatitis C and HIV respectively.

The aim of this review is to show the possible associations between COVID-19 and heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). RECENT FINDINGS: In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the prevalence of HFpEF is high, ranging from 4 to 16%, probably due to the shared cardio-metabolic risk profile. Indeed, comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, obesity and chronic kidney disease  known predictors of a severe course of COVID-19  are major causes of HFpEF, too. COVID-19 may represent a precipitating factor leading to acute decompensation of HF in patients with known HFpEF and in those with subclinical diastolic dysfunction, which becomes overt. COVID-19 may also directly or indirectly affect the heart. In otherwise healthy patients, echocardiographic studies showed that the majority of COVID-19 patients present diastolic (rather than systolic) impairment, pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction. Such abnormalities are observed both in the acute or subacute phase of COVID-19. Cardiac magnetic resonance reveals myocardial inflammation and fibrosis in up to the 78% of patients in the chronic phase of the disease. SUMMARY: These findings suggest that COVID-19 might be a novel independent risk factor for the development of HFpEF, through the activation of a systemic pro-inflammatory state. Follow-up studies are urgently needed to better understand long-term sequelae of COVID-19 inflammatory cardiomyopathy.","output":"Myocardial Involvement in COVID-19: an Interaction Between Comorbidities and Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.

The diagnostic accuracy of the meta-analysis examining nipple discharge fluid had a sensitivity of 75 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.74C0.77) and a specificity of 87 % (95 % CI, 0.86C0.87) for benign breast disease. For breast cancer, it had a sensitivity of 62 % (95 % CI, 0.53C0.71) and a specificity 71 % (95 % CI, 0.57C0.81). Furthermore, patients presenting with blood-stained discharge yielded an overall malignancy rate of 58 % (95 % CI, 0.54C0.60) with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 27 % (95 % CI, 0.17C0.36). CONCLUSIONS: Pooled data from studies encompassing nipple discharge fluid assessment suggest that nipple smear cytology is of limited diagnostic accuracy. The authors recommend that a tailored approach to diagnosis be required given the variable sensitivities of currently available tests.

Env is conformationally flexible, but controls its transition from the unbound closed conformation (State 1) to downstream CD4-bound conformations (States 2/3), which are required for fusion. In particular, HIV-1 has evolved several mechanisms that reduce the premature opening of Env which exposes highly conserved epitopes recognized by non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) capable of mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Env cleavage decreases its conformational transitions favoring the adoption of the closed conformation. Here we altered the gp160 furin cleavage site to impair Env cleavage and to examine its impact on ADCC responses mediated by plasma from HIV-1-infected individuals. We found that infected primary CD4+ T cells expressing uncleaved, but not wildtype, Env are efficiently recognized by nnAbs and become highly susceptible to ADCC responses mediated by plasma from HIV-1-infected individuals. Thus, HIV-1 limits the exposure of uncleaved Env at the surface of HIV-1-infected cells at least in part to escape ADCC responses.","output":"HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins proteolytic cleavage protects infected cells from ADCC mediated by plasma from infected individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Sexual violence is a significant public health concern in the United States, affecting as many as one in two women and one in four men. However, few medical schools offer education on trauma-informed communication with patients who disclose sexual assault (SA). The goal of this training was to provide medical students with an understanding of how to empathically respond to SA disclosures, collect pertinent medical information while avoiding retraumatization, and empower patients to feel in control of their care. METHODS: One hundred forty-nine second-year medical students at Rush Medical College attended a 1-hour didactic lecture discussing the needs of SA survivors followed by small-group sessions during which they practiced trauma-informed communication skills. Students completed anonymous pre- and postsession surveys featuring nine Likert-scale questions that assessed comfort level providing trauma-informed care. RESULTS: Of the 149 attendees, 88 (59%) completed matched pre- and posttraining surveys that demonstrated significant improvement in all assessed metrics of trauma-informed care, including comfort collecting information, empowering survivors, and responding to and normalizing patients concerns. Two weeks after completing the training, all 149 students also correctly answered a free-response question testing retention of key training takeaways on their Sexuality and Reproduction final exam. DISCUSSION: The training significantly improved medical student comfort in providing trauma-informed care across all collected metrics. The training can be feasibly reproduced at other institutions so that future physicians across specialties can provide trauma-informed care, ideally improving the acute and chronic health outcomes that disproportionately affect SA survivors.","output":"Creation of a Medical Student Training to Improve Comfort Providing Trauma-Informed Care to Sexual Assault Survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer is a frequently diagnosed urinary system tumor, whose mortality remains rising. Minichromosome maintenance eight homologous recombination repair factor (MCM8), a newly discovered MCM family member, has been shown to be required for DNA replication. Unfortunately, little is known concerning the roles of MCM8 in bladder cancer. METHODS: The present study, we aimed at probing into the impacts and detailed mechanisms of MCM8 in bladder cancer progression. In this study, MCM8 expression level was detected through immunohistochemistry staining (IHC), qRT-PCR and Western blot assay. Silenced MCM8 cell models were constructed by lentivirus transfection. In vitro, the cell proliferation was evaluated by the MTT assay. The wound-healing assay and the transwell assay were utilized to assess the cell migration. Also, the cell apoptosis and the cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry. Moreover, the Human Apoptosis Antibody Array assay was performed to analyze the alterations of apoptosis-related proteins. The in vivo experiments were conducted to verify the effects of MCM8 knockdown on the tumor growth of bladder cancer. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that compared with normal adjacent tissues, MCM8 expression in bladder cancer tissues was strongly up-regulated. The up-regulation of MCM8 expression in bladder cancer may be a valuable independent prognostic indicator. Of note, MCM8 inhibition modulated the malignant phenotypes of bladder cancer cells. In terms of mechanism, it was validated that MCM8 knockdown made Akt, P-Akt, CCND1 and CDK6 levels down-regulated, as well as MAPK9 up-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study demonstrated an important role of MCM8 in bladder cancer and created a rationale for the therapeutic potential of MCM8 inhibition in human bladder cancer therapy.","output":"Knockdown of MCM8 inhibits development and progression of bladder cancer in vitro and in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Oxygen therapy, using supraphysiological concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia), is routinely administered to patients who require respiratory support including mechanical ventilation (MV). However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia results in acute lung injury (ALI) and accumulation of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in the airways. We previously showed that airway HMGB1 mediates hyperoxia-induced lung injury in a mouse model of ALI. Cholinergic signaling through the 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7nAChR) attenuates several inflammatory conditions. The aim of this study was to determine whether 3C(2,4 dimethoxy-benzylidene)-anabaseine dihydrochloride, GTS-21, an 7nAChR partial agonist, inhibits hyperoxia-induced HMGB1 accumulation in the airways and circulation, and consequently attenuates inflammatory lung injury. METHODS: Mice were exposed to hyperoxia (99% O(2)) for 3 days and treated concurrently with GTS-21 (0.04, 0.4 and 4 mg/kg, i.p.) or the control vehicle, saline. RESULTS: The systemic administration of GTS-21 (4 mg/kg) significantly decreased levels of HMGB1 in the airways and the serum. Moreover, GTS-21 (4 mg/kg) significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced acute inflammatory lung injury, as indicated by the decreased total protein content in the airways, reduced infiltration of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils into the lung tissue and airways, and improved lung injury histopathology. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that GTS-21 can attenuate hyperoxia-induced ALI by inhibiting extracellular HMGB1-mediated inflammatory responses. This suggests that the 7nAChR represents a potential pharmacological target for the treatment regimen of oxidative inflammatory lung injury in patients receiving oxygen therapy.","output":"The 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, GTS-21, attenuates hyperoxia-induced acute inflammatory lung injury by alleviating the accumulation of HMGB1 in the airways and the circulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article examines how the UN Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women has been instrumental in developing state obligations for tackling gender-based violence against women The Committee first adopted a General Recommendation on violence against women in 1989 and then brought it unequivocally into international human rights law through its ground-breaking General Recommendation 19 in 1992 Twenty-five years later, in 2017, in light of the continuing and deadly violence against women that remains pervasive in all countries, with high levels of impunity the Committee updated its work in a further General Recommendation, No 35 This Recommendation provides guidance to and an anchoring of the legal standards that have evolved over the last 25 years, while also looking forward in terms of current and emerging challenges and trends in this field ? 2020 Thomson Reuters and Contributors","output":"The cedaw committee: Global leader in tackling violence against women and girls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genotyping of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was performed on trachea and kidney samples of six chickens obtained from a single farm in Japan.

As bowel cleanliness affects CCEs diagnostic yield, a few operator-dependent scores (LeightonCRex and CC-CLEAR scores) and a computer-dependent score (CAC score) have been developed to grade bowel cleanliness objectively. CCE can be used to monitor IBD mucosal disease activity through the UCEIS and the panenteric CECDAIic score for UC and CD, respectively.

He denied any chest pain, nausea, or vomiting. His other medical problems include hypertension. He denied tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. On presentation, he was afebrile but hypoxic with oxygen saturation of 87% requiring supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula 3L/min. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for coronavirus was tested positive and COVID IgG was non-reactive. Laboratory tests showed elevated inflammatory markers with C- Reactive proteins 14.1 mg/dl (normal: 0-0.9 mg/dl), Lactate dehydrogenase 391 IU/L (normal 108-199 IU/L), and Ferritin 1532 ng/ml (normal 3-111ng/ml). The complete blood count was unremarkable with no leukocytosis. Chest x-ray showed bilateral lower lobe airspace disease. CT chest showed patchy and confluent ground glass opacities bilaterally without pneumothorax.The patient was admitted for acute respiratory failure in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia. On admission day 3, his hypoxemia worsened requiring high flow oxygen. Also, he was given remdesivir, dexamethasone, and enoxaparin. On day 14, he developed worsening nausea and cough. The repeat CT chest ruled out pneumothorax but showed subcutaneous emphysema and pneumo-mediastinum. The patient was monitored closely with no hemodynamic compromise. Clinically he improved and was discharged on Day 18. Discussion: Pneumo-mediastinum is a potential complication of COVID-19, even in patients without mechanical ventilation. Its presentation may be incidental as seen in our case or manifest as worsening cardiopulmonary collapse [2].

Objective: To estimate the prevalence of and risk factors associated with depression symptoms among US adults during vs before the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationally representative survey study used 2 population-based surveys of US adults aged 18 or older. During COVID-19, estimates were derived from the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study, conducted from March 31, 2020, to April 13, 2020. Before COVID-19 estimates were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from 2017 to 2018. Data were analyzed from April 15 to 20, 2020. Exposures: The COVID-19 pandemic and outcomes associated with the measures to mitigate it. Main Outcomes and Measures: Depression symptoms, defined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 cutoff of 10 or higher. Categories of depression symptoms were defined as none (score, 0-4), mild (score, 5-9), moderate (score, 10-14), moderately severe (score, 15-19), and severe (score, &#8805;20). Results: A total of 1470 participants completed the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being survey (completion rate, 64.3%), and after removing those with missing data, the final during-COVID-19 sample included 1441 participants (619 participants [43.0%] aged 18-39 years; 723 [50.2%] men; 933 [64.7%] non-Hispanic White). The pre-COVID-19 sample included 5065 participants (1704 participants [37.8%] aged 18-39 years; 2588 [51.4%] women; 1790 [62.9%] non-Hispanic White). Depression symptom prevalence was higher in every category during COVID-19 compared with before (mild: 24.6% [95% CI, 21.8%-27.7%] vs 16.2% [95% CI, 15.1%-17.4%]; moderate: 14.8% [95% CI, 12.6%-17.4%] vs 5.7% [95% CI, 4.8%-6.9%]; moderately severe: 7.9% [95% CI, 6.3%-9.8%] vs 2.1% [95% CI, 1.6%-2.8%]; severe: 5.1% [95% CI, 3.8%-6.9%] vs 0.7% [95% CI, 0.5%-0.9%]). Higher risk of depression symptoms during COVID-19 was associated with having lower income (odds ratio, 2.37 [95% CI, 1.26-4.43]), having less than $5000 in savings (odds ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.02-2.26]), and exposure to more stressors (odds ratio, 3.05 [95% CI, 1.95-4.77]). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that prevalence of depression symptoms in the US was more than 3-fold higher during COVID-19 compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with lower social resources, lower economic resources, and greater exposure to stressors (eg, job loss) reported a greater burden of depression symptoms.

The phase diagrams of the ABSs have been constructed using the turbidometric titration method at 309 K. The tie-line lengths and the slope of tie lines of the system have been obtained using the gravimetric method. The use of sugar alcohol to replace the salt-rich phase for phase separation makes the ABS apt for extracting different molecules of biological relevance. Using one of these newly constructed eco-friendly ABSs, d-mannitol vs PPG#400, the extraction behaviors of Ivermectin and Doxycycline (which have been extensively used to treat COVID-19 patients) were studied at different pH values. About 90% of Ivermectin and 70% of Doxycycline has been extracted to the polymer-rich phase of ABS at pH 7 in single extraction. The extraction patterns of these two drugs remain almost the same even in the presence of l-ascorbic acid and zinc acetate, which are also administered as combination drugs in the treatment of COVID-19. We have also studied the extraction behavior of Prednisolone, a corticosteroid, which also is widely recommended to particularly treat the severity of the cytokine storm that arises in many patients at the third phase of COVID-19. Complete extraction of Prednisolone has been achieved at pHs 3 and 5, and 97% of extraction has been achieved at pH 7. The objective of such extraction is to design cleaner methods of remediation of these drugs to minimize their exposure to the environment that may lead to drug resistance in the environment.

The virus surfaced towards the end of December 2019 in Wuhan, China where earlier SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) had also surfaced in 2003. Unlike SARS, SARS-CoV-2 (a close relative of the SARS virus) created a pandemic, and as of February 24 2021, caused 112,778,672 infections and 2,499,252 deaths world-wide. Despite the best efforts of scientists, no drugs against COVID-19 are yet in sight; five vaccines have received emergency approval in various countries, but it would be a difficult task to vaccinate twice the world population of 8 billion. The objective of the present study was to evaluate through in silico screening a number of phytochemicals in Allium cepa (onion) regarding their ability to bind to the main protease of COVID-19 known as the 3C-like protease or 3CLpro, (PDB ID: 6LU7), 3CLpro of SARS (PDB ID: 3M3V), and human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), [PDB ID: 1R42], which functions as a receptor for entry of the virus into humans. Molecular docking (blind docking, that is docking not only against any target pocket) were done with the help of AutoDockVina. It was observed that of the twenty-two phytochemicals screened, twelve showed good binding affinities to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, the compounds also demonstrated good binding affinities to ACE-2. It is therefore very likely that the binding affinities shown by these compounds against both 3CLpro and ACE-2 merit further study for their potential use as therapeutic agents.","output":"In silico screening of Allium cepa phytochemicals for their binding abilities to SARS and SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease and COVID-19 human receptor ACE-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Some publications suggest high rates of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and of nosocomial pneumonia portending a poor prognosis in ICU cancer patients. A better understanding of the epidemiology of HAIs in these patients is needed. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all the patients hospitalized for  48 h during a 12-year period in the 12-bed ICU of the Gustave Roussy hospital, monitored prospectively for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bloodstream infection (BSI) and for use of medical devices. RESULTS: During 3388 first stays in the ICU, 198 cases of VAP and 103 primary, 213 secondary, and 77 catheter-related BSIs were recorded. The VAP rate was 24.5/1000 ventilator days (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.2C28.0); the catheter-related BSI rate was 2.3/1000 catheter days (95% CI 1.8C2.8). The cumulative incidence during the first 25 days of exposure was 58.8% (95% CI 49.1C66.6%) for VAP, 8.9% (95% CI, 6.2C11.5%) for primary, 15.1% (95% CI 11.6C18.5%) for secondary and 5.0% (95% CI 3.2C6.8%) for catheter-related BSIs.

We aimed to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on admission rates and in-hospital care for acute stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) in Israel, shortly after the start of the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study, based on data reported to the Israeli National Stroke Registry from 7 tertiary hospitals. All hospital admissions for acute stroke or TIA that occurred between January 1 and April 30, 2020 were included. Data were stratified into 2 periods according to the timing of COVID-19 restrictions as follows: (1) pre-pandemic ? January 1 to March 7, 2020 and (2) pandemic ? March 8 to April 30, 2020. We compared the weekly counts of hospitalizations between the 2 periods. We further investigated changes in demographic characteristics and in some key parameters of stroke care, including the percentage of reperfusion therapies performed, time from hospital arrival to brain imaging and to thrombolysis, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 2,260 cases were included: 1,469 in the pre-COVID-19 period and 791 in the COVID-19 period. Hospital admissions significantly declined between the 2 periods, by 48% for TIA (rate ratio [RR] = 0.52; 95% CI 0.43C0.64) and by 29% for stroke (RR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.64C0.78). No significant changes were detected in demographic characteristics and in most parameters of stroke management. While the percentage of reperfusion therapies performed remained unchanged, the absolute number of patients treated with reperfusion therapies seemed to decrease. Higher in-hospital mortality was observed only for hemorrhagic stroke. CONCLUSION: The marked decrease in admissions for acute stroke and TIA, occurring at a time of a relatively low burden of COVID-19, is of great concern.

Confluent lesions covering the whole inoculated area were produced by 107 viable units of the fungus, whereas the minimal infective dose of 103 viable units produced limited areas of infection only. The level of nutrition within the limits imposed had no effect on the extent or severity of lesions. The fungus was found to invade the keratinized portions of skin and hair of cattle of all ages at the same rate. However, both the cutaneous inflammatory response and the resolution of lesions were most rapid in older animals. The ability to eliminate infection more rapidly was associated with a marked delayed hypersensitivity response commencing 14 days after infection. Such hypersensitivity was not detectable by this means after the resolution of lesions. T. verrueosum could not be isolated in culture from skin lesions until 21 days after inoculation and could only be isolated for half the period that lesions were present. Cattle were resistant to cutaneous reinfection with viable T. verrueosum on previously infected or fresh skin sites at 2 months and at more than one year after the resolution of primary lesions. A mild delayed hypersensitivity response developed in every site within 48 hr. of reinoculation. The intravenous inoculation of previously-infected cattle with 104 viable units of T. verrueosum resulted in an immediate-type cutaneous reaction at the original site of infection.","output":"Experimental Bovine Trichophyton verrueosum Infection: Preliminary Clinical, Immunological and Histological Observations in Primarily Infected and Reinoculated Cattle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Generative learning theory posits that learners engage more deeply and produce better learning outcomes when they engage in selecting, organizing, and integrating processes during learning.
