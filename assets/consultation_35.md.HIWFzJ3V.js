In this study, we attempted to develop an omalizumab biobetter antibody with the potential to overcome its limitations. We removed two aspartic acid isomerization hotspots in CDRs of omalizumab to improve antibody candidates stability. Meanwhile, several murine amino acids in the framework region of omalizumab were replaced with human source to reduce the potential immunogenicity. Yeast display technology was then applied to screen antibody candidates with high binding affinity to IgE. Moreover, YTE mutation in Fc fragment was introduced into the candidates for extending their serum half-life. A lead candidate, AB1904Am15, was screened out, which showed desired biophysical properties and improved stability, high binding affinity and elevated potency in vitro, prolonged half-life in human FcRn transgenic mouse, and enhanced in vivo efficacy in cynomolgus monkey asthma model.

In interactions with K562 targets, NK cells of H and C pigs responded similarly in frequency of conjugate formation and lytic activity, while L pigs had very little or no response. Therefore, in pigs selected for high Ab and CMIR, there was no correlated enhancement of NK-cell-related traits following vaccination with TGEV, while selection for low immune response was associated with reduced NK response in pigs.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic diseases account for 90% of healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality. In the United States, healthcare providers attempt to modulate a limited set of risks. However, chronic diseases continue to proliferate despite expansion of wellness programs and drugs to manage and prevent chronic conditions. Pandemics, exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), show that people in good health suffer mortality rates at 10% the rate compared to those with pre-existing chronic conditions. Healthcare costs and morbidity rates often parallel mortality rates. New root-cause risk and health tools that accommodate low health literacy and are linked to personalized health improvement care plans are needed to reverse the chronic disease epidemic. Reported here is a study on 70 manufacturing employees in the Midwest US using a personalized and group approach to chronic disease reversal and prevention which may also find utility in pandemic severity and policy decisions. Methods Health, lifestyle, behavior, and motivation data were collected on 70 individuals at the beginning of a nine-month disease reversal and prevention program. The data were updated every two to six months over the period. Inputs included information from a novel health risk assessment, serum biomarkers specific for chronic disease, and traditional medical information. Using all these data we generated robust, personalized, and modifiable care plans that were implemented by the participant and guided by a care team including health coaches and medical providers. Periodic renewal of profile data and biomarkers facilitated adjustment of care plans to optimize the path toward health goals set mutually by the participant and the care team. Results Ninety percent of participants experienced a favorable reduction in chronic disease biomarkers. The reduction in serum biomarkers coincided with a reduction in disease and risk attributes based on medical chart data and before and after interviews. Hemoglobin A1C, for example, lowered in all but one participant concomitant with reported improved energy and reduced need for medications in the majority of participants. Markers of inflammation lowered across the population. Most importantly each individual reported improvement in their overall health. Conclusions This simple, inexpensive, root-cause based risk and health approach generates a do no harm action plan that guides a care team, including the participant, on a path to improved health. The data demonstrate that changes in a novel risk calculator score coincide with changes in sensitive biomarkers for chronic disease. When the risks of an individual are reduced, the biomarkers reflect that change with self-reported wellbeing also improved. This program and process may be of value to society plagued with escalating levels of chronic disease and merits further study and implementation.","output":"Reduction in Chronic Disease Risk and Burden in a 70-Individual Cohort Through Modification of Health Behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The current pandemic coronavirus (COVID-19) is a novel disease with no standardized course of treatment and cure.

Design This was a qualitative study of cross-sectional design. Rehabilitation practitioners completed semi-structured interviews via Zoom. Transcribed interviews were analyzed for themes. Setting With the onset of COVID-19, rehabilitation practitioners quickly adapted and started offering telerehabilitation services where they interacted directly with the client and evaluate, diagnose, and treat their condition virtually. These services differed from prior methods of telehealth, where healthcare practitioners delivered care from one healthcare facility to another. Practitioners from both public and private clinics shifted their services to virtual platforms quickly to provide continued care to patients needing acute and prolonged rehabilitation care. Participants Twenty-four rehabilitation practitioners were recruited to participate in the study (14 physiotherapists, 4 occupational therapists, 2 speech language pathologists, 1 psychologist, 1 kinesiologist, 1 social worker, 1 orthopedic surgeon) from rural and urban clinics as well as private and publicly funded practices. Inclusion criteria required practitioners to have transitioned to telerehabilitation, either through video conferencing or telephone. Interventions N/A. Main Outcome Measures N/A. Results The overarching theme which emerged from the data was providing continued access to care. Rehabilitation practitioners quickly transitioned to using the telephone or video conferencing platforms such as Zoom to connect with clients. Multiple subthemes emerged allowing for a better understanding of the transition to telerehabilitation during COVID-19. Barriers to offering telerehabilitation services included adequate access to technology (computer, laptop, tablet) and IT support for the client and sufficient internet bandwidth. Limited availability of validated virtual assessments made the transition difficult for practitioners. However, many benefits emerged such as easier scheduling of interdisciplinary meetings, increased client accountability, better access to group programming, and decreased travel times to clinics. Conclusions Although there were challenges, especially surrounding technology, the switch to telerehabilitation had many benefits and could be a viable method of delivering care that goes beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

Originally concerned with disease and its emergence, virus evolution had not been well integrated into the general study of evolution. This chapter reviews the developments that have brought us to this new appreciation for the general significance of virus evolution to all life. We now know that viruses numerically dominate all habitats of life, especially the oceans. Theoretical developments in the 1970s regarding quasispecies, error rates, and error thresholds have yielded many practical insights into virusChost dynamics. The human diseases of HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus cannot be understood without this evolutionary framework. Yet recent developments with poliovirus demonstrate that viral fitness can be the result of a consortia, not one fittest type, a basic Darwinian concept in evolutionary biology. Darwinian principles do apply to viruses, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution distinguish virus evolution from classical studies. The available phylogenetic tools have greatly aided our analysis of virus evolution, but these methods struggle to characterize the role of virus populations. Missing from many of these considerations has been the major role played by persisting viruses in stable virus evolution and disease emergence. In many cases, extreme stability is seen with persisting RNA viruses. Indeed, examples are known in which it is the persistently infected host that has better survival. We have also recently come to appreciate the vast diversity of phage (DNA viruses) of prokaryotes as a system that evolves by genetic exchanges across vast populations (Chapter 10). This has been proposed to be the big bang of biological evolution. In the large DNA viruses of aquatic microbes we see surprisingly large, complex and diverse viruses. With both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA viruses, recombination is the main engine of virus evolution, and virus host co-evolution is common, although not uniform. Viral emergence appears to be an unending phenomenon and we can currently witness a selective sweep by retroviruses that infect and become endogenized in koala bears.","output":"The Widespread Evolutionary Significance of Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses utilize cellular lipids and manipulate host lipid metabolism to ensure their replication and spread. Therefore, the identification of lipids and metabolic pathways that are suitable targets for antiviral development is crucial. Using a library of compounds targeting host lipid metabolic factors and testing them for their ability to block pseudorabies virus (PRV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, we found that U18666A, a specific inhibitor of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), is highly potent in suppressing the entry of diverse viruses including pseudotyped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). NPC1 deficiency markedly attenuates viral growth by decreasing cholesterol abundance in the plasma membrane, thereby inhibiting the dynamics of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), which are indispensable for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Significantly, exogenous cholesterol can complement the dynamics of CCPs, leading to efficient viral entry and infectivity. Administration of U18666A improves the survival and pathology of PRV- and influenza A virus-infected mice. Thus, our studies demonstrate a unique mechanism by which NPC1 inhibition achieves broad antiviral activity, indicating a potential new therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2, as well as other emerging viruses.

These patients require systemic treatment. However, it is still a key challenge to achieve durable remissions with the available treatment options. CTCL is characterized by the presence of malignant clonal T-cells in the skin and/or blood, lymph nodes or visceral organs. Epigenetic alterations in malignant T cells are known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Resminostat is an orally available HDAC-inhibitor, which induces changes in gene expression resulting in growth inhibition, modified cell differentiation and enhanced tumor immunogenicity. The purpose of the RESMAIN study is to investigate resminostat as maintenance treatment for patients with advanced stage mycosis fungoides (MF) or Szary syndrome (SS) that have achieved disease control with systemic therapy. The RESMAIN study is a multicenter, double blind randomized, placebo controlled, prospective efficacy trial. Patients are randomized 1:1 to the resminostat and the placebo arm. Furthermore, patients are stratified according to their remission status and their disease stage immediately prior to the last systemic therapy. Patients will be treated until disease progression. Patients of the placebo arm have the option to receive resminostat treatment. In addition, exploratory biomarker analyses will be performed. The study is conducted in 11 European countries at 51 sites and at 5 sites in Japan. The first patient was enrolled in January 2017. Recruitment was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic but continued slowly in 2020 and is now in its final stage. The independent data safety monitoring committee (DSMB) recommended continuation of the ongoing RESMAIN study without modification after a pre-specified review of cumulative safety data of the first 50, 100, ,150 and 175 patients which had completed at least one treatment cycle. The poster will present an actual status update of the RESMAIN study. The primary objective is to determine if maintenance treatment with resminostat increases progression free survival (PFS) compared to placebo. As a key secondary end point the effect of resminostat on time to symptom worsening (TTSW) of pruritus compared to placebo will be assessed. Further secondary endpoints are TTP, TTNT, ORR, OS and HrQoL among others.

Although it mainly affects the respiratory system, it influences all organs, including the heart. It is associated with a broad spectrum of widespread cardiovascular problems ranging from mild myocardial injury to fulminant myocarditis. We aimed to evaluate the presence and prevalence of cardiac involvement in asymptomatic or symptomatic patients after they recovered from COVID 19 infection. METHODS: A total of 100 consecutive patients with COVID\\\\19 proven by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\\\\PCR), under 40 years of age and without any known additional chronic diseases were analyzed retrospectively for cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) results and symptoms. RESULTS: Cardiac involvement was detected in 49 out of 100 patients on CMR imaging. In the cardiac involvement group, the number of patients with chest pain and/or dyspnea was 41 (84%), which was statistically significant (p = 0.001).

We consider the implications of antibody certificate systems, develop a set of risk-minimising principles and a security framework for their evaluation, and show that these may be satisfied in practice. Finally, we also develop two additional protocols that minimise individual discrimination but which still allow for collective transmission risk to be estimated.

To fight the pandemic, the search for promising viral drug targets has become a cross-border common goal of the international biomedical research community. Within the international Covid19-NMR consortium, scientists support drug development against SARS-CoV-2 by providing publicly available NMR data on viral proteins and RNAs. The coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is an RNA-binding protein involved in viral transcription and replication. Its primary function is the packaging of the viral RNA genome. The highly conserved architecture of the coronavirus N protein consists of an N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NTD), followed by an intrinsically disordered Serine/Arginine (SR)-rich linker and a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD). Besides its involvement in oligomerization, the CTD of the N protein (N-CTD) is also able to bind to nucleic acids by itself, independent of the NTD.

Objective To report the respective risk of ICU admission in patients hospitalized with Delta and Omicron variants and to compare the characteristics and disease severity of critically ill patients infected with both variants according to vaccination status. Design Analysis from the APHP database, called Reality, prospectively recording the following information in consecutive patients admitted in the ICU for COVID-19: age, sex, type of variant, immunosuppression, vaccination, pneumonia, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, time between symptom onset and ICU admission, and in-ICU mortality. Retrospective analysis on an administrative database, Systeme Information pour le Suivi des Victimes (SI-VIC), which lists hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Setting 39 hospitals in the Paris area from APHP group. Participants Patients hospitalized from December 1, 2021 to January 18, 2022 for COVID-19. Main outcomes and measures Risk of ICU admission was evaluated in 3761 patients and Omicron cases were compared to Delta cases in the ICU in 888 consecutive patients. Results On January 18, 45% of patients in the ICU and 63.8% of patients in conventional hospital units were infected with the Omicron variant (p < 0.001). The risk of ICU admission with Omicron was reduced by 64% than with Delta (9.3% versus 25.8% of cases, respectively, p < 0.001). In critically ill patients, 400 had the Delta variant, 229 the Omicron variant, 98 had an uninformative variant screening test and 161 did not have information on variant screening test. 747 patients (84.1%) were admitted for pneumonia. Compared to patients infected with Delta, Omicron patients were more vaccinated (p<0.001), even with 3 doses, more immunocompromised (p<0.001), less admitted for pneumonia (p<0.001), especially when vaccinated (62.1% in vaccinated versus 80.7% in unvaccinated, p<0.001), and less invasively ventilated (p=0.02). Similar results were found in the subgroup of pneumonia but Omicron cases were older. Unadjusted in-ICU mortality did not differ between Omicron and Delta cases, neither in the overall population (20.0% versus 27.9%, p = 0.08), nor in patients with pneumonia (31.6% versus 29.7%, respectively) where adjusted in-ICU mortality did not differ according to the variant (HR 1.43 95%CI [0.89;2.29], p=0.14). Conclusion and relevance Compared to the Delta variant, the Omicron variant is less likely to result in ICU admission and less likely to be associated with pneumonia. However, when patients with the Omicron variant are admitted for pneumonia, the severity seems similar to that of patients with the Delta variant, with more immunocompromised and vaccinated patients and no difference in adjusted in-ICU mortality.

Additionally, the influence of baseline patient and transplant characteristics on hematopoietic recovery was evaluated. From January 1994 to March 1996, 47 consecutive adult patients received VUD-BMT. GVHD prophylaxis was cyclosporin A/short course methotrexate/prednisolone, and in four patients additional ATG. Post-transplantation, cohorts of patients received rhG-CSF (5 g/kg/day) (n = 22) or no rhG-CSF (n = 25) in a non-randomized manner. The patient groups with and without rhG-CSF were rather comparable with respect to baseline patient and transplant characteristics. Median time to neutrophil counts (ANC) >500/l was 14 days with rhG-CSF vs 16 days without rhG-CSF (P = 0.048), to ANC >1000/l was 15 vs 18 days (P = 0.084). Neutrophil recovery was accelerated in patients receiving more than the median MNC dose of 2.54  10(8)/kg with a median time to ANC >1000/l of 13 days vs 19 days (P = 0.017). RhG-CSF did not influence platelet recovery and incidence of infectious complications. Incidence of acute GVHD IICIV was 50% with rhG-CSF and 28% without rhG-CSF (P = 0.144), but death before acute GVHD IICIV occurred in 9% of patients with and 20% of patients without rhG-CSF. The median follow-up time was 38 and 36 months in patients with and without rhG-CSF, respectively. Survival at 2 years post-transplant was 39% (95% confidence interval (18%, 60%)) in patients with rhG-CSF and 24% (95% confidence interval (7%, 41%)) in patients without rhG-CSF. Administration of rhG-CSF after VUD-BMT may lead to more rapid neutrophil recovery, but did not influence the incidence of infectious complications. Patients receiving rhG-CSF showed a slightly higher incidence of acute GVHD IICIV.

Patients who suffer from chronic pain, whether due to a physical injury, a chronic medical illness, psychosomatic pain, or a combination, can have significantly low functioning levels and may be unable to participate in outpatient models. Therefore, such patients require a higher level of care. The goal of this session is to describe the inpatient model for the treatment of pediatric chronic pain. Methods: Mirabelle Mattar, MD, describes the diverse structure, treatment principles, and functionality of inpatient programs. The focus is drawn on medical-psychiatric programs and the advantages of this holistic treatment approach. We also address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inpatient treatment. Results: Dr. Mattar discusses programs ranging from a strictly medical rehabilitation approach to integrated medical-psychiatric units, which are less common and available. Inpatient rehabilitation treatment programs provide daily therapy that addresses physical/medical, psychological, educational, and daily living goals in patients with more stable mental health conditions not requiring inpatient mental health care. Medical-psychiatric programs cater to patients that are too mentally ill to be treated on medical wards and too medically ill to be treated with conventional mental health inpatient services. Such a holistic treatment approach often reduces readmission rates. The integration of medical and mental health care often allows for improvement of mood, monitoring, and treatment of suicidal thoughts (should they exist), in addition to providing intensive rehabilitation and medical services. Patients are also exposed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in regard to absence of direct family support in their treatment course. Conclusions: Inpatient integrated care programs adopt the multidisciplinary treatment model to address pain with biological, psychological, and social approaches. These programs, already quite saturated and uncommon, have become almost inaccessible to out-of-state patients due to COVID-19 rules and restrictions. The therapeutic model has been further impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, thus driving the transition of several aspects of care, even family sessions, to virtual platforms.

METHODS: A retrospective and descriptive study was performed on patients with lens subluxation, angle closure, goniosynechia, and evaluated intraocular pressure (IOP) that cannot be controlled with medication, who underwent Phaco-CTR-IOL-OE-GSL. The postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), IOP, range of goniosynechia and complications were retrospectively observed. RESULTS: Nine patients with secondary angle-closure glaucoma induced by traumatic lens subluxation were included. The follow-up period was 51.18.6mo. The preoperative range of zonule rupture was 158.233.0, and the range of goniosynechia was 220.092.5. The baseline BCVA was 0.91.0 logMAR, IOP was 30.717.3 mm Hg, and number of anti-glaucoma medication was 3.21.1. Mild intraoperative hyphaemia with 8 eyes (88.8%) in the anterior chamber, and was absorbed two days postoperatively.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the development and performance of a clinical decision support tool to inform resource utilization for elective procedures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prognostic study, predictive modeling was used on retrospective electronic health records data from a large academic health system comprising 1 tertiary care hospital and 2 community hospitals of patients undergoing scheduled elective procedures from January 1, 2017, to March 1, 2020. Electronic health records data on case type, patient demographic characteristics, service utilization history, comorbidities, and medications were and abstracted and analyzed. Data were analyzed from April to June 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Predicitons of hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, and need to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility. These predictions were generated using the random forests algorithm. Predicted probabilities were turned into risk classifications designed to give assessments of resource utilization risk. RESULTS: Data from the electronic health records of 42 199 patients from 3 hospitals were abstracted for analysis. The median length of stay was 2.3 days (range, 1.3-4.2 days), 6416 patients (15.2%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, 1624 (3.8%) received mechanical ventilation, and 2843 (6.7%) were discharged to a skilled nursing facility.

Understanding the factors that influence compliance with social distancing measures is therefore an urgent issue. The present research investigated the role of political and social trust for social distancing using a variety of methods. In Study 1 (N = 301), conducted with a sample from the United Kingdom in the midst of the virus outbreak (i.e., the first wave), neither political nor social trust had main associations with self-reported social distancing tendencies. However, both factors interacted such that social trust was associated with lower social distancing tendencies among participants with low levels of political trust. In Study 2, using an experimental longitudinal design and again conducted with a sample collected from the UK (N = 268) during the first wave of the pandemic, social distancing practices increased over time, independent of an experimental manipulation of political trust. Moreover, while the interaction between political and social trust from the first study could not be conceptually replicated, social trust was positively related to social distancing intentions. Moving from the individual to the country level and assessing actual behavior at both the first and second wave of the pandemic, in Study 3 (N = 65 countries), country-level political trust was related to less social distancing during the first wave. Social trust was related to a higher growth rate of infections. Against the background of these inconsistent findings, we discuss the potential positive and unexpected negative effects of social trust for social distancing.","output":"How Political and Social Trust Can Impact Social Distancing Practices During COVID-19 in Unexpected Ways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION Recognizing named entities (NER) and their associated attributes like negation are core tasks in natural language processing. However, manually labeling data for entity tasks is time consuming and expensive, creating barriers to using machine learning in new medical applications. Weakly supervised learning, which automatically builds imperfect training sets from low cost, less accurate labeling rules, offers a potential solution. Medical ontologies are compelling sources for generating labels, however combining multiple ontologies without ground truth data creates challenges due to label noise introduced by conflicting entity definitions. Key questions remain on the extent to which weakly supervised entity classification can be automated using ontologies, or how much additional task-specific rule engineering is required for state-of-the-art performance. Also unclear is how pre-trained language models, such as BioBERT, improve the ability to generalize from imperfectly labeled data. RESULTS We present Trove, a framework for weakly supervised entity classification using medical ontologies. We report state-of-the-art, weakly supervised performance on two NER benchmark datasets and establish new baselines for two entity classification tasks in clinical text. We perform within an average of 3.5 F1 points (4.2%) of NER classifiers trained with hand-labeled data. Automatically learning label source accuracies to correct for label noise provided an average improvement of 3.9 F1 points. BioBERT provided an average improvement of 0.9 F1 points. We measure the impact of combining large numbers of ontologies and present a case study on rapidly building classifiers for COVID-19 clinical tasks.

The purpose of this study is to develop a methodology for predicting the trend of stock value based on the relationship between the fluctuation of Tobin's Q by sector as a trend index and the stock price variation of the Columbia stock market. To this end, a quantitative quasi-experimental survey will be conducted on shares traded by December 30, 2019. This is at least 90% of the time we have traded in the last 5 years. From the average Q value of the relevant economic sector, the value of each company's stock is adjusted to calculate the estimated price of the company's stock. If there is a disparity between the estimated value of the stock and the value at time t, you can forecast the stock price transition. If the computation yields a more significant result than what is now witnessed in the market, the next period's development will be positive; if it yields a lower result, its development will be negative. The results allow us to establish a significant influence of industry results on the performance of corporate Tobin's Q at the individual level. The significance level is greater than 50% in all cases, and profitability does not go below 30% in any sector, even reaching 100%.

METHODS: Molecular docking on the binding between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of common laboratory mammals and the receptor-binding domain of the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the golden Syrian hamster is an option. Virus challenge, contact transmission, and passive immunoprophylaxis were performed. Serial organ tissues and blood were harvested for histopathology, viral load and titre, chemokine/cytokine assay, and neutralising antibody titre. RESULTS: The Syrian hamster could be consistently infected by SARS-CoV-2. Maximal clinical signs of rapid breathing, weight loss, histopathological changes from the initial exudative phase of diffuse alveolar damage with extensive apoptosis to the later proliferative phase of tissue repair, airway and intestinal involvement with virus nucleocapsid protein expression, high lung viral load, and spleen and lymphoid atrophy associated with marked cytokine activation were observed within the first week of virus challenge. The lung virus titre was between 105-107 TCID50/g. Challenged index hamsters consistently infected na?ve contact hamsters housed within the same cage, resulting in similar pathology but not weight loss. All infected hamsters recovered and developed mean serum neutralising antibody titre &#8805;1:427 fourteen days post-challenge. Immunoprophylaxis with early convalescent serum achieved significant decrease in lung viral load but not in lung pathology. No consistent non-synonymous adaptive mutation of the spike was found in viruses isolated from infected hamsters.

Given social distancing and precipitous evolution of the pandemic, Internet enabled recruitment was deemed the best method to engage a community-based sample. We quantify the efficiency and acceptability of this Internet-based recruitment for engaging a trial cohort and describe the approach used for implementing a health-related trial entirely online using off-the-shelf tools. Methods: We recruited 1,971 adult participants (a룤18 years) via engagement with community partners and organizations and outreach through direct and social media messaging. We quantified response rate and participant characteristics of our sample, examine sample representativeness, and evaluate potential non-response bias. Results: Recruitment was similarly derived from direct referral from partner organizations and broader social media based outreach, with extremely low study entry from organic (non-invited) search activity. Of social media platforms, Facebook was the highest yield recruitment source. Bot activity was present but minimal and identifiable through meta-data and engagement behavior. Recruited participants differed from broader populations in terms of sex, ethnicity, and education, but had similar prevalence of chronic conditions. Retention was satisfactory, with entrance into the first follow-up survey for 61% of those invited. Conclusions: We demonstrate that rapid recruitment into a longitudinal intervention trial via social media is feasible, efficient, and acceptable. Recruitment in conjunction with community partners representing target populations, and with outreach across multiple platforms, is recommended to optimize sample size and diversity.

We investigated changes in the fecal fungal microbiomes (mycobiome) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and upon recovery. Methods We performed deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis of fecal samples from 30 patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong, from February 5 through May 12, 2020. Fecal samples were collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge. We compared fecal mycobiome compositions of patients with COVID-19 with those from 9 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 30 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed fecal mycobiome profiles throughout time of hospitalization until clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples. Results Patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in their fecal mycobiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of Candia albicans and a highly heterogeneous mycobiome configuration, at time of hospitalization. Although fecal mycobiomes of 22 patients with COVID-19 did not differ significantly from those of controls during times of hospitalization, 8 of 30 patients with COVID-19 had continued significant differences in fecal mycobiome composition, through the last sample collected. The diversity of the fecal mycobiome of the last sample collected from patients with COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher than that of controls (P<.05). Samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Aspergillus flavus compared with controls. Two respiratory-associated fungal pathogens, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger, were detected in fecal samples from a subset of patients with COVID-19, even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples and resolution of respiratory symptoms. Conclusions In a pilot study, we found heterogeneous configurations of the fecal mycobiome, with enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus, during hospitalization of 30 patients with COVID-19 compared with controls. Unstable gut mycobiomes and prolonged dysbiosis persisted in a subset of patients with COVID-19 up to 12 days after nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2.

We previously showed that pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma can be diagnosed by detecting MALT lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) translocations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells. Analysis of B-cell clonality based on immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene rearrangements was also reportedly useful for diagnosing pulmonary lymphoma. The aim of this prospective multicenter study was to evaluate the yet unknown diagnostic potential of combined detection of MALT1 translocations and clonality using BALF. We analyzed B- and T-cell clonality based on IGH and T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements together with MALT1 translocations using BALF of patients with clinically suspected pulmonary lymphomas. In total, 39 patients were evaluated and categorized into three groups: B-cell lymphoma, lymphoproliferative disorders, and other diseases. IGH rearrangement detection for B-cell lymphoma diagnosis exhibited sensitivity and specificity of 88.9% and 90.0%, respectively. TCR rearrangements were not observed in patients with B-cell lymphomas. The presence of IGH rearrangements together with the absence of TCR rearrangements indicated 96.0% specificity for the diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma. The sensitivity and specificity of MALT1 translocations for diagnosing MALT lymphoma were 28.6% and 100%, respectively. The combined detection of lymphocyte clonality and MALT1 translocations using BALF is suitable for screening and diagnosis of B-cell lymphomas.

Here we test the hypothesis that Ace2 expression in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts is modulated by the microbiome. We used quantitative PCR to profile Ace2 expression in germ-free mice, conventional raised specific pathogen-free mice, and gnotobiotic mice colonized with different microbiota. Intestinal Ace2 expression levels were significantly higher in germ-free mice compared to conventional mice. A similar trend was observed in the respiratory tract. Intriguingly, microbiota depletion via antibiotics partially recapitulated the germ-free phenotype, suggesting potential for microbiome-mediated regulation of Ace2 expression. Variability in intestinal Ace2 expression was observed in gnotobiotic mice colonized with different microbiota, partially attributable to differences in microbiome-encoded proteases and peptidases.

We examined associations of device-measured sleep, SB and PA, and time reallocations among them, with GDF-15 in older adults. METHODS We used data from 2245 older adults participating in the Seniors-ENRICA-2 study. Wrist-worn accelerometers were employed to ascertain total time in sleep, SB, light PA (LPA) and moderate-to vigorous PA (MVPA). Associations between these activities and serum GDF-15 levels were analysed using linear regression, including isotemporal substitution models for time reallocations among activities, and adjusted for potential confounders. Analyses were conducted separately in two groups (less active and more active individuals) according to the median total PA time. RESULTS In the less active participants, 30 min/day more of MVPA were related to lower levels of GDF-15 when replacing sleep (fully adjusted mean percentage differences [95% confidence interval] in GDF-15 of -9.2% [-13.2, -5.0]), SB (-9.8% [-13.6, -5.8]) and LPA (-5.8% [-11.1, -0.3]), whereas 30 min/day more of LPA were related to lower GDF-15 when replacing both sleep (-3.6% [-6.1, -1.0]) and SB (-4.2% [-6.7, -1.7]). In the more active participants, 30 min/day more of MVPA were also associated with lower GDF-15 when replacing sleep (-2.9% [-5.3, -0.3]), SB (-2.4% [-4.6, -0.2]) and LPA (-3.5% [-6.6, -0.3]), but no associations were found for more time in LPA. Spending more time in SB was associated with higher GDF-15 levels only among those less active (1.9% [0.9, 2.9] per 30 min/day increment). Sleep time did not appear to be associated with GDF-15. CONCLUSIONS The MVPA was inversely associated with GDF-15, with stronger associations at lower PA volumes. Also, more LPA and less SB time were linked to lower GDF-15 in the less active individuals.

A statistical analysis was performed for general status, regional distribution, presence or absence of clusters, and results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests. RESULTS Among the 133 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were 65 boys and 68 girls, with a male/female ratio of 0.96:1. The youngest age of onset was 3 months and 7 days, and the mean age of onset was (95) years. Of all the 133 children, 90(67.7%) were the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection among their family members. Of all the children, 108(81.2%) came from the Gaocheng District in Shijiazhuang, among whom 38(28.6%) were from Xiaoguozhuang Village where the first patient with a confirmed diagnosis lived.

Those with objectifiable alteration in taste or smell were subjected to MRI with contrast agent to investigate possible involvement of the central nervous system. We found dysosmia and dysgeusia to be mostly objectifiable, but no evidence for neuroinvasiveness could be detected by MRI in the late stage of the disease. Alterations in taste and smell could be objectified in most patients. Nevertheless, no evidence for a neuroinvasive potential could be identified by MRI, at least in the late stage of disease.

Prior studies have examined the nutritional quality of foods offered through food banks, but little is known about what government policies may shape the healthy food donation landscape. The purpose of this study was to review US federal policies that impact food and beverage donations to food banks and assess whether policies encourage healthy food donations. In spring 2020, two researchers independently reviewed federal food and beverage donation policies using predefined search terms in two legal databases. We identified six categories of policies based on the existing food donation literature and themes that emerged in the policy review. We identified 42 federal policies spanning six categories that addressed food and beverage donations to food banks. The largest category was government programs, with 19 (45%) policies. The next largest category was donation via schools, with 12 (29%) policies. However, no policies specifically addressed the nutritional quality of food donations. There is an opportunity for the federal government to strengthen food bank donation policies and improve the nutritional quality of donated foods and beverages.","output":"Food Bank Donations in the United States: A Landscape Review of Federal Policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating and first-responding innate myeloid cells and have so far been underestimated in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is the most frequent, immune-mediated, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. MS is treatable but not curable and its cause(s) and pathogenesis remain elusive. The involvement of neutrophils in MS pathogenesis has been suggested by the use of preclinical animal disease models, as well as on the basis of patient sample analysis. In this review, we provide an overview of the possible mechanisms and functions by which neutrophils may contribute to the development and pathology of MS. Neutrophils display a broad variety of effector functions enabling disease pathogenesis, including (1) the release of inflammatory mediators and enzymes, such as interleukin-1?, myeloperoxidase and various proteinases, (2) destruction and phagocytosis of myelin (as debris), (3) release of neutrophil extracellular traps, (4) production of reactive oxygen species, (5) breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and (6) generation and presentation of autoantigens. An important question relates to the issue of whether neutrophils exhibit a predominantly proinflammatory function or are also implicated in the resolution of chronic inflammatory responses in MS.","output":"Neutrophils: Underestimated Players in the Pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Social distancing is a key behavior to minimize COVID-19 infections. Identification of potentially modifiable determinants of social distancing behavior may provide essential evidence to inform social distancing behavioral interventions. PURPOSE: The current study applied an integrated social cognition model to identify the determinants of social distancing behavior, and the processes involved, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In a prospective correlational survey study, samples of Australian (N = 365) and U.S. (N = 440) residents completed online self-report measures of social cognition constructs (attitude, subjective norm, moral norm, anticipated regret, and perceived behavioral control [PBC]), intention, action planning, habit, and past behavior with respect to social distancing behavior at an initial occasion. Follow-up measures of habit and social distancing behavior were taken 1 week later. RESULTS: Structural equation models indicated that subjective norm, moral norm, and PBC were consistent predictors of intention in both samples. Intention, action planning, and habit at follow-up were consistent predictors of social distancing behavior in both samples. Action planning did not have consistent effects mediating or moderating the intention-behavior relationship. Inclusion of past behavior in the model attenuated effects among constructs, although the effects of the determinants of intention and behavior remained. CONCLUSIONS: Current findings highlight the importance of subjective norm, moral obligation, and PBC as determinants of social distancing intention and intention and habit as behavioral determinants. Future research on long-range predictors of social distancing behavior and reciprocal effects in the integrated model is warranted.","output":"Predicting Social Distancing Intention and Behavior During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Integrated Social Cognition Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: Describe naturalistic clinical course over 14 weeks in a mixed adolescent and a young-adult patient group diagnosed with developmental delays and catatonia, when the frequency of maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (M-ECT) was reduced secondary to 2020 COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Methods: Participants were diagnosed with catatonia, and were receiving care in a specialized clinic. They (n = 9), F = 5, and M = 4, ranged in age from 16 to 21 years; ECT frequency was reduced at end of March 2020 due to institutional restrictions. Two parents/caregivers elected to discontinue ECT due to concern for COVID-19 transmission. Majority (n = 8) were developmentally delayed with some degree of intellectual disability (ID). Observable symptoms were rated on a three point scale during virtual visits. Results: All cases experienced clinically significant decline. Worsening of motor symptoms (agitation, aggression, slowness, repetitive self-injury, stereotypies, speech deficits) emerged within the first 3 weeks, persisted over the 14 week observation period and were more frequent than neurovegetative symptoms (appetite, incontinence, sleep). Four participants deteriorated requiring rehospitalization, and 2 among these 4 needed a gastrostomy feeding tube. Conclusion: Moderate and severe symptoms became apparent in all 9 cases during the observation period; medication adjustments were ineffective; resuming M-ECT at each participant's baseline schedule, usually by week 7, resulted in progressive improvement in some cases but the improvement was insufficient to prevent re-hospitalization in 4 cases. In summary, rapid deterioration was noted when M-ECT was acutely reduced in the setting of COVID-19 related restrictions.","output":"Maintenance Electroconvulsive Therapy Is an Essential Medical Treatment for Patients With Catatonia: A COVID-19 Related Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The trend of telemedicine is exponentially increasing worldwide due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However, patient satisfaction is always a concern regarding the use of telemedicine. Introduction: The aim of this study is to evaluate the perception and satisfaction level of patients toward the use of telemedicine during the pandemic of COVID-19 among Pakistani population. Materials and Methods: The survey questionnaires were distributed to 251 patients who received telemedicine consultation in any of three specializations: orthopedic, ophthalmology, and general medicine. The questionnaire contains 15 questions that covered four categories of patient satisfaction: interpersonal communication, caring, care delivery, and proficiency. Descriptive and analytical statistics were obtained by analyzing data using SPSS software version 20. Results: A total of 251 patients responded to the telemedicine questionnaire. Overall, 61.35% patients reported that they did not need any support for using technology during consultation and 96.41% of the patient population reported that telemedicine saved their travel time. It was found that gender, education, and age were significantly associated with the ease in technology with the p-value 0.012, 0.004 and <0.001, respectively, whereas the use of telemedicine again in future is found to be significantly associated with only education and age p-value <0.001.

One of the two enzymes, papain-like protease or PLpro, also possesses deubiquitination and deISGylation activities that suppresses host innate immune responses toward SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, PLpro is a potential COVID-19 drug target. To repurpose drugs for PLpro, we experimentally screened 33 deubiquitinase and 37 cysteine protease inhibitors on their inhibition of PLpro. Our results showed that 15 deubiquitinase and 1 cysteine protease inhibitors exhibit potent inhibition of PLpro at 200 M. More comprehensive characterizations revealed 7 inhibitors GRL0617, SJB2-043, TCID, DUB-IN-1, DUB-IN-3, PR-619, and S130 with an IC50 value below 60 M and four inhibitors GRL0617, SJB2-043, TCID, and PR-619 with an IC50 value below 10 M. Among four inhibitors with an IC50 value below 10 M, SJB2-043 is the most unique in that it doesnt fully inhibit PLpro but has an outstanding IC50 value of 0.56 M. SJB2-043 likely binds to an allosteric site of PLpro to convene its inhibition effect, which needs to be further investigated.

Further uneven distribution of the health workforce is a major barrier to the effective diagnosis and treatment of CRDs. Teleconsultation between a specialist and non-specialist could possibly bridge the gap in access to health care and decrease CRD burden in remote areas. This review investigates the evidence for the effective use of specialist to non-specialist teleconsultation in the management of CRDs in remote areas and identifies instances of good practice and knowledge gaps. METHODS: We searched for articles till November 2020, which focused on specialist to non-specialist teleconsultations for CRD diagnosis or management. Two independent reviewers conducted the title and abstract screening and extracted data from the selected papers and the quality was assessed by Joanna Briggs Institutes (JBI) tool. A descriptive and narrative approach was used due to the heterogeneous nature of the selected studies. RESULTS: We found 1715, articles that met the initial search criteria, but after excluding duplicates and non-eligible articles, we included 10 research articles of moderate quality. These articles were from nine different studies, all of which, except one, were conducted in high-income countries. The studies reported results in terms of impact on the patients, and the health care providers including primary care physicians (PCP) and specialists. The teleconsulting systems used in all the selected papers primarily used audio modes in addition to other modes like the audio-video medium. The included studies reported primarily non-clinical outcomes including effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability and usability of the teleconsultation systems and only three described the clinical outcomes. The teleconsultation was predominantly conducted in the PCPs office with the specialist located remotely. CONCLUSIONS: We found relatively few, papers which explored specialist to non-specialist teleconsultation in management of CRDs, and no controlled trials. Two of the included papers described systems, which were used for other diseases in addition to the CRD. The available literature although not generalisable, encourages the use of specialist to non-specialist teleconsultation for diagnosis and management of CRDs.","output":"Specialist to non-specialist teleconsultations in chronic respiratory disease management: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Biocontaminants represent higher risks to occupants' health in shared spaces. Natural ventilation is an effective strategy against indoor air biocontamination. However, the relationship between natural ventilation and indoor air contamination requires an in-depth investigation of the behavior of airborne infectious diseases, particularly concerning the contaminant's viral and aerodynamic characteristics. This research investigates the effectiveness of natural ventilation in preventing infection risks for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) through indoor air contamination of a free-running, naturally-ventilated room (where no space conditioning is used) that contains a person having COVID-19 through building-related parameters. Design/methodology/approach This research adopts a case study strategy involving a simulation-based approach. A simulation pipeline is implemented through a number of design scenarios for an open office. The simulation pipeline performs integrated contamination analysis, coupling a parametric 3D design environment, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and energy simulations. The results of the implemented pipeline for COVID-19 are evaluated for building and environment-related parameters. Study metrics are identified as indoor air contamination levels, discharge period and the time of infection. Findings According to the simulation results, higher indoor air temperatures help to reduce the infection risk. Free-running spring and fall seasons can pose higher infection risk as compared to summer. Higher opening-to-wall ratios have higher potential to reduce infection risk. Adjacent window configuration has an advantage over opposite window configuration. As a design strategy, increasing opening-to-wall ratio has a higher impact on reducing the infection risk as compared to changing the opening configuration from opposite to adjacent. However, each building setup is a unique case that requires a systematic investigation to reliably understand the complex airflow and contaminant dispersion behavior. Metrics, strategies and actions to minimize indoor contamination risks should be addressed in future building standards. The simulation pipeline developed in this study has the potential to support decision-making during the adaptation of existing buildings to pandemic conditions and the design of new buildings. Originality/value The addressed need of investigation is especially crucial for the COVID-19 that is contagious and hazardous in shared indoors due to its aerodynamic behavior, faster transmission rates and high viral replicability. This research contributes to the current literature by presenting the simulation-based results for COVID-19 as investigated through building-related and environment-related parameters against contaminant concentration levels, the discharge period and the time of infection. Accordingly, this research presents results to provide a basis for a broader understanding of the correlation between the built environment and the aerodynamic behavior of COVID-19.","output":"The impact of natural ventilation on airborne biocontaminants: a study on COVID-19 dispersion in an open office"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"My article looks at the events around Shaheen Bagh through the frame of the 1987 Hindi feature film Mirch Masala and analyses the politics of space and gender in both. In late 2019Cearly 2020, elderly women of Shaheen Bagh, a Muslim ghetto in south New Delhi, staged an unprecedented protest against the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA). These women had never before been politically active, nor had any support from political or social organisations. However, their protest soon captured the imagination of not only other Indians but also the world. The peaceful sit-in, which survived repeated vilification, attacks, and even a communal riot, created for the first time a significant challenge to the Hindu majoritarian philosophy of Prime Minister Narendra Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its parent organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). In March 2020, as the country went into a lockdown, the government finally managed to evacuate the protestors, but as several commentators have argued, Shaheen Bagh had ceased to be a geographical site and had become a reimagination of the nation itself. Mirch Masala, set in a village in western India in the 1940s, is considered to be one of the first feminist Hindi films. The narrative of the film revolves around a resistance set up by some of the village women against the local colonial officials lecherous desires for one of them. While there are obviously significant differences between the narrative of the film and the real-life protest, both allow us to study gendered spaces and reimaginations of citizenships.","output":"Chilli powder and resistance: Mirch Masala, Shaheen Bagh, and the politics of space"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efficient therapy of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is still a major challenge.

Two co-leaders led the group while the third disseminated electronic materials and scored the patients' online sleep diaries. Virtual administration of CBT-I had benefits and challenges. Report of case(s): Firstly, many of the patients were familiar with teleconferencing as their jobs also transitioned to virtual meetings and could identify environments with limited interruptions. Telehealth group etiquette such as muting audio, timely diary submission, and peer support were easily mastered. However, one patient had poor internet connection, which necessitated switching between their laptop and phone to connect and seemed to negatively impact engagement with the group. Furthermore, the clinicians were confronted with the difficult decision to continue helping troubleshoot technical issues or continue with the session. During in-person visits, co-leaders could address difficulties with sleep prescription or questions about the material;however, balancing technical issues, answering questions, and facilitating support amongst the patients via telehealth was often distracting and inefficient. From a clinician perspective, it was difficult to co-lead the group due to patients respectfully muting their mics, resulting in less contributions to discussion. Additionally, many of the administrative tasks typically completed with clinic staff after an in-person session were completed during session, making it challenging to maintain confidentiality. Presentation of visual aids was difficult as patient using cellphones to connect could not view and download files while connected to session. Finally, basic clinical techniques were impacted using the virtual platform. For instance, 'sitting in silence' was less effective while maintaining eye contact with the entire group was facilitated by looking directly at the camera. Unfortunately, reading facial expressions and non-verbals was often more difficult and clinicians relied on more direct questions rather than open-ended questions. Conclusion: These challenges provide opportunities to learn how to make CBT-I via telehealth more effective. Despite the challenges of transitioning to telepsychology, the CBT-I group was effective as evidenced by high satisfaction ratings from patients, reductions in PHQ-9 and ISI scores, SOL, WASO, and increases in sleep efficiency.","output":"Transitions to virtual administration of CBT-I: Strengths and barriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Purpose This retrospective study aims to illustrate the radiographic characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the correlation with the clinical course.

It is based on the use of two antibodies directed one against a typical exosomal housekeeping protein and the second against either another exosomal housekeeping protein or a potential disease marker: the first antibody is used for the capture of exosomes, the second for the quantification and characterization of the captured vesicles. In fact, with this method it is possible both to characterize and count exosomes and to detect the presence of disease, including tumor, biomarkers. This needs of course to preliminary obtain an EVs purification from the clinical sample; the most agreed method to get to an EVs purification is the repeated rounds of ultracentrifugation, that, while far to be perfect, is the methodological approach allowing to not exclude EVs subpopulation from the separation procedure and to analyze a full range of EVs from both qualitative and quantitative point of view. The immunocapture-based approach has proven to be highly useful in screening, diagnosis and prognosis of tumors, in plasma samples. One amazing information provided by this method is that cancer patients have always significantly higher levels of EVs, in particular of exosomes, independently from the histological nature of the tumor. One microenvironmental factor that is fully involved in the increased exosome release by tumors is the extracellular acidity. However, few pre-clinical data suggest that plasmatic levels of exosomes may correlate with the tumor mass. Some recent clinical reports suggest also that circulating exosomes represent the real delivery system for some known tumor markers that are presently on trial (e.g., PSA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for articles published till August 10, 2020. We included studies providing information regarding diagnostic test accuracy of FDA-EUA POCTs for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The methodologic quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. The review protocol is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (protocol number CRD42020202248). RESULTS: We included 26 studies describing a total of 3242 samples. The summary sensitivity and specificity were 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88-0.97] and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99-1.00), respectively. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99-1.00). A pooled analysis based on the index test revealed a summary sensitivity and specificity of Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 [0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-1.00) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00, respectively)] and ID NOW COVID-19 [0.78 (95% CI: 0.74-0.82) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98-1.00), respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: FDA-EUA POCTs, especially molecular assays, have high sensitivity, specificity, and overall diagnostic accuracy for detecting SARS-CoV-2. If approved, FDA-EUA POCTs can provide a rapid and practical way to identify infected individuals early on and help to limit the strain on the healthcare system.

Methods: From March 16 to April 30th, 2020, patients with MS or related disorders at NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center (MSCC) were identified with laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The diagnosis was established using a standardized questionnaire or by a review of in-patient hospital records. Results: We identified 76 patients (55 with relapsing MS of which 9 had pediatric-onset;17 with progressive MS; and 4 with related disorders). 37 underwent PCR testing and were confirmed positive. Of the entire group, 64 (84%) patients were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) including anti-CD20 therapies (n=34, 44.7%) and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators (n=10, 13.5%). The most common COVID-19 symptoms were fever and cough, but 21.1% of patients had neurologic symptom recrudescence preceding or coinciding with the infection. A total of 18 (23.7%) were hospitalized; 8 (10.5%) had COVID-19 critical illness or related death. Features more common among those hospitalized or with critical illness or death were older age, presence of comorbidities, progressive disease, and a non-ambulatory status. No DMT class was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or fatal outcome. Conclusions: Most MS patients with COVID-19 do not require hospitalization despite being on DMTs. Factors associated with critical illness were similar to the general at risk patient population.

We treat the problem by adopting a partial differential equation (PDE) version of the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, Deceased (SIRD) compartmental model of epidemiology, which is achieved by replacing compartmental populations by their densities. Building on our recent work (Computational Mechanics, 66, 1177, 2020), we replace our earlier use of global polynomial basis functions with those having local support, as epitomized in the finite element method, for the spatial representation of the SIRD parameters. The time dependence is treated by inferring constant parameters over time intervals that coincide with the time step in semi-discrete numerical implementations. In combination, this amounts to a scheme of field inversion of the SIRD parameters over each time step. Applied to data over ten months of 2020 for the pandemic in the US state of Michigan and to all of Mexico, our system inference via field inversion infers spatio-temporally varying PDE SIRD parameters that replicate the progression of the pandemic with high accuracy. It also produces accurate predictions, when compared against data, for a three week period into 2021. Of note is the insight that is suggested on the spatio-temporal variation of infection, recovery and death rates, as well as patterns of the population's mobility revealed by diffusivities of the compartments.","output":"System inference via field inversion for the spatio-temporal progression of infectious diseases: Studies of COVID-19 in Michigan and Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of the global coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), the biggest global killer and major risk factor for severe COVID-19 infections. We aim to explore the indirect consequences of COVID-19 on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with CVD. METHODS: Eighty-one adult outpatients with CVD were assessed using the EQ-5D, a generic health status instrument with five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), before and during the pandemic. Changes in the EQ-5D dimensional responses were compared categorically as well as using the dimension-specific sum-score (range 1C3, with a higher score indicating worse health). The responses and sum-score were compared using the exact test of symmetry and the paired t-test, respectively. RESULTS: These patients [mean age (SD) 59.8 (10.5); 92.6% males; 56% New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I] had coronary artery disease (69%), heart failure (28%), or arrhythmias (15%). None experienced change in NYHA class between assessments. About 30% and 38% of patients reported problems with at least one of the EQ-5D dimensions pre-pandemic and during the pandemic, respectively. The highest increase in health problems was reported for anxiety/depression (12.5% pre-pandemic vs 23.5% during pandemic; p = 0.035) with mean domain-specific score from 1.12 (SD 0.33) to 1.25 (SD 0.46) (standardized effect size = 0.373, p = 0.012).

This study assessed central and peripheral fatigue after self-paced exercise of different durations. METHODS Thirteen well-trained male cyclists completed 4-, 20-, and 40-km simulated time trials (TTs). Pre- and immediately post-TT (<2.5 min), twitch responses from the knee extensors to electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve and transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex were recorded to assess neuromuscular and corticospinal function. RESULTS Time to complete 4-, 20-, and 40-km TTs was 6.0  0.2, 31.8  1.0, and 65.8  2.2 min at average exercise intensities of 96%, 92%, and 87% of maximum oxygen uptake, respectively. Exercise resulted in significant reductions in maximum voluntary contraction, with no difference between TTs (-18%, -15%, and -16% for 4-, 20-, and 40-km TTs, respectively). Greater peripheral fatigue was evident after 4-km (40% reduction in potentiated twitch) compared with that after 20-km (31%) and 40-km TTs (29%). In contrast, longer TTs were characterized by more central fatigue, with greater reductions in voluntary activation measured by motor nerve (-11% and -10% for 20- and 40-km TTs vs -7% for 4-km TTs) and cortical stimulation (-12% and -10% for 20- and 40-km vs -6% for 4-km).

PATIENTS Forty-nine patients were included; 23(46.9%) born at term, 12(24.5%) born very preterm to late preterm, and 14(28.6%) born extremely preterm. INTERVENTION Cortisol levels were drawn at baseline, 15, 30, and 60 minutes following administration of Cortrosyn TM 1mcg/kg (maximum dose 1mcg). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Timing of peak cortisol level and marginal value of drawing a second and third cortisol sample at 15, 30 or 60 minutes was determined. RESULTS Cortisol peaked at 15-, 30- and 60-minute sampling times for 4%, 27% and 69 % of patients. The probability that a failed LDST changes to a pass by adding a 15- or 30-minute sample to the superior 60 minute sample is 5.6% (1-25.8%) and 11% (3.1-32.6%) respectively, for a cortisol pass threshold of 18.1mcg/dL (500nmol/L). CONCLUSIONS In contrast to studies of older children, we found that the majority of neonatal LDST cortisol peaks occurred at the 60-minute sampling time with the addition of a 30 minute sample providing substantial benefit. It is questionable if a 15-minute sample provides any benefit, making a case to revise LDST protocols to sample cortisol later for neonates.","output":"Evaluating the low-dose ACTH stimulation test (LDST) in neonates: Ideal times for cortisol measurement."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Social exclusion usually contributes to an increased vulnerability to mental health problems and risky health behaviors.

The self-administered questionnaire included items about sociodemographics, eating habits, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and substance use. Depressive symptoms were measured using the short version of the Child Depression Inventory. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyze our results. Results: Daily fruit and vegetable consumption was reported by 21.7% and 22.4% of respondents, respectively. The proportion of the respondents reporting daily sweets consumption stood at 13.2%, daily soft drinks consumption was 12.3%, and daily energy drink consumption tallied to 4.5%. More than one-third of the sample (35.5%) reported having breakfast every school day, which rose to 68.1% of the sample reporting breakfast on both weekend days. The rate of students engaged in daily physical activity was 6.5%, while 86.1% of them reported more than four hours screen time in a day. In addition, despite the mandatory confinement, a notable percentage of adolescents engaged in substance use. Consistent with previous studies, girls had a higher risk of depression. Low levels of physical activity and high levels of screen time - as well as alcohol and drug use - were associated with a high risk of depression.

However, the mechanism for cardiac infection and cardiomyocyte injury in COVID-19 patients remains unclear. The current literature supports the notion that SARS-CoV-2 particles access the heart either by the circulating blood cells or by extracellular vesicles, originating from the inflamed lungs, and encapsulating the virus along with its receptor (ACE2). Both cardiomyocytes and pericytes (coronary arteries) express the necessary accessory proteins for access of SARS-CoV-2 particles (i.e. ACE2, NRP-1, TMPRSS2, CD147, integrin 51, and CTSB/L). These proteins facilitate the SARS-CoV-2 interaction and entry into the pericytes and cardiomyocytes thus leading to cardiac manifestations. Subsequently, various signaling pathways are altered in the infected cardiomyocytes (i.e. increased ROS production, reduced contraction, impaired calcium homeostasis), causing cardiac dysfunction. The currently adopted pharmacotherapy in severe COVID-19 subjects exhibited side effects on the heart, often manifested by electrical abnormalities. Nonetheless, cardiovascular adverse repercussions have been associated with the advent of some of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with no clear mechanisms underlining these complications. We provide herein an overview of the pathways involved with cardiomyocyte in COVID-19 subjects to help promoting pharmacotherapies that can protect against SARS-CoV-2-induced cardiac injuries.","output":"Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with cardiomyocytes: Insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of cardiac injury and pharmacotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has infected over 109 000 000 people with 2 423 443 deaths as of February 17, 2021.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, some clinicians might have opted for less potent immunosuppressive agents to counterbalance the novel infectious risk. We conducted a nationwide study to characterize immunosuppression use and subsequent clinical outcomes during the first 5 months of COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS Using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we studied all kidney-only recipients in the United States from 1/1/2017 to 3/12/2020 (\\"prepandemic\\" era; n=64 849) and from 3/13/2020 to 7/31/2020 (\\"pandemic\\" era; n=5035). We compared the use of lymphocyte-depleting agents (vs. basiliximab or no induction) and maintenance steroids (vs. steroid avoidance/withdrawal) in the pandemic era compared to the prepandemic era. Then, we compared early posttransplant outcomes by immunosuppression regimen during the pandemic era. RESULTS Recipients in the pandemic era were substantially less likely to receive lymphocyte-depleting induction agents compared to their prepandemic counterparts (aOR=0.400.530.69); similar trends were found across subgroups of state-level COVID-19 incidence, donor type, and recipient age. However, lymphocyte-depleting induction agents were associated with decreased rejection during admission (aOR=0.110.230.47), but not with increased mortality in the pandemic era (aHR=0.130.471.66). On the other hand, the use of maintenance steroids versus early steroid withdrawal remained similar (aOR=0.711.071.62). CONCLUSIONS The use of lymphocyte-depleting induction agents has decreased in favor of basiliximab and no induction during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. METHODS: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across China. The model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted. RESULTS: We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range [IQR] 76,776 C 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p<0.001, R(2)=0.86) with reported incidence. Without NPIs, the number of COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (IQR: 44 C 94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. If NPIs could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in China, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. However, if NPIs were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across China, respectively. Results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in China to prevent case numbers increasing again after travel restrictions were lifted on February 17, 2020. CONCLUSION: The NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Early and integrated NPI strategies should be prepared, adopted and adjusted to minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions around the World.","output":"Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the high incidence of cancer in the elderly, little is known about the protective immune response against cancer and the treatment of other comorbidities.

METHODS: In an experimental set-up, phacoemulsification was performed on enucleated goat eyes and cadaveric human corneoscleral rims mounted on an artificial anterior chamber. Standard settings for sculpt and quadrant removal mode were used on Visalis 100 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). Microincision and standard phacoemulsification were performed using titanium straight tips (2.2 mm and 2.8 mm in diameter). The main wound incisions were titrated equal to and larger than the sleeve size. High-speed shadowgraphy technique was used to detect the possible generation of any droplets and aerosols. The visualization and quantification of size of the aerosols and droplets along with calculation of their spread were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: In longitudinal phacoemulsification using a peristaltic pump device with a straight tip, no aerosol generation was seen in a closed chamber. In larger wounds, there was a slow leak at the main wound. The atomization of balanced salt solution was observed only when the phacoemulsification tip was completely exposed next to the ocular surface.

Many antiviral agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, have been used to treat COVID-19, without being broadly accepted. QTc prolongation is a worrisome adverse effect, scarcely studied in pediatrics. Patients and methods. Paediatric patients affected from COVID-19 who received antivirals were matched (1:2) with controls not infected nor exposed. Electrocardiograms were prospectively analyzed at baseline, during the first 72 hours in treatment and after 72 hours. Results. Eleven (22.9%) out of 48 patients admitted due to COVID-19 (March-July 2020) received antiviral therapy. All had underlying diseases: congenital heart disease (4/11; 36.4%) and immunosuppression (3/11; 27.3%) stand out. 5/11 (45.5%) received treatment at baseline with a potential effect on QTc. There where no differences observed in the baseline QTc between cases and controls: 414.8ms (49.2) vs 416.5ms (29.4), (p=0.716). Baseline long QT was observed in 2/11 cases and 2/22. Among cases, 10/11 (90.9%) received hydroxychloroquine, mainly associated with azithromycin (8/11; 72.7%), 3 received lopinavir/ritonavir and one remdesivir. The median increase in QTc after 72 hours under treatment was 28.9 ms [IQR 48.7] (p=0.062). 4/11 (36.4%) patients had a long QTc at 72 hours, resulting in 3 patients 500ms; treatment was stopped in one (QTc 510ms) but ventricular arrhythmias were not documented. Conclusions. The use of antivirals caused an increase on the QTc interval after 72 hours of treatment, being the QTc long in 36.3% of the patients, although no arrhythmic events were observed. The use of hydroxychloroquine and antivirals requires active QTc monitoring and it is recommended to discontinue treatment if QTc >500ms.","output":"EVOLUCIN DEL INTERVALO QTC EN PACIENTES CON INFECCIN SARS-COV-2 TRATADOS CON FARMACOS ANTIVIRALES?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundLittle is known about COVID-19 information-seeking experiences for culturally and linguistically diverse groups in Australia.

However, no information on the performance of surviving pigs that were exposed to the PEDv as piglets is available. Here, a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) infection on growing pigs performance, as indicated by mortality, average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) was performed using production records from weaned pigs in nursery and wean-to-finish sites from sow farms that became PEDv-infected between May 2013 and June 2014. Production records from the first batch of growing pigs weaned in infected flows after the PEDv outbreak (infected batches) were compared with those from pigs weaned within the previous 14 to 120 days (control batches). Performance records from infected and control batches, paired by flow, were compared using non-parametric paired tests. Mortality, ADG and FCR were significantly different in PEDv-positive (infected) compared with PEDv-negative (control) batches, with a mean increase of mortality and FCR of 11% and 0.5, respectively, and a decrease of ADG of 0.16 lb/day. Our results demonstrate a poorer performance of growing pigs weaned after a PEDv outbreak compared with those weaned within the previous 14-120 days, suggesting that in addition to the mortality induced by PEDv in suckling pigs, the disease also impairs the performance of surviving pig. These findings help to quantify the impact of PEDv infection in the US and, ultimately, contribute to efforts to quantify the cost-effectiveness of disease prevention and control measures.","output":"Impact of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea on Performance of Growing Pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (vvIBDV) causes high mortality in chickens but measures to reduce the mortality have not been explored.

METHODS: From March 14 to April 6, 2020, 72 non-hospitalized patients referred by the emergency department to CTPA for COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively identified. Relevant clinical and laboratory data and CT scan findings were collected for each patient. CTPA scans were reviewed by two radiologists to determinate the presence or absence of APE. Clinical classification, lung involvement of COVID-19 pneumonia, and CT total severity score were compared between APE group and non-APE group. RESULTS: APE was identified in 13 (18%) CTPA scans. The mean age and D-dimer of patients from the APE group were higher in comparison with those from the non-APE group (74.4 vs. 59.6 years, p = 0.008, and 7.29 vs. 3.29 g/ml, p = 0.011). There was no significant difference between APE and non-APE groups concerning clinical type, COVID-19 pneumonia lung lesions (ground-glass opacity: 85% vs. 97%; consolidation: 69% vs. 68%; crazy paving: 38% vs. 37%; linear reticulation: 69% vs. 78%), CT severity score (6.3 vs. 7.1, p = 0.365), quality of CTPA (1.8 vs. 2.0, p = 0.518), and pleural effusion (38% vs. 19%, p = 0.146).

One of the measures to ensure social distancing and restricting the movements has been national lockdown, to break the chain of transmission. Telemedicine is a cost-effective measure to provide medical services to remote underserved areas. Objective: The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of teleconsultation as an alternative option to in-person consultation in providing continued medical care for neurology patients during the national lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: The clinical demographic profile, frequency of different neurological disorders, and treatment details of the patients attending the teleneurology consultation (TNCO) outpatient department (OPD) at Sir Sunderlal Hospital (S.S.H.), Institute of Medical Sciences (I.M.S.), BHU, Varanasi, India, were recorded in a prespecified pro forma. Results: A total of 1,567 patients attended the TNCO OPD over 90 days. The average patient attendance was 35 per day, and 72% were males. Out of these, 77% of patients were from the same district, and the majority of patients (68%) were regularly followed up in-person by the neurology OPD. The most common illness for consultation was epilepsy (19%) followed by low backache and stroke (18% each). The satisfaction rate among the patients with respect to teleservices was high (90%). Conclusion: TNCO seems to be as effective as in-person OPD in the management of neurological disorders. During the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, avoiding physical visits through TNCO may reduce the spread of the virus.

The usual treatment of hypercapnia is to increase ventilation. During the recent surge of COVID-19, respiratory acidosis unresponsive to increased mechanical ventilatory support was common. Increasing mechanical ventilation comes at the expense of barotrauma and hemodynamic compromise from increasing positive end-expiratory pressures or minute ventilation. Treating acute respiratory acidemia with sodium bicarbonate remains controversial. RECENT FINDINGS: There are no randomized controlled trials of administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidemia. A recent review concluded that alkali therapy for mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis might be useful but was based on the conflicting and not conclusive literature regarding metabolic acidosis. This strategy should not be extrapolated to treatment of respiratory acidemia. Low tidal volume ventilation in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has beneficial effects associated with permissive hypercapnia. Whether the putative benefits will be negated by administration of alkali is not known. Hypercapnic acidosis is well tolerated, with few adverse effects as long as tissue perfusion and oxygenation are maintained.

These contaminants harm the environment and human health causing the spread of disease. Thus, effective treatment of hospital wastewater is an urgent task for sustainable development. Membranes, with controllable porous and nonporous structures, have been rapidly developed for molecular separations. In particular, membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology demonstrated high removal efficiency toward organic compounds and low waste sludge production. To further enhance the separation efficiency and achieve material recovery from hospital waste streams, novel concepts of MBRs and their applications are rapidly evolved through hybridizing novel membranes (non hydrophilic ultrafiltration/microfiltration) into the MBR units (hybrid MBRs) or the MBR as a pretreatment step and integrating other membrane processes as subsequent secondary purification step (integrated MBR-membrane systems). However, there is a lack of reviews on the latest advancement in MBR technologies for hospital wastewater treatment, and analysis on its major challenges and future trends. This review started with an overview of main pollutants in common hospital waste-water, followed by an understanding on the key performance indicators/criteria in MBR membranes (i.e., solute selectivity) and processes (e.g., fouling). Then, an in-depth analysis was provided into the recent development of hybrid MBR and integrated MBR-membrane system concepts, and applications correlated with wastewater sources, with a particular focus on hospital wastewaters. It is anticipated that this review will shed light on the knowledge gaps in the field, highlighting the potential contribution of hybrid MBRs and integrated MBR-membrane systems toward global epidemic prevention.

The primary objective of the COVID-19 Ring-based Prevention Trial with lopinavir/ritonavir (CORIPREV-LR) is to evaluate the efficacy of a 14-day course of oral lopinavir/ritonavir as PEP against COVID-19 among individuals with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed case. METHODS: This is an open-label, multicenter, 1:1 cluster-randomized trial of LPV/r 800/200 mg twice daily for 14 days (intervention arm) versus no intervention (control arm), using an adaptive approach to sample size calculation. Participants will be individuals aged > 6 months with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case within the past 7 days. A combination of remote and in-person study visits at days 1, 7, 14, 35, and 90 includes comprehensive epidemiological, clinical, microbiologic, and serologic sampling. The primary outcome is microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection within 14 days after exposure, defined as a positive respiratory tract specimen for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction. Secondary outcomes include safety, symptomatic COVID-19, seropositivity, hospitalization, respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, mortality, psychological impact, and health-related quality of life. Additional analyses will examine the impact of LPV/r on these outcomes in the subset of participants who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. To detect a relative risk reduction of 40% with 80% power at &#945; = 0.05, assuming the secondary attack rate in ring members (p0) = 15%, 5 contacts per case and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.05, we require 110 clusters per arm, or 220 clusters overall and approximately 1220 enrollees after accounting for 10% loss-to-follow-up. We will modify the sample size target after 60 clusters, based on preliminary estimates of p0, ICC, and cluster size and consider switching to an alternative drug after interim analyses and as new data emerges. The primary analysis will be a generalized linear mixed model with logit link to estimate the effect of LPV/r on the probability of infection. Participants who test positive at baseline will be excluded from the primary analysis but will be maintained for additional analyses to examine the impact of LPV/r on early treatment. DISCUSSION: Harnessing safe, existing drugs such as LPV/r as PEP could provide an important tool for control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Novel aspects of our design include the ring-based prevention approach, and the incorporation of remote strategies for conducting study visits and biospecimen collection.

OBJECTIVE: The arrhythmic safety profile of HCQ monotherapy, which remains under investigation as a therapeutic and prophylactic agent in COVID-19, is less established and we sought to evaluate this. METHODS: In 245 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the University of Washington hospital system between March 9 and May 10, 2020, we identified 111 treated with HCQ monotherapy. Patients treated with HCQ underwent a systematic arrhythmia and QT interval surveillance protocol including serial electrocardiograms (ECG) (baseline, following second HCQ dose). The primary endpoint was in-hospital sustained ventricular arrhythmia or arrhythmic cardiac arrest. Secondary endpoints included clinically significant QTc prolongation. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients with COVID-19 underwent treatment with HCQ monotherapy (mean age 6216 years, 44 women [39%], serum creatinine 0.9 [interquartile range 0.4] mg/dL). There were no instances of sustained ventricular arrythmia or arrhythmic cardiac arrest. In 75 patients with serial ECGs, clinically significant QTc prolongation was observed in a minority (N=5 [7%]). In patients with serial ECGs, there was no significant change in the QTc interval in pre-specified subgroups of interest, including those with prevalent cardiovascular disease or baseline use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis inhibitors. CONCLUSION: In the context of a systematic monitoring protocol, HCQ monotherapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was not associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmia.

METHODS: We conducted an observational study on non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients administered dabigatran at different dosing intervals at the Department of Geriatrics, Peking University First Hospital, China. We enrolled 121 consecutive non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients aged &#8805;60 years on dabigatran therapy (mean age, 79.6  7.4 years); they were administered conventional low-dose dabigatran (110 mg twice daily) or extended-interval dosing with dabigatran (110 mg every 16 h or every 24 h). All patients received follow-up care, and we evaluated the presence of bleeding and thromboembolic events. RESULTS: All patients exhibited creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min with an average of 56.6  17.3 mL/min. Sixty-two patients received extended-interval dosing with dabigatran at a mean dose of 117.1  18.6 mg daily. Patients on extended-interval dosing were older; they exhibited lower creatinine clearance and bodyweight and higher CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores. The mean follow-up time was 25.8  15.6 months. No significant differences were observed in the trough and peak values of the activated partial thromboplastin time and in thromboembolic or bleeding events between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Extended-interval dabigatran dosing in older patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and lower creatinine clearance can maintain activated partial thromboplastin time trough and peak values comparable to the conventional low dose.

Several underlying pathologies have also been associated with splenic rupture, such as hematological diseases, malignancies, and infectious and inflammatory diseases. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 52-year-old man who referred to the Poursina Hospital in Rasht while complaining of abdominal pain from the day before hospitalization. The patient reported a history of lethargy, fever, and nausea. In the examinations performed, there was a brief tenderness in the patients epigastrium. The patient was monitored and about 12 h after hospitalization, ill appearance, respiratory (respiratory distress) symptoms, and high fever were reported for the patient. According to the examination, the patient was immediately transferred to the operating room and underwent laparotomy. During the operation, contrary to our expectations, a lot of blood (about 1000 cc) was observed in the patients abdomen. After blood suctioning, the left upper quadrant (LUQ) was bleeding and the rupture of the spleen could also be observed. Therefore, a splenectomy was performed. In the examinations performed for the patient, the patients rtPCR test confirmed COVID-19.

METHODS: The self-quarantine programme and pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening were initiated for patients who were scheduled for admission later than 7 May 2020 for elective orthopaedic surgery on admission. On the day of admission, the patients declared compliance with self-quarantine regulations. The admission was refused in cases of non-compliance. After admission, the patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening. If PCR results were negative, isolation was terminated. If PCR results were positive, the surgery was postponed. If the patients had symptoms suspicious of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) after surgery, the PCR test was repeated. RESULTS: Overall, 308 patients (age: 63.2  18.8 years, 197 female and 111 male) were scheduled for elective orthopaedic surgery. Two patients did not agree with the requirements of self-quarantine, and two other procedures were cancelled. No non-compliance was reported; thus, the completion rate of the self-quarantine programme was 304/308 (98.7%). Finally, 304 patients underwent PCR testing, and there were no positive PCR results. After cancellations of four operations due to reasons other than COVID-19, 300 surgical procedures were performed. No patients developed COVID-19 during hospitalisation.

However, gastrointestinal barriers and antigen degradation impose significant hurdles in the development of oral vaccines. Live attenuated viruses and bacteria can overcome these barriers but at the risk of introducing safety concerns. As an alternative, particles have been investigated for antigen protection and delivery, yet there are no FDA-approved oral vaccines based on particle-based delivery systems. Our objective was to discover underlying determinants that can explain the current inadequacies and identify paradigms that can be implemented in future for successful development of oral vaccines relying on particle-based delivery systems. AREAS COVERED We reviewed literature related to the use of particles for oral vaccination and placed special emphasis on formulation characteristics and administration schedules to gain an insight into how these parameters impact production of antigen-specific antibodies in systemic and mucosal compartments. EXPERT OPINION Despite the long history of vaccines, particle-based oral vaccination is a relative new field with the first study published in 1989. Substantial variability exists between different studies with respect to dosing schedules, number of doses, and the amount of vaccine per dose. Most studies have not used adjuvants in the formulations. Better standardization in vaccination parameters is required to improve comparison between experiments, and adjuvants should be used to enhance the systemic and mucosal immune responses and to reduce the number of doses, which will make oral vaccines more attractive.","output":"Demystifying particle-based oral vaccines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated longstanding inequities in opioid use disorder (OUD) that reflect multiple facets of structural racism. In Massachusetts, opioid overdose deaths in 2020 rose by nearly 70% in Black men compared to just 5% overall. Emergency department (ED) visits in people with OUD may represent key touchpoints for overdose prevention. Although racial inequities in buprenorphine and methadone maintenance initiation, dosing, and retention have been well documented, less is known about the administration of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD, buprenorphine and methadone), in the ED. ED leadership initiated an internal review to explore racial equity in multiple clinical quality metrics, including frequency of MOUD administration in patients with OUD. Methods: Retrospective data were analyzed for quality improvement (QI) purposes. Patients presenting to the ED with OUD July 29, 2020-March 12, 2021 were identified via ICD-10 codes. Patient demographics and MOUD administration were explored using descriptive statistics;c2 tests compared the frequency of MOUD administration by race. An intensive QI intervention to improve MOUD utilization will be delivered to all ED prescribers in June 2021. The intervention includes content on racial inequities in OUD treatment and factors that drive them, including provider bias, reasons for mistrust of the medical system among patients of color, and structural barriers to OUD treatment and retention. Through educational sessions for providers, transparency of data of current MOUD trends in the ED, and structured on-shift reminders by ED pharmacists, we plan to improve provider-patient communication and MOUD utilization in the ED. The QI initiative will be followed by a three-month monitoring period (July-September 2021) to evaluate for changes in MOUD administration. Results: A total of 998 unique patients with OUD were seen for 1452 ED visits. Documented race was 56.7% White, 21.5% Black, 13.5% Hispanic, 1.7% Other, and 6.6% unknown. MOUD were administered during 945/1452 visits (65.1%). The likelihood of administration varied significantly by race: 80.3% of White patients received MOUD compared to 35.9% of Black patients, and 59.9% of Hispanic patients (p<0.001, Table 1). Significant differences in treatment were also observed when comparing white and Black patients (p<0.001) and white and Hispanic patients (p<0.001) directly. Conclusion: Renewed attention to ensuring racial equity in clinical practice prompted an exploration of ED data at our institution, including equitable administration of buprenorphine and methadone in patients with OUD. This QI analysis identified a racial inequity, prompting the development of a QI initiative to improve overall utilization of MOUD, with a specific focus on mitigating observed racial inequities.

Immunosuppressive medication is known to potentially compromise vaccination responses, and expansion of our knowledge on vaccination efficacy in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) is therefore of utmost importance. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre observational study and evaluated the efficacy of approved COVID-19 vaccines in 303 adult AIIRD patients. Serum levels of IgG antibodies against the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (anti-S IgG) were measured at least two weeks after vaccination. In a subgroup of patients without humoral response, T-cell responses were determined using an interferon- gamma release assay. RESULTS: Overall seropositivity rate was 78.5% and was significantly lower in patients under immunosuppressive therapy (75.7 vs 93.2%, P = 0.009). No difference regarding the vaccination type was observed. Glucocorticoids, mycophenolate-mofetil, TNF inhibitors, tocilizumab, abatacept and rituximab were all associated with non-response after proper vaccination. The risk was highest under RTX therapy (OR 0.004, 95% CI 0.001, 0.023, P < 0.0001). A strong negative correlation was observed between time since vaccination with an mRNA vaccine and anti-S antibody levels (r=C0.6149, P < 0.0001). In patients without humoral response, a T-cell response was found in 50%. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination in patients with AIIRD is effective using any approved vaccine. Humoral response might be impaired depending on the individual immunosuppressive medication. The risk of non-response is highest under rituximab therapy. Anti-S IgG antibody levels wane over time after mRNA vaccination.

Existing literature indicates the primary caregiver, typically the mother, is instrumental in vaccine decision-making, but this may vary in contexts. We investigated the role of stakeholders in India who influence caregivers vaccination perceptions, as this is essential to developing strategies to promote vaccine acceptance and improve uptake. METHODS: This research was conducted in 2019 in Mewat District in Haryana, an area in India with extremely low vaccination coverage. We conducted six focus group discussions with 60 participants in the following categories: fathers of children under-5 years old, expectant mothers, mothers-in-law, community health workers, and community influencers such as locally elected officials and religious leaders. RESULTS: Our results highlighted four themes that influence vaccine uptake. First, while caregivers associated vaccination with reductions in specific diseases, they also noted that vaccination services brought broad health gains, including improved nutrition, antenatal guidance, and social support. Second, community health workers critically influenced, positively or negatively, caregivers vaccination perceptions. Third, community health workers faced gaps in their education such as limited training on vaccine side-effects, placing them at a disadvantage when dealing with families. Finally, we found that mothers-in-law, fathers, and religious leaders influence caregivers perceptions of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Communication of broader benefits of vaccines and vaccination services by community health workers could be impactful in increasing vaccine acceptance. Vaccine uptake could potentially be improved by facilitating community health workers ownership over vaccine acceptance and uptake by involving them in the design and implementation of interventions to target mothers and mothers-in-law. A bottom-up approach, leveraging community health workers knowledge to design interventions, and giving a voice to key members of the household and society beyond mothers alone, may sustain health improvement in low vaccine coverage areas.

The purpose of this study was to provide a summary of the clinico-epidemiological data and imaging data of the KICC-19. METHODS: The KSTR members at 17 COVID-19 referral centers retrospectively collected imaging data and clinical information of consecutive patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-proven COVID-19 in respiratory specimens from February 2020 through May 2020 who underwent diagnostic chest computed tomography (CT) or radiograph in each participating hospital. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 239 men and 283 women (mean age, 52.3 years; age range, 11C97 years). Of the 522 subjects, 201 (38.5%) had an underlying disease. The most common symptoms were fever (n = 292) and cough (n = 245). The 151 patients (28.9%) had lymphocytopenia, 86 had (16.5%) thrombocytopenia, and 227 patients (43.5%) had an elevated CRP at admission. The 121 (23.4%) needed nasal oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation (n = 38; 7.3%), and 49 patients (9.4%) were admitted to an intensive care unit. Although most patients had cured, 21 patients (4.0%) died. The 465 (89.1%) subjects underwent a low to standard-dose chest CT scan at least once during hospitalization, resulting in a total of 658 CT scans. The 497 subjects (95.2%) underwent chest radiography at least once during hospitalization, which resulted in a total of 1,475 chest radiographs. CONCLUSION: The KICC-19 was successfully established and comprised of 658 CT scans and 1,475 chest radiographs of 522 hospitalized Korean COVID-19 patients.

However, how and to what extent the daily involvement of trainees in clinical and surgical activities was compromised by the COVID-19 pandemic is currently unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an electronic survey. An invitation was sent through the executive training administration of the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS) randomly to 400 residents and fellows over two weeks period from April 23, 2020 until May 6, 2020. Descriptive statistics were presented using counts and proportions (%). The comparison between the trainees among the socio-demographic and the characteristics of trainees toward the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on their training had been conducted using the Chi-square test. A p-value cut off point of 0.05 at 95% Confidence Interval (CI) used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: Out of the 400 questionnaires distributed, 240 trainees responded, resulting in a response rate of 60%. The most frequently cited specialty was surgical (41.3%) and medical (38.3%). Approximately 43% of them had direct contact with patients with COVID-19, and 43.8% had enough training regarding the proper use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). There were seven responders (2.9%) who had been infected by the disease. Among them, 6 (2.5%) members of their family had also been infected. Approximately 84.6% reported a reduction in training activities due to the current pandemic. Of those with surgical specialties, almost all (97%) reported that their surgical exposure reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The adoption of smart learning is critical. For those who have been affected by examination delays, we recommend continuing to revise steadily using webinars, podcasts, prerecorded sessions, and social media.

Medical cost burden impacts the well-being of patients through reducing income, cutting daily expenses, curtailing leisure activities, and depleting exhausting savings. The COmprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) was created and validated by De Souza and colleagues. Our study intends to measure the financial burdens of cancer therapy and investigate the link between financial toxicity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in an advanced lung cancer population. Methods: Patients aged  18 years with confirmed stage III to IV lung cancer were eligible. The COST questionnaire verified by de Souza et al. was used to identify financial toxicity. Multivariable linear regression analysis with log transformation univariate analysis and Pearson correlations were used to perform the analysis. Results: The majority of the patients (90.8%, n = 138/152) had an annual income of $50,000 ($7,775). The cohort's insurance situation was as follows: 64.5% of the cohort had social insurance, 20.4% had commercial insurance, and 22.0% had both. Patients who were younger age (50-59, P < 0.001), employed but on sick leave, and had lower income reported increased levels of financial toxicity (P < 0.05). The risk factors for high financial toxicity: (i) younger age (50-59), (ii) <1 month of savings, and (iii) being employed but on sick leave. Increased financial toxicity is moderately correlated with a decrease in QoL. Conclusion: Poorer psychological status and specific demographics are linked to increased financial toxicity (lower COST). Financial toxicity has a modest relationship with HRQoL and may have a clear link with HRQoL measurements.","output":"Assessment of Financial Toxicity Among Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer in Western China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering the potential for widespread adoption of social vulnerability indices (SVI) to prioritize COVID-19 vaccinations, there is a need to carefully assess them, particularly for correspondence with outcomes (such as loss of life) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic The University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health Public Health GIS team developed a methodology for assessing and deriving vulnerability indices based on the premise that these indices are, in the final analysis, classifiers Application of this methodology to several Midwestern states with a commonly used SVI indicates that by using only the SVI rankings there is a risk of assigning a high priority to locations with the lowest mortality rates and low priority to locations with the highest mortality rates Based on the findings, we propose using a two-dimensional approach to rationalize the distribution of vaccinations This approach has the potential to account for areas with high vulnerability characteristics as well as to incorporate the areas that were hard hit by the pandemic","output":"A Data Driven Approach for Prioritizing COVID-19 Vaccinations in the Midwestern United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several virulent variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged along with the spread of this virus throughout the population. Some variants can exhibit increased transmissibility and reduced immune neutralization reactivity. These changes are deeply concerning issues that may hinder the ongoing effort of epidemic control measures, especially mass vaccination campaigns. The accurate discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants is essential to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Herein, we report a low-cost, facile, and highly sensitive diagnostic platform that can simultaneously distinguish wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 and its two mutations, namely, D614G and N501Y, within 2 h. WT or mutant (M) nucleic acid fragments at each allelic locus were selectively amplified by the tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR assay. Allele-specific amplicons were simultaneously detected by two test lines on a quantum dot nanobead (QB)-based dual-color fluorescent test strip, which could be interpreted by the naked eye or by a home-made fluorescent strip readout device that was wirelessly connected to a smartphone for quantitative data analysis and result presentation. The WT and M viruses were indicated and were strictly discriminated by the presence of a green or red band on test line 1 for the D614G site and test line 2 for the N501Y site. The limits of detection (LODs) for the WT and M D614G were estimated as 78.91 and 33.53 copies per L, respectively. This assay was also modified for the simultaneous detection of the N and ORF1ab genes of SARS-CoV-2 with LODs of 1.90 and 6.07 copies per L, respectively.

Particularly, the understanding of drivers of social media use by salespeople remains fragmented and scant. Drawing on motivation-opportunity-ability theory, this study develops an integrative framework. The individual's opportunities to use social media, including perceptions about market readiness, peer influence, and organizational support are considered as important antecedents of individuals' motivation (perceived usefulness) and ability (perceived ability to integrate social media in the sales tasks) to use social media in their job. Next to a positive effect of social media use on sales performance also a potential negative impact through distraction is accounted for. The framework and hypotheses are tested using a sample of 345 salespeople. The results largely support the model and hypotheses. Market readiness, peer influence, and organizational support positively affect salesperson motivation, and except for organizational support, the individual's ability to integrate social media in his/her sales job too. Findings further show that motivation and ability together drive social media use in sales, but that a lack of ability shuts down the positive influence of motivation on social media use. Finally, a positive effect of social media use on sales performance is detected, suggesting that social media can be an important tool to enhance sales growth.

Methods The study was performed on buffy-coat samples from EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood samples of 205 healthy shelter cats. From 50 of these cats, fecal samples were also examined. FCoV genomic and subgenomic RNA in the buffy coats was amplified by a total FCoV RNA qRT-PCR. Evidence for FCoV replication in peripheral blood and feces was obtained by M gene mRNA qRT-PCR. Results Nine of 205 cats (4.4%) were viremic by the total FCoV RNA qRT-PCR, and one of these cats had evidence of peripheral FCoV blood replication by an FCoV mRNA qRT-PCR. The single cat with peripheral blood replication had a unique partial M gene sequence distinct from positive controls and previously published FCoV sequences. Neither seven of the nine viremic cats with follow-up nor the single cat with replicating FCoV with positive qRT-PCR results developed signs compatible with FIP within 6 months of sample collection. Conclusions and relevance FCoV viremia and peripheral blood replication in healthy shelter cats have a low prevalence and do not correlate with later development of FIP in this study population, but larger case-control studies evaluating the prognostic accuracy of the qRT-PCR assays are needed.","output":"Cross-sectional quantitative RT-PCR study of feline coronavirus viremia and replication in peripheral blood of healthy shelter cats in Southern California."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Robots hold significant promise to assist with providing care to an aging population and to help overcome increasing caregiver demands.

Cross-sectional analyses at 23C24 h revealed that AVDSf > 0.25 predicts mortality and DMV (p = 0.03 and P = 0.02 respectively); however, it did not predict prolonged hospital LOS. For every 0.1 increase in the AVDSf, the odds of mortality, DMV, and hospital LOS increased by 4.9 [95% CI = 1.45C16.60, p = 0.002], 2.06 [95% CI = 1.14C3.71, p = 0.01], and 1.43[95% CI = 0.84C2.45, p = 0.184], respectively.

The pandemic is causing an explosion in cloud migration, expected that by 2025, 95% of workloads will live in the cloud. One of the challenges of the cloud is data security. It is the responsibility of cloud service providers to protect user data from unauthorized access. Historically, a third-party auditor (TPA) is used to provide security services over the cloud. With the tremendous growth of demand for cloud-based services, regulatory requirements, there is a need for a semi to fully automated self sovereign identity (SSI) implementation to reduce cost. Its critical to manage cloud data strategically and extend the required protection. At each stage of the data migration process, such as data discovery, classification, and cataloguing of the access to the mission-critical data, need to be secured. Cloud storage services are centralized, which requires users must place trust in a TPA. With the SSI, this can become decentralized, reducing the dependency and cost. Our current work involves replacing TPA with SSI. A cryptographic technique for secure data migration to and from the cloud using SSI implemented. SSI facilitate peer-to-peer transactions, meaning that the in-between presence of TPA needs no longer be involved. The C2C migration performance is recorded and found the background or foreground replication scenario is achievable.

The keys generated by the algorithm are validated with an online validator to ensure the correctness of the generated keys.

Prediction models using regression techniques allows for risk stratification to aid periprocedural care. Technological advances have enabled large data to be analyzed using machine learning (ML) algorithms. A national database of colon cancer patients was selected to determine whether ML methods better predict outcomes following surgery compared to conventional methods. METHODS: Surgical colon cancer patients were identified using the 2013 National Cancer Database (NCDB). The negative outcome was defined as a composite of 30-d unplanned readmission and 30- and 90-d mortality. ML models, including Random Forest and XGBoost, were built and compared with conventional logistic regression. For the accounting of unbalanced outcomes, a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was implemented and applied using XGBoost. RESULTS: Analysis included 528,060 patients. The negative outcome occurred in 11.6% of patients. Model building utilized 30 variables. The primary metric for model comparison was area under the curve (AUC). In comparison to logistic regression (AUC 0.730, 95% CI: 0.725-0.735), AUC's for ML algorithms ranged between 0.748 and 0.757, with the Random Forest model (AUC 0.757, 95% CI: 0.752-0.762) outperforming XGBoost (AUC 0.756, 95% CI: 0.751-0.761) and XGBoost using SMOTE data (AUC 0.748, 95% CI: 0.743-0.753).

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the coarse-to-fine strategy have been widely used in this field. However, multi-lesion segmentation remains to be challenging due to the uncertainty in size, contrast, and high interclass similarity of tissues. In addition, the commonly adopted cascaded strategy is rather demanding in terms of hardware, which limits the potential of clinical deployment. To address the problems above,we propose a novel Prior Attention Network (PANet) that follows the coarse-to-fine strategy to perform multi-lesion segmentation in medical images. The proposed network achieves the two steps of segmentation in a single network by inserting lesion-related spatial attention mechanism in the network. Further, we also propose the intermediate supervision strategy for generating lesion-related attention to acquire the regions of interest (ROIs), which accelerates the convergence and obviously improves the segmentation performance. We have investigated the proposed segmentation framework in two applications: 2D segmentation of multiple lung infections in lung CT slices and 3D segmentation of multiple lesions in brain MRIs. Experimental results show that in both 2D and 3D segmentation tasks our proposed network achieves better performance with less computational cost compared with cascaded networks. The proposed network can be regarded as a universal solution to multi-lesion segmentation in both 2D and 3D tasks.

This aim of the qualitative component of the study was to explore stakeholders understandings of adaptation, as to date there has limited consideration of how different concepts and meanings shape decision-making and practice. METHODS: A case study research design was used. Participants/cases were purposefully sampled based on study outcome, study design, expertise, context and country. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of researchers (n = 23); representatives from research funding panels (n = 6); journal editors (n = 5) and practitioners (n = 3). Data were analysed using the Framework approach. Overarching themes were discussed with the ADAPT study team, with further iterative refinement of subthemes. RESULTS: The results generated four central themes. Four themes related to stakeholders understanding: 1) definitions of adaptation and related concepts; 2) rationales for undertaking adaptation; 3) the appropriate timing for adaptation; and 4) ensuring fidelity when implementing adapted interventions. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the lack of clarity around key concepts and uncertainty about central decision-making processes, notably why interventions should be adapted, when and to what extent.

To clarify the mechanism behind these cell localization differences, we overexpressed W protein derived from four different NDV strains or W protein associated with different cellular regions in Vero cells. This revealed that the key region for determining W protein localization is 180-227aa. Further experiments found that there is a nuclear export signal (NES) motif in W protein 211-224aa. W protein could be transported into the nucleus via interaction with KPNA1, KPNA2, and KPNA6 in a nuclear localization signal-dependent manner, and W protein containing an NES was transported back to the cytoplasm in a CRM1-independent manner. Interestingly, we observed that the cytoplasm-localized W protein colocalizes with mitochondria. We rescued the NES-deletion W protein NDV strain rSG10-WC/WNES using an NDV reverse genetics system and found that the replication ability, virulence, and pathogenicity of an NDV strain were all higher when the W protein cellular localization was in the nucleus rather than the mitochondria. Further experiments revealed that W protein nuclear localization reduced the expression of IFN- otherwise stimulated by NDV. Our research reveals the mechanism by which NDV W protein becomes localized to different parts of the cell and demonstrates the outcomes of nuclear or cytoplasmic localization both in vitro and in vivo, laying a foundation for subsequent functional studies of the W protein in NDV and other paramyxoviruses.IMPORTANCE In Newcastle disease virus (NDV), the W protein, like the V protein, is a nonstructural protein encoded by the P gene via RNA editing. Compared with V protein, W protein has a common N-terminal domain but a unique C-terminal domain. V protein is known as a key virulence factor and an important interferon antagonist across the family Paramyxoviridae In contrast, very little is known about the function of NDV W protein, and this limited information is based on studies of the Nipah virus W protein. Here, we investigated the localization mechanism of NDV W protein and its subcellular distribution in mitochondria. We found that W protein localization differences impact IFN- production, consequently affecting NDV virulence, replication, and pathogenicity. This work provides new insights on the differential localization mechanism of NDV W proteins, along with fundamental knowledge for understanding the functions of W proteins in NDV and other paramyxoviruses.","output":"Mechanisms and consequences of Newcastle disease virus W protein subcellular localization in the nucleus or mitochondria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Temporary expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) during the COVID-19 pandemic provided additional monthly income for US families, with no restrictions on use, from July through December 2021.

Despite demonstrating a beneficial role in the control and prevention of COVID-19, there are crucial concerns regarding the large-scale use of disinfectants and sanitizers, including the side effects on human and animal health along with harmful impacts exerted on the environment and ecological balance. This article discusses the roles of disinfectants and sanitizers in the control and prevention of the current pandemic and highlights updated disinfection techniques against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This article provides evidence of the deleterious effects of disinfectants and sanitizers exerted on humans, animals, and the environment as well as suggests mitigation strategies to reduce these effects. Additionally, potential technologies and approaches for the reduction of these effects and the development of safe, affordable, and effective disinfectants are discussed, particularly, eco-friendly technologies using nanotechnology and nanomedicine.","output":"The role of disinfectants and sanitizers during COVID-19 pandemic: advantages and deleterious effects on humans and the environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Widely acknowledged is the disproportionate number of COVID-19 cases among nursing home residents. This observational study examined the relationship between accreditation status and COVID-19 case rates in states where the numbers and proportions of Joint Commission accredited facilities made such comparisons possible (Illinois (IL), Florida (FL), and Massachusetts (MA)). COVID-19 data were accessed from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Nursing Home Compare Public Use File, which included retrospective COVID-19 data submitted by nursing homes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network. The outcome variable was the total number of nursing home-identified COVID-19 cases from June 2020 to January 2021. Joint Commission accreditation status was the independent variable. Mediating factors included state, and county-level case rates. Increases in the county rate had a significant association with higher nursing home COVID-19 case rates (p < .001). After adjusting for county case rates, no differences were observed in the mean group case rates for accredited and nonaccredited nursing homes. However, comparing predicted case rates to actual case rates revealed that accredited nursing homes were more closely aligned with their predicted rates. Performance of the nonaccredited nursing homes was more variable and had proportionally more outliers compared to accredited nursing homes. Community prevalence of COVID-19 is the strongest predictor of nursing home cases. While accreditation status did not have an impact on overall mean group performance, nonaccredited nursing homes had greater variation in performance and a higher proportion of negative outliers. Accreditation was associated with more consistent performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite being located in counties with a higher prevalence of COVID-19.","output":"A Multistate Comparison Study of COVID-19 Cases Among Accredited and Nonaccredited Nursing Homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Surgical education has constantly evolved and has been recently severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While virtual reality (VR) has been utilized for resident training and neuroanatomy education, application of VR has been limited for neurosurgical education in medical school. This is the first report of a comprehensive, multicomponent teaching model with VR as a primary component to neurosurgical and neuroanatomy education for pre-clerkship medical students. DESIGN Twelve second-year medical students were included in this prospective survey study that was conducted to evaluate a year-long neurosurgery elective course with an interactive VR platform as a primary teaching tool for neuroanatomy and neurosurgical procedures. The course had 4 components: (1) didactic/lecture-based learning, (2) problem-based learning, (3) hands-on skills lab, and (4) VR-based learning through Surgical Theater's Precision VR visualization platform. Outcome measures were based on confidence levels measured on pre- and post-course competency confidence surveys in students' ability to identify neuroanatomical structures, interpret neuroradiological imaging, and analyze neurosurgical cases, and student feedback on their experience with VR on a postcourse survey. SETTING The survey study was conducted in the neurosurgery library and conference room at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. PARTICIPANTS All 12 second-year medical students who enrolled in the neurosurgery zero-credit hour course completed the course. RESULTS At course conclusion, 100% of students reported significantly higher competency confidence levels on all topics, and 100% agreed utilizing VR helped them gain a deeper understanding of neuroanatomy/neurosurgery. 92% agreed that using VR helped them better retain the anatomical/functional details of the brain/spine, and 69% better understand neurosurgical skills taught, respectively. 100% of students found the course to be a valuable learning experience and VR a useful learning tool.

We developed a triage strategy including noninvasive respiratory support and admission to the intermediate care unit (IMCU). ICU admission was restricted to patients requiring invasive ventilation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to the IMCU. METHOD: Retrospective cohort including consecutive patients admitted between March 28 and April 27, 2020. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure avoiding ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included the rate of emergency intubation, 28-day mortality, and predictors of ICU admission. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-seven patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia were admitted to the IMCU. Among the 85 patients admitted for worsening respiratory failure, 52/85 (61%) avoided ICU admission. In multivariate analysis, PaO2/FiO2 (OR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96C0.99) and BMI (OR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78C0.98) were significantly associated with ICU admission. No death or emergency intubation occurred in the IMCU. CONCLUSIONS: IMCU admission including standardized triage criteria, self-proning, and noninvasive respiratory support prevents ICU admission for a large proportion of patients with COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, IMCUs may play an important role in preserving ICU capacity by avoiding ICU admission for patients with worsening respiratory failure and allowing early discharge of ICU patients.","output":"Role of Intermediate Care Unit Admission and Noninvasive Respiratory Support during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the planned COVID-19 vaccine, vaccine hesitation is a great challenge, particularly for healthcare professionals.

The questionnaire consisted of demographic characteristics (age, gender, profession, sector, medical history, and general health), COVID-19 related knowledge, and personal history of influenza vaccination. The intention to get the vaccine once it is available was directly asked, and attitudes towards the diseases and the vaccine were studied using a four-point Likert scale statement based on the health belief model's constructs. The study included 1159 HCWs; 62.9% were females, and 52.5% were between the ages of 30-49 years. The intention to get vaccinated was only 37.8% [95%CI: 35.0%-40.6%], while 31.5% were undecided, and 30.7% planned to refuse it.

The transition from the 1st to the 2nd response phase allows identification of adequate unloading of the respiratory muscles with NAVA (NAVA(AL)). We aimed to develop and validate a mathematical algorithm to identify NAVA(AL). P(aw), Vt, and EAdi were recorded while systematically increasing the NAVA level in 19 adult patients. In a multistep approach, inspiratory P(aw) peaks were first identified by dividing the EAdi into inspiratory portions using Gaussian mixture modeling. Two polynomials were then fitted onto the curves of both P(aw) peaks and Vt. The beginning of the P(aw) and Vt plateaus, and thus NAVA (AL), was identified at the minimum of squared polynomial derivative and polynomial fitting errors.

Studies showed that PDCoV uses porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) as an entry receptor, but the infection of pAPN-knockout cells or pigs with PDCoV revealed that pAPN might be not a critical functional receptor, implying there exists an unidentified receptor involved in PDCoV infection. Herein, we report that sialic acid (SA) can act as an attachment receptor for PDCoV invasion and facilitate its infection. We first demonstrated that the carbohydrates destroyed on the cell membrane using NaIO(4) can alleviate the susceptibility of cells to PDCoV. Further study showed that the removal of SA, a typical cell-surface carbohydrate, could influence the PDCoV infectivity to the cells significantly, suggesting that SA was involved in the infection. The results of plaque assay and Western blotting revealed that SA promoted PDCoV infection by increasing the number of viruses binding to SA on the cell surface during the adsorption phase, which was also confirmed by atomic force microscopy at the microscopic level. In in vivo experiments, we found that the distribution levels of PDCoV and SA were closely relevant in the swine intestine, which contains huge amount of trypsin. We further confirmed that SA-binding capacity to PDCoV is related to the pre-treatment of PDCoV with trypsin. In conclusion, SA is a novel attachment receptor for PDCoV infection to enhance its attachment to cells, which is dependent on the pre-treatment of trypsin on PDCoV.

Using a native mass spectrometry-based approach to screen a natural product library for Nsp9 binders, we identified an ent-kaurane natural product, oridonin, capable of binding to purified SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 with micromolar affinities. By determining the crystal structure of the Nsp9-oridonin complex, we showed that oridonin binds through a conserved site near Nsp9s C-terminal GxxxG-helix. In enzymatic assays oridonins binding to Nsp9 reduces its potential to act as substrate for Nsp12s Nidovirus RdRp-Associated Nucleotidyl transferase (NiRAN) domain.

Little did we know that soon after Europe and the rest of the world (with Asia already earlier) would be in lock-down due to COVID-19. It has been a strange year. And now, at the start of 2021, the excitement of having a vaccine is tempered by the fact that everywhere mutants of the virus pop up. Although this was likely to occur, as also the influenza virus keeps mutating, it means that at the moment it is unclear as to whether the current situation of lock-downs and social distancing will remain for a longer period than we had anticipated and hoped for at the end of 2020 when it became clear that several vaccines were efficacious. Some studies have shown a role of the gut microbiota composition in disease severity, together with vitamin D, cholesterol and other factors. It was a hype to write a 'review' on gut microbiota and the effect on COVID-19, and also the board of Beneficial Microbes has received several submissions of so-called reviews on the topic. However, all of them were rejected, as they were mere speculations about how the gut microbiota might affect virus infection and disease severity, without any data whatsoever. However, there are some good studies out there that have shown that a proper gut microbiota may indeed influence disease severity, such as recently reviewed by Kim (2021).

Sperm was transfected with a Cy3-labelled DNA using tip type electroporation with voltages ranging from 500 to 1500 V. Sperm kinetics parameters were assessed using Computer Assisted Semen Analysis (CASA) and cell integrity, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial functionality and transfection rate were evaluated by flow cytometry. The transfection rates were positively affected by tip type electroporation, reaching 64.9%  3.6 in the lowest voltage used (500 V) and 86.6%  1.9 in the highest (1500 V). The percentage of overall motile sperm in the electrotransfected samples was found to decrease with increasing field strength (P < 0.05). Increase in the sperm damaged plasma membrane was observed with increasing field strength (P < 0.05).

In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous GCN-based method for dynamic rumor detection (HDGCN), mainly composed of a joint content and propagation module and an ODE-based dynamic module. The joint content and propagation module constructs a content-propagation heterogeneous graph to obtain rumor representations by mining and discovering the interaction between post content and propagation structures in the rumor propagation process. The ODE-based dynamic module leverages a GCN integrated with an ordinary differential system to explore dynamic features of heterogeneous graphs. To evaluate the performance of our proposed HDGCN model, we have conducted extensive experiments on two real-world datasets from Twitter.

We describe the control measures used and their relationship with imported and domestically-acquired case numbers. Methods: Data on the first 270 SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and the timing and nature of control measures were captured by Vietnam's National Steering Committee for COVID-19 response. Apple and Google mobility data provided population movement proxies. Serial intervals were calculated from 33 infector-infectee pairs and used to estimate the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission events and time-varying reproduction numbers. Results: After the first confirmed case on January 23rd, the Vietnamese Government initiated mass communications measures, contact tracing, mandatory 14-day quarantine, school and university closures, and progressive flight restrictions. A national lockdown was implemented between April 1st and 22nd. Around 200,000 people were quarantined and 266,122 RT-PCR tests conducted. Population mobility decreased progressively before lockdown. 60% (163/270) of cases were imported; 43% (89/208) of resolved infections were asymptomatic. 21 developed severe disease, with no deaths. The serial interval was 3.24 days, and 27.5% (95% confidence interval, 15.7%-40.0%) of transmissions occurred pre-symptomatically. Limited transmission amounted to a maximum reproduction number of 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.37-2.36). No community transmission has been detected since April 15th. Conclusions: Vietnam has controlled SARS-CoV-2 spread through the early introduction of communication, contact-tracing, quarantine, and international travel restrictions.

While pharmacological management is common, its effectiveness remains equivocal. This systematic review investigated the effectiveness of physiotherapy management in adults with PPSP in comparison to usual care. METHODS A systematic search of six electronic databases was conducted. Studies of human adults (>18 years) with PPSP localised or directly referred from the surgical site, pain persisting for at least two months post-surgery and with physiotherapy as the intervention were included. This review was conducted and reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The McMaster critical review form for quantitative studies was utilised to assess the methodological quality. A descriptive synthesis was undertaken due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. RESULTS Of the 1395 articles that were screened, eight studies met the inclusion criteria. A diverse range of physiotherapy interventions were utilised, and effectiveness was measured through diverse outcomes and measures. Summarised findings from the heterogenous evidence base indicated that physiotherapy interventions for PPSP has a positive impact across a range of outcomes, including pain, quality of life (QoL), physical function and depression. While these are encouraging findings, the current evidence base lacks uniformity with regards to participant characteristics, time periods since diagnosis, interventions delivered, and its parameters, and outcomes measured. CONCLUSION Due to ongoing challenges in the management of PPSP, alternate treatment strategies such as physiotherapy are being trialled.

To our knowledge, the utility of cap-assisted ERCP with a forward-viewing gastroscope when other techniques fail has not been reported. We describe and demonstrate a novel rescue approach using a cap-fitted, forward-viewing gastroscope in patients with Billroth II anatomy, when attempts with duodenoscopes, pediatric colonoscopes, and gastroscopes previously failed. METHODS Retrospective case series. Inclusion criteria were: (a) documented Billroth II anatomy; and (b) use of cap-assisted ERCP as a rescue intervention on the first endoscopic encounter after failed attempts to perform ERCP with a duodenoscope. Patients were excluded if they successfully underwent ERCP with a duodenoscope. One advanced endoscopist and one advanced endoscopy fellow performed all but one of the procedures.

Apart from the respiratory manifestations, CoVs are also responsible for infections of the gastrointestinal tract and nervous systems. Their propensity to recombine allows them to easily transmit and adapt to new hosts. The emergence of a new CoV in humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is attributed to a zoonotic origin, has provoked numerous studies to assess its pathogenicity for different animal species (pets, farm and wild animals). Available results indicate that numerous animal species are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. From April 2020, when the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in minks was reported in the Netherlands, to the end of January 2021, further outbreaks have been confirmed in Denmark, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United States, Greece, France, Canada, Lithuania and Poland. It has also been established that human-to-minks and minks-to-human transmission may occur. The results obtained to date indicate that the virus was originally introduced into the minks population by humans, possibly at the start of the pandemic and had been circulating in the population for several weeks before detection. Recent data indicate that minks are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the route or routes of virus transmission between farms, other than by direct contact with infected humans, have not been identified. In minks, infection can occur in clinical and subclinical form, making it possibly difficult to detect.

However, few studies have evaluated factors that lead to increased detection of deposition or the individual differences among patients. OBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of repeated dosages of gadopentetate dimeglumine on pediatric brains and to determine the factors that influence signal intensity changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study evaluated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients <18 years of age who received >5 doses of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Regions of interest were placed in 30 locations in the brain on axial precontrast T1 images. Signal intensity ratios were evaluated throughout the brain. The effect of increasing gadopentetate dimeglumine exposure on signal intensity ratios was assessed using linear mixed models adjusted for gender, age, imaging sequence type (fast spin echo or gradient echo), MRI manufacturer (General Electric, Philips or Siemens), and field strength (1.5 tesla [T] or 3 T). Finally, the variance of the random slope in the linear mixed models was tested to determine if there were differences in the rate of signal intensity ratio change among individuals. RESULTS: Fifty patients (M:F=25:25; mean age at first imaging: 6.4 years) with a mean of 21.5 gadopentetate dimeglumine administrations (range: 6-86) were included. There were significant increases in T1 signal in the globus pallidus, dentate nucleus and pulvinar with an increasing number of contrast administrations. Patient gender, age, and MRI field strength were not associated with changing signal intensity ratios. However, MRI sequence type and vendor significantly impacted some measured signal intensity ratios. Finally, significant differences in the slopes of the ratios were present among patients for multiple locations. CONCLUSION: Repeated administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine is associated with T1 hyperintense signal in the dentate nucleus, globus pallidus and pulvinar. Detection is significantly affected by MRI sequence type and scanner vendor. Even when accounting for these differences, there are individual differences in the slope of signal intensity change suggesting a patient-level effect influences gadolinium deposition.","output":"A retrospective cohort evaluation of the effect of multiple administrations of gadopentetate dimeglumine on brain magnetic resonance imaging T1-weighted signal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Faire de l'Angleterre un nouveau et prospere ?

However, data on influenza vaccination in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) is scarce. In this study, our goals were to (i) measure vaccination coverage rates (VCR) for influenza in a large cohort of children, adolescents and adults with CHD, (ii) identity patient characteristics as predictors for vaccination, and (iii) investigate the impact of influenza vaccination on hospitalization. METHODS: A nationwide cohort study in Belgium included 16,778 patients, representing 134,782 vaccination years, from the BELgian COngenital heart disease Database combining Administrative and Clinical data (BELCODAC). Data over 9 vaccination years (2006-2015) were used, and patients were stratified into five age cohorts: 6 months-4 years; 5-17 years; 18-49 years; 50-64 years; and &#8805;65 years. RESULTS: In the respective age cohorts, the VCR was estimated to be 6.6%, 8.0%, 23.9%, 46.6%, and 72.8%. There was a steep increase in VCR as of the age of 40 years. Multivariable logistic regression showed that higher anatomical complexity of CHD, older age, presence of genetic syndromes, and prior cardiac interventions were associated with significantly higher VCRs. Among adults, men had lower and pregnant women had higher VCRs. The association between influenza vaccination and all-cause hospitalization was not significant in this study. CONCLUSION: The influenza VCR in people with CHD is low, especially in children and adolescents. Older patients, particularly those with complex CHD, are well covered.

The recent pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has generated even greater extents of morbidity and mortality across the entire world. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spreads through the air in the form of droplets and potentially smaller droplets (aerosols) via exhaling, coughing, and sneezing. Direct detection from such airborne droplets would be ideal for protecting general public from potential exposure before they infect individuals. However, the number of viruses in such droplets and aerosols is too low to be detected directly. A separate air sampler and enough collection time (several hours) are necessary to capture a sufficient number of viruses. In this work, we have demonstrated the direct capture of the airborne droplets on the paper microfluidic chip without the need for any other equipment. 10% human saliva samples were spiked with the known concentration of SARS-CoV-2 and sprayed to generate liquid droplets and aerosols into the air. Antibody-conjugated submicron particle suspension is then added to the paper channel, and a smartphone-based fluorescence microscope isolated and counted the immunoagglutinated particles on the paper chip. The total capture-to-assay time was <30 min, compared to several hours with the other methods. In this manner, SARS-CoV-2 could be detected directly from the air in a handheld and low-cost manner, contributing to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We can presumably adapt this technology to a wide range of other respiratory viruses.","output":"Direct capture and smartphone quantification of airborne SARS-CoV-2 on a paper microfluidic chip"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Pregnant women suffer from varying levels of pregnancy-related anxiety (PRA) which can negatively affect pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess PRA and its associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This web-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 2020 on 318 pregnant women purposively recruited from primary healthcare centers in Sari and Amol, Iran. Data were collected using questionnaires (PRAQ, Edinburg, KAP of COVID-19, CDA-Q and Demographic questionnaire), which were provided to participants through the social media or were completed for them over telephone. Data were analyzed with the linear regression and the logistic regression analysis, at the significance level of 0.05 using the SPSS software (v. 21). RESULTS: Around 21% of participants had PRA, 42.1% had depression, and 4.4% had COVID-19 anxiety. The significant predictors of PRA were number of pregnancies (P = 0.008), practice regarding COVID-19 (P < 0.001), COVID-19 anxiety (P < 0.001), depression (P < 0.001), and social support (P = 0.025) which explained 19% of the total variance. Depression and COVID-19 anxiety increased the odds of PRA by respectively four times and 13%, while good practice regarding COVID-19 decreased the odds by 62%. CONCLUSION: Around 21% of pregnant women suffer from PRA during the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant predictors of PRA during the pandemic include number of pregnancies, practice regarding COVID-19, COVID-19 anxiety, depression, and social support.

Jerusalem with its 919,400 inhabitants has a wide variety of populations, of which 62% are Jews (36% ultra-orthodox;64% non-ultraorthodox) and 38% Arabs which were largely affected by the pandemic. Objectives: The aim of our study was to understand the different presentations, course and clinical outcomes in these different ethnical and cultural groups in Jerusalem in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We performed a cohort study of all COVID-19 patients admitted between March 9 - July 16, 2020 to the two university medical centers in Jerusalem. Demographic data, presenting symptoms, comorbid conditions, medications, physical examination, laboratory and imaging data as well as outcome at 30-day were systematically recorded. Patients were divided according to their religion and ethnicity into 3 main groups: 1) Ultra- Orthodox Jews;2) other (non-Ultra-Orthodox) Jews and 3) Arabs. Results: Six hundred and two patients comprised the study population. Of them the 361 (60%) were Ultra-Orthodox Jews;166 (27.5%) non-Ultra- Orthodox Jews and 75 (12.5%) Arabs. The Arab patients were younger than the Ultra-Orthodox Jews and the non-Ultra-Orthodox Jews (5118 year-old vs. 5721 and 5919, respectively, p<0.01), but suffered from significantly more co-morbidities. Fever, cough, dyspnea and fatigue, were more prominent, as presenting symptoms, in the Jewish patients as compared with the Arab patients. Moreover, hemodynamic shock, ischemic ECG changes and pathological chest x-ray were all more frequent in the Ultra-Orthodox patients as compared the other groups of patients. Being an Ultra-Orthodox was independently associated with significantly higher rate of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) [OR=1.96;95% CI (1.03-3.71), p<0.05]. Age was the only independent risk factor associated with increased mortality rate [OR=1.10;95% CI (1.07-1.13), p<0.001]. Conclusions: The COVID-19 first phase in Jerusalem, affected different ethnical and cultural groups differently, with the Ultra-Orthodox Jews mostly affected by admission rates, presenting symptoms clinical course and MACE (Acute coronary syndrome, shock, cerebrovascular event or venous thromboembolism). It is conceivable that vulnerable populations need special attention and health planning in time of pandemic, to prevent rapid distribution and severe morbidity.","output":"Cardiac and other presentation and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pandemic among different ethnic and religious populations in the city of Jerusalem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world continues in the grip of COVID-19 with devastated tourism industries and global economies. In a previous paper, it was noted that a countrys failure to dampen a first wave of infection or the recurrence of a second wave would serve as disincentives for greatly needed tourists in summer 2020 and would further significantly reduce tourism revenues and potentially accelerate job losses and bankruptcies in affected countries. Countries in the first wave of infection would need to restrain COVID-19 spread swiftly in order to benefit from summer 2020 tourism. Countries that had controlled COVID-19 and who experienced second waves would manifest the same negative effects. In the case of Malta, up to the beginning of July, the country had the lowest COVID-19 numbers in Europe but this ended abruptly when two mass events took place. In a fortnight, the steep escalation of cases led to a downgrade of the countrys status to a high-risk destination, with a host of European countries enacting quarantine measures. The Maltese government re-imposed restrictions and COVID-19 numbers slowly started to temporarily decline. As an economy, Malta is highly dependent on the tourism industry, with approximately 17% of GDP reliant on this sector, directly and indirectly.

Mood disorders are associated with impaired immune function and social determinants that increase the risk of COVID-19. Determining whether preexisting mood disorders represent a risk of COVID-19 would inform public health priorities. Objective: To assess whether preexisting mood disorders are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 susceptibility, hospitalization, severe complications, and death. Data Sources: Systematic searches were conducted for studies reporting data on COVID-19 outcomes in populations with and without mood disorders on PubMed/MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Embase, Web of Science, Google/Google Scholar, LitCovid, and select reference lists. The search timeline was from database inception to February 1, 2021. Study Selection: Primary research articles that reported quantitative COVID-19 outcome data in persons with mood disorders vs persons without mood disorders of any age, sex, and nationality were selected. Of 1950 articles identified through this search strategy, 21 studies were included in the analysis. Data Extraction and Synthesis: The modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess methodological quality and risk of bias of component studies. Reported adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were pooled with unadjusted ORs calculated from summary data to generate 4 random-effects summary ORs, each corresponding to a primary outcome. Main Outcomes and Measures: The 4 a priori primary outcomes were COVID-19 susceptibility, COVID-19 hospitalization, COVID-19 severe events, and COVID-19 death. The hypothesis was formulated before study search. Outcome measures between individuals with and without mood disorders were compared. Results: This review included 21 studies that involved more than 91 million individuals. Significantly higher odds of COVID-19 hospitalization (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.53; P = .001; n = 26a?554a?397) and death (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.34-1.69; P < .001; n = 25a?808a?660) were found in persons with preexisting mood disorders compared with those without mood disorders. There was no association between mood disorders and COVID-19 susceptibility (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.73-2.19; n = 65a?514a?469) or severe events (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87-1.03; n = 83a?240). Visual inspection of the composite funnel plot for asymmetry indicated the presence of publication bias; however, the Egger regression intercept test result was not statistically significant. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis examining the association between preexisting mood disorders and COVID-19 outcomes suggest that individuals with preexisting mood disorders are at higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death and should be categorized as an at-risk group on the basis of a preexisting condition.","output":"Association Between Mood Disorders and Risk of COVID-19 Infection, Hospitalization, and Death: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human breath contains hundreds of volatile molecules that can provide powerful, non-intrusive spectral diagnosis of a diverse set of diseases and physiological/metabolic states. To unleash this tremendous potential for medical science, we present a robust analytical method that simultaneously measures tens of thousands of spectral features in each breath sample, followed by efficient and detail-specific multivariate data analysis for unambiguous binary medical response classification. We combine mid-infrared cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy (CE-DFCS), capable of real-time collection of tens of thousands of distinct molecular features at parts-per-trillion sensitivity, with supervised machine learning, capable of analysis and verification of extremely high-dimensional input data channels. Here, we present the first application of this method to the breath detection of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Using 170 individual samples at the University of Colorado, we report a cross-validated area under the Receiver-Operating-Characteristics curve of 0.849(4), providing excellent prediction performance. Further, this method detected a significant difference between male and female breath as well as other variables such as smoking and abdominal pain. Together, these highlight the utility of CE-DFCS for rapid, non-invasive detection of diverse biological conditions and disease states. The unique properties of frequency comb spectroscopy thus help establish precise digital spectral fingerprints for building accurate databases and provide means for simultaneous multi-response classifications. The predictive power can be further enhanced with readily scalable comb spectral coverage.","output":"Frequency comb and machine learning-based breath analysis for COVID-19 classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this research is to examine the impact of service quality on customer satisfaction in the post pandemic world in auto care industry.

Many warned that this risked damaging public confidence during a critical period of pandemic response. This study investigated whether the pause in the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine had an impact on subsequent vaccine uptake in European countries. Methods We used a difference-in-differences approach capitalizing on the fact that some countries halted their rollouts whilst others did not. A longitudinal panel was constructed for European Economic Area countries spanning 15 weeks in early 2021. Media reports were used to identify countries that paused the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the timing of this. Data on vaccine uptake were available through the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker. Difference-in-differences linear regression models controlled for key confounders that could influence vaccine uptake, and country and week fixed effects. Further models and robustness checks were performed. Results The panel included 28 countries, with 19 in the intervention group and 9 in the control group. Pausing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was associated with a 0.52% decrease in uptake for the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and a 1.49% decrease in the uptake for both doses, comparing countries that paused to those that did not. These estimates are not statistically significant (p=0.86 and 0.39 respectively). For the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine only, the pause was associated with a 0.56% increase in uptake for the first dose and a 0.07% decrease in uptake for both doses. These estimates are also not statistically significant (p= 0.56 and 0.51 respectively). All our findings are robust to sensitivity analyses.

We systematically reviewed the process and outcome of evaluating CKD-EPICr in estimating point GFR or GFR decline over time in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. METHODS In this systematic review, MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up to August 2019. Observational studies comparing CKD-EPICr with measured GFR (mGFR) in adults with diabetes were included. Studies on people with kidney transplant, non-diabetes related kidney disease, pregnancy, potential kidney donors, and those with critical or other systematic illnesses were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted data from published papers and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Risk-of-bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018108776) RESULTS: From the 2820 records identified, 29 studies (14 704 participants) were included. All studies were at risk of bias. Bias (eight different forms) ranged from -26 to 35 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 ; precision (five different forms) ranged between 9 and 63 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 ; accuracy (five different forms) ranged between 16% and 96%; the correlation coefficient between CKD-EPICr and mGFR (four different forms) ranged between 0.38 and 0.86; and the reduced major axis regression slope ranged between 0.8 and 1.8. CONCLUSIONS Qualitative synthesis of data suggested CKD-EPICr was inaccurate in estimating point GFR or GFR decline over time.

The presence of infection is identified using ground glass opacity in these images. Sometimes, there are very few changes that cannot be identified with the naked eye. Deep learning algorithms can be used to classify such images. Many deep learning algorithms have performed exceptionally well in classifying images. In this paper, we evaluated VGG16 and Xception models and found that the Xception model has a large number of non-trainable parameters. VGG16 model uses a normal convolution and Xception uses a depth wise separable convolution with Batch Normalization. Our results show that VGG16 performs better in classifying CoViD CT Images than the Xception model. We conclude that due to the Batch Normalization Xception model has non-trainable parameters and shows low performance when lesser images are used to train the model. However, VGG16 was found to perform very well even on images with subtle opacity. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Parameter based Performance Evaluation of Deep Learning Models for Classification of CoViD and Pneumonia CT Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic has resulted in the worst global pandemic of our generation, affecting 215 countries with nearly 5.5 million cases. The association between COVID\\\\19 and the cardiovascular system has been well described. We sought to systematically review the current published literature on the different cardiac manifestations and the use of cardiac\\\\specific biomarkers in terms of their prognostic value in determining clinical outcomes and correlation to disease severity. METHODS: A systematic literature review across PubMed, Cochrane database, Embase, Google Scholar, and Ovid was performed according to PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant articles that discussed risk factors for cardiovascular manifestations, cardiac manifestations in COVID\\\\19 patients, and cardiac\\\\specific biomarkers with their clinical implications on COVID\\\\19. RESULTS: Sixty\\\\one relevant articles were identified which described risk factors for cardiovascular manifestations, cardiac manifestations (including heart failure, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmia, and myocarditis among others) and cardiac\\\\specific biomarkers (including CK\\\\MB, CK, myoglobin, troponin, and NT\\\\proBNP). Cardiovascular risk factors can play a crucial role in identifying patients vulnerable to developing cardiovascular manifestations of COVID\\\\19 and thus help to save lives. A wide array of cardiac manifestations is associated with the interaction between COVID\\\\19 and the cardiovascular system. Cardiac\\\\specific biomarkers provide a useful prognostic tool in helping identify patients with the severe disease early and allowing for escalation of treatment in a timely fashion.

Ambitious tree-planting initiatives, many already underway, aim to sequester enormous quantities of carbon to partly compensate for anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which are a major cause of rising global temperatures. However, tree planting that is poorly planned and executed could actually increase CO2 emissions and have long-term, deleterious impacts on biodiversity, landscapes and livelihoods. Here, we highlight the main environmental risks of large-scale tree planting and propose 10 golden rules, based on some of the most recent ecological research, to implement forest ecosystem restoration that maximizes rates of both carbon sequestration and biodiversity recovery while improving livelihoods. These are as follows: (1) Protect existing forest first; (2) Work together (involving all stakeholders); (3) Aim to maximize biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals; (4) Select appropriate areas for restoration; (5) Use natural regeneration wherever possible; (6) Select species to maximize biodiversity; (7) Use resilient plant material (with appropriate genetic variability and provenance); (8) Plan ahead for infrastructure, capacity and seed supply; (9) Learn by doing (using an adaptive management approach); and (10) Make it pay (ensuring the economic sustainability of the project). We focus on the design of long-term strategies to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises and support livelihood needs. We emphasize the role of local communities as sources of indigenous knowledge, and the benefits they could derive from successful reforestation that restores ecosystem functioning and delivers a diverse range of forest products and services. While there is no simple and universal recipe for forest restoration, it is crucial to build upon the currently growing public and private interest in this topic, to ensure interventions provide effective, long-term carbon sinks and maximize benefits for biodiversity and people.","output":"Ten golden rules for reforestation to optimize carbon sequestration, biodiversity recovery and livelihood benefits."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internet and smartphone addiction have become important social issues. Various studies have demonstrated their association with clinical and psychological factors, including depression, anxiety, aggression, anger expression, and behavioral inhibition, and behavioral activation systems. However, these two addictions are also highly correlated with each other, so the consideration of the relationship between internet and smartphone addiction can enhance the analysis. In this study, we considered the copula regression model to regress the bivariate addictions on clinical and psychological factors. Real data analysis with 555 students (age range: 14-15 years; males, N = 295; females, N = 265) from South Korean public middle schools is illustrated. By fitting the copula regression model, we investigated the dependency between internet and smartphone addiction and determined the risk factors associated with the two addictions. Furthermore, by comparing the model fits of the copula model with linear regression and generalized linear models, the best copula model was proposed in terms of goodness of fit. Our findings revealed that internet and smartphone addiction are not separate problems, and that associations between them should be considered. Psychological factors, such as anxiety, the behavioral inhibition system, and aggression were also significantly associated with both addictions, while ADHD symptoms were related to internet addiction only.

When a new epidemic or pandemic emerges, people are faced with the challenge of sorting through a great volume of varied information. Therefore, the dissemination of high-quality web-based information is essential during this time period. The overarching aim was to investigate the quality of web-based information about preventive measures and self care methods at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: in May 2020, consumer-oriented websites written in Swedish were identified via systematic searches in Google (n = 76). Websites were assessed with inductive content analysis, the JAMA benchmarks, the QUEST tool and the DISCERN instrument. RESULTS: seven categories and 33 subcategories were identified concerning preventive measures (md = 6.0 subcategories), with few specifying a method for washing hands (n = 4), when to sanitize the hands (n = 4), and a method for sanitizing the hands (n = 1). Eight categories and 30 subcategories were identified concerning self care methods (md = 3.0 subcategories), with few referring to the national number for telephone-based counseling (n = 20) and an online symptom assessment tool (n = 16). Overall, the median total quality scores were low (JAMA = 0/4, QUEST =13/28, DISCERN = 29/80). CONCLUSIONS: at the beginning of the pandemic, substantial quality deficits of websites about COVID-19 may have counteracted the public recommendations for preventive measures. This illustrates a critical need for standardized and systematic routines on how to achieve dissemination of high-quality web-based information when new epidemics and pandemics emerge.

METHODS: A 17-item questionnaire was distributed to ophthalmologists practicing in Israel. Data was obtained regarding demographics and clinical and surgical practice during the pandemic. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-seven ophthalmologists completed the survey from all regions of Israel. The survey was distributed during the early stages of the outbreak. At this time, no official government guidelines were in place. Most respondents reported no reduction of elective clinic visits and surgeries and no utilization of triage questionnaires. COVID-19 guidelines were reportedly promulgated to hospital ophthalmologists but not to community and private physicians.

It provides a convenient and precise picture of the progression of the disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of chest radiograph reporting systems (Brixia and total severity score (TSS)) and the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) clinical score in a group of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods This retrospective cohort study used routinely collected clinical data from polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients admitted to Field Hospital District 8, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from August 2021 to September 2021. The initial chest radiographs were scored based on the TSS and Brixia scoring systems to quantify the extent of lung involvement. After the chest radiograph score was reported, two residents calculated the rate of all-cause in-hospital mortality with the consultation of expert radiologists. In this study, NEWS2 scores on hospital admission were calculated. The gradient boosting machines (GBMs) and Shapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) were applied to access the important variable and improve the accuracy of mortality prediction. The adjusted odds ratio for predictor was presented by univariate analysis and multivariate analysis. Results The chest X-rays (CXRs) at the admission of 273 patients (mean age 59 years +/-16, 42.1% were male) were scored. In the univariate analysis, age, vaccination status, previous disease, NEWS2, a saturation of peripheral oxygen (Sp02), the Brixia and TSS scores were signi?cant predictors of mortality (p-value < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, there were statistically significant differences in mortality between age, Sp02, Brixia score, and patients with previous diseases were independent predictors of mortality and hospitalization. A gradient boosting machine was performed in the train data set, which showed that the best hyperparameters for predicting the mortality of patients are the Brixia score (exclude TSS score). In the top five predictors, an increase in Brixia, age, and BMI increased the logarithmic number of probability clarifying as death status. Although the TSS and Brixia scores evaluated chest imaging, the TSS score was not essential as the Brixia score (rank 6/11). It was clear that the BMI and NEWS2 score was positively correlated with the Brixia score, and age did not affect this correlation. Meanwhile, we did not find any trend between the TSS score versus BMI and NEWS2. Conclusion When integrated with the BMI and NEWS2 clinical classification systems, the severity score of COVID-19 chest radiographs, particularly the Brixia score, was an excellent predictor of all-cause in-hospital mortality.","output":"Chest X-ray Severity Score as a Putative Predictor of Clinical Outcome in Hospitalized Patients: An Experience From a Vietnamese COVID-19 Field Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urinary bladder cancer is one of the most common urinary tract cancers. Standard diagnosis procedure can be invasive and time-consuming. For these reasons, procedure called optical biopsy is introduced. This procedure allows in-vivo evaluation of bladder mucosa without the need for biopsy. Although less invasive and faster, accuracy is often lower. For this reason, machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to increase its accuracy. The issue with ML algorithms is their sensitivity to the amount of input data. In medicine, collection can be time-consuming due to a potentially low number of patients. For these reasons, data augmentation is performed, usually through a series of geometric variations of original images. While such images improve classification performance, the number of new data points and the insight they provide is limited. These issues are a motivation for the application of novel augmentation methods.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the mediation effects of depressive symptoms, emotional competence, and COVID-related PTSS on the relationship between family functioning and NSSI in adolescents. METHOD: A sample of 5854 adolescents was recruited from June 16 to July 8, 2020. The data for family functioning, depressive symptoms, emotional competence, COVID-related PTSS, and NSSI behavior of adolescents were collected via self-reported questionnaires. A structural equation model was constructed to examine the relationship, and a bootstrap analysis was conducted to evaluate the mediation effects. RESULTS: The reporting rate of adolescent NSSI was 30.2%. The poor family functioning was positively associated with adolescent NSSI (? = 0.130, 95% CI = 0.093-0.182), which was mediated by depression with effect size of 0.231 (95% CI = 0.201-0.257). The pathway coefficients between emotional competence and NSSI, and depression, COVID-related PTSS and NSSI, though statistically significant were unlikely to be clinically meaning with values of 0.057 and 0.015. There was no mediating effect by COVID-related PTSS. The pathways initially constructed between family functioning and COVID-related PTSS, emotional capacity and COVID-related PTSS were not been verified. LIMITATIONS: It was unclear whether this mediational effect would be supported in a longitudinal design. The application and extension of this model toward other regions and countries, and different ages need to be further explored.

The issues identified were used to craft a checklist to assist clinical trial managers in more efficient trial start-up. RESULTS: We identified key drivers for start-up delays in the following categories: regulatory, contracts and budgets, insurance, clinical supplies, site identification and selection, site activation, and inefficient processes/pitfalls. CONCLUSION: Initiating global randomized clinical trials is a complex endeavor, and reasons for delay are well documented in the literature. By using a checklist, clinical trial managers may mitigate some delays and get clinical studies initiated as soon as possible.","output":"Drivers of Start-Up Delays in Global Randomized Clinical Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adequate characterization of chemical entities made for biological screening in the drug discovery context is critical. Incorrectly characterized structures lead to mistakes in the interpretation of structure-activity relationships and confuse an already multidimensional optimization problem. Mistakes in the later use of these compounds waste money and valuable resources in a discovery process already under cost pressure. Left unidentified, these errors lead to problems in project data packages during quality review. At worst, they put intellectual property and patent integrity at risk. We describe a KNIME workflow for the early and automated identification of these errors during registration of a new chemical entity into the corporate screening catalog. This Automated Structure Verification workflow provides early identification (within 24 hours) of missing or inconsistent analytical data and therefore reduces any mistakes that inevitably get made. Automated identification removes the burden of work from the chemist submitting the compound into the registration system. No additional work is required unless a problem is identified and the submitter alerted. Before implementation, 14% of samples within the existing sample catalog were missing data on initial pass.

HCV nonstructural (NS) cysteine protease, NS2/3, is required for viral replication in vivo. Cystatin C is a naturally occurring cysteine protease inhibitor in human cells. We aimed to investigate the relation between serum levels of cystatin C and HCV viremia in treatment-na?ve children with chronic hepatitis C. METHODS Serum cystatin C levels were measured in 27 children with chronic hepatitis C and determined their relation with liver functions, histopathological parameters, and hepatitis C viral load. Serum cystatin C was compared with that of 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. RESULTS Cystatin C was significantly higher in patients than in controls (1.4  0.47 vs 0.99  0.49; P = 0.006), and in those with low viremia than in those with moderate viremia (1.55  0.41 vs 0.99  0.43; P = 0.013). Cystatin C was not correlated with histopathological findings in liver biopsy (P > 0.05 for all). In addition, there was no significant difference of cystatin C levels in patients with normal versus those with elevated transaminases (P > 0.05). Of importance, cystatin C correlated negatively with viral load (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Cystatin C levels correlated negatively with HCV viremia. This finding may reflect an inhibitory effect of cystatin C on HCV replication through inhibiting its NS2/3 and tempting for further studies for cystatin C as a possible adjuvant therapy for HCV infection.","output":"Serum cystatin C correlates negatively with viral load in treatment-na?ve children with chronic hepatitis C."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Mini Review of the literature aimed to assess the role of tocilizumab for the treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We describe herein the prevalence of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infection among Warao indigenous refugees from Venezuela living in Belm, Par, Brazil. METHODS: In total, 101 individuals of both sexes (43 men and 58 women) between 18 and 77 years of age were investigated. Blood samples were collected and separated into plasma and leukocytes. Serological screening was performed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Murex HTLV-I+II, DiaSorin, Dartford, UK), and seropositive samples were submitted to proviral DNA extraction followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). A nested PCR of the env region (630 bp) followed by enzymatic digestion with XhoI was performed to identify the molecular subtype of HTLV-2, in addition to sequencing analysis of the 5'LTR-I and 5-LTR-II regions. RESULTS: Of the 101 individuals analyzed, 3 (3.0%) were seropositive. Molecular analysis of the pol and tax genes confirmed the HTLV-1 infection in a 55-year-old woman and HTLV-2 infection in a man (68 years old) and a woman (23 years old). HTLV-2 strains were defined by enzymatic digestion as belonging to the HTLV-2b subtype. The sequencing of the 5LTR regions confirmed the presence of subtype 2b and identified HTLV-1 as belonging to subtype 1A (Cosmopolitan) and the Transcontinental subgroup. Among the infected patients, it was possible to conduct medical interviews with two individuals after delivery of the result. One patient with HTLV-2 reported symptoms such as joint pain, foot swelling, frequent headache, dizziness and lower back pain. The HTLV-1-positive woman was diagnosed with a tumor, dementia, urinary incontinence, felt body pain, and had spots on her body. The presence of the HTLV-2b subtype highlights the prevalence of this molecular variant among indigenous South Americans, as well as the presence of HTLV-1 Transcontinental, which has a worldwide distribution. CONCLUSION: These results reveal a high prevalence of HTLV-1/2 infection among Warao immigrants, suggesting migratory flow as a virus spread mechanism among human populations and alert public authorities to the need to create epidemiological surveillance programs, public social and health policies aimed at welcoming immigrants in the Brazilian territory.","output":"HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 Infection Among Warao Indigenous Refugees in the Brazilian Amazon: Challenges for Public Health in Times of Increasing Migration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Master narratives of \\"Good death\\" that render the circumstances surrounding COVID-19 fatalities as inherently \\"Bad\\" exacerbate the profound layers of grief people are experiencing as a result of the pandemic.

We centralized paediatric traumatology supposing a reduction of ER admissions, with increased severity of conditions, and a change in fracture patterns and consequently re-organized our structure. The COVID-19 epidemic in Europe has seen Italy as the first focus starting from the 21st of February 2020. Lombardy has been the most affected area. The initial NHS approach determined a high percentage of hospital admissions that led to early overload of hospitals, and we had to reorganize our structure to face the emergency. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the admission and treatment data to observe the epidemiological evolution of paediatric trauma during the lockdown ordinance and compared them with the same period in 2019. RESULTS We found a reduction of 78% paediatric visits in the ER but no decrease in the amount of paediatric fractures, rather we found a rate of paediatric fractures increased by 21,62 %. The upper limb fractures being the most representative. CONCLUSIONS Our expectations were confirmed. We believe that the reorganization and the guidelines by us designed has been effective to spare resources and subtract the paediatric traumatology load from those hospitals dealing with an unexpected number of critical COVID-19 patients. Even if we experienced a significant reduction of paediatric admissions to our trauma E.R., the presence of a determined number of fractures justifies the necessity of a specialized hub to collect all paediatric fractures.","output":"How the pandemic spread of COVID-19 affected children's traumatology in Italy: changes of numbers, anatomical locations, and severity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a denotational semantics for weak memory concurrency that avoids thin-air reads, provides data-race free programs with sequentially consistent semantics (DRF-SC), and supports a compositional refinement relation for validating optimisations.

Despite these risks, there have been no consistent statements on surgical guidelines regarding the perioperative screening or management of COVID-19 patients, and we do not have objective global data that describe the current conditions surrounding this issue. This study aimed to clarify the current global surgical practice including COVID-19 screening, preventive measures and in-hospital infection under the COVID-19 pandemic, and to clarify the international gaps on infection control policies among countries worldwide. METHODS: During April 2-8, 2020, a cross-sectional online survey on surgical practice was distributed to surgeons worldwide through international surgical societies, social media and personal contacts. Main outcome and measures included preventive measures and screening policies of COVID-19 in surgical practice and centers experiences of in-hospital COVID-19 infection. Data were analyzed by countrys cumulative deaths number by April 8, 2020 (high risk, >5000; intermediate risk, 100-5000; low risk, <100). RESULTS: A total of 936 centers in 71 countries responded to the survey (high risk, 330 centers; intermediate risk, 242 centers; low risk, 364 centers). In the majority (71.9%) of the centers, local guidelines recommended preoperative testing based on symptoms or suspicious radiologic findings. Universal testing for every surgical patient was recommended in only 18.4% of the centers. In-hospital COVID-19 infection was reported from 31.5% of the centers, with higher rates in higher risk countries (high risk, 53.6%; intermediate risk, 26.4%; low risk, 14.8%; P < 0.001). Of the 295 centers that experienced in-hospital COVID-19 infection, 122 (41.4%) failed to trace it and 58 (19.7%) reported the infection originating from asymptomatic patients/staff members. Higher risk countries adopted more preventive measures including universal testing, routine testing of hospital staff and use of dedicated personal protective equipment in operation theatres, but there were remarkable discrepancies across the countries. CONCLUSIONS: This large international survey captured the global surgical practice under the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the insufficient preoperative screening of COVID-19 in the current surgical practice.

Results:, 472 patients were enrolled in the first part of our study. SARSCoV- 2 infection was confirmed in, 16.9% of patients. Wearing gloves and masks were found to be effective in preventing infection (p=0.02;p=0.005), avoidance of communal areas had no effect on infection rates. Male sex increased the risk (p=0.008) of viral infection. Based on subjective complaints, UC patients had a worse disease course (p=0.002). Biological therapies did not increase the risk of infections. Patients vaccinated with mRNA vaccine had a significantly higher spike protein antibody titer one month after the second vaccination (p=0.004) compared to other vaccine types (Sinopharm?, Sputnik V?, Astra Zeneca?). Seropositivity was detected in, 98% of patients. Sinopharm ? vaccination triggered the lowest number of side effect (p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2 infection induced relapses more frequently than vaccinations. Conclusion: Face mask was the most effective preventive tool. The risk of infection was not increased by biological therapy, therefore therapy discontinuation is not justified. Almost every vaccinated patient developed seropositivity two month after vaccination independently from the type of the vaccine, however, spike protein antibody was significantly higher following mRNA vaccinations.","output":"COVID-19 risk factors, infection course and vaccination among patients with inflammatory bowel disease based on a Hungarian cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 increased difficulties associated with health management, especially cancer management To provide continuous pharmaceutical care to cancer patients, the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) implemented a remote pharmacy service platform based on its already existing online hospital App, known as Cloud SYSUCC OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics, acceptance, and initial impact of Cloud SYSUCC during the outbreak of COVID-19 in a tertiary cancer hospital in China METHODS: Total number of online prescriptions and detailed information were obtained during the first 6 months after work resumption The gender, age, residence, primary diagnosis, drug classification, weekly number of prescriptions, prescribed drugs and patients were included in the analysis Meanwhile, a telephone survey regarding the patients' satisfaction using the remote prescription service was conducted RESULTS: A total of 1718 prescriptions including 2022 drugs for 1212 patients were delivered to 24 provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government of China between February 12, 2020 and August 11, 2020 The majority of patients were female (841, 69 39%) and 90 18% (n=1093) of the patients were aged 31 to 70 years old The top three online medical prescription diagnosis were breast cancer (599, 49 42%), liver cancer (249, 20 54%), and thyroid cancer (125, 10 31%) Of the 1718 delivered prescriptions, 1435 (83 5%) were sent to Guangdong Province and 283 (16 5%) were sent to other provinces in China Of the 2022 delivered drugs, 1012 (50 05%) were hormonal drugs The general trend in the use of the online prescription service was down since the 10th weeks A telephone survey showed 88% (n=88) participants were very satisfied while 12% (n=12) were somewhat satisfied with our remote pharmacy service platform CONCLUSIONS: The Cloud SYSUCC remote pharmacy platform is efficient and convenient for continuous pharmaceutical care to cancer patients during the COVID-19 crisis The widespread use of this platform can help to reduce person-to-person transmission as well as the infection risk of patients with cancer diseases Further efforts need to be made to improve the quality and acceptance of Cloud SYSUCC, as well as to regulate and standardize the management of this novel service","output":"Implementation of A Remote Oncology Pharmacy Service Platform During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the great success of the administered vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus can still spread, as evidenced by the current circulation of the highly contagious Omicron variant. This emphasizes the additional need to develop effective antiviral countermeasures. In the context of early preclinical studies for antiviral assessment, robust cellular infection systems are required to screen drug libraries. In this study, we reported the implementation of a human glioblastoma cell line, stably expressing ACE2, in a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay. These glioblastoma cells, designated as U87.ACE2+, expressed ACE2 and cathepsin B abundantly, but had low cellular levels of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. The U87.ACE2+ cells fused highly efficiently and quickly with SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing cells. Furthermore, upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus, the U87.ACE2+ cells displayed rapidly a clear CPE that resulted in complete cell lysis and destruction of the cell monolayer. By means of several readouts we showed that the U87.ACE2+ cells actively replicate SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, the U87.ACE2+ cells could be successfully implemented in an MTS-based colorimetric CPE reduction assay, providing IC50 values for Remdesivir in the low nanomolar range. Lastly, the U87.ACE2+ cells were consistently permissive to all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including the current Omicron variant. Thus, ACE2 expressing glioblastoma cells are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 with productive viral replication and with the induction of a strong CPE that can be utilized in high-throughput screening platforms.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Permissive Glioblastoma Cell Line for High Throughput Antiviral Screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic in March 2020.

The Pango dynamic nomenclature is a popular system for classifying and naming genetically-distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, and is based on the analysis of complete or near-complete virus genomes. However, for several reasons, nucleotide sequences may be generated that cover only the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2. It is therefore important to understand how much information about Pango lineage status is contained in spike-only nucleotide sequences. Here we explore how Pango lineages might be reliably designated and assigned to spike-only nucleotide sequences. We survey the genetic diversity of such sequences, and investigate the information they contain about Pango lineage status. RESULTS: Although many lineages, including the main variants of concern, can be identified clearly using spike-only sequences, some spike-only sequences are shared among tens or hundreds of Pango lineages. To facilitate the classification of SARS-CoV-2 lineages using subgenomic sequences we introduce the notion of designating such sequences to a lineage set, which represents the range of Pango lineages that are consistent with the observed mutations in a given spike sequence. CONCLUSIONS: We find that many lineages, including the main variants-of-concern, can be reliably identified by spike alone and we define lineage-sets to represent the lineage precision that can be achieved using spike-only nucleotide sequences. These data provide a foundation for the development of software tools that can assign newly-generated spike nucleotide sequences to Pango lineage sets.

METHODS: This was a retrospective descriptive study of COVID-19 patients who were admitted between March 2020 and December 2020 at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. Data collected include patient demographic and baseline characteristics. Differences between patients who were known to have diabetes and hypertension during admission were compared for statistical significance. Difference between those who survived and those who died were also compared for statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 913 records of patients were studied with a mean age of 51.2 years (SD = 16.7), 66.5% were male and 80.8% were of African origin. History of diabetes, hypertension, and HIV status were at 27.3%, 33.1%, and 2.3%, respectively.

We explore the extent to which differing medical specialties have engaged with the concept over the last 20 years and how and why this attention has varied among a sample of medical specialties since 2001. METHODS Reference to patient-centered care in the medical literature for selected specialties was used as a proxy for clinical application of patient-centered care in those disciplines. We undertook a statistical analysis and historical review of the medical literature that references the concept of patient-centered care in pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology (OB-GYN), orthopedics, radiology, dermatology, and neurosurgery. We analyzed the extent to which the literature referencing patient-centered care has changed for the six disciplines since first mentioned in the Institute of Medicine 2001 publication. We measured changes over time in reference to patient-centered care in the medical literature for six diverse medical specialties. RESULTS The six disciplines differed significantly in reference to patient-centered care when comparing publications between the disciplines (p < 0.001). Pediatrics showed the most extensive reference to the concept followed by OB-GYN. In contrast, patient-centered care was hardly mentioned in dermatology and neurosurgery, nor orthopedics or radiology. When correcting for the number of papers published in the different fields, reference to patient-centered care is ~18X more common in pediatrics than in neurosurgery. CONCLUSION Uptake, attention and applicability of the principles of patient-centered care have varied over the last 20 years. Differences among specialties appear to reflect true differences in patient centricities in the disciplines, with higher uptake in specialties that are person-oriented rather than technique-oriented.

Each vignette described (1) the RCT and characteristics of the treatment tested (ie, doses, administration routes) and (2) the trial procedures and different options (on-site or remotely) for how the trial was organized for informed consent, follow-up visits, and communication of results when the trial was completed. We recruited 628 participants from ComPaRe (www.compare.aphp.fr), a French e-cohort of patients with chronic diseases. The outcomes were the participants preferences for the way the trial was organized (on-site or remotely) and their willingness to participate in the trial. RESULTS: Of the 628 participants who answered the vignettes, 491 (78.2%) were female (median age 55 years), with different chronic diseases ranging from endometriosis in 59 of 491 (12%) patients to asthma in 133 of 628 (21.2%) patients. In addition, 38 (6.1%) participants wanted to provide informed consent and all trial visits on-site, 176 (28%) wished to participate in the trial entirely remotely, and 414 (65.9%) wanted to combine remote-based and hospital-based visits. Considering the trial as a whole, when the trial was organized in a way that the patients preferred, the median (Q1-Q3) likelihood of participation in the trial was 90% (80-100) versus 60% (30-80) if the trial followed the patients nonpreferred model. Furthermore, 256 (40.8%) patients responded to open-ended questions expressing their experience with trial participation and visits to the hospital and providing suggestions for improvement. The patients emphasized the need to personalize the way a trial is organized according to each patients needs and conditions. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant diversity in the participants preferences. Most participants preferred hybrid organization involving both on-site and remote visits. Participants were more likely to participate in a trial organized according to their preferences.","output":"Patients Perspectives on Transforming Clinical Trial Participation: Large Online Vignette-based Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is causing a rapid and tragic health emergency worldwide. Because of the particularity of COVID-19, people are at a high risk of pressure injuries during the prevention and treatment process of COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aimed to summarize the pressure injuries caused by COVID-19 and the corresponding preventive measures and treatments. METHODS: This systematic review was according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. PubMed, Web of science and CNKI (Chinese) were searched for studies on pressure injuries caused by COVID-19 published up to August 4, 2020. The quality of included studies was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) and the CARE guidelines. RESULTS: The data were extracted from 16 studies involving 7,696 participants in 7 countries. All studies were published in 2020. There are two main types of pressure injuries caused by the COVID-19: 1) Pressure injuries that caused by protective equipment (masks, goggles and face shield, etc.) in the prevention process; 2) pressure injuries caused by prolonged prone position in the therapy process. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, the included studies showed that wearing protective equipment for a long time and long-term prone positioning with mechanical ventilation will cause pressure injuries in the oppressed area. Foam dressing may need to be prioritized in the prevention of medical device related pressure injuries. The prevention of pressure injuries should be our particular attention in the course of clinical treatment and nursing.","output":"COVID-19 related pressure injuries in patients and personnel: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most COVID-19 convalescents can build effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity, but it remains unclear how long it can maintain and how efficiently it can prevent the reinfection of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we tested the sera from 248 COVID-19 convalescents around one year post-infection in Wuhan, the earliest known epicenter. SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins G (IgG) were well maintained in most patients and potently neutralizes the infection of the original strain and the B.1.1.7 variant. However, varying degrees of immune escape was observed on the other tested variants in a patient-specific manner, with individuals showing remarkably broad neutralization potency. The immune escape can be largely attributed to several critical spike mutations.

We show that decomposing heart rate from low-cost wearable technologies into signals from different systems can give a multidimensional description of physiological changes due to COVID-19 infection. We find that the separate physiological features of basal heart rate, heart rate response to physical activity, circadian variation in heart rate, and autocorrelation of heart rate are significantly altered and can classify symptomatic versus healthy periods. Increased heart rate and autocorrelation begin at symptom onset, while the heart rate response to activity increases soon after symptom onset and increases more in individuals exhibiting cough. Symptom onset is associated with a blunting of circadian variation in heart rate, as measured by the uncertainty in the phase estimate.

This can amplify age-related declines in physical and cognitive functions and may therefore affect the ability to complete basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL and IADL, respectively), which are essential for independence. This systematic review aims to describe the association of objectively measured PA and SB with ADL and IADL in community-dwelling older adults. Six databases (PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, CINAHL, PsychINFO, SPORTDiscuss) were searched from inception to 21/06/2020 for articles meeting our eligibility criteria: 1) observational or experimental study, 2) participants' mean/median age 60 years, 3) community-dwelling older adults, 4) PA and SB were measured with a(n) accelerometer/pedometer, 5) PA and SB were studied in relation to ADL and/or IADL. Risk of bias was assessed in duplicate using modified versions of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Effect direction heat maps provided an overview of associations and standardized regression coefficients (?s) were depicted in albatross plots. Thirty articles (6 longitudinal; 24 cross-sectional) were included representing 24,959 (range: 23 to 2749) community-dwelling older adults with mean/median age ranging from 60.0 to 92.3 years (54.6% female). Higher PA and lower SB were associated with better ability to complete ADL and IADL in all longitudinal studies and overall results of cross-sectional studies supported these associations, which underscores the importance of an active lifestyle. The median [interquartile range] of ?s for associations of PA/SB with ADL and IADL were, respectively, 0.145 [0.072, 0.280] and 0.135 [0.093, 0.211]. Our strategy to address confounding may have suppressed the true relationship of PA and SB with ADL or IADL because of over-adjustment in some included studies.

We performed a federal state-wide cross-sectional seroprevalence study named SaarCoPS, that is representative for the adult population including elderly individuals and nursing home residents in the Saarland. METHODS: Serum was collected from 2940 adults via stationary or mobile teams during the 1(st) pandemic wave steady state period. We selected an antibody test system with maximal specificity, also excluding seroreversion effects due to a high longitudinal test performance. For the calculations of infection and fatality rates, we accounted for the delays of seroconversion and death after infection. RESULTS: Using a highly specific total antibody test detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses over more than 180 days, we estimate an adult infection rate of 1.02% (95% CI: [0.64; 1.44]), an underreporting rate of 2.68-fold (95% CI: [1.68; 3.79]) and infection fatality rates of 2.09% (95% CI: (1.48; 3.32]) or 0.36% (95% CI: [0.25; 0.59]) in all adults including elderly individuals, or adults younger than 70 years, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the importance of study design and test performance for seroprevalence studies, particularly when seroprevalences are low. Our results provide a valuable baseline for evaluation of future pandemic dynamics and impact of public health measures on virus spread and human health in comparison to neighbouring countries such as Luxembourg or France.","output":"German federal-state-wide seroprevalence study of 1(st) SARS-CoV-2 pandemic wave shows importance of long-term antibody test performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The conscious promotion of health by an appropriate, balanced diet has become an important social request.

Timely gathering of information on this topic can provide valuable insight and improve the handling of the ongoing and future pandemic outbreaks. Methods and Results A survey instrument developed by the authors was disseminated via e-mail, text messaging, WhatsApp, and social media to interventional cardiologists between April 6, 2020, and April 11, 2020. A total of 509 responses were collected from 18 countries, mainly from the United States (51%) and Italy (36%). Operators reported significant decline in coronary, structural heart, and endovascular procedure volumes. Personal protective equipment was available to 95% of respondents; however FIT-tested N95 or equivalent masks were available to only 70%, and 74% indicated absence of coronavirus disease 2019 pretesting. Most (83%) operators expressed concern when asked to perform cardiac catheterization on a suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patient, primarily because of fear of viral transmission (88%). Although the survey demonstrated significant compliance with social distancing, high use of telemedicine (69%), and online education platforms (80%), there was concern over impending financial loss. Conclusions Our survey indicates significant reduction in invasive procedure volumes and concern for viral transmission. There is near universal adoption of personal protective equipment; however, coronavirus disease 2019 pretesting and access to FIT-tested N95 masks is suboptimal.

PURPOSE To compare the effects of 2 lateral MAT fixation techniques-bone block and suture only-on knee kinematics and forces. STUDY DESIGN Controlled laboratory study. METHODS With a robotic testing system, loads were applied during flexion on 10 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees: 134-N anterior tibial load + 200-N axial compression, 5-Nm internal tibial + 5-Nm valgus torques, and 5-Nm external tibial + 5-Nm valgus torques. Kinematic data were recorded for 4 knee states: intact, total lateral meniscectomy, lateral MAT bone block, and lateral MAT suture-only fixation. In situ force in the anterior cruciate ligament and resultant forces in the lateral meniscus and in the meniscal allograft were quantified via the principle of superposition. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze variations in kinematics and forces at 0, 30, 60, and 90 of knee flexion. Significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS When anterior loads were applied, a decrease in medial translation of the tibia that was increased after total lateral meniscectomy was observed at 30, 60, and 90 of knee flexion for both the lateral MAT bone block (54.2%, 48.0%, and 50.0%) and the MAT suture-only (50.0%, 40.0%, and 34.6%) fixation techniques (P < .05). Yet, most of the increases in knee kinematics after lateral meniscectomy were not significantly reduced by either lateral MAT technique (P > .05 for each MAT technique vs the total lateral meniscectomy state). Resultant forces in the meniscal allograft were 50% to 60% of the resultant forces in the intact lateral meniscus in response to all loading conditions at all flexion angles (P < .05). Overall, no significant differences between lateral MAT techniques were observed regarding kinematics and forces (P > .05). CONCLUSION Lateral MAT partially restored medial translation of the tibia, and the resultant forces in the meniscal allograft were only 50% to 60% of the intact lateral meniscus forces in the cadaver model. In the majority of testing conditions, no significant changes of the in situ force in the anterior cruciate ligament were observed. Surgeons should consider the potential benefits of lateral MAT when deciding the appropriate treatment for symptomatic patients after lateral meniscectomies. Both lateral MAT techniques functioned similarly.

The current study has two aims (1) to investigate if mental health problems previous to COVID-19 pandemic are associated with access to online learning;(2) to investigate whether those accessing online learning have lower levels of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The sample consisted of 672 young people (16 - 24 years of age) from the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort that were enrolled in an educational institution and had access to the internet. Participants were evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic and in a previous time point. A total of 511 students were enrolled in online classes, while 161 were not enrolled. Psychopathology was measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in both time points. Attendance to online classes during COVID-19 was obtained by self-report. Data were analyzed using multiple regression models. Results: Prospective analysis revealed that every one-point increase in the total SDQ score before the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase of 6% in the chance of a participant not accessing online classes, above and beyond previous negative school events, such as suspensions and grade repetition and other confounders (adjusted OR 0.94;95%CI 0.91-0.98;p=0.0009). Cross-sectional analysis revealed that participants that accessed online classes had a slightly lower number of inattention/hyperactivity problems if compared to those without online classes (Cohen's d=0.25;=-0.63, p=0.006);however, those results were fully explained by previous symptoms of inattention/hyperactivity.

Design: A convenience sample of 201 older adults aged 65 and over was interviewed. Using bootstrapping, we tested the strength and significance of the indirect effect of depressive symptoms and malnutrition (mediators) on the relationship between feelings of loneliness and subjective age. Results: The relationship between feelings of loneliness and subjective age during the COVID-19 pandemic was mediated by malnutrition, but not by depressive symptoms. In addition, the participants felt older during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the preceding period. Conclusions: An association was found among feelings of loneliness, malnutrition, and subjective age. To overcome these feelings in times of crisis like the pandemic, it is essential to develop new communication methods (technologies for managing and addressing the needs of the older population; technologies to encourage social engagement, and technologies for managing and providing remote medical services) for and with older adults that are effective in reducing loneliness, and to promote good nutrition.

Determining the status of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in both candidates and recipients will be important to understand the epidemiology and clinical course of COVID-19 in this population. While there are multiple tests to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, their performance is variable. Tests vary according to their platforms and the antigenic targets which make interpretation of the results challenging. Furthermore, for some assays, sensitivity and specificity is less than optimal. Additionally, currently available serological tests do not exclude the possibility that positive responses are due to cross reactive antibodies to community coronaviruses rather than SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This study describes the development and validation of a high throughput multiplex antibody detection assay. RESULTS: The multiplex assay has the capacity to identify, simultaneously, patient responses to 5 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely, the full spike protein, 3 individual domains of the spike protein (S1, S2 and receptor binding domain) and the nucleocapsid protein. The antibody response to the above proteins are SARS-CoV-2 specific, as antibodies against 4 common coronaviruses do not cross-react. CONCLUSIONS: This new assay provides a novel tool to interrogate the spectrum of immune responses to SAR-CoV-2 and is uniquely suitable for use in the transplant setting. Test configuration is essentially identical to the single antigen bead assays used in the majority of histocompatibility laboratories around the world and could easily be implemented into routine screening of transplant candidates and recipients.","output":"Development and Validation of a Multiplex, Bead-Based Assay to Detect Antibodies Directed Against SARS-CoV-2 Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the pandemic, testing for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 by RT\\\\PCR is one of the pillars on which countermeasures are based. Factors limiting the output of laboratories interfere with the effectiveness of public health measures.

Blood transfusion services had experience in performance of high throughput NAT analysis and can support the national health system by screening of the inhabitants for SARS\\\\COV\\\\2. METHODS: We evaluated a new approach of a multiple swab method by simultaneously incubating multiple respiratory swabs in a single tube.

RESULTS: The novel method did not cause false negative results with non\\\\significantly differing Ct values between single swab and multiple swab NAT. In two routine applications, all mini pools containing positive patient samples were correctly identified. CONCLUSIONS: The new method enables countries to increase the total number of testing significantly. The multiple swab method is able to screen system relevant groups of employees frequently.

Whether a maternal cytokine storm can affect neonatal brain development is unclear. The objective of the present study is to assess neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy. MethodsIn this prospective cohort study, the neurodevelopment status of infants (N=298) born to women with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy was assessed at 10-12 months post discharge using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, 3rd edition (ASQ-3). The ASQ-3 scores were classified into developmental delays (cutoff score: 2 standard deviations (SDs) below the population mean) and no delay (score >2 SDs above the population mean).ResultsApproximately 10% of infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy showed developmental delays. Two of 298 infants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and both had normal ASQ-3 scores. The majority of the pregnant women had SARS-CoV-2 infection during their third trimester. The risk of developmental delays among infants was higher in those whose mothers had SARS-CoV-2 infections during the first (P=0.039) and second trimesters (P=0.001) than in those whose mothers had SARS-CoV-2 infections during the third trimester. Infants born at <31 weeks gestation were more prone to developmental delays than those born at >31 weeks gestation (10% versus 0.8%;P=0.002).ConclusionThe findings of the study highlight the need for long term neurodevelopmental assessment of infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy: A national prospective study in Kuwait (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The first outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy occurred during the second half of February 2020 in some areas in the North of the country. Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people in the world. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. Methods: We analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 30 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative log-logistic distribution. Results: A total of 101,739 infected individuals were confirmed until 30 March 2020, of which 14,620 recovered or discharged, and 11,591 deaths. Until the same date patients quarantined at home were 43,752, whereas hospitalized patients were 31,776, of which 3981 in intensive care. The active cases (i.e. the number of patients not yet recovered until that date) were 75,528. The forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for Italy of 234,000 about, and a duration of the epidemic of approximately 4 months. Conclusions: One month after the first outbreaks there seemed to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections, showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic.

The flexibility of the MPC is demonstrated by controlling a WRRF under four management objectives, aiming at minimizing: (A) effluent concentrations, (B) electricity consumption, (C) total operations costs (sum electricity costs and discharge effluent tax) or (D) global warming potential (direct and indirect nitrous oxide emissions, and indirect from electricity production) . The MPC is tested with data from the alternating WRRF in N?rre Snede (Denmark) and from the Danish electricity grid. Results showed how the four control objectives resulted in important differences in aeration patterns and in the concentration dynamics over a day. Controls B and C showed similarities when looking at total costs, while similarities in global warming potential for controls A and D suggest that improving effluent quality also reduced greenhouse gasses emissions. The MPC flexibility in handling different objectives is shown by using a combined objective function, optimizing both cost and greenhouse emissions. This shows the trade-off between the two objectives, enabling the calculation of marginal costs and thus allowing WRRF operators to carefully evaluate prioritization of management objectives. The long-term MPC performance is evaluated over 51 days covering seasonal and inter-weekly variations. On a daily basis, control A was 9-30% cheaper on average compared to controls A, D and to the current rule-based control. Similarly, control D resulted on average in 35-43% lower greenhouse gasses daily emission compared to the other controls. Difference between control performance increased for days with greater inter-diurnal variations in electricity price or greenhouse emissions from electricity production, i.e. when MPC has greater possibilities for exploiting input variations. The flexibility of the proposed MPC can easily accommodate for additional control objectives, allowing WRRF operators to quickly adapt the plant operation to new management objectives and to face new performance requirements.","output":"Prioritize effluent quality, operational costs or global warming? - Using predictive control of wastewater aeration for flexible management of objectives in WRRFs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Even though advancement in mother-to-child HIV transmission prevention services is observed, many infants are lost to follow-up and could not access the full package of mother-to-child HIV transmission prevention services as a result. This is one of the obstacles to the effectiveness of the program. Therefore, determining the magnitude of lost to follow-up and its predictors is important among HIV-exposed infants. METHOD: This institution-based retrospective cohort study was conducted from August 2013 to June 2018 at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. We retrieved charts of 423 childCmother pairs through a simple random sampling technique. Data collectors extracted data by using a data extraction tool adapted from the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health HIV-exposed infant follow-up form. Bivariable and multivariable Cox regression models were fitted to identify predictors of lost to follow-up. RESULT: A total of 402 childCmother pairs were included in the study.

So, in this study, we aimed to examine Turkish final year medical students' knowledge level, and perceptions towards the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS The present descriptive multicentered study was conducted with the medical students in the final year of six medical schools located in six geographic regions of Turkey. After ethical approval, data was gathered using an online questionnaire through Google forms between April 10, 2020, and April 20, 2020.

Bovines are considered potential sources of infection for humans, because species and genotypes of Cryptosporidium and Giardia infecting humans have also been isolated from cattle in molecular parasitological studies. However, species and genotypes of Cryptosporidium and Giardia of bovids, and the extent of zoonotic transmission in different geographical regions in the world, are still relatively poorly understood.

We employed group testing with a sparse random pooling scheme and conventional group test decoding algorithms both for exact and inexact recovery. Our simulations showed that significant reduction in per case test numbers (or expansion in total test numbers preserving the number of actual tests conducted) for very sparse prevalence regimes is available. Currently proposed COVID-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 10X scale-up. There is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios. We investigated if further improvement is available, especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans.

However, it is unknown whether genetic predisposition to VTE is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis following vaccination. METHODS Using data from the UK Biobank, which contains in-depth genotyping data and linked vaccination and health outcomes information, we generated a polygenic risk score (PRS) using 299 genetic variants identified from a previous large genome-wide association study. We prospectively assessed associations between PRS and incident VTE after first and the second-dose vaccination separately. We conducted sensitivity analyses stratified by vaccine type (adenovirus- and mRNA-based) and using two historical unvaccinated cohorts. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) for PRS-VTE associations using Cox models. RESULTS Of 359,310 individuals receiving one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, 160,327 (44.6%) were males, and the mean age at the vaccination date was 69.05 (standard deviation [SD] 8.04) years. After 28- and 90-days follow-up, 88 and 299 individuals developed VTE respectively, equivalent to an incidence rate of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70 to 1.08) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.04) per 100,000 person-days. The PRS was significantly associated with a higher risk of VTE (HR per 1 SD increase in PRS, 1.41 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.73) in 28 days and 1.36 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.52) in 90 days). Similar associations were found after stratification by vaccine type, in the two-dose cohort and across the historical unvaccinated cohorts. CONCLUSIONS The genetic determinants of post-Covid-19-vaccination VTE are similar to those seen in historical data. This suggests that, at the population level, post-vaccine VTE has similar aetiology to conventional VTE. Additionally, the observed PRS-VTE associations were equivalent for adenovirus- and mRNA-based vaccines.","output":"Genetic risk and incident venous thromboembolism in middle-aged and older adults following 1 Covid-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) are seriously affecting human health all over the world.

These drugs are docked onto the three-dimensional structure of the nsp12 protein of SARS-CoV-2, which controls the polymerization process. Hence, it is considered one of the primary therapeutic targets for coronaviruses. Sofosbuvir is a drug that is currently used for HCV treatment; therefore, HCV RdRp is used as a positive control protein target. The protein dynamics are simulated for 100 ns, while the binding is tested during different dynamics states of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Additionally, the drug-protein complexes are further simulated for 20 ns to explore the binding mechanism. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as a target with the active form of sofosbuvir as a ligand demonstrates binding effectiveness. One of the FDA-approved antiviral drugs, such as sofosbuvir, can help us in this mission, aiming to limit the danger of COVID-19.

Secondary outcome included the proportion of patients with normoprolactinaemia after DA withdrawal using individual patient data. Risk of bias was assessed by using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled proportions were estimated using a random effects model in case I 2  75% or by reporting range of effects if I 2 > 75%. RESULTS: Thirty two observational studies enrolling 1563 patients were included. The proportion of patients with persistent normoprolactinaemia ranged from 0 to 75 % (I 2 = 84 %). Heterogeneity was partly explained by age with more successful withdrawal in patients of higher age. Individual patient data analyses suggested that the proportion of patients with persistent normoprolactinaemia 6 months after DA withdrawal with a low maintenance dose and full regression of the prolactinoma was 87.7 % (95 % CI = 60.7 to 97.1; I 2 = 0 %) and 58.4 % (95 % CI = 23.8 to 86.3; I 2 = 75 %) for microadenomas and macroadenomas, respectively.

An intensive external facilitation intervention may enhance uptake in low-adopting VHA facilities by engaging stakeholders from multiple clinical settings within a facility (e.g., mental health, primary care, pain specialty clinic, substance use disorder clinics). Our study identified pre-intervention determinants of implementation through qualitative interviews, described strategies employed during the first 6 months of intensive external facilitation, and explored patterns of implementation determinants in relation to early outcomes. METHODS Guided by the integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework, we interviewed stakeholders at low-adopting VHA facilities prior to external facilitation, employed a rapid qualitative analytic process, presented findings during facility visits, and collaboratively created facilitation action plans to achieve goals set by the facilities that would increase M-OUD uptake. The primary outcome was the Substance Use Disorder (SUD)-16, which is a VHA facility-level performance metric consisting of the percent of patients receiving M-OUD among those with an OUD diagnosis. We examined the relationship between pre-implementation factors and 6-month SUD-16 outcomes. RESULTS Across eight VHA facilities, we interviewed 68 participants. Implementation determinants included barriers and facilitators across innovation, context, and recipients constructs of i-PARIHS. Each facility selected goals based on the qualitative results. At 6 months, two facilities achieved most goals and two facilities demonstrated progress. The SUD-16 from baseline to 6 months significantly improved in two facilities (8.4% increase (95 % confidence interval [CI] 4.4-12.4) and 9.9% increase (95% CI 3.6-16.2), respectively). Six-month implementation outcomes showed that the extent to which M-OUD aligns with existing clinical practices and values was a primary factor at all facilities, with six of eight facilities perceiving it as both a barrier and facilitator. External health system barriers were most challenging for facilities with the smallest change in SUD-16. CONCLUSIONS Early impacts of a multi-faceted implementation approach demonstrated a strong signal for positively impacting M-OUD prescribing in low-adopting VHA facilities. This signal indicates that external facilitation can influence adoption of M-OUD at the facility level in the early implementation phase. These short-term wins experienced by stakeholders may encourage continued adoption and long-term sustainability M-OUD.","output":"Early impacts of a multi-faceted implementation strategy to increase use of medication treatments for opioid use disorder in the Veterans Health Administration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected mental health, creating an urgent need for convenient and safe interventions to improve well-being.

Early deaths were mainly attributable to intractable multiple organ failure related to the primary infection (82 %) and to mesenteric ischemia (6.4 %). In-ICU late deaths were directly related to end-of-life decisions in 29 % of patients and otherwise mostly related to ICU-acquired complications, including nosocomial infections (20.4 %) and mesenteric ischemia (16.6 %). Independent determinants of early death were age, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, no pathogen identification, and initial severity. Among 3-day survivors, independent risk factors for late death were age, cirrhosis, no pathogen identification, and previous corticosteroid treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a comprehensive assessment of septic shock-related deaths. Identification of risk factors of early and late deaths may determine differential prognostic patterns.","output":"Timing and causes of death in septic shock"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The drug discovery process currently employed in the pharmaceutical industry typically requires about 10 years and $2-3 billion to deliver one new drug.

We report here the properties of a trimeric ACE2 variant, created by a structure-based approach, with binding affinity of ~60 pM for the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, while preserving the wildtype peptidase activity as well as the ability to block activation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 in the RAS.

Mutations in these critical proteins have been implicated in human diseases including Brugada syndrome, idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias, and epileptic encephalopathy. The underlying ionic mechanisms by which reduced sodium channel availability in Fhf2 knockout mice predisposes to abnormal excitability at the tissue level are not well defined. Objective: Using animal models and theoretical multicellular linear strands, we examined how FHF2 orchestrates the interdependency of sodium, calcium, and gap junctional conductances to safeguard cardiac conduction. Methods and Results: Fhf2KO mice were challenged by reducing calcium conductance using verapamil or by reducing gap junctional conductance using carbenoxolone or by backcrossing into a connexin 43 heterozygous (Cx43+/-) background. All conditions produced conduction block in Fhf2KO mice, with Fhf2WT showing normal impulse propagation. To explore the ionic mechanisms of block in Fhf2KO hearts, multicellular linear strand models incorporating FHF2-deficient sodium channel inactivation properties were constructed and faithfully recapitulated conduction abnormalities seen in mutant hearts. The mechanisms of conduction block in mutant strands with reduced calcium conductance or gap junction uncoupling are very different. Enhanced sodium channel inactivation due to FHF2 deficiency shifts dependence onto calcium current to sustain electrotonic driving force, axial current flow, and action potential generation from cell-to-cell. In the setting of gap junction uncoupling, slower charging time from upstream cells conspires with accelerated sodium channel inactivation in mutant strands to prevent sufficient downstream cell charging for action potential propagation. Conclusions: FHF2-dependent effects on sodium channel inactivation ensure adequate sodium current reserve to safeguard against numerous threats to reliable cardiac impulse propagation.","output":"Ionic Mechanisms of Impulse Propagation Failure in the FHF2-Deficient Heart"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several mammalian arenaviruses (mammarenaviruses) cause hemorrhagic fevers in humans and pose serious public health concerns in their endemic regions. Additionally, mounting evidence indicates that the worldwide-distributed, prototypic mammarenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), is a neglected human pathogen of clinical significance. Concerns about human-pathogenic mammarenaviruses are exacerbated by of the lack of licensed vaccines, and current anti-mammarenavirus therapy is limited to off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective. Detailed understanding of virus/host-cell interactions may facilitate the development of novel anti-mammarenavirus strategies by targeting components of the host-cell machinery that are required for efficient virus multiplication. Here we document the generation of a recombinant LCMV encoding a nucleoprotein (NP) containing an affinity tag (rLCMV/Strep-NP) and its use to capture the NP-interactome in infected cells. Our proteomic approach combined with genetics and pharmacological validation assays identified ATPase Na(+)/K(+) transporting subunit alpha 1 (ATP1A1) and prohibitin (PHB) as pro-viral factors. Cell-based assays revealed that ATP1A1 and PHB are involved in different steps of the virus life cycle. Accordingly, we observed a synergistic inhibitory effect on LCMV multiplication with a combination of ATP1A1 and PHB inhibitors. We show that ATP1A1 inhibitors suppress multiplication of Lassa virus and Candid#1, a live-attenuated vaccine strain of Junn virus, suggesting that the requirement of ATP1A1 in virus multiplication is conserved among genetically distantly related mammarenaviruses. Our findings suggest that clinically approved inhibitors of ATP1A1, like digoxin, could be repurposed to treat infections by mammarenaviruses pathogenic for humans.","output":"Interactome analysis of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleoprotein in infected cells reveals ATPase Na(+)/K(+) transporting subunit Alpha 1 and prohibitin as host-cell factors involved in the life cycle of mammarenaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may progress to severe pulmonary disease, COVID-19. Currently, patients admitted to hospital because of COVID-19 have better prognosis than during the first period of the pandemic due to improved treatment. However, the overall societal susceptibility of being infected makes it pivotal to prevent severe courses of disease to avoid high mortality rates and collapse of the healthcare systems. Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) self-care is used in chronic pulmonary disease and has been shown to prevent pneumonia in a high-risk cohort of patients with leukaemia. PEP flute self-care to prevent respiratory deterioration and hospitalisation in early COVID-19: a randomised trial (The PEP-CoV trial) examines the effectiveness on respiratory symptoms and need of hospital admission by regular PEP flute use among non-hospitalised individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this randomised controlled trial, we hypothesise that daily PEP flute usage as add-on to usual care is superior to usual care as regards symptom severity measured by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) at 30-day follow-up (primary outcome) and hospital admission through register data (secondary outcome). We expect to recruit 400 individuals for the trial. Participants in the intervention group receive a kit of 2 PEP flutes and adequate resistances and access to instruction videos. A telephone hotline offers possible contact to a nurse. The eight-item CAT score measures cough, phlegm, chest tightness, dyspnoea, activities of daily living at home, feeling safe at home despite symptoms, sleep quality and vigour. The CAT score is measured daily in both intervention and control arms by surveys prompted through text messages. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was registered prospectively at www.clinicaltrials.gov on 27 August 2020 (NCT04530435). Ethical approval was granted by the local health research ethics committee (Journal number: H-20035929) on 23 July 2020. Enrolment of participants began on 6 October 2020.

Aims This study screened for psychopathology and evaluated the efficacy of a brief, social contact-based video intervention in increasing treatment-seeking intentions among healthcare workers (trial registration: NCT04497415). We anticipated finding high rates of psychopathology and greater treatment-seeking intentions post-intervention. Method Healthcare workers (n = 350) were randomised to (a) a brief video-based intervention at day 1, coupled with a booster video at day 14;(b) the video at day 1 only;or (c) a non-intervention control. In the 3 min video, a female nurse described difficulty coping with stress, her anxieties and depression, barriers to care and how therapy helped her. Assessments were conducted pre- and post-intervention and at 14- and 30-day follow-ups. Results Of the 350 healthcare workers, 281 (80%) reported probable anxiety, depression and/or PTSD. Participants were principally nurses (n = 237;68%), physicians (n = 52;15%) and emergency medical technicians (n = 30;9%). The brief video-based intervention yielded greater increases in treatment-seeking intentions than the control condition, particularly among participants in the repeat-video group. Exploratory analysis revealed that in both video groups, we found greater effect among nurses than non-nurses. Conclusions A brief video-based intervention increased treatment-seeking intention, possibly through identification and emotional engagement with the video protagonist. A booster video magnified that effect. This easily disseminated intervention could increase the likelihood of seeking care and offer employers a proactive approach to encourage employees to search for help if needed.

Findings The levels of B-cell cfDNA after the primary dose correlated with development of neutralizing antibodies and memory B-cells after the booster, revealing a link between early B-cell turnover - potentially reflecting affinity maturation C and later development of effective humoral response. We also observed co-elevation of B-cell, T-cell and monocyte cfDNA after the booster, underscoring the involvement of innate immune cell turnover in the development of humoral and cellular adaptive immunity. Actual cell counts remained largely stable following vaccination, other than a previously demonstrated temporary reduction in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts.

In face-to-face learning, the students go to a specific classroom where the hardware is available. However, laboratories are one of the challenges of distance education, due to the impossibility of the students attending classes at a certain place. This is especially relevant since the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to the increase of students enrolled in distance education. Different approaches to tackle this problem have been adopted, ranging from mixed models where lectures are online but physical attendance to laboratories is required to purely virtual models where virtual worlds or augmented reality have been used to simulate the real hardware. This paper presents the case of study of a flexible laboratory for the use of Arduino in a Computer Technology course with 153 students, geographically distributed in Spain and Latin America. The goal of the case study is to study the impact of such a flexible laboratory in the course, based on four fundamental parameters: student access to the online lectures, participation in the course and marks obtained, and satisfaction surveys. The results show that students have increased their marks by 28.8% and their class attendance by 247.18%, doing more elaborate and complex work than in previous courses. Therefore, it is considered that they have satisfactorily integrated the knowledge acquired during the subject, and the projects with Arduino in Computer Technology have an impact on the flexibility and personalization of the education, motivate students and increase its educational productivity and effect on the quality of education, influencing the learning experience.","output":"Case of Study in Online Course of Computer Engineering during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the COVID-19 virus was met by a strict lockdown in many countries around the world, with the closure of all physical activity (PA) facilities and limitations on moving around freely.

Reducing the proportion of young adults who get sunburned may reduce the incidence of melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer. Advances in technology have enabled the delivery of real-time UV light exposure and content-relevant health interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the feasibility of young adults performing the following tasks daily: wearing a UV dosimeter, receiving text messages and real-time UV-B doses on their smartphone, and responding to daily web-based surveys about sunburn and sun protection. METHODS: Young adults aged 18-39 years (n=42) were recruited in the United States in June 2020 via social media. Participants received the UV Guard sun protection system, which consisted of a UV dosimeter and a smartphone app. During 3 consecutive periods, intervention intensity increased as follows: real-time UV-B dose; UV-B dose and daily behavioral facilitation text messages; and UV-B dose, goal setting, and daily text messages to support self-efficacy and self-regulation. Data were self-reported through daily web-based surveys for 28 days, and UV-B doses were transmitted to cloud-based storage. RESULTS: Patients median age was 22 years (IQR 20, 29), and all patients had sun-sensitive skin. Sunburns were experienced during the study by fewer subjects (n=18) than those in the preceding 28 days (n=30). In July and August, the face was the most commonly sunburned area among 13 body locations; 52% (22/42) of sunburns occurred before the study and 45% (19/42) occurred during the study. The mean daily UV-B dose decreased during the 3 periods; however, this was not statistically significant. Young adults were most often exercising outdoors from 2 to 6 PM, walking from 10 AM to 6 PM, and relaxing from noon to 2 PM. Sunburn was most often experienced during exercise (odds ratio [OR] 5.65, 95% CI 1.60-6.10) and relaxation (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.03-4.67) relative to those that did not exercise or relax in each category. The self-reported exit survey indicated that participants felt that they spent less time outdoors this summer compared to the last summer because of the COVID-19 pandemic and work. In addition, 38% (16/42) of the participants changed their use of sun protection based on their app-reported UV exposure, and 48% (20/42) shifted the time they went outside to periods with less-intense UV exposure. A total of 79% (33/42) of the participants were willing to continue using the UV Guard system outside of a research setting. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept research, young adults demonstrated that they used the UV Guard system; however, optimization was needed. Although some sun protection behaviors changed, sunburn was not prevented in all participants, especially during outdoor exercise.

In this study we evaluated the efficacy of NL-CVX1 against variants of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, including important viral variants of concern (VOC) such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. METHODS: The relative binding affinity of NL-CVX1 to the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein of VOC was measured using biolayer interferometry (Octet). A competitive ELISA measured the ability of NL-CVX1 to compete with hACE2 for binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein from the original strain and VOC. The activity of NL-CVX1 in preventing viral infection was assessed by evaluating the cytopathic effects (CPE) of SARS-CoV-2 in a transmembrane protease, serine 2-expressing Vero E6 cell line (Vero E6/TMPRSS2) and determining the viral load using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in infected cells. A K18hACE2 mouse model of SARS CoV-2 infection was used to study the dose-response of NL-CVX1 anti-viral activity in vivo. RESULTS: NL-CVX1 binds the RBD of different VOC of SARS-CoV-2 at low nanomolar concentrations (Fig 1; K(d) < 1-~5 nM). When competing with hACE2, NL-CVX1 achieved 100% inhibition against hACE2 binding to the RBD of different VOC with IC50s values ranging from 0.7-53 nM (Fig 2). NL-CVX1 neutralized the B.1.1.7 variant as efficiently as the original strain in Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells, with EC50 values of 16 nM and 101.2 nM, respectively (Fig 3). In mice, we found that a single intranasal dose of 100 g NL-CVX1 prevented clinically significant SARS-CoV-2 infection and protected mice from succumbing to infection. Results from additional in vitro and in vivo experiments to be conducted this summer will be presented. [Image: see text] Figure 1.

The COVID-19 outbreak is considered a pandemic and has created a number of challenges for the general population, patients, and healthcare professionals. Lockdowns have been implemented to slow down the spread of the virus with the expectation that these restrictions will limit the number of cases, and hence the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions. However, these restrictions, and in particular lockdowns, impact on the life of everyone living in Ireland. AIM: To record how the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictive measures impacted on peoples activities, work, schooling, and childcare. METHODS: The Corona Citizens Science Project was set up as a population-wide survey. A questionnaire was designed, and the survey was first launched on the 8th of April 2020. An overview of results was released in the press days later. Data was collected in four waves: April 8, April 22, May 6, and June 17, 2020. Each wave had core questions allowing to compare each wave, and wave-specific questions, to understand current impact of changing measures. RESULTS: Over four waves, 152,259 responses were collected. The mean age of respondents was 47 with about 10% over the age of 65. Around 75% were female and 85% had a higher degree. Nearly 70% of the respondents were in employment, and around 13% were retired. Up to 20% of the respondents were essential workers, and 10% of respondents indicated they were in receipt of the COVID-19 pandemic unemployment payment. Around 10% of the people who responded were living alone. The number of people talked to the previous day was on average 2.3 in the first survey; during the lockdown, this went up over time, and in the last survey, the mean was 3.9. The percentage of respondents who did not talk to anyone the previous day decreased from 40 to 22% over the waves. In the first wave, about 6% of respondents reported having had flu-like symptoms in the last 14 days, which declined to 3.3%, 2.5%, and 2.0% in waves 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Similarly, over the four waves, the respondents who indicated that someone they lived with had flu-like symptoms declined from 17 to 12%, 9%, and 11%. Throughout the four waves, nearly one third of people reported one or more underlying conditions. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of restrictive measures, in particular lockdown, were implemented in Ireland to protect populations and healthcare systems. To record some of the major impacts on society, we launched a Corona Citizens Science Project, with the aim to support decision-making. This report provides detail of its findings.","output":"Corona citizens science project-repeated surveys of the Irish response to COVID-19 and subsequent lockdown and restrictive measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HLA sequence-based DNA typing (SBT) by long-range PCR amplification (LR PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a high-throughput DNA sequencing method (LR-NGS-SBT) for the efficient and sensitive detection of novel and null HLA alleles to the field-4 level of allelic resolution without phase ambiguity. However, the accuracy and reliability of the HLA typing results using buccal cells (BCs) and saliva as genetic source materials for the LR-NGS-SBT method are dependent largely on the quality of the extracted genomic DNA (gDNA) because a large degree of gDNA fragmentation can result in insufficient PCR amplification with the incorrect assignment of HLA alleles due to allele dropouts. In this study, we developed a new cost-efficient swab storage gel (SSG) for wet swab collection of BCs (BC-SSG) and evaluated its usefulness by performing different DNA analytical parameters including LR-NGS-SBT to compare the quality and quantity of gDNA extracted from BCs (in SSG or air dried), blood and saliva of 30 subjects. The BC-SSG samples after 5 days of storage revealed qualitative and quantitative DNA values equivalent to that of blood and/or saliva and better than swabs that were only air-dried (BC-nSSG). Moreover, all the gDNA extracted from blood, saliva and BC-SSG samples were HLA-typed successfully to an equivalent total of 408 alleles for each sample type. Therefore, the application of BC-SSG collection media for LR-NGS-SBT has benefits over BC dried samples (dry swabs) such as reducing retesting and the number of untestable BC samples due to insufficient DNA amplification.

Despite the complex task of isolating and characterizing novel natural products, microbial genomic strategies can be useful for carrying out these types of studies. However, although genomic-based research on secondary metabolism is on the increase, there is still a lack of reports focusing specifically on the genus Pseudomonas . In this work, we aimed (i) to unveil the main biosynthetic systems related to secondary metabolism in Pseudomonas type strains, (ii) to study the evolutionary processes that drive the diversification of their coding regions and (iii) to select Pseudomonas strains showing promising results in the search for useful natural products. We performed a comparative genomic study on 194 Pseudomonas species, paying special attention to the evolution and distribution of different classes of biosynthetic gene clusters and the coding features of antimicrobial peptides. Using EvoMining, a bioinformatic approach for studying evolutionary processes related to secondary metabolism, we sought to decipher the protein expansion of enzymes related to the lipid metabolism, which may have evolved toward the biosynthesis of novel secondary metabolites in Pseudomonas . The types of metabolites encoded in Pseudomonas type strains were predominantly non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, bacteriocins, N-acetylglutaminylglutamine amides and ?-lactones. Also, the evolution of genes related to secondary metabolites was found to coincide with Pseudomonas species diversification. Interestingly, only a few Pseudomonas species encode polyketide synthases, which are related to the lipid metabolism broadly distributed among bacteria. Thus, our EvoMining-based search may help to discover new types of secondary metabolite gene clusters in which lipid-related enzymes are involved. This work provides information about uncharacterized metabolites produced by Pseudomonas type strains, whose gene clusters have evolved in a species-specific way. Our results provide novel insight into the secondary metabolism of Pseudomonas and will serve as a basis for the prioritization of the isolated strains.

Serious and life threatening COVID-19 are defined as per published literature (please, refer to the full protocol, Additional file 1). The rationale is that TPE can remove interleukins-3, 6, 8, 10, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Thus, it may reduce the cytokine release syndrome associated with fulminant COVID-19 disease. TRIAL DESIGN: Pilot, interventional, open-label, randomized controlled multicenter trial. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria are: 1) age  18 years old; 2) intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission; 3) serious and/or life-threatening COVID-19 (please, refer to the full protocol, Additional file 1). SARS-CoV-2 infection is confirmed by Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR) assays using QuantiNova Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) in a Light-Cycler 480 real-time PCR system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Exclusion criteria are: 1) previous allergic reaction to plasma exchange or its ingredients (i.e., sodium citrate), 2) two consecutive negative RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 at least 24 hours apart, 3) mild COVID-19 not requiring ICU admission and 4) terminally ill patients receiving palliative care. The primary site will be King Saud Medical City (KSMC), Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Also, the study will run in ICUs (Ministry of Health Cluster 1; Riyadh) and other centers in KSA pending their institutional review board (IRB) approval. INTERVENTIONS AND COMPARATOR: The intervention group will receive TPE, plus empiric treatment for COVID-19. TPE is administered using the Spectra Optia TM Apheresis System equipped with the Depuro D2000 Adsorption Cartridge (Terumo BCT Inc., USA). The first dose is 1.5 plasma volumes, followed by one plasma volume on alternate days or daily for five to seven total treatments. Spectra Optia TM Apheresis System operates with acid-citrate dextrose anticoagulant (ACDA) as per Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2019 guidelines. Plasma is replaced with albumin 5% or fresh frozen plasma in patients with coagulopathy (prothrombin time >37 seconds; international normalized ratio >3; activated partial thromboplastin time >100 or fibrinogen level <100 mg/d). TPE sessions are performed daily over four hours and laboratory markers measured daily. The comparators are controls not receiving TPE but usual empiric treatment for COVID-19 as per institutional, national and international recommendations. Both groups will receive standard ICU supportive care. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary study end-point is 28-day mortality and safety of TPE in serious and/or life-threatening COVID-19. Safety will be evaluated by the documentation of any pertinent adverse and/or serious adverse effects related to TPE as per institutional, national and international (Food and Drug Administration) guidelines. Secondary outcomes are: i) improvement in Sequential Organ Function Assessment (SOFA) score ; ii) changes in inflammatory markers: serum C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, d-dimers and interleukin-6; iii) days on mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. RANDOMIZATION: Eligible consented patients are randomized (1:1 allocation) after stratification by ICU center and two PaO2/FIO2 ratio categories (> 150 and  150). Randomization occurs in variable block sizes of four to eight patients. A web-based randomization service, randomize.net, is used to allocate patients to their respective strata prior to the intervention or control therapy. BLINDING (MASKING): Given the visibility of TPE machinery, the intervention will be unblinded; hence, no enrollment concealment will be expedited. The lack of allocation concealment will be mitigated by several measures (please, refer to the full protocol, Additional file 1). NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): This pilot randomized trial aims to recruit a convenience sample of patients with serious and/or life-threatening COVID-19. Therefore, at least 20 patients are to be randomized to each group per participating center. We are hoping to consent and randomize approximately 60 patients in each group over a 3 to 6 months period giving a total of 120 participants. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol version 1 was approved 29/04/2020. Recruitment is ongoing, and began on 01/05/2020. We estimate completion by 29/10/2020.

METHODS Initial chest radiographs of 79 patients, 15 to 69 years old (mean age 34.1 years, 40 men and 39 women), were retrospectively reviewed in the study. For all patients, average temperature was 38.8 degrees C and mean time from onset of the fever to the time of initial radiographs taken was 5.8 days. Location, abnormal distribution, appearance of lung abnormalities, effusion of pericadiaum and pleura, and lymphadenopathy were observed. Abnormal distribution and associated findings were compared. Differences of mean age, temperature, and the time were statistically analyzed between patients with and without abnormal findings. RESULTS Initial chest radiographs were normal in 36 of 79 patients (45.5%). Abnormal radiographs in 43 patients (81.3%) showed exudative changes. No significant difference of mean age and day (form onset of the fever to the time of initial radiographs taken) was found between the patients with and without abnormal initial chest radiographs (P > 0.05). No lymphadenopathy, effusion of pericadiaum and pleura were found on the initial chest radiographs. CONCLUSIONS The main abnormal radiographic appearance of lung in patients with SARS is exudative changes.

METHODS: We obtained 155 samples of posteroanterior chest X-ray images from COVID-19 open dataset repositories to develop a classification model using a simple convolutional neural network (CNN). All of the images contained diagnostic information for COVID-19 and other diseases. The model would classify whether a patient was infected with COVID-19 or not. Eighty percent of the images were used for model training, and the rest were used for testing. The graphic user interface-based programming in the KNIME enabled class label annotation, data preprocessing, CNN model training and testing, performance evaluation, and so on. RESULTS: 1,000 epochs training were performed to test the simple CNN model. The lower and upper bounds of positive predictive value (precision), sensitivity (recall), specificity, and f-measure are 92.3% and 94.4%.

In total, 44 ecological factors from canopy, understory and soil were determined. We constructed the related network of reforestation ecosystems, quantified the structure of ecosystem through network topology, and explored the relationships between structure and functions. The results showed that changes in plantation type altered the network hubs, but some nodes, such as species height, breast-height diameter and understory biomass, were often keystone hubs. Mixed plantations enhanced the connectivity among different modules. In addition, we found that closeness of network connectivity was an important factor influencing ecological functions, while soil erodibility was the main limiting factor for reforestation ecosystem structure in this region. Moreover, mixed plantations tended to have more balanced topological metrics and ecological functions. Overall, this study suggests that mixed plantations or monoculture plantations should be designed according to the characteristics and ecological demands of the regional ecological environment.

Despite this fact, a subgroup of individuals affected by COVID-19 is at greater risk of developing worse outcomes and experience a high rate of mortality. Data on the association between obesity and COVID-19 are growing; the available studies, have reported a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in patients experiencing a severe COVID-19 course, with serious complications requiring hospitalization and admission to intensive care units. This paper attempts to highlight potential mechanisms behind the greater vulnerability to COVID-19 of individuals with obesity. The presence of uncontrolled chronic obesity-related comorbidities, particularly pulmonary diseases, can present a primary fertile soil for respiratory tract infection. Combined with immune system impairments, such as alteration in the T-cell proliferation and macrophage differentiation, and the high pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the adipose organ, this may worsen the general condition toward a systemic diffusion of infection. Prevention remains the first line of intervention in these patients that can be achieved by adhering to social distancing and adopting hygiene precautions, combined with a healthy lifestyle. Patients with obesity require preferential access dedicated to primary care services to ensure they are regularly taking their medications for the treatment of any concurrent chronic diseases. Finally, their physicians must promptly manage any medical signs or symptoms in the case of suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) infection to prevent the risk of severe outcomes.","output":"Obesity and Higher Risk for Severe Complications of Covid-19: What to do when the two pandemics meet."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID19 complications cause inflammatory storm. Colchicine is a potent anti-inflammatory medication that has been proposed as a possible treatment option for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: to assess effectiveness and safety of add on use of colchicine to the standard treatment in moderate and severe COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled open label clinical trial, 160 patients hospitalized equally divided between moderate and severe COVID19 categories were randomized to 4 study groups in a 1:1:1:1 allocation (n = 40 for each group) according to type of treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive the standard treatment for 14 days (control group) or colchicine add on to the standard treatment 1 mg daily orally for 7 days then 0.5 mg daily for another 7 days. Survival rate, time to cure in days, and side effects were assessed. RESULTS: Colchicine add on treatment was associated with a significantly shorter time to cure (referring to start of first symptom) by an average of 5 days in severe disease and 2 days in moderate disease (log-rank P=<0.001). In addition, the Colchicine add on significantly increased the risk of cure per unit of time by 2.69 times compared to controls after adjusting for disease severity, age, and time since the start of the disease to start of treatment. A severe COVID19 disease, a longer time for starting treatment, and the older age notably reduced the risk of cure (HR = 0.72, p = 0.07; HR = 0.74, p < 0.001; and HR = 0.59, p = 0.015 respectively).

Wellness can relate to many areas or domains in our lives such as financial, social, spiritual, physical, and occupational, whereas well-being is career focused. Wellness is multidimensional and encompasses different domains, and well-being usually focuses on a singular domain. Literature supports the study of well-being in health care workers; however, research is limited for assessing wellness in different domains of health care workers. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to describe perceived pharmacy resident wellness during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: A 67-item survey was sent by e-mail to eligible study participants, including any postgraduate year (PGY) 1, 2, or 24-month pharmacy resident completing/completed their training in June 2019-July 2020. The primary outcome was perceived resident wellness based on the 7 domains from Princeton UMatter Wellness Self-Assessment, developed to measure self-perceptions of wellness across dimensions. Descriptive statistics and participant scores were aggregated and presented as a total domain score. Statistics and scores were determined from completed surveys. RESULTS: A total of 418 participants accessed the survey, 384 met inclusion criteria, and 326 completed the survey. Of the participants, 77% were female with 85% completing a traditional PGY-1 residency program. The wellness domain with the lowest total was physical wellness, with a domain median of 23 of 28.

However, there are growing discussions as to its role postpandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We surveyed patients, radiation oncology (RO) attendings, and RO residents to assess their experience with telemedicine. Surveys addressed quality of patient care and utility of telemedicine for teaching and learning core competencies. Satisfaction was rated on a 6-point Likert-type scale. The quality of teaching and learning was graded on a 5-point Likert-type scale, with overall scores calculated by the average rating of each core competency required by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (range, 1-5). RESULTS: Responses were collected from 56 patients, 12 RO attendings, and 13 RO residents. Patient feedback was collected at 17 new-patient, 22 on-treatment, and 17 follow-up video visits. Overall, 88% of patients were satisfied with virtual visits. A lower proportion of on-treatment patients rated their virtual visit as very satisfactory (68.2% vs 76.5% for new patients and 82.4% for follow-ups). Only 5.9% of the new patients and none of the follow-up patients were dissatisfied, and 27% of on-treatment patients were dissatisfied. The large majority of patients (88%) indicated that they would continue to use virtual visits as long as a physical examination was not needed. Overall scores for medical training were 4.1 out of 5 (range, 2.8-5.0) by RO residents and 3.2 (range, 2.0-4.0) by RO attendings. All residents and 92% of attendings indicated they would use telemedicine again; however, most indicated that telemedicine is best for follow-up visits.

Many serology and molecular tests have received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but they have not yet been independently verified. There are three main types of diagnostic tests available: (1) imaging studies, (2) molecular tests, and (3) serology tests. Imaging studies reveal bilateral lower lobe pneumonia and ground-glass opacities that are suggestive of disease. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction identifies specific segments of viral RNA, indicating the active presence of the virus in the test subject, which is most useful for elective surgery screening. Finally, serology studies detect the presence of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies to the virus, indicating a current or past infection.

Weak but positive correlations were found between PA and the QOL domains: physical health (0.16. 95% CI 0.11 0.22; I(2) = 99.96%); mental health (0.14; 95% CI 0.07C0.20; I(2) = 99.97%); social relations (0.24, 95% CI 0.08C0. 38; I(2) = 99.99%); environment (0.23, 95% CI 0.14C0.32; I(2) = 99.90%); vitality (0.17. 95% CI 0.15C0.20; I(2) = 99.49%) pain (0.02. 95% CI ? 0.02 to 0.12; I(2) = 99.96%); QOL and PA (0.21, 95% CI 0.08C0.34; I(2) = 99.99%).An association of R = 0.60 (95% CI 0.25C0.95; I(2) = 85.61%) was found between QOL and PA in total. CONCLUSION: The results of our study showed a weak but positive relationship between physical activity and overall quality of life in college students, and also between PA and the domains of QL: physical health, social relationships, mental health, environment, and vitality, in this same population. It is important to study this population, since risk behaviors in this phase tend to perpetuate in the other phases of life.","output":"Physical activity and quality of life among college students without comorbidities for cardiometabolic diseases: systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused feelings of anxiety, confusion, and panic among the world population. Due to these psychological changes resulting from the stress produced by the disease, we sought to investigate the psychological impact of the pandemic on the university student community. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 1,283 students were surveyed, of which 1,149 students were selected. The majority of the subjects were female, and the overall average age was of 20 years. They were provided with an 82-question online questionnaire divided into four sections; looking for the prevalence of significant symptomatology of major depression and generalised anxiety using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales; and factors that potentially affect the mental health of our university population. RESULTS: We found a high prevalence of significant depression (47.08%) and anxiety (27.06%) symptomatology, considering a score of 10 or more as cut-off point. There was no significant difference in depression and anxiety symptomatology between the health-care students and non-health-care students. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, together with what is observed in the literature, allow us to conclude that the college student population has a high risk of mental illness, and these should be taken into consideration for the search of effective strategies for detection and control of mental health illnesses. Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 pandemic is a red flag that shows the need to upgrade mental health programmes in universities and to validate virtual instruments.","output":"Psychosocial impact on health-related and non-health related university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: This was a prospective randomized controlled noninferiority study. Thirty participants were randomized among 3 groups to detect a noninferiority margin set at 10% of the mean improvement in expected total FLS scores. Group 1 received \\"standard\\" in-person expert instruction. Group 2 received similar training administered via the MVR platform. Group 3 (control) practised on their own, with no feedback. All participants were tested for baseline performance, then immediately after training, and 1 month later. Groups were compared using ordinary 1-way analysis of variance. Results: MVR was noninferior to the standard in-person training group for total FLS times on both immediate (p = 0.632) and delayed post-testing (p = 0.829). Performance was also identical between MVR and standard training groups for each FLS task. All 3 groups improved from baseline after training. Greater improvements were observed in the standard and MVR arms than in controls for all tasks except for peg transfer and pattern cut, which did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: This randomized controlled trial provides validity evidence for the use of an MVR platform as a noninferior alternative to in-person instruction for initial FLS instruction, forming the foundation for future work on remote training and collaboration.","output":"Merged virtual reality teaching of the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery: a randomized controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We sequenced the 29,751-base genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus known as the Tor2 isolate.

We hypothesize that a measure three times the length of the middle finger can be used for predicting tracheal tube depth in children. METHODS Eighty-six children (4-14 years of age) were included in this study. After the children were anesthetized, a fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) was inserted into the trachea, the lengths from the upper incisor teeth to carina and vocal cords were measured, and a suitably sized cuffed tracheal tube was inserted into the trachea. Age-based and middle finger length-based formulas were used to determine the tracheal intubation depth. RESULTS All 86 children enrolled were included in this study. Compared with the age-based intubation, the rate of appropriate tube placement was higher for middle finger length-based intubation (88.37% vs 66.28%, P = 0.001). The proximal intubation rate was lower in middle finger length-based intubation (4.65% vs 32.56%, P < 0.001). There was only weak evidence for a difference in the distal intubation rate between the two methods (6.97% vs 1.16%, P = 0.054). The correlation coefficient between middle finger length and optimal tracheal tube depth was larger than that between age and optimal tracheal tube depth (0.883 vs 0.845).

Diversion of health care resources for containing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly undermined the accessibility and availability of essential health services. Under these circumstances, the preparedness of PHCs in providing safe patient-centered care and meeting the current health needs of the population while preventing further transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is crucial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the primary health care facility preparedness toward the provision of safe outpatient services during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among supervisors and managers of primary health care facilities attached to medical colleges and institutions in India. A list of 60 faculties involved in the management and supervision of PHCs affiliated with the community medicine departments of medical colleges and institutes across India was compiled from an accessible private organization member database. We collected the data through a rapid survey from April 24 to 30, 2020, using a Google Forms online digital questionnaire that evaluated preparedness parameters based on self-assessment by the participants. The preparedness domains assessed were infrastructure availability, health worker safety, and patient care. RESULTS: A total of 51 faculties responded to the survey. Each medical college and institution had on average a total of 2.94 (SD 1.7) PHCs under its jurisdiction. Infrastructural and infection control deficits at the PHC were reported in terms of limited physical space and queuing capacity, lack of separate entry and exit gates (n=25, 49%), inadequate ventilation (n=29, 57%), and negligible airborne infection control measures (n=38, 75.5%). N95 masks were available at 26 (50.9%) sites. Infection prevention and control measures were also suboptimal with inadequate facilities for handwashing and hand hygiene reported in 23.5% (n=12) and 27.4% (n=14) of sites, respectively. The operation of outpatient services, particularly related to maternal and child health, was significantly disrupted (P<.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Existing PHC facilities in India providing outpatient services are constrained in their functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic due to weak infrastructure contributing to suboptimal patient safety and infection control measures. Furthermore, there is a need for effective planning, communication, and coordination between the centralized health policy makers and health managers working at primary health care facilities to ensure overall preparedness during public health emergencies.","output":"Primary Health Care Facility Preparedness for Outpatient Service Provision During the COVID-19 Pandemic in India: Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has exacerbated staffing challenges already facing critical care nurses in intensive care units.

METHODS: We modified workflows, deployed home workstations, and changed staffing models with the goal of providing additional clinical support to bedside colleagues while reducing exposure time and conserving personal protective equipment for those caring for this highly contagious patient population. The unit changed focus and granted more than 300 clinicians access to technology that enabled them to care for patients remotely, added nearly 200 mobile carts, and allowed more than 20 tele-intensive care unit nurses to work from home. RESULTS: Tele-intensive care unit nursing provided clinical knowledge to the nurses covering current and expanded critical care units. Using technology, virtual rounding, and increased collaboration with nurses, tele-intensive care unit nursing minimized the risk to bedside nurses while maintaining a high level of care for patients.

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of the radiation dose to the gastric fundus on the risk of postoperative anastomotic leakage in patients undergoing nCRT followed by transthoracic esophagectomy. METHODS Between January 2012 and July 2015, 97 consecutive patients who underwent nCRT followed by transthoracic esophagectomy were included in this single-center cohort study. The gastric fundus was contoured on the pretreatment planning computed tomography. Within this contour, dose-volume histogram variables were calculated, and logistic regression analysis was used to determine their influence on the risk of anastomotic leakage. RESULTS In 25 of 97 patients (26%) anastomotic leakage occurred. The mean radiation dose to the gastric fundus was significantly higher in patients with than without leakage (median 35.6 Gy versus 24.9 Gy, respectively, p = 0.047). A mean dose more than versus less than 31.4 Gy was associated with leakage rates of 43% versus 15%, respectively. Adjusted for tumor location, clinical T stage, and radiation method, the mean radiation dose to the gastric fundus remained significantly and independently associated with an increased risk of anastomotic leakage (adjusted odds ratio 1.05 per 1-Gy increase, 95% confidence interval: 1.002 to 1.10, p = 0.043).

Here, we report a unique mode of cell migration elicited by the lability of integrin ligands. We found that stationary cells spontaneously turn migratory on substrates where integrin ligands are subject to depletion by cellular force. Using TGT, a rupturable molecular linker, we quantitatively tuned the rate of ligand rupture by cellular force and tested platelets (anucleate cells), CHO-K1 cells (nucleated cells), and other cell types on TGT surfaces. These originally stationary cells readily turn motile on the uniform TGT surface, and their motility is correlated with the ligand depletion rate caused by cells. We named this new migration mode ligand-depleting (LD) migration. Through both experiments and simulations, we revealed the biophysical mechanism of LD migration. We found that the cells create and maintain a gradient of ligand surface density underneath the cell body by constantly rupturing local ligands, and the gradient in turn drives and guides cell migration. This is reminiscent of the phenomenon that some liquid droplets or solid beads can spontaneously move on homogeneous surfaces by chemically forming and maintaining a local gradient of surface energy. Here, we showed that cells, as living systems, can harness a similar mechanism to migrate. LD migration is beneficial for cells to maintain adhesion on ligand-labile surfaces, and might also play a role in the migration of cancer cells, immune cells, and platelets that deplete adhesive ligands of the matrix.","output":"Cell Migration Driven by Self-Generated Integrin Ligand Gradient on Ligand-Labile Surfaces."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen of the Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), is still devastating the world causing significant chaos to the international community and posing a significant threat to global health.

SETTING: This study was conducted at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH) situated in Johannesburg, South Africa. METHODS: This was a quantitative retrospective record review. All adult psychiatric inpatients who had undergone a CT and/or MRI scan during 01 January 2014 to 31 December 2015 were included. Out-patients or patients admitted in the medical wards were excluded from the study. All neuro-imaging referrals were identified from hospital records and their demographics, scan characteristics and diagnoses were subsequently captured. RESULTS: A total of 1040 patients were admitted to the CMJAH psychiatric unit, of which 213 (20.5%) underwent neuro-imaging tests. Of the 213 scans performed, 74 were abnormal, representing a yield of 34.7%. The most common reported pathology was atrophy (n = 22, 29.7%).

RESULTS: The pre-COVID and COVID cohorts included 73 and 87 patients, respectively. Seventy (44%) were female and median age at palatoplasty was 13.5 months for CP  cleft lip (CP  L) and 5.5 years for submucous cleft palate (SMCP). In patients with CP  L, TT were placed or in place and patent at palatoplasty in 28/38 (74%) pre-COVID and 37/50 (74%) during COVID (P = 0.97).

We sought to identify all potentially deleterious drug groups in COVID-19 and critically assess the underpinning strength of evidence pertaining to the harmful effects of these drugs. Methods and findingsWe performed a rapid systematic review, searching Medline, Embase and two COVID-19 portfolios (WHO COVID-19 database and NIH iSearch COVID-19 portfolio) for papers and preprints related to primary studies investigating drugs identified as potentially deleterious. Primary outcomes were direct measures of susceptibility to infection, disease severity and mortality. Study quality was assessed using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute quality assessment tools. Random-effects meta-analyses were used for data synthesis with further subgroup analyses where possible for specific outcome, study design, statistical adjustment and drug groups when two were combined. Sensitivity analyses were performed by removing any studies at high risk of bias and by publication status. 49 observational studies (15 peer-reviewed papers and 34 preprints) reported primary outcomes for eight drug groups hypothesised to be deleterious. Meta-analysis showed that acute inpatient corticosteroid use was associated with increased mortality (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.26-3.90), however this result appeared to have been biased by confounding via indication. One subgroup analysis indicated an association between immunosuppressant use and susceptibility to COVID-19 among case control and cross-sectional studies (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.19-1.40) but this was not found with cohort studies (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.86-1.43).

Furthermore, studies which combined these two drug groups in their analysis demonstrated an association with a lower mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55-0.85). ConclusionsWe found minimal high quality or consistent evidence that any drug groups increase susceptibility, severity or mortality in COVID-19. Converse to initial hypotheses, we found some evidence that regular use of ACEIs and ARBs prior to infection may be effective in reducing the level of care required, such as requiring intensive care, in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Deleterious drugs in COVID-19: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo: o objetivo deste estudo  discutir os nudges no contexto pandmico do SARS-CoV-2, retomando algumas reflex?es sobre a tica e revisando-as sob o novo cenrio imposto pela pandemia.

Theoretical approach: the theoretical framework of Behavioral Economics was the basis for nudges' analysis, while utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics were the classic moral theories used to reflect on ethical aspects. Methods: we undertook a literature review about nudges searched through the latest studies about this subject applied to COVID-19 mitigation. In the ethical discussion section, we used classical references to articulate the nudge theory with the following moral theories: utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics. Results: our findings indicate that the trend intervention during the pandemic is 'nudging messages' and 'increase people's commitment,' mainly to nudge people toward the desired behavior and increase policy adherence. Many experiments did not show significant results, and some drawbacks in policies' applications indicate that nudges might be revised in crisis scenarios, such as a pandemic outbreak. The ethical discussion section relates three moral theories that justify some of the nudge's aspects. Conclusions: this paper showed some flaws and inconsistencies in nudge theory and its application during the pandemic that can be solved by discussing ethical aspects. We suggest that connecting these problems with moral views might be a solution for some deadlocks found in the nudge theory.","output":"Nudge Policies in COVID-19 Context: A Necessary Action or Ethical Dilemma?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The transmission risk of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 virus infection is increased in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients, and also the disease causes much higher mortality than the normal population. The aim of this study is to define the predictive value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in terms of worse outcomes in MHD patients. METHODS A total of 123 MHD patients who had received inpatient care due to COVID-19 infection were included in this multicentered retrospective study. Receiver operating curve analysis were plotted to illustrate C reactive protein (C-rp), systemic inflammatory index (SII) and NLR best cut-off values for estimation of need for intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality. Multivariate regression analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to determine the association between C-rp, SII and NLR and mortality. RESULTS Twenty-eight (23%) patients with MHD were dead due to COVID-19. Nonsurvivor patients was significantly older than the survivors (p < 0.001) and also had higher rates of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.01) and coronary artery disease (p = 0.02). Cox regression analysis revealed that NLR >5.17 significantly associated with mortality [HR: 6.508, p < 0.001]. Similarly, SII > 726 [HR: 3.124, p = 0.006] and C-rp > 88 [HR: 4.590, p = 0.002] were significantly associated with mortality due to COVID-19 in hospitalized MHD patients. Multivarite logistic regression analysis showed that age older than 60 years, higher ferritin, and NLR > 5.17 were independent factors associated with mortality. CONCLUSION NLR had favorable predictive value than the C-rp and SII in terms of need for ICU and mortality in MHD patients. Determining the poor prognosis with simple and easily applicable markers may reduce mortality in these patients with early supportive treatments.","output":"Predictive value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in terms of need for intensive care unit and mortality in maintenance hemodialysis patients with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sensible and conflicting scenario of the pandemic postulated many challenges to societies around the world in 2020.

The MRV2 isolate infected neonatal piglets, in which it induced severe diarrhea, while the virus was detected in multiple organs of piglets. Moreover, the complete genome of an MRV2 isolate was obtained, which was a novel reassortant MRV strain of human MRV, porcine MRV, chamois MRV, bat MRV, and mink MRV based on the nucleotide identity and phylogenetic tree. The S1 gene of isolate had eight unique amino acid mutations compared with available MRV2 S1 in the GenBank. To investigate the prevalence of this MRV2, 78 samples of diarrhea feces were collected from 10 pig farms in seven regions of Sichuan province. The obtained results showed that the positive rate of samples was 14% (11/78), and positive rate of farms was 60% (6/10), while the amplified fragments shared the identical amino acid mutations with the isolated strain, thus suggesting that this MRV2 strain was already prevalent in Sichuan province.

We present patient and management characteristics, and outcomes for the entire cohort of adult (>18 years) COVID-19 patients admitted to Norwegian intensive care units (ICU) from 10 March to 19 June 2020. METHODS: Data were collected from The Norwegian intensive care and pandemic registry (NIPaR). Demographics, co-morbidities, management characteristics and outcomes are described. ICU length of stay (LOS) was analysed with linear regression, and associations between risk factors and mortality were quantified using Cox regression. RESULTS: In total, 217 patients were included. The male to female ratio was 3:1 and the median age was 63 years. A majority (70%) had one or more co-morbidities, most frequently cardiovascular disease (39%), chronic lung disease (22%), diabetes mellitus (20%), and obesity (17%). Most patients were admitted for acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF) (91%) and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) was used in 86%, prone ventilation in 38% and 25% of patients received a tracheostomy. Vasoactive drugs were used in 79% and renal replacement therapy in 15%. Median ICU LOS and time of MV was 14.0 and 12.0 days. At end of follow-up 45 patients (21%) were dead.

Methods In response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in mid-May 2021, Taipei City Hospital set up 12 citywide proactive community testing (PCT) stations for early identification of infected individuals from May 17 to June 20, 2021. Individuals with RAD positivity were isolated and later confirmed by RT-PCR. The c-statistic value was estimated to indicate the level of diagnostic accuracy of RAD tests. Results Of the 33,798 individuals who were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 4.4% tested positive for RAD. There was a moderate concordance (kappa = 0.67) between the RAD tests and RT-PCR assay for identifying infectious individuals. The c-statistic value of the RAD test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.8. There was a positive linear trend between the accuracy of the RAD tests and the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the study population ( = 0.04; p=0.03). As the cycle threshold value decreased, the sensitivity rate of the RAD tests increased (p<.001).

The purpose of this systematic review was to present an overview of the inflammatory response and the serum markers associated with hernia repair and to compare the response between patients treated with and without mesh. METHODS The review was conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines. The outcomes of interest were serum concentration of leukocytes, cytokines, and acute phase proteins before and after hernia repair with or without mesh reinforcement. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies of intervention. RESULTS A total of 31 studies were included in the systematic review including 1326 patients with a mean age ranging from 33 to 67 years. The studies predominantly included males (95.0% males, 5.0% female) with inguinal hernias (98.5% inguinal hernias, 1.5% incisional hernias). The inflammatory response after hernia repair was characterized by an increase in CRP, IL-6, leukocytes, neutrophils, IL-1, IL-10, fibrinogen, and 1-antitrypsin and a decrease in lymphocytes and albumin within the first 24 postoperative hours. The systemic inflammatory response was normalized before or on the seventh postoperative day. A higher CRP and IL-6 serum concentration was found in patients treated with mesh compared with sutured repairs. CONCLUSIONS Hernia repair elicits a systemic inflammatory response characterized by an increase in CRP, IL-6, leukocytes, neutrophils, IL-1, IL-10, fibrinogen, and 1-antitrypsin and a decrease in lymphocytes and albumin. A higher inflammatory response was found after mesh repair compared with non-mesh repair and after open mesh repair compared with laparoscopic mesh repair.","output":"Systemic inflammatory response after hernia repair: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spirituality has ascendant value during times of adversity.

RECENT FINDINGS: Orthopedic surgery is the surgical specialty that has seen the highest proportion of its procedures cancelled due to the pandemic. In this context and onward, telemedicine seems to be a reasonable option for the orthopedic surgeon. Multiple studies have described its safety and a similar patient satisfaction compared to in-person consultations. It has a potential to increase productivity and decrease wait times by providing easier access to the clinician and by decreasing travel-associated limitations and costs. Authors have described the possibility to conduct a reliable virtual assessment of the patient range of motion. Some of the limitations to the use of this technology are technological literacy and access to virtual consultation platforms, the inability to conduct a complete physical examination, potential reduction in identification of intimate and child abuse victims, and limited knowledge about the legal implications of this technology. Telemedicine in orthopedic surgery has a potential to increase productivity, reduce costs, and increase the access to healthcare. Identified limitations include risk of misdiagnosis, required technologic literacy, unknown legal implications, and failure to identify victims of abuse. In order to use this technology judiciously, the clinician must take into consideration the patient's condition and his technological literacy and be aware of the advantages and disadvantages.","output":"Orthopedic Surgery and Telemedicine in Times of COVID-19 and Beyond: a Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Garden-based learning promotes environmental awareness, health, and wellness across the school community and beyond.

In this study, the social behavior and psychological abnormalities which was defined as the positive of any dimension were investigated in multiple dimensions during long-term home-schooling. The influencing factors of psycho-behavioral problems were analyzed by Logistic regression, and the confounding factors were corrected with graded multivariable adjustment. Results: A total of 6 906 valid questionnaires were collected including 3 592 boys and 3 314 girls, of whom 3 626 were children (6-11 years old) and 3 280 were adolescents (12-16 years old). The positive detection rate of psychosocial-behavioral problems were 13.0% (900/6 906) totally, 9.6% (344/3 592) in boys and 16.8% (556/3 314) in girls respectively, and 7.3%(142/1 946) in boys aged 6-11, 14.0%(235/1 680) in girls aged 6-11, 12.3%(202/1 646) in boys aged 12-16, 19.6%(321/1 634) in girls aged 12-16 respectively. There were significant differences between the psychological problems group and the non-psychological problems group in gender, parent-offspring conflict, number of close friends, family income change, sedentary time, homework time, screen exposure time, physical activity, dietary problems (2=78.851, 285.264, 52.839, 26.284, 22.778, 11.024, 10.688, 36.814, 70.982, all P<0.01).

We fabricated tubes of fibroblast-derived collagenous matrix that have been shown to regenerate and grow as a pulmonary artery replacement in lambs and implemented a design for a valved conduit consisting of three tubes sewn together. Seven lambs were implanted with tri-tube valved conduits in sequential cohorts and compared to bioprosthetic conduits. Valves implanted into the pulmonary artery of two lambs of the first cohort of four animals functioned with mild regurgitation and systolic pressure drops <10 mmHg up to 52 weeks after implantation, during which the valve diameter increased from 19 mm to a physiologically normal ~25 mm. In a second cohort, the valve design was modified to include an additional tube, creating a sleeve around the tri-tube valve to counteract faster root growth relative to the leaflets. Two valves exhibited trivial-to-mild regurgitation at 52 weeks with similar diameter increases to ~25 mm and systolic pressure drops of <5 mmHg, whereas the third valve showed similar findings until moderate regurgitation was observed at 52 weeks, correlating to hyperincrease in the valve diameter. In all explanted valves, the leaflets contained interstitial cells and an endothelium progressing from the base of the leaflets and remained thin and pliable with sparse, punctate microcalcifications. The tri-tube valves demonstrated reduced calcification and improved hemodynamic function compared to clinically used pediatric bioprosthetic valves tested in the same model.

Lung features described in COVID-19 include B-lines (ring-down artifacts appearing in the presence of interstitial lung fluid), thickened and irregular pleural line, subpleural consolidations and effusions. Computer-aided interpretation can be incorporated into POCUS platforms to provide objective data and improve interpretations by novices. We sought to test a commercially available B-Lines counting feature previously developed using non-COVID data, on patients suspected of COVID-19. This first step would allow expansion to automated B-line scoring and further lung feature detection, to create an intelligent POCUS system with comprehensive set of lung ultrasound features for COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This was a prospective observational study at a single academic medical center. Subjects presenting to the emergency department with shortness of breath and suspected COVID-19 were enrolled. The Philips Lumify TM ultrasound system with sector or linear transducer was used to obtain 6-second clips of 14 lung zones (upper and lower, right and left anterior, lateral and posterior). Right and left anterior upper zone clips were also obtained with a second probe type. Repeat examinations with data collection were performed on days 3, 5, 7 or 12+/- 1 day for admitted patients. All clips with 2 or more B-lines were included (N=80), as well as a random selection of 70 clips with 1 or fewer B-lines. B-line count for inclusion was based on visual rating by two researchers with POCUS training. A POCUS fellowship trained emergency physician visually assessed each clip frame and counted the maximum number of B-lines per clip. This was compared to automatic counts by the commercially available Lumify TM Lung B-lines Quantification software by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cohens weighted kappa. Results: Of the 899 total clips,150 clips from 30 unique subjects and 44 overall exams were used for analysis, with 100 clips from patients with confirmed COVID by PCR. The average maximum B-line count by algorithm was 1.52 +/- 1.24, and that by expert was 1.60 +/- 1.35 (ns). The ICC between algorithm and expert was 0.87 (95% CI 0.83-0.91), with a weighted kappa of 0.64 (95% CI 0.48-0.81), indicating substantial agreement. Average of maximum B-line counts, ICC and weighted kappa between algorithm and expert were comparable for COVID+ and COVID- subgroups as well as between transducer types.

This study provides a definition for IH, a diagnosing algorithm, and information on several factors influencing IH formation. METHOD Baseline characteristics, laboratory findings, imaging studies, operative findings, and follow up data of 1583 patients that underwent LRYGB at our bariatric facility between 2007 and 2013 were recorded. Follow up varied between 3 and 76 months, and 85 % of the data was available for analysis at 12 months. Our surgical technique was standardized. Intermesenteric spaces were not closed until July 2012, where after they were closed. To facilitate comparison, IH cases were matched with controls. RESULTS Forty patients (2.5 %) had an IH during re-laparoscopy. The modal clinical presentation is acute onset epigastric discomfort, often crampy/colicky in nature. Additional examinations included laboratory testing, abdominal X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, and abdominal CT scanning. Patients who developed an IH lost a significantly higher percentage of their total body weight than their matched controls at every time point. IH incidence was higher in the non-closure group than the closure group. CONCLUSION The large variation in reported IH incidence is due to the large variation in IH definition. To gain more uniformity in reporting IH prevalence, we propose the use of the AMSTERDAM classification. Post-LRYGB patients with acute onset crampy/colicky epigastric pain should undergo abdominal ultrasound to rule out gallbladder pathology and offered re-laparoscopy with a low threshold. IH incidence is highest among patients with rapid weight loss and non-closure of intermesenteric defects.","output":"Internal Herniation After Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery: Pitfalls in Diagnosing and the Introduction of the AMSTERDAM Classification."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe world is going through the critical phase of COVID-19 pandemic, caused by human coronavirus, SARS-CoV2. Worldwide concerted effort to identify viral genomic changes across different sub-types has identified several strong changes in the coding region. However, there have not been many studies focusing on the variations in the 5 and 3 untranslated regions and their consequences. Considering the possible importance of these regions in host mediated regulation of viral RNA genome, we wanted to explore the phenomenon. MethodsTo have an idea of the global changes in 5 and 3-UTR sequences, we downloaded 8595 complete and high-coverage SARS-CoV2 genome sequence information from human host in FASTA format from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from 15 different geographical regions. Next, we aligned them using Clustal Omega software and investigated the UTR variants. We also looked at the putative host RNA binding protein (RBP) and microRNA binding sites in these regions by RBPmap and RNA22 v2 respectively. Expression status of selected RBPs and microRNAs were checked in lungs tissue. ResultsWe identified 28 unique variants in SARS-CoV2 UTR region based on a minimum variant percentage cut-off of 0.5. Along with 241C>T change the important 5-UTR change identified was 187A>G, while 29734G>C, 29742G>A/T and 29774C>T were the most familiar variants of 3UTR among most of the continents. Furthermore, we found that despite of the variations in the UTR regions, binding of host RBP to them remains mostly unaltered, which further influenced the functioning of specific miRNAs. ConclusionOur results, shows for the first time in SARS-Cov2 infection, a possible cross-talk between host RBPs-miRNAs and viral UTR variants, which ultimately could explain the mechanism of escaping host RNA decay machinery by the virus. The knowledge might be helpful in developing anti-viral compounds in future.","output":"Global cataloguing of variations in untranslated regions of viral genome and prediction of key host RNA binding protein-microRNA interactions modulating genome stability in SARS-CoV2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the number of people living with dementia grows, so does the need to provide them with adequate psychosocial support.

This study aims to test the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial of community singing in dementia, to pave the way for a larger, conclusive study. METHODS: The PRESIDE study is designed as a two-arm, parallel-group randomised trial with a waiting list control. Dyads consisting of a person with dementia (n = 80) and their carer (n = 80) will be recruited. Each dyad will be randomised either to attend 10 weeks of community group singing sessions straight away or to wait for 3 months before attending the sessions. The singing sessions will be led by experienced professional musicians and will last about 90 min, including time for socialising. The primary outcome of this study is the attainment of feasibility criteria around recruitment, retention and the acceptability of the waiting list control. Secondary outcomes include the quality of life, mood, cognition, and musical engagement of the person with dementia, and quality of life, mood, and experiences/challenges of the carer. These data will be collected during home visits at baseline, and 3 and 6 months post-baseline. DISCUSSION: Despite growing public interest in the positive effects of singing, and encouraging findings from qualitative and non-randomised quantitative studies, there is a lack of rigorous evidence. This is the first randomised controlled trial of community group singing for people with dementia in Europe, to our knowledge. If the results favour a full trial, conclusively demonstrating the effectiveness of group singing could positively affect the opportunities available to community-dwelling people with dementia and their carers.

Methods: A total of 60199 residents in China were surveyed via an internet-based survey containing a general questionnaire, such as the self-rating depression scale, the state anxiety inventory, and the negative cognitive processing bias questionnaire. An ordered multiple logistic regression analysis model was used to analyze the collected data. Results: The survey revealed mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms in 62.65%, 11.33%, and 6.14% participants, respectively, and mild, moderate, and severe anxiety symptoms in 33.21%, 41.27%, and 22.99% participants, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that factors, such as female gender, being older than 55 years, high school education level, medical staff, marital conflicts, negative attention bias, rumination, and death growth rate, positively affected depression and anxiety symptoms. The good family functionality, democratic working atmosphere, and a myriad of social activities negatively affected the level of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: Chinese residents exhibited a high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms during the epidemic. Thus, psychological interventions should focus on the vulnerable groups, and cognitive training should focus on reducing the negative cognitive processing bias. This might be an effective way to alleviate the mental stress of the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Mental health status of Chinese residents during the COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine for adolescents was recommended as an effective prevention strategy of HPV-related cancers. In Vietnam, HPV vaccination has not been introduced to male adolescent. This study was conducted to examine the acceptance of having boys vaccinated against HPV and its underlying reasoning, and to identify their parent's willingness to pay (WTP) for HPV vaccination in central Vietnam. 785 parents of boys were directly interviewed based on a structured questionnaire. Parent's acceptability of HPV vaccine for their sons was identified by one question with response on 3-point scale (agree, don't know, and disagree). Multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine contributing factors to participant's acceptance. Bidding game method was applied to elicit WTP values for HPV vaccination with initial bid of 161.2 USD. The results showed that 49.2% of parents agreed to have their sons vaccinated against HPV. Factors that influenced parent's acceptance including son's age older than 12 years (OR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.08C1.98); being eldest son (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.13C2.19), being mother (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.01C1.91), parents with high educational level (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.11C2.47) and their knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccine (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.23C2.65). Average WTP value for full doses of HPV vaccine was 137.5 USD, ranging between 9 USD and 188.3 USD. Parents' knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccine was the only factor affecting WTP value (Rho: 0.11; p-value: 0.030).

Medical workers and frontline staff need to wear respirators to protect themselves from breathing in the virus-containing respiration droplets. The most frequently used state-of-the-art respirators are of N95 standard; however, they lack self-decontamination capabilities. In addition, the viruses and bacteria can accumulate on the respirator surfaces, possessing high risks to the wearers over long-term usage. Photothermal decontamination is a contactless, fast, low-cost, and widely available method, capable of decontaminating the respirators. Herein, we report a plasmonic photothermal and superhydrophobic coating on N95 respirators, possessing significantly better protection than existing personal protection equipment. The plasmonic heating can raise the surface temperature to over 80 C for this type of respirator within 1 min of sunlight illumination. The superhydrophobic features prohibit respiration droplets from accumulating on the respirator surfaces. The presence of the silver nanoparticles can provide additional protection via the silver ions disinfection toward microbes. These synergistic features of the composite coatings provide the N95 respirator with better protection and can inspire experts from interdisciplinary fields to develop better personal protection equipment to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Plasmonic and Superhydrophobic Self-Decontaminating N95 Respirators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At its inception, the COVID-19 pandemic was described as something inherently new, capable of crossing and erasing the economic, racial, gendered, and religious divides that stratify societies around the world.

This review aimed to examine patients and caregivers experiences of accessing cancer services during the pandemic and its perceived impact on their psychological wellbeing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A protocol-led (CRD42020214906) systematic review was conducted by searching six databases including EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL for articles published in English-language between 1/2020 and 12/2020. Data were extracted using a pilot-tested, structured data extraction form. Thematic synthesis of data was undertaken and reported as per the PRISMA guideline. RESULTS: A total of 1110 articles were screened, of which 19 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies originated from 10 different countries including the US, UK, India and China. Extracted data were categorised into seven themes. Postponement and delays in cancer screening and treatment, drug shortages and inadequate nursing care were commonly experienced by patients. Hospital closures, resource constraints, national lockdowns and patient reluctance to use health services due to infection worries contributed to the delay. Financial and social distress, isolation, and spiritual distress were also commonly reported. Caregivers in addition felt anxious about infecting cancer patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Patients and caregivers experienced delays in cancer screening, treatment and care during the COVID-19 pandemic and negatively affected their psychological wellbeing. Their views and preferences should be accounted to minimise the impact of the current and any future pandemics and ensure resilient cancer services.

Using flow cytometry, we detected a significant increase of LDGs in the blood of acute COVID-19 patients, compared to healthy controls. Based on their surface marker expression, COVID-19-related LDGs exhibit four different populations, which display distinctive stages of granulocytic development and most likely reflect emergency myelopoiesis. Moreover, COVID-19 LDGs show a link with an elevated recruitment and activation of neutrophils.

A significant proportion of these peptides are oxidatively modified, most commonly through covalent linkage with the antioxidant glutathione. Unlike some of the previously reported cysteine-based modifications, this represents a true physiological alteration of cysteine residues. Furthermore, our results suggest that alterations in the cellular redox state induced by viral infection are communicated to the immune system through the presentation of S-glutathionylated viral peptides, resulting in altered T cell recognition.

These indicate that SARM1 homo-octamer avoids premature activation by assuming a packed conformation, with ordered inner and peripheral rings, that prevents dimerization and activation of the catalytic domains. This inactive conformation is stabilized by binding of SARM1s own substrate NAD+ in an allosteric location, away from the catalytic sites. This model was validated by mutagenesis of the allosteric site, which led to constitutively active SARM1. We propose that the reduction of cellular NAD+ concentration contributes to the disassembly of SARM1's peripheral ring, which allows formation of active NADase domain dimers, thereby further depleting NAD+ to cause an energetic catastrophe and cell death.","output":"Structural basis for SARM1 inhibition and activation under energetic stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence and transfer of wealth promote the evolution of civilizations.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major problem with rising prevalence in the western world. Hypertension is also a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Self-report, remotely from the clinic, becomes even more essential when patients are encouraged to avoid visiting the clinic as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-reporting of height and weight is suspected of leading to underestimation of obesity prevalence in the population; however, it has not been well studied in the elderly population.The Health Belief Model tries to predict and explain decision making of patients based on the patient's health beliefs. METHODS: Residents of a retirement home network filled a questionnaire about their health beliefs regarding hypertension and obesity and self-reported their height, weight, and blood pressure. Blood pressure, height, and weight were then measured and compared to the patients' self-reporting. FINDINGS: Ninety residents, aged 84.90  5.88, filled the questionnaire. From a clinical perspective, the overall gap between the measured and the self-reported BMI (M = 1.43, SD = 2.72), which represents an absolute gap of 0.74 kilograms and 2.95 centimeters, is expected to have only a mild influence on the physician's clinical evaluation of the patient's medical condition. This can allow the physician to estimate their patient's BMI status before the medical consultation and physical examination upon the patient's self-reporting. Patients' dichotomous (normal/abnormal) self-report of their blood pressure condition was relatively credible: positive predictive value (PPV) of 77.78% for normal blood pressure (BP) and 78.57% for abnormal BP.

The analysis reveals that increased economic uncertainty in the US reduces industrial output in all the countries analysed, while the effect of increased domestic uncertainty varies across the economies. A key finding concerns the role of the exchange rate. Whereas the real effective exchange rate amplifies the effect of uncertainty shocks in the US, it typically helps absorb shocks in the open economies.

Phenylalanine (Phe) was selected as a model amino acid precursor to investigate its derived DBPs and their variations during a chlorination regime that simulated water distribution with residue chlorine. The 7-day DBPs formation potential (DBPsFP) test with chlorine revealed chlorination by-products of phenylalanine including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), and halonitromethanes (HNMs), but not trichloronitromethane (TCNM) which was a significant N-DBP detected during the first 48 h of chlorine contact. The formation of most carbonaceous DBPs (C-DBPs) increased with chlorination time; however N-DBPs and non-chlorinated byproducts of phenylacetonitrile and phenylacetaldehyde reached their highest concentration after 2 h of reaction, and then gradually decreased until below detection after 7 days. The chlorination influencing factors indicated that light enhanced the peak yield of DBPs; the pH value showed different influences associated with corresponding DBPs; and the presence of bromide ions (Br-) generated a variety of bromine-containing DBPs. The DBPsFP test with chloramine reduced C-DBPs generation to about 1/3 of the level observed for chlorine disinfection and caused an increase in dichloroacetonitrile.

METHODS This retrospective longitudinal study included 973 participants who underwent health checkups between 2018 and 2020. We used data from the MedCity21 health examination registry. Participants' clinical characteristics and lifestyle habits were investigated. Independent lifestyle predictors of MAFLD development before the pandemic (2018-2019) and during the pandemic (2019-2020) were identified using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS In 2018, 261 (27%) patients were diagnosed with MAFLD. Before the pandemic, 22 patients developed new MAFLD. During this time, routine late-night meals were identified as an independent lifestyle predictor of MAFLD development (hazard ratio [HR] 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-6.36, P=0.046). In contrast, 44 patients developed new MAFLD during the pandemic. During this time, higher daily alcohol intake was identified as an independent lifestyle predictor of MAFLD development (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, P=0.008). In participants aged <60 years, daily alcohol intake and the proportion of participants who ate 2 times/day were significantly higher in patients who developed MAFLD during the pandemic than in those who did not. In participants aged 60 years, no lifestyle habits were associated with MAFLD development before or during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS New MAFLD diagnoses increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In particular, as a result of the social distancing protocols, loneliness is likely to increase. This study investigates (a) potential risk and resilience factors for loneliness in the Norwegian population during the strict social distancing non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) implemented against the pandemic and (b) the associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Methods: A survey was disseminated online to the adult Norwegian population when strict social distancing measures had been implemented for 2 weeks. The resulting sample of 10,061 respondents was unproportionate in terms of gender and educational level and thus sensitivity analyses were conducted. The levels of loneliness were compared across demographic sub-groups, and regression analyses were conducted to identify potential risk and resilience factors for loneliness and associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Results: Among the stable factors, being single and having a psychiatric diagnosis were related to more loneliness with small effect sizes. Among the state risk factors, more rumination and worry in general were associated with stronger loneliness, showing a medium effect size. Among the coping behaviors examined, doing new things at home not done otherwise was negatively related to loneliness, with a small effect size. Loneliness was associated with both depression and anxiety with small effect sizes when all potential confounders and psychiatric diagnosis were controlled for. The relationship to depression was more marked than the relationship to anxiety. Conclusions: The findings suggest that singles and those with a psychiatric diagnosis were most affected by loneliness during the implementation of social distancing measures to impede the coronavirus. The results support the link between loneliness and depression and anxiety symptoms. The results of the analysis of potential risk and resilience factors point to intervention targets for reducing loneliness during pandemic crises.","output":"Loneliness and Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Risk Factors and Associations With Psychopathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical and paraclinical features and outcomes of pregnant and nonpregnant women with COVID\\\\19.

It remains to be seen, how well this technology can be integrated during the transition from hospital discharge to outpatient settings. Here, we aim to assess the feasibility of introducing the FreeStyle Libre during the transition of care from inpatient to the outpatient environment in patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). We will assess CGM use as measured by the numbers of days used and frequency of daily scans. Methods: During the time period April and September 2020, 20 patients with T2D being discharged on multiple daily injections admitted to North Shore University Hospital were enrolled in this study. Exclusion criteria were those with adhesive allergy, CKD 4/5 or on dialysis and pregnant women. Participants were trained on how to use the FreeStyle Libre with the LibreLink mobile application. All patients received 2 Libre sensors at the time of discharge, one that was placed in the hospital and the other to be placed after 14 days. 1 participant died prior to discharge. Analyses included descriptive statistics, specifically categorical variables using frequencies and percentages while continuous variables using mean and standard deviation. Results: Among who used the mobile application, 10 were men and 9 were women. Majority of patients were Black (n=11, 57.9%) with a mean age of 52 years (range 31C76). The mean duration of diabetes was 9.7 years (range: 0 to 22) and mean Hemoglobin A1c of 11.2% (range: 5.5C15.5). 10 out of 19 persons used CGM for more than 2 weeks, while the remaining 9 utilized the CGM for less than 2 weeks. Mean average daily scans were 5 times per day (range: 1C12) with majority of the persons (n=15, 78.9%) scanning more frequently (3 or more times per day). The average glucose ranged from 62 to 268 mg/dl and the mean active CGM time was 52.05% (range 0C98). Mean glycemic variability was 29.17% (range: 14.5C56.7). Technical issues with the CGM included poor adhesion or issues connecting to the mobile application. Conclusion: Our study found that the initiation of CGM during the transition from hospital discharge to the outpatient setting is feasible and a useful tool. A limitation of this study was the inability for all people to use the mobile application due to incompatible phones or operating systems. References: 1. Beck RW, Riddlesworth TD, Ruedy K, et al.

In preparation for a future randomized controlled trial, this pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component intervention (I-SLEEP) that educates and empowers inpatients to advocate for fewer nighttime disruptions in order to improve sleep during periods of hospitalization. METHODS: Eligible inpatients received I-SLEEP, which included an educational video, brochure, sleep kit, and three questions patients can ask their team to reduce nighttime disruptions. Following I-SLEEP, inpatients were surveyed on the primary feasibility outcomes of satisfaction with and use of I-SLEEP components. Inpatients were also surveyed regarding empowerment and understanding of intervention materials. Patient charts were reviewed to collect data on nighttime (11 PMC7 AM) vital sign and blood draws disruptions. RESULTS: Ninety percent (n = 26/29) of patients were satisfied with the brochure and 87% (n = 27/31) with the video. Nearly all (95%, n = 36/37) patients felt empowered to ask their providers to minimize nighttime disruptions and 68% (n = 26/37) intended to alter sleep habits post-discharge. Forty-nine percent (n = 18/37) of patients asked an I-SLEEP question. Patients who asked an I-SLEEP question were significantly more likely to experience nights with fewer disruptions due to nighttime vitals (19% vs. 2.1%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: This pilot study found that I-SLEEP was well-accepted and enabled hospitalized patients to advocate for less disrupted sleep. Educating patients to advocate for reducing nighttime disruptions may be a patient-centered, low-cost strategy to improve patients care and in-hospital experience. These results suggest that I-SLEEP is ready to be evaluated against routine care in a future randomized controlled trial.

METHODS: Using multiple public data sources, we created an enhanced open-source surveillance dataset of all MERS-CoV cases between 20 September 2012 and 31 December 2018 in Saudi Arabia including available risk factor data. RESULTS: Of the 1791 cases of MERS-CoV identified, 30 cases (1.7%) were aged under 18 years and 1725 cases (96.3%) were aged 18 years and over. Three paediatric cases were fatal, aged 0, 2 and 15 years. The odds of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection among cases under 18 years (n = 10/23; 44%) was significantly higher (odds ratio (OR) = 4.98; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.15-11.51; P = 0.001) compared to adults (n = 199/1487; 13%). The odds of hospitalisation were significantly lower (OR = 0.17; 95% CI: 0.08-0.39; P < 0.001) among cases under 18 years (n = 12/24; 50%) compared to adults (n = 1231/1443; 85%).

Although rare, COVID-19 cases that SARS-CoV-2 infecting cardiomyocytes (CMs) have been reported. In vitro, SARS-CoV-2 infection of human induced-pluripotent-cells derived CMs triggered innate immune responses and induced apoptosis (Bojkova et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2020). Therefore, the current literature indicates that the heart is attacked by SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly;however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Involved in the pathogenesis of heart diseases, Toll-like receptors (TLR) are a family of pattern recognition receptors that sense the pathogenic stimuli and signal the cardiac residential cells to cope with harsh conditions (Yu and Feng, 2018). Among the best characterized TLR signaling pathways is TLR4/NF-kB axis (Lu et al., 2008), in which TLR4 convey the danger signals through its down stream kinases, such as TAK1 and TBK1, to activate NF-kB. SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is well known for its role of mediating virus entry into host cells, but its immunogenic role has not been clearly defined. Recently, we have found that SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein directly interacts with TLR4 and activates NFkB transcriptional activity. Pharmaceutically blocking either TBK1 or TAK1 attenuates Spike protein's immunogenic activity. To pinpoint Spike protein's role in the heart, we generated an AAV to specifically express a truncated Spike protein (S1-TM) in the CMs. Our data show that expressing S1-TM in CMs induces cardiac hypertrophy and decreases heart systolic function in mice. On the molecular level, Spike protein increases RelA (p65 subunit of the NF-kB complex) and activates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. In summary, our study suggests that Spike protein directly interacts with TLR4 to trigger innate immune signaling, and that Spike protein induced CM innate immune responses might be one of the underlying mechanisms of cardiac injury in COVID-19.","output":"Expressing a truncated SARS-COV-2 spike protein in mouse heart induces cardiac hypertrophy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was adopted to decompose daily COVID-19 infections in Tokyo from February 28, 2020, to July 12, 2021.

After variabilities of daily inspections were weekly denoised by EMD, one low-frequency IMF reveals that the average period of external influences (public health and social measures) to stop COVID-19 spread was 19 days, corresponding to the measures response duration based on the incubation period. By monitoring this nonlinear wave, public health and social measures for stopping COVID-19 spread can be evaluated and visualized quantitatively in the instantaneous frequency domain. Moreover, another low-frequency IMF revealed that the period of the COVID-19 outbreak and retreat was 57 days on average.

The effects of different mitigation scenarii on the amount of aerosols potentially containing SARS-CoV-2 that are extracted through the ventilation system are investigated. Numerical results indicate that adequate bed orientation and additional air treatment unit positioning can increase by 40% the number of particles extracted and decrease by 25% the amount of particles deposited on surfaces 45s after shedding. This approach could help lay the grounds for a more comprehensive way to tackle contamination risks in hospitals, as the model can be seen as a proof of concept and be adapted to any room configuration.","output":"Modeling of aerosol transmission of airborne pathogens in ICU rooms of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Affected by the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, the traditional teaching mode is going to be broken, while 'Internet + Education' is becoming a hot topic again Presently, the traditional teaching mode has some new challenges such as virtualization of teaching environment, mediatization of teaching content, fragmentation of teaching resources and diversification of teaching methods Aiming at solving these challenges, this paper first analyzes the characteristics of information-based teaching under the epidemic situation in detail Furthermore, this paper discusses the solution of integrating information techniques with teaching in combining the advantages of 'Internet + Education' and traditional classroom teaching This research is expected to provide good opportunities and new direction for future education development ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Research on information-based teaching and its influence on future education under the background of epidemic situation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Short-term interventions to suppress COVID-19 completely dominate the public, political and even the professional discussion on what explains observed differences in mortality and morbidity across countries.

Current state-of-the art approaches rely on hand-crafted 3D local features for modeling geometric variations in plant structures. While recent advancements in deep learning on point clouds have the potential of extracting relevant local and global characteristics, the scarcity of labeled 3D plant data impedes the exploration of this potential. We adapted six recent point-based deep learning architectures (PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, PointCNN, ShellNet, RIConv) for segmentation of structural parts of rosebush models. We generated 3D synthetic rosebush models to provide adequate amount of labeled data for modification and pre-training of these architectures. To evaluate their performance on real rosebush plants, we used the ROSE-X data set of fully annotated point cloud models. We provided experiments with and without the incorporation of synthetic data to demonstrate the potential of point-based deep learning techniques even with limited labeled data of real plants. The experimental results show that PointNet++ produces the highest segmentation accuracy among the six point-based deep learning methods. The advantage of PointNet++ is that it provides a flexibility in the scales of the hierarchical organization of the point cloud data. Pre-training with synthetic 3D models boosted the performance of all architectures, except for PointNet.","output":"Segmentation of structural parts of rosebush plants with 3D point-based deep learning methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A nephropathogenic K2/01 strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was attenuated by 170 serial passages in embryonated chicken eggs for possible use as a future IBV vaccine strain. High-growth properties and narrow tissue tropisms (limited replication in respiratory tracts) were achieved by the adaptation process. Unlike the parent strain, the attenuated strain (K2p170) was safe in day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks since replication of the virus did not induce mortality and nephritis, and rarely induced histological changes in the trachea and kidney after intraocular administration. In day-old broilers, even though coarse spray administration of K2p170 induced clinical signs, ciliostasis, and histopathological lesions in the trachea and the kidney, they were all comparable to birds vaccinated with commercial H120 vaccine. Despite restriction of viral replication in the respiratory tract, K2p170 elicited the production of antiserum with a neutralization index of 4.5. K2p170 provided almost complete protection against both two distinct subgroups of Korean nephropathogenic strain (KM91-like and QX-like subgroup). Furthermore, K2p170 provided significantly greater cross-protection against two heterologous strains (Massachusetts and Korean respiratory strain) than those conferred by the commercial H120 vaccine. K2p170 also had no virulence reversion after five back passages in chickens. In conclusion, K2p170 exhibits a fine balance between attenuation and immunogenicity, possesses cross-protective efficacy, and merits further investigation as a potential live vaccine as an alternative means of protection against the recently emergent nephropathogenic IBV infection in many Eurasian countries.","output":"Characterization of a novel live attenuated infectious bronchitis virus vaccine candidate derived from a Korean nephropathogenic strain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a highly pathogenic virus, is responsible for a respiratory disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes various structural and non-structural proteins, which are necessary for viral entry and replication. Among these proteins, papain-like protease (PLpro), 3C-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, a serine protease, and spike protein are potential targets of herbal remedies and phytocompounds for inhibition of viral infection and replication. There is at present no confirmed cure for the COVID-19. Various plants and their components have been introduced against SARS-Co-2. A number of review articles have also been published on them. This article is focusing on the mechanistic aspects of these plants and their derivatives on SARS-CV-2. METHOD: The material in this review article was prepared from significant scientific databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Google Scholar. RESULTS: Different medicinal plants and their phytocompounds interact with important structural and non-structural of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Natural compounds form strong bonds with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 protease and make large conformational changes. These phytochemicals are potential inhibitors of structural and non-structural of SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as Spike protein, PLpro, and 3CLpro. Some important anti-SARS-CoV-2 actions of medicinal plants and their metabolites are inhibition of the virus replication or entry, blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor and \\"Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)\\" regulation of inflammatory mediators, inhibition of endothelial activation, toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Some of these important natural immune boosters that are helpful for prevention and curing various symptoms related to COVID-19 include Allium sativum, Nigella sativa, Glycyrrhiza glabra Zingiber officinalis, Ocimum sanctum, Withania somnifera, Tinospora cordifolia, and Scutellaria baicalensis. Also, Kaempferol, Quercetin, Baicalin, Scutellarin, Glycyrrhizin, Curcumin, Apigenin, Ursolic acid, and Chloroquine are the best candidates for treating the symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: Medicinal plants and/or their bioactive compounds with inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 support the human immune system and help in fighting against COVID-19 and rejuvenating the immune system.","output":"Mechanistic Aspects of Medicinal Plants and Secondary Metabolites against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It is important for understanding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the missing opportunity for the early detection of oral cancer. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the existing population-based oral cancer (OC) service screening program in Taiwan. Methods: Before and after COVID-19 pandemic design was used to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the reduction of screening rate, referral rate, and the effectiveness of this OC service screening. Data and analysis after pandemic covered non-VOC period in 2020 and VOC period in 2021 compared to the historical control before pandemic in 2019. Results: The screening rate decreased substantially from 26.6% before COVID-19 in 2019 to 16.7% in 2020 and 15.3% in 2021 after pandemic. The reduction of screening rate varied with months, being the most remarkable decline in March (RR=0.61, 95% CI (0.60-0.62)) and June (RR=0.09, 95% CI (0.09-0.10)) in 2021 compared with January. The referral rate was stable at 81.5% in 2020 but it was reduced to 73.1% in 2021. The reduction of screening and referral rate led to the attenuation of effectiveness of advance cancer and mortality attenuated by 4% and 5%, respectively. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the screening and the referral rate and further led to statistically significant reduction in effectiveness for preventing advanced cancer and death.

The primary outcome was a positive COVID-19 test from nasopharyngeal swab. A backwards stepwise logistic regression was used to derive a model of clinical variables predictive of a positive COVID-19 test. Internal validation of the final model was performed using bootstrapped samples and the model scoring derived from the coefficients, with modelling performed for increasing prevalence. RESULTS: Of 4226 patients with suspected COVID-19 who were assessed, 2976 patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing (n = 108 SARS-CoV-2 positive) and were used to determine factors associated with a positive COVID-19 test.

COVID-19 has presented with a variety of patterns on computed tomography (CT) and these findings may assist in disease stratification. This study aims to identify potential CT characteristics that may portend adverse outcomes. Methods: This is a retrospective review of 559 symptomatic patients infected with COVID-19 admitted from March 2020 to May 2020 at Temple University Hospital (Philadelphia, PA) who received thorax CT scans on admission. These scans were independently reviewed by a chest radiologist and evaluated for the presence of ground glass opacities, consolidations, interlobular septal thickening, enlarged pulmonary artery (PA) diameter, centrilobular nodules, and crazy paving pattern. Common CT findings were then associated with a combined adverse inpatient outcome (requiring high-flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and/or death) through univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Of the 559 patients, 182 (32.6%) required high-flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and/or died. The cohort with adverse outcomes were older (mean age 65.0 years vs 56.7 years, p&lt;0.0001), but had statistically similar gender, BMI and duration of symptoms compared to the cohort without adverse outcomes. The adverse outcome cohort had more COPD (18.7% vs 8.2%) but had statistically similar proportions of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. On multivariate logistic regression, a PA diameter greater than 30mm (OR 1.056 [95% CI 1.015-1.097], p=0.0064), segmental consolidations (OR 2.359 [95% CI 1.446-3.848], p=0.0009), and non-segmental consolidations (OR 2.441, [95% CI 1.440-4.140], p=0.0009) were found to be significant predictors of adverse inpatient outcomes of either requiring high-flow nasal cannula, mechanical ventilation, or death. Conclusion: In symptomatic COVID-19 patients, enlarged PA diameter and consolidations on chest CT were associated with worse outcomes. These findings are likely representative of advanced pulmonary involvement and may be predictors of patients who require more aggressive upfront therapy.

We also cultured ITP and control peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with recombinant leptin to assess its direct effect on pro/anti-inflammatory cytokine gene expression. A significant increase in leptin was observed in children with active disease compared to controls. A significant inverse correlation of leptin with platelet count was also observed in children with acute ITP. Leptin remained high after treatment with IVIg, whereas steroid treatment lowered leptin below control levels. In remission, leptin was in the control range. Cytokine gene expression was significantly increased in children with acute ITP compared with controls, with highest expression for IFN- and IL-10. IVIg/steroid treatment significantly decreased IFN- and IL-10 expression. In remission, IFN- and IL-10 expression remained low. Addition of leptin to PBMCs isolated from patients in remission resulted in a significant increase in IL-10 gene expression compared to controls. Further experiments with purified T-cells and monocytes identified monocytes as the source of leptin-induced IL-10.

MATERIALS AND METHODS An institutional registry was retrospectively reviewed and revealed 16 patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer (median age, 67 y; range, 50-86 y) who underwent percutaneous image-guided ablation to treat 18 metastatic sites. A subgroup of 7 patients with 8 metastases were androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT)-na?ve and underwent ablation to delay initiation of ADT. Local tumor control, progression-free survival (PFS), ADT-free survival, and procedural complications were analyzed. RESULTS Local tumor control was achieved in 15 of 18 metastases (83%) at a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 5-56 mo). Local tumor recurrence was found in 3 of 18 metastases (17%), with a median time to local recurrence of 3.5 months (range, 3-38 mo). Estimated PFS rates at 12 and 24 months were 56% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30%-76%) and 43% (95% CI, 19%-65%), respectively. In the 7 ADT-na?ve patients, local tumor control was achieved in all metastases, and the median ADT-free survival period was 29 months. There were no major procedural complications. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort of patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer, percutaneous image-guided ablation was feasible and well tolerated and achieved acceptable local tumor control rates.

Macrophages are immune cells that sense and actively respond to disturbances in tissue homeostasis by initiating, and subsequently resolving, inflammation. Hypoxic conditions generated at a wound site also strongly recruit macrophages and affect their function. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 is a transcription factor that contributes to both glycolysis and the induction of inflammatory genes, while also being critical for macrophage activation. For the latter, HIF-1 regulates sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) to affect the migration, activation, differentiation, and polarization of macrophages. Recently, S1P and HIF-1 have received much attention, and various studies have been performed to investigate their roles in initiating and resolving inflammation via macrophages. It is hypothesized that the HIF-1/S1P/S1P receptor axis is an important determinant of macrophage function under inflammatory conditions and during disease pathogenesis. Therefore, in this review, biological regulation of monocytes/macrophages in response to circulating HIF-1 is summarized, including signaling by S1P/S1P receptors, which have essential roles in wound healing.","output":"Macrophage Motility in Wound Healing Is Regulated by HIF-1 via S1P Signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent U.S. in-restaurant dining restrictions deleteriously affected the restaurant industry.

In this case, as a motivational psychological system oriented toward avoiding infection, the behavioral immune system (BIS) may be activated and link to preventive behaviors. This study investigated the mechanisms through which emotional and cognitive processes resulted by BIS have promoted preventive behaviors in relation to COVID-19. We collected data on 22,005 active Sina Weibo users from 31 December 2019 to 8 February 2020 to measure their emotions (including disgust, happiness, and fear), cultural values (individualism and collectivism), moral concern (including purity vice, fairness vice, and authority virtue), and behavioral intentions (including isolation intention, protection intention, and aid intention) using Text Mind software and related dictionaries. Multiple regression and mediation analyses were performed to explore the relationships among variables. The results showed seven complete mediation paths (such as disgust-purity vice-protection intention). Each of these paths describes the effects of cognitive processes caused by BIS on preventive behaviors. We inferred that there may be path mechanisms such as disgust-cognitive processes-preventive behaviors. Using these results, policy makers can take appropriate measures to intervene in preventive behaviors (e.g., by posting disgusting images on social media to evoke disgust). The results can be used to explain differences in preventive behaviors among populations even in the face of similar thread levels.

I note here two key problems that significantly affect their estimates and cast doubt on their conclusions. Firstly, their calculations arbitrarily cut off after 13 weeks, without costing the epidemic end state. That is, they assume indifference between mid-September states of 13 or 7500 weekly deaths and corresponding infection rates. This seems indefensible unless one assumes that (a) there is little chance of any effective vaccine or improved medical or social interventions for the foreseeable future, (b) notwithstanding temporary lockdowns, COVID-19 will very likely propagate until herd immunity. Even under these assumptions it is very questionable. Secondly, they ignore the costs of serious illness, possible long-term lowering of life quality and expectancy for survivors. These are uncertain, but plausibly at least as large as the costs in deaths.

Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs.

These health measures are referred to as \\"endpoints.\\" A \\"digital endpoint\\" is defined by its use of sensor-generated data often collected outside of a clinical setting such as in a patient's free-living environment. Applicable sensors exist in an array of devices and can be applied in a diverse set of contexts. For example, a smartphone's microphone might be used to diagnose or predict mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or a wrist-worn activity monitor (such as those found in smartwatches) may be used to measure a drug's effect on the nocturnal activity of patients with sickle cell disease. Digital endpoints are generating considerable excitement because they permit a more authentic assessment of the patient's experience, reveal formerly untold realities of disease burden, and can cut drug discovery costs in half. However, before these benefits can be realized, effort must be applied not only to the technical creation of digital endpoints but also to the environment that allows for their development and application. The future of digital endpoints rests on meaningful interdisciplinary collaboration, sufficient evidence that digital endpoints can realize their promise, and the development of an ecosystem in which the vast quantities of data that digital endpoints generate can be analyzed. The fundamental nature of health care is changing. With coronavirus disease 2019 serving as a catalyst, there has been a rapid expansion of home care models, telehealth, and remote patient monitoring. The increasing adoption of these health-care innovations will expedite the requirement for a digital characterization of clinical status as current assessment tools often rely upon direct interaction with patients and thus are not fit for purpose to be administered remotely.

METHODS We acquired data on a Discovery PET/computed tomography 710 scanner using Hoffman brain and pillar phantoms with 20 MBq of 18F for 30 min. The images were reconstructed into 10-, 20-, and 30-min periods. The ordered subset-expectation maximization algorithm was used for image reconstruction, which uses a 2- or 4-mm Gaussian filter and a combination of iteration and subset numbers. The percentage contrast and coefficient of variation (CV; as the image noise) were used as physical evaluation indices for reconstructed images, and images with superior contrast and low image noise were selected for clinical evaluation. The imaging data of 15 symptomatic patients (n = 7 and n = 8 for positive and negative diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease, respectively) were reconstructed under the phantom study conditions. Radiographers visually evaluated and ranked the clinical images based on the overall contrast and image noise, and nuclear medicine specialists diagnosed Alzheimer's disease. We compared the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) obtained with different acquisition conditions. RESULTS The basic study using the phantom revealed high convergence of contrast and image noise in five patterns of acquisition time and filter strengths. Regarding visual evaluation, the use of a 2-mm Gaussian filter caused difficulties in diagnosis because the brain parenchymal accumulation was mottled with high image noise.

The genus Torovirus, within the family Coronaviridae, is less well characterized, in part because toroviruses cannot yet be grown in cell culture (except for the Berne virus). In this study, we determined the sequence of the complete genome of Breda-1 (BoTV-1), a bovine torovirus. This is the first complete torovirus genome sequence to be reported. BoTV-1 RNA was amplified using long RT-PCR and the amplicons sequenced. The genome has a length of 28.475 kb and consisted mainly of the replicase gene (20.2 kb) which contains two large overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding polyproteins pp1a and pp1b, respectively. Sequence analysis identified conserved domains within the predicted sequences of pp1a and pp1b. Sequence alignments and protein secondary structure prediction data suggest the presence of a 3C-like serine protease domain with similarity to the arterivirus 3C-like serine protease and a single papain-like cysteine protease domain with similarity to the picornavirus leader protease. The ADRP (APPR-1) domain C unique to the Coronaviridae C was also located in BoTV pp1a. In addition, several hydrophobic domains were identified that are typical of a nidovirus replicase.

This technique is usually employed in the setting of critical limb ischemia and tibial artery intervention, but it may offer potential practical advantages for popliteal artery and even superficial femoral artery intervention in unique situations. As in all cases of lower extremity arterial intervention, consideration of access is important not only for initial approach to any obstructing lesion but also for exit strategy. The dorsalis pedis artery and posterior tibial artery can be readily accessed if necessary owing to their relatively superficial position in the foot or the ankle, yet their normal diameter and the presence of significant calcification (a common finding in patients with tibial occlusive disease and critical limb ischemia) can pose difficulties as well. In addition, the peroneal artery in the lower leg can be accessed percutaneously; however, its size and depth may present additional challenges.

Dosing is usually guided by therapeutic drug monitoring adjusted to target trough levels of CNIs to keep the balance between over-dose causing severe toxicity and increased risk of infections or under-dose with a risk of graft injury. Adaptation of CNI-based immunosuppression by monitoring of torque teno virus (TTV), a latent nonpathogenic DNA virus, measured in the whole blood in addition to conventional therapeutic drug monitoring may reduce the toxicity of immunosuppression with similar efficacy. METHODS/DESIGN: An open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial in lung transplant recipients will be conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of immunosuppression guided by TTV monitoring as an add-on to conventional therapeutic drug monitoring. Adult lung transplant recipients 21 to 42 days after transplantation are eligible to participate. Patients (N = 144) will be randomized 1:1 to the experimental intervention (arm 1: immunosuppression guided by TTV monitoring in addition to conventional therapeutic drug monitoring of tacrolimus trough levels) and control intervention (arm 2: conventional therapeutic drug monitoring). Outcomes will be assessed 12 months after randomization with the change in glomerular filtration rate as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints will be additional measurements of renal function, allograft function, incidence of acute rejections, incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction, graft loss, and infections.

Because these orders impacted countries, states, and communities at different times and in different ways, a naturally occurring, quasi-randomized control experiment has unfolded, allowing the testing of criminological theories as never before. Using new and traditional data sources made available as a result of the pandemic criminologists are equipped to study crime in society as never before.

DuplicAR(?) is a novel device that allows simultaneous and independent ventilation of two subjects with a single ventilator. The aims of this study are (a) to determine the efficacy of DuplicAR(?) to independently regulate the peak and positive-end expiratory pressures in each subject, both under pressure-controlled ventilation and volume-controlled ventilation and (b) to determine the ventilation mode in which DuplicAR(?) presents the best performance and safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two test lungs are connected to a single ventilator using DuplicAR(?). Three experimental stages are established: (1) two identical subjects, (2) two subjects with the same weight but different lung compliance, and (3) two subjects with different weights and lung compliances. In each stage, the test lungs are ventilated in two ventilation modes. The positive-end expiratory pressure requirements are increased successively in one of the subjects. The goal is to achieve a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg for each subject in all different stages through manipulation of the ventilator and the DuplicAR(?) controllers. RESULTS: DuplicAR(?) allows adequate ventilation of two subjects with different weights and/or lung compliances and/or PEEP requirements. This is achieved by adjusting the total tidal volume for both subjects (in volume-controlled ventilation) or the highest peak pressure needed (in pressure-controlled ventilation) along with the basal positive-end expiratory pressure on the ventilator and simultaneously manipulating the DuplicAR(?) controllers to decrease the tidal volume or the peak pressure in the subject that needs less and/or to increase the positive-end expiratory pressure in the subject that needs more. While ventilatory goals can be achieved in any of the ventilation modes, DuplicAR(?) performs better in pressure-controlled ventilation, as changes experienced in the variables of one subject do not modify the other one. CONCLUSIONS: DuplicAR(?) is an effective tool to manage the peak inspiratory pressure and the positive-end expiratory pressure independently in two subjects connected to a single ventilator. The driving pressure can be adjusted to meet the requirements of subjects with different weights and lung compliances. Pressure-controlled ventilation has advantages over volume-controlled ventilation and is therefore the recommended ventilation mode.","output":"Combined Ventilation of Two Subjects with a Single Mechanical Ventilator Using a New Medical Device: An In Vitro Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Complete nucleotide cDNA sequence (29715 nucleotides) of SARS-associated coronavirus (strain SoD) isolated for the first time in the territory of the Russian Federation was determined.

Viet Nam implemented an aggressive testing, isolation, contact tracing and quarantine strategy in response to all laboratory-confirmed cases. We report the results of SARS-CoV-2 testing during the first half of 2020 in northern Viet Nam. METHODS: Between January and May 2020, 15 650 upper respiratory tract specimens were collected from 14 470 suspected cases and contacts in northern Viet Nam. All were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RTCPCR. Individuals with positive specimens were tested every three days until two tests were negative. Positive specimens from 81 individuals were cultured. RESULTS: Among 14 470 tested individuals, 158 (1.1%) cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were confirmed; 89 were imported and 69 were associated with community transmission. Most patients (122, 77%) had negative results after two tests, while 11 and 4 still tested positive when sampled a third and fourth time, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from 29 of 81 specimens (36%) with a cycle threshold (Ct) value < 30. Seven patients who tested positive again after testing negative had Ct values > 30 and negative cultures. CONCLUSION: Early, widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2 in northern Viet Nam identified very few cases, which, when combined with other aggressive strategies, may have dramatically contained the epidemic. We observed rapid viral clearance and very few positive results after clearance.

We investigated the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia based on the timing of dexamethasone administration. Methods A single-center, retrospective cohort study based on medical record reviews was conducted between June 10 and September 21, 2020. We compared the risk of severe COVID-19, defined as the use of a high-flow nasal cannula or a mechanical ventilator, between groups that received dexamethasone either within 24 hours of hypoxemia (early dexamethasone group) or 24 hours after hypoxemia (late dexamethasone group). Hypoxemia was defined as room-air SpO2 <90%. Results Among 59 patients treated with dexamethasone for COVID-19 pneumonia, 30 were in the early dexamethasone group and 29 were in the late dexamethasone group. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics, the time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis or hospitalization, or the use of antiviral or antibacterial agents between the two groups. The early dexamethasone group showed a significantly lower rate of severe COVID-19 compared to the control group (75.9% vs 40.0%, P-value=0.012). Further, the early dexamethasone group showed a significantly shorter total duration of oxygen supplementation (10.45 d vs. 21.61 d, P-value=0.003) and length of stay in the hospital (19.76 d vs. 27.21 d, P-value=0.013).

In this study we evaluated the efficacy of NL-CVX1 against variants of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, including important viral variants of concern (VOC) such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. Methods The relative binding affinity of NL-CVX1 to the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein of VOC was measured using biolayer interferometry (Octet). A competitive ELISA measured the ability of NL-CVX1 to compete with hACE2 for binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein from the original strain and VOC. The activity of NL-CVX1 in preventing viral infection was assessed by evaluating the cytopathic effects (CPE) of SARS-CoV-2 in a transmembrane protease, serine 2-expressing Vero E6 cell line (Vero E6/TMPRSS2) and determining the viral load using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in infected cells. A K18hACE2 mouse model of SARS CoV-2 infection was used to study the dose-response of NL-CVX1 anti-viral activity in vivo. Results NL-CVX1 binds the RBD of different VOC of SARS-CoV-2 at low nanomolar concentrations (Fig 1;Kd < 1-~5 nM). When competing with hACE2, NL-CVX1 achieved 100% inhibition against hACE2 binding to the RBD of different VOC with IC50s values ranging from 0.7-53 nM (Fig 2). NL-CVX1 neutralized the B.1.1.7 variant as efficiently as the original strain in Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells, with EC50 values of 16 nM and 101.2 nM, respectively (Fig 3). In mice, we found that a single intranasal dose of 100 g NL-CVX1 prevented clinically significant SARS-CoV-2 infection and protected mice from succumbing to infection. Results from additional in vitro and in vivo experiments to be conducted this summer will be presented. Figure 1. NL-CVX1 binds the RBD from multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2 at low nanomolar concentrations. Figure 2. NL-CVX1 achieves 100% inhibition against all strains tested, including SARS-CoV-2 VOC. Figure 3. NL-CVX1 neutralizes the B.1.1.7 variant as efficiently as the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. Conclusion In vitro and in vivo data (Fig 4) demonstrate that NL-CVX1 is a promising drug candidate for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. As a hACE2 mimetic, it is resilient to antibody escape mutations found in SARS-CoV-2 VOC. NL-CVX1 further demonstrates the power and utility of de novo protein design for developing proteins as human therapeutics. Figure 4.

This work aims to assess the transport and fate of droplets in indoor environments using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This study employs unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations with the Euler-Lagrange approach to visualize the location of thousands of droplets released in a respiratory event and their size evolution. Furthermore, we assess the dispersion of coughing, sneezing, and breathing saliva droplets from an infected source in a classroom with air conditioning and multiple occupants. The results indicate that the suggested social distancing protocol is not enough to avoid the transmission of COVID-19 since small saliva droplets (  12 m) can travel in the streamwise direction up to 4 m when an infected person coughs and more than 7 m when sneezes. These droplets can reach those distances even when there is no airflow from the wind or ventilation systems. The number of airborne droplets in locations close to the respiratory system of a healthy person increases when the relative humidity of the indoor environment is low. This work sets an accurate, rapid, and validated numerical framework reproducible for various indoor environments integrating qualitative and quantitative data analysis of the droplet size evolution of respiratory events for a safer design of physical distancing standards and air cleaning technologies.","output":"Prediction of respiratory droplets evolution for safer academic facilities planning amid COVID-19 and future pandemics: A numerical approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Objetivo Este estudio tiene como primer objetivo: realizar predicciones del curso de la infeccin en el horizonte temporal desde marzo 18 a abril 18 del 2020, segn diferentes medidas de aislamiento aplicadas.

With M(PID) = 8.6% and N(PID) = 50.2%, the 2003 SARS-CoV falls into group B, which consists of CoVs with intermediate levels of both fecalCoral and respiratory transmission potentials. Further validation of the model came with MERS-CoV (M(PID) = 9%, N(PID) = 44%) and SARS-CoV-2 (M(PID) = 5.5%, N(PID) = 48%) falling into the groups C and B, respectively. Group C contains CoVs with higher fecalCoral but lower respiratory transmission potentials. Unlike SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 with M(PID) = 5.5% has one of the hardest outer shells among CoVs. Because the hard shell is able to resist the antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids, the infected person is able to shed large quantities of viral particles via saliva and mucus, which could account for the higher contagiousness of SARS-COV-2. Further searches have found that high rigidity of the outer shell is characteristic for the CoVs of burrowing animals, such as rabbits (M(PID) = 5.6%) and pangolins (M(PID) = 5C6%), which are in contact with the buried feces. A closer inspection of pangolin-CoVs from 2017 to 2019 reveals that pangolins provided a unique window of opportunity for the entry of an attenuated SARS-CoV-2 precursor into the human population in 2017 or earlier, with the subsequent slow and silent spread as a mild cold that followed by its mutations into the current more virulent form. Evidence of this lies in both the genetic proximity of the pangolin-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2 (90%) and differences in N disorder. A 2017 pangolin-CoV strain shows evidence of higher levels of attenuation and higher fecalCoral transmission associated with lower human infectivity via having lower N(PID) (44.8%). Our shell disorder model predicts this to be a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strain, as lower inner shell disorder is associated with the lesser virulence in a variety of viruses.","output":"Shell Disorder Analysis Suggests That Pangolins Offered a Window for a Silent Spread of an Attenuated SARS-CoV-2 Precursor among Humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Punitive drug laws have had a differentiated and violent impact on women.

OBJECTIVE To examine the indirect effects of COVID-19 on health service utilisation and to explore the risk of bias in studies on prediction models. DESIGN Monthly data were analysed using interrupted time-series modelling. We used linear mixed-effect models for the analysis of antenatal care visits, institutional deliveries, vaccinations, outpatient visits and hospital admissions, and generalised linear mixed-effect models for hospital mortality. RESULTS During 2018-2020, the six hospitals recorded a total of 57,075 antenatal care visits, 38,706 institutional deliveries, 312,961 vaccinations, 605,925 out-patient visits and 143,915 hospital admissions. The COVID-19 period was associated with decreases in vacci-nations (- 575 vaccinations, P < 0.0001), outpatient visits (- 700 visits, P < 0.0001) and hospital admission (- 102 admission, P = 0.001); however, no statistically significant effects were found for antenatal care visits (P = 0.71) or institutional deliveries (P = 0.14). Mortality rate increased by 2% per month in the pre-COVID-19 period; however, a decreasing trend (by 2% per month) was observed during the COVID-19 period (P = 0.004). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses broadly confirmed the main findings with only minor inconsistencies.

Previous evidence suggested the prognostic role of the nutritional status in patients affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aim to investigate the nutritional risk in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in an internal medicine ward and their clinical outcomes using the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) and parameters derived from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 aimed at exploring: 1) the prevalence of nutritional risk with NRS-2002 and BIA; 2) the relationship between NRS-2002, BIA parameters and selected outcomes: length of hospital stay (LOS); death and need of intensive care unit (ICU); prolonged LOS; and loss of appetite. RESULTS: Data of 90 patients were analyzed. Patients at nutritional risk were 92% with NRS-2002, with BIA-derived parameters: 88% by phase angle; 86% by body cell mass; 84% by fat-free mass and 84% by fat mass (p-value 0.001). In ROC analysis, NRS had the maximum sensitivity in predicting the risk of death and need of ICU and a prolonged hospitalization showing moderate-low specificity; phase angle showed a good predictive power in terms of AUC. NRS-2002 was significantly associated with LOS ( 12.62, SE 5.79). In a multivariate analysis, blood glucose level and the early warning score are independent predictors of death and need of ICU (OR 2.79, p 0.001; 1.59, p-0.029, respectively). CONCLUSION: Present findings confirm the clinical utility of NRS-2002 to assess nutritional risk in patients with COVID-19 at hospital admission and in predicting LOS, and that bioimpedance does not seem to add further predictive value.

Chest-CT is an essential diagnostic and prognostic tool to evaluate the disease, and findings of Covid-19 pneumonia are well established. However, vascular abnormalities have been reported in a vast majority of patients, such as irregularities and enlargement of the distal pulmonary vessels, and they are not yet well-known or recognised by most radiologists. Recent findings : Histological studies have shown vascular mural infiltration and multiple abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature. These can be correlated to the chest-CT findings, and may raise the diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia when there is a biological doubt or progression of ground-glass opacities of unknown origin. They suggest that the alveolo-interstitial lesions, which are not associated with bronchial abnormalities, could be secondary to the vascular damages. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the prognostic value of the extent of pulmonary vascular abnormalities on chest-CT.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of systemic corticosteroid use (SCU) in nonsevere patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study in Hubei Province. A total of 1726 patients admitted with nonsevere type COVID-19 were included. Mixed-effect Cox model, mixed-effect Cox model with time-varying exposure, multiple linear regression, and propensity score analysis (inverse probability of treatment weight and propensity score matching) were used to explore the association between SCU and progression into severe type, all-cause mortality, and length of stay. RESULTS: During the follow-up of 30 days, 29.8% of nonsevere patients with COVID-19 received treatment with systemic corticosteroids. The use of systemic corticosteroids was associated with higher probability of developing severe type (adjusted hazard ratio 1.81; 95% confidence interval 1.47-2.21), all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.92; 95% confidence interval 1.39-6.15) in time-varying Cox analysis, and prolonged hospitalization ( 4.14; P < .001) in multiple linear regression.

RESULTS: Fifteen (71.43%) COVID-19 patients had abnormal magnetic resonance findings, including raised myocardial native T1 (5, 23.81%) and T2 values (10, 47.62%), decreased LVEF (1, 4.76%), and RVEF (2, 9.52%). The segmental myocardial T2 value of COVID-19 patients (49.20 [46.1, 54.6] msec) was significantly higher than HC (48.3 [45.2, 51.7] msec) (P < 0.001), while the myocardial native T1 value showed no significant difference between COVID-19 patients and HC. The myocardial T2 value of serious COVID-19 patients (52.5 [48.1, 57.1] msec) was significantly higher than unserious COVID-19 patients (48.8 [45.9, 53.8] msec) and HC (48.3 [45.2, 51.7]) (P < 0.001). COVID-19 patients with abnormally elevated D-dimer, C-reactive protein, or lymphopenia showed higher myocardial T2 values than without (all P < 0.05).

We aimed to: (1) identify and assess the quality of information that commercial manufacturers provided for their point-of-care tests (POCTs) and (2) examine the implications of these findings on real-world settings. DESIGN: We used a content analysis methodology in two stages to systematically, code and analyse textual data from documents of commercial manufacturers. A deductive approach was applied using a coding guide based on the validated Point-of-Care Key Evidence Tool (POCKET) multidimensional checklist. An inductive approach was used to identify new patterns or themes generated from our textual analysis. SETTING: Publicly available supportive information documents by commercial manufacturers for lateral flow serology, were identified and gathered from online searches. PARTICIPANTS: Supportive information documents retrieved from online searches over 3 months (March 2020 to June 2020). RESULTS: A total of 79 POCTs were identified that met the study inclusion criteria. Using the POCKET coding guide, we found that the quality of information varied significantly between the manufacturers and was often lacking in detail. Our inductive approach further examined these topics and found that several statements were vague and that significant variations in the level of details existed between manufacturers. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed significant concerns surrounding the supportive information reported by manufacturers for lateral flow serology assays. Information transparency was poor and human factor issues were not properly addressed to mitigate the risk of improper device use, although it should be noted that the results of our study are limited by the data that manufactures were prepared to disclose.

This study performed a multidimensional association analysis to explore the correlation between the GHS Index and COVID-19-associated morbidity, mortality, and disease increase rate (DIR) in 178 countries (regions). METHODS: The GHS Index and COVID-19 pandemic data - including total cases per million (TCPM), total deaths per million (TDPM), and daily growth rate - were extracted from online databases. The Spearman correlation coefficient was applied to describe the strength of the association between the GHS Index, sociological characteristics, and the epidemic situation of COVID-19. DIRs were compared, and the impact of the GHS Index on the DIR by the time of \\"lockdown\\" was visualized. RESULTS: The overall GHS Index was positively correlated with TCPM and TDPM, with coefficients of 0.34 and 0.41, respectively. Countries categorized into different GHS Indextiers had different DIRs before implementing lockdown measures. However, no significant difference was observed between countries in the middle and upper tiers after implementing lockdown measures. The correlation between GHS Index and DIR was positive five days before lockdown measures were taken, but it became negative 13 days later.

Achieving rapid message signing and verification for authentication is challenging due to complex operations, such as bilinear pairs. This paper proposes a secure pseudonym-based conditional privacy-persevering authentication scheme for communication security in VANETs. The Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and secure hash cryptographic function were used in the proposed scheme for signing and verifying messages. After a vehicle receives a significant amount of pseudo-IDs and the corresponding signature key from the Trusted Authority (TA), it uses them to sign a message during the broadcasting process. Thus, the proposed scheme requires each vehicle to check all the broadcasting messages received. Besides, in the proposed scheme, the TA can revoke misbehaving vehicles from continuously broadcasting signed messages, thus preventing insider attacks. The security analysis proved that the proposed scheme fulfilled the security requirements, including identity privacy-preservation, message integrity and authenticity, unlinkability, and traceability. The proposed scheme also withstood common security attacks such as man-in-the-middle, impersonation, modification, and replay attacks. Besides, our scheme was resistant against an adaptive chosen-message attack under the random oracle model. Furthermore, our scheme did not employ bilinear pairing operations; therefore, the performance analysis and comparison showed a lower resulting overhead than other identity-based schemes. The computation costs of the message signing, individual signature authentication, and batch signature authentication were reduced by 49%, 33.3%, and 90.2%, respectively.","output":"A Secure Pseudonym-Based Conditional Privacy-Preservation Authentication Scheme in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many states authorize involuntary psychiatric care on the basis of grave disability, a legal standard often defined as a person's inability to provide for basic needs because of mental illness.

METHODS Prospectively enrolled patients underwent baseline NCCT and MRI and started endovascular therapy within 12 hours of stroke onset. Inclusion criteria for this analysis were evaluable pretreatment NCCT, diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), and 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores. Two expert readers graded ischemic change on NCCT and DWI using the ASPECTS. ASPECTS scores were analyzed with the full scale or were trichotomized (0-4 versus 5-7 versus 8-10) or dichotomized (0-7 versus 8-10). Good functional outcome was defined as a 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2. RESULTS Seventy-four patients fulfilled our study criteria. The full-scale inter-rater agreement for CT-ASPECTS and DWI-ASPECTS was 0.579 and 0.867, respectively. DWI-ASPECTS correlated with functional outcome (P=0.004), whereas CT-ASPECTS did not (P=0.534). Both DWI-ASPECTS and CT-ASPECTS correlated with DWI volume. The receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that DWI-ASPECTS outperformed both CT-ASPECTS and the time interval between symptom onset and start of the procedure for predicting good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 2) and DWI volume 70 mL.

When training DL models with large number of parameters and/or large datasets, cost and speed of training can become prohibitive. Distributed DL training solutions that split a training job into subtasks and execute them over multiple nodes can decrease training time. However, the cost of current solutions, built predominantly for cluster computing systems, can still be an issue. In contrast to cluster computing systems, Volunteer Computing (VC) systems can lower the cost of computing, but applications running on VC systems have to handle fault tolerance, variable network latency and heterogeneity of compute nodes, and the current solutions are not designed to do so. We design a distributed solution that can run DL training on a VC system by using a data parallel approach. We implement a novel asynchronous SGD scheme called VC-ASGD suited for VC systems. In contrast to traditional VC systems that lower cost by using untrustworthy volunteer devices, we lower cost by leveraging preemptible computing instances on commercial cloud platforms.

They generate a proton motive force across the plasma membrane providing the free energy to drive the transport of other solutes, partly by coupling to H+ influx. Wegner & Shabala (2020; New Phytol. 225:37-47) recently suggested that passive H+ influx can exceed pump-driven efflux due to 'active buffering', i.e. cytosolic H+ scavenging and apoplastic H+ generation by metabolism ('biochemical pH clamp'). Charge balance is provided by K+ efflux or anion influx. Here, this hypothesis is extended to net H+ efflux: Even though H+ pumping is faster than backflow via symporters and antiporters, a progressive increase in the transmembrane pH gradient is avoided. Cytosolic H+ release is associated with bicarbonate formation from CO2 . Bicarbonate serves as substrate for the PEPcase catalyzing the reaction from phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate subsequently reduced to malate. Organic anions like malate and citrate are released across the plasma membrane and are (partly) protonated in the apoplast, thus limiting pump-induced acidification. Moreover, a 'biophysical pH clamp' is introduced, i.e. adjustment of apoplastic/cytosolic pH involving net H+ fluxes across the plasma membrane, while the gradient between compartments is maintained.

This cytokine induces the expression of several IFN-Stimulated Genes (ISGs), some of which act as restriction factors. Upon IFN stimulation, cells also express ISG15 and SUMO, two key ubiquitin-like (Ubl) modifiers that play important roles in the antiviral response. IFN itself increases the global cellular SUMOylation in a PML-dependent manner. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables the large-scale identification of Ubl protein conjugates to determine the sites of modification and the quantitative changes in protein abundance. Importantly, a key difference amongst SUMO paralogs is the ability of SUMO2/3 to form poly-SUMO chains that recruit SUMO ubiquitin ligases such RING finger protein RNF4 and RNF111, thus resulting in the proteasomal degradation of conjugated substrates. Crosstalk between poly-SUMOylation and ISG15 has been reported recently, where increased poly-SUMOylation in response to IFN enhances IFN-induced ISGylation, stabilizes several ISG products in a TRIM25-dependent fashion, and results in enhanced IFN-induced antiviral activities.

Given the complexity of the construct of boredom and its increasing prevalence among adolescents in recent years, the present study aimed to validate the factorial structure of the Italian version of the Multidimensional State Boredom Scale (MSBS) in adolescents using a cross-validation approach. The study involved 272 students (33.8% males, 66.2% females) aged 14C19 (M = 15.9, SD = 1.38) living in northern and central Italy. In addition to the MSBS, the Symptoms Checklist 90-R (SCL 90-R) and the Childrens Depression Inventory (CDI) were administered. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses validated a 23-item structure of the MSBS, comprising five correlated factors. The tool showed a good internal consistency for these factors and a good convergent and factor validity. The MSBS consequently seems a valid and reliable method for assessing boredom in adolescence. The cut-off for the total score that could pinpoint cases posing a potential clinical risk was 88. A weak correlation was found between the total level of boredom and the daily Internet usage, while no relationship emerged between boredom and age, gender, and grades. Since excessive levels of boredom may conceal a general unease that could develop into structured psychological disorders, the value of the MSBS lies in enabling us to identify in advance adolescents at potential clinical risk.","output":"Boredom in Adolescence: Validation of the Italian Version of the Multidimensional State Boredom Scale (MSBS) in Adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cytokine release syndrome is a serious complication of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19).

IgA-containing molecules purified from serum or milk were assessed by the release and subsequent analysis of their Fab fragments. Our data revealed that serum IgA1 consists of two distinct structural populations, namely monomeric IgA1 ( 80%) and dimeric joining (J-) chain coupled IgA1 ( 20%).

Interestingly, the serum and milk IgA1-Fab repertoires were distinct between monomeric, and J-chain coupled dimeric IgA1. The serum dimeric J-chain coupled IgA1 repertoire contained several abundant clones also observed in the milk IgA1 repertoire. The latter repertoire had little to no overlap with the serum monomeric IgA1 repertoire.

The 30 turmeric compounds and nine drugs were performed in the docking procedure for vital proteins of COVID-19. With evaluations based on docking scores, the Prime MMGBSA binding free energy and protein-ligand interactions were identified in detail. The 100 ns MD simulations were also performed to assess the stability of the ligands at the binding site of the target proteins. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) is used to obtain the average displacement for a particular frame concerning a reference frame. The results of this study are suggesting that turmeric spice have a potential to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins and can be use a therapeutic or protective agent against SARS-CoV-2 via inhibiting key protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The compound 4, 23 and 6 are the most prominent inhibitor for the main protease, the spike glycoprotein and RNA polymerase of virus, respectively. The MD simulation validated the stability of ligand-protein interactions. The compactness of the complexes was shown using a radius of gyration.

Clinical data and epidemiological history of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The diagnosis was confirmed through RNA-PCR testing. Among the 25 cases, 14 were males and 11 were females. The median age was 11.0 (6.3-14.5) years (range 0.6-17.0 years). All children were related to a family cluster outbreak, and 7 children (28%) with a travel or residence history in Hubei Province. These patients could be categorized into different clinical types, including 8 (32%) asymptomatic, 4 (16%) very mild cases and 13 (52%) common cases. No severe or critical cases were identified. The most common symptoms were cough (13 cases, 52%) and fever (6 cases, 24%). The duration time of clinical symptoms was 13.0 (8.0-25.0) days. In the 25 cases, on admission, 21 cases (84%) had normal white blood cell counts, while only 2 cases (8%) more than 10  10/L and 2 cases (8%) less than 4  10/L, respectively; 22 cases(88%) had normal CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 3 cases(8%) this increased mildly; 23 cases had normal CD8+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 2 cases (8%) CD8+ T lymphocyte counts were mildly increased as well. All Lymphocyte counts were normal. There were no statistical differences of lab results between the groups of asymptomatic cases, mild cases and common cases. There were only 13 cases with abnormal CT imaging, most of which were located in the subpleural area of the bottom of the lung. All patients were treated with interferon, 6 cases combined with Ribavirin, and 12 cases combined with lopinavir or ritonavir. The days from onset to RNA turning negative was 15.20  6.54 days.

Data on reactogenicity (vaccine side effects) in this population are limited. AIMS: To assess reactogenicity among nursing home (NH) residents. To provide a plausible proxy for predicting vaccine response among this population. METHODS: We enrolled and sampled NH residents and community-dwelling healthcare workers who received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, to assess local or systemic reactogenicity and antibody levels (immunogenicity). RESULTS: NH residents reported reactions at a much lower frequency and lesser severity than the community-dwelling healthcare workers. These reactions were mild and transient with all subjects experiencing more local than systemic reactions. Based on our reactogenicity and immunogenicity data, we developed a linear regression model predicting log-transformed anti-spike, anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD), and neutralizing titers, with a dichotomous variable indicating the presence or absence of reported reactions which revealed a statistically significant effect, with estimated shifts in log-transformed titers ranging from 0.32 to 0.37 (all p < 0.01) indicating greater immunogenicity in subjects with one or more reported reactions of varying severity. DISCUSSION: With a significantly lower incidence of post-vaccination reactions among NH residents as reported in this study, the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine appears to be well-tolerated among this vulnerable population. If validated in larger populations, absence of reactogenicity could help guide clinicians in prioritizing vaccine boosters. CONCLUSIONS: Reactogenicity is significantly mild among nursing home residents and overall, subjects who reported post-vaccination reactions developed higher antibody titers.

Unlike Nsp1 of SARS-CoV, Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 has the most interacting partners among all the viral proteins and likely functions as a hub for the viral proteins. Five self-interactions were confirmed, and five interactions, Nsp1/Nsp3.1, Nsp3.1/N, Nsp3.2/Nsp12, Nsp10/Nsp14, and Nsp10/Nsp16, were determined to be positive bidirectionally. Using the replicon reporter system of SARS-CoV-2, we screened all viral proteins for their impacts on the viral replication and revealed Nsp3.1, the N-terminus of Nsp3, significantly inhibited the replicon reporter gene expression. We found Nsp3 interacted with N through its acidic region at N-terminus, while N interacted with Nsp3 through its NTD, which is rich in the basic amino acids. Furthermore, using purified truncated N and Nsp3 proteins, we determined the direct interactions between Nsp3 and N protein.

We evaluated the effects of a potent DPP4 inhibitor (gemigliptin) on these processes among patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). METHODS: This study employed a multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled design. A total of 201 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two groups, one received treatment with 50 mg gemigliptin daily along with standard care for diabetes mellitus for 6 months. The changes in the coronary calcium score (CAC score), cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), vascular calcification level, and tubular renal injury marker expression were evaluated at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS: In total, 182 patients completed the study. Significant reductions in hemoglobin A1C levels were observed in both groups. The changes in the CAC score, CAVI, eGFR, and level of proteinuria over the 6 months of the study did not significantly differ between the gemigliptin and control groups. However, biomarkers of vascular calcification, including serum bone alkaline phosphatase and kidney injury, including urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)/Cr and urine liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP)/Cr, were improved significantly in the gemigliptin treatment group compared with the control group. No serious adverse events were observed during the study. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that gemigliptin significantly improved the expression of renal tubular injury biomarkers and vascular calcification levels among patients with DKD; however, gemigliptin did not affect renal function or coronary calcification compared with those observed in the control.

Recent approaches are just proposing variations of the activation function within the same unresolved dying ReLU challenge. This contribution reports a different research direction by investigating the development of an innovative quantum approach to the ReLU AF that avoids the dying ReLU problem by disruptive design. The Leaky ReLU was leveraged as a baseline on which the two quantum principles of entanglement and superposition were applied to derive the proposed Quantum ReLU (QReLU) and the modified-QReLU (m-QReLU) activation functions.

Oman is no exception to this, with several studies indicating high levels of anxiety and depression among the Omani public. There is a need for adaptive and effective interventions that aim to improve the elevated levels of psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to comparatively assess the efficacy of therapist-guided online therapy with that of self-help, internet-based therapy focusing on COVID-19-induced symptoms of anxiety and depression among individuals living in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a 6-week-long pragmatic randomized controlled trial involving 60 participants who were recruited from a study sample surveyed for symptoms of anxiety or depression among the Omani public amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in the intervention group were allocated to receive 1 online session per week for 6 weeks from certified psychotherapists in Oman; these sessions were conducted in Arabic or English. The psychotherapists utilized cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy interventions. Participants in the control group received an automatic weekly newsletter via email containing self-help information and tips to cope with distress associated with COVID-19. The information mainly consisted of behavioral tips revolving around the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. The primary outcome was measured by comparing the change in the mean scores of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale from the baseline to the end of the study (ie, after 6 sessions) between the two groups. The secondary outcome was to compare the proportions of participants with depression and anxiety between the two groups. RESULTS: Data from 46 participants were analyzed (intervention group n=22, control group n=24). There was no statistical difference in the baseline characteristics between both groups. Analysis of covariance indicated a significant reduction in the GAD-7 scores (F1,43=7.307; P=.01) between the two groups after adjusting for baseline scores. GAD-7 scores of participants in the intervention group were considerably more reduced than those of participants in the control group (?=-3.27; P=.01). Moreover, a greater reduction in mean PHQ-9 scores was observed among participants in the intervention group (F1,43=8.298; P=.006) than those in the control group (?=-4.311; P=.006). Although the levels of anxiety and depression reduced in both study groups, the reduction was higher in the intervention group (P=.049) than in the control group (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence to support the efficacy of online therapy for improving the symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 crisis in Oman. Therapist-guided online therapy was found to be superior to self-help, internet-based therapy; however, both therapies could be considered as viable options.

Mechanistic studies and studies of patients with inborn errors of immunity have revealed that immune dysregulation reflecting inappropriate antibody and T-cell responses plays a crucial role in causing bystander inflammation and more severe disease.

Persons with asymptomatic disease exhibit viral shedding, resulting in transmission, which presents disease control challenges. However, the clinical characteristics of these asymptomatic individuals remain elusive. We collected samples of 25 asymptomatic and 27 symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Viral titers of throat swabs were determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). COVID-19 IgG and IgM were examined. Complete blood counts were determined, and serum biochemistry panels were performed. Cytokines, including gamma interferon (IFN-?3), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 were evaluated. T cell, B cell, and NK cell counts were measured using flow cytometry. Although similar viral loads were detected, asymptomatic patients had significantly faster virus turnover than symptomatic patients. Additionally, asymptomatic patients had higher counts of lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, and NK cells. While liver damage was observed in symptomatic patients, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes and decreased liver-synthesized proteins in the blood, asymptomatic patients showed normal liver measurements. Lactate dehydrogenase, a COVID-19 risk factor, was significantly lower in asymptomatic patients. These results suggest that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients had normal clinical indicators and faster viral clearance than symptomatic patients. Lymphocytes may play a role in their asymptomatic phenotype. Since asymptomatic patients may be a greater risk of virus transmission than symptomatic patients, public health interventions and a broader range of testing may be necessary for the control of COVID-19.IMPORTANCE Asymptomatic transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a potential problem for pandemic control through public health strategies. Our results demonstrate that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients have better outcomes than symptomatic patients. This may have been due to more active cellular immune responses and normal liver function. Since asymptomatic patients have no clinical symptoms which can easily prevent timely diagnosis and treatment, they may cause a greater risk of virus transmission than symptomatic patients, which poses a major challenge to infection control.

Methods and Materials: We retrospectively collected 56 COVID-19 cases from two institutions in Hunan province, China. The basal clinical characteristics, detail imaging features and follow-up CT changes were evaluated and the relationship with the viral load was analyzed. Results: GGO (48, 85.7%) and vascular enlargement (44, 78.6%) were the most frequent signs in COVID-19 patients. Of the lesions, 64.3% of the margins were uneasily differentiated. However, no significant correlations were found in terms of leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, and C-reactive protein (all P > 0.05). In contrast, the uneasily differentiated margin was negatively correlated with the Ct value (r = ?0.283, P = 0.042), that is, an uneasily differentiated margin indicated a lower Ct value (P = 0.043). Patients with a lower Ct value were likely to present a progress follow-up change (P = 0.022). The Ct value at baseline could predict a progress follow-up change with an AUC of 0.685 (Cut-off value = 29.48). All four patients with normal CT findings presented new lesion(s) on follow-up CT scans. Conclusion: The viral load of COVID-19 is negatively correlated with an uneasily differentiated lesion margin on initial CT scan images and the Ct value should noted when making a diagnosis. In addition, following-up CT scans are necessary for patients who presented a normal CT at the initial diagnosis, especially for those with a low Ct value.","output":"The Relationship Between Chest Imaging Findings and the Viral Load of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 21 December 2020 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Comirnaty?, BioNTech, Mainz, Germany; Pfizer, New York City, NY, USA) as the first vaccine against SARS-CoV?2 in the European Union and the second vaccine (Moderna?, Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA) followed on 6 January 2021.

The present study aims to describe the clusters of inflammation in COVID-19 and to analyze their prognostic role. This is a retrospective observational study including 15,691 patients with a high degree of inflammation. They were included in the Spanish SEMI-COVID-19 registry from March 1, 2020 to May 1, 2021. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified 7 clusters. C1 is characterized by lymphopenia, C2 by elevated ferritin, and C3 by elevated LDH. C4 is characterized by lymphopenia plus elevated CRP and LDH and frequently also ferritin. C5 is defined by elevated CRP, and C6 by elevated ferritin and D-dimer, and frequently also elevated CRP and LDH. Finally, C7 is characterized by an elevated D-dimer. The clusters with the highest in-hospital mortality were C4, C6, and C7 (17.4% vs. 18% vs. 15.6% vs. 36.8% vs. 17.5% vs. 39.3% vs. 26.4%). Inflammation clusters were found as independent factors for in-hospital mortality. In detail and, having cluster C1 as reference, the model revealed a worse prognosis for all other clusters: C2 (OR = 1.30, p = 0.001), C3 (OR = 1.14, p = 0.178), C4 (OR = 2.28, p < 0.001), C5 (OR = 1.07, p = 0.479), C6 (OR = 2.29, p < 0.001), and C7 (OR = 1.28, p = 0.001).

Patients were contacted in hospital, by phone calls, or by internet regarding their ability to smell or taste, and 143 were interviewed by phone 1 to 4 months later to assess the recovery of their chemosensory abilities. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported olfactory, general taste, and taste quality-specific disturbances (sweet, sour, bitter, and salty) in the patients with COVID-19 were 82.4% (95% CI, 79.5%-85.3%), 76.2% (95% CI, 72.9%-79.4%), and 52.2% (95% CI, 48.3%-56.1%), respectively.

The sample consisted of 4661 adults aged 30 years or above, and was chosen from the 2017 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data. Of all the subjects, 14.6% engaged in high-intensity DWPA and 6.25% in moderate-intensity DWPA; while 11.68% and 24.80% engaged in high- and moderate-intensity LTPA, respectively. The effects of both types of physical activities on the risk of diabetes were analyzed using a Bayesian ordered probit model. For those with high-intensity DWPA, the probability of the FBG level being normal was 5.10% (SE = 0.25) lower than for those with non-high-intensity DWPA, and the probabilities of IFG and diabetes were 3.30% (SE = 0.15) and 1.79% (SE = 0.09) higher, respectively.

Likewise, for moderate-intensity DWPA and LTPA, the results were the same compared to low-intensity physical activities though the magnitude of the effects were smaller than for high-intensity. Thus, the activities related to work have a negative effect and those related to leisure have a positive effect. The criteria for physical activities to reduce the risk of diabetes should be set by separating these domains of physical activity, and new management strategies for diabetes are needed for people with moderate- or high-intensity DWPA.","output":"Opposite Effects of Work-Related Physical Activity and Leisure-Time Physical Activity on the Risk of Diabetes in Korean Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented increased usage of Personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare-workers. PPE usage causes headache in majority of users. We evaluated changes in cerebral hemodynamics among healthcare-workers using PPE. METHODS: Frontline healthcare-workers donning PPE at our tertiary center were included. Demographics, co-morbidities and blood-pressure were recorded. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of middle cerebral artery was performed with 2-MHz probe. Mean flow velocity (MFV) and pulsatility index (PI) were recorded at baseline, after donning N95 respirator-mask, and after donning powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), when indicated. End-tidal carbon-dioxide (ET-CO2) pressure was recorded for participants donning PAPR in addition to the N95 respirator-mask. RESULTS: A total of 154 healthcare-workers (mean age 29  12 years, 67% women) were included. Migraine was the commonest co-morbidity in 38 (25%) individuals while 123 (80%) developed de-novo headache due to N95 mask. Donning of N95 respirator-mask resulted in significant increase in MFV (4.4  10.4 cm/s, p < 0.001) and decrease in PI (0.13  0.12; p < 0.001) while ET-CO2 increased by 3.1  1.2 mmHg (p < 0.001). TCD monitoring in 24 (16%) participants donning PAPR and N95 respirator mask together showed normalization of PI, accompanied by normalization of ET-CO2 values within 5-min. Combined use of N95 respirator-mask and PAPR was more comfortable as compared to N95 respirator-mask alone. CONCLUSION: Use of N95 respirator-mask results in significant alterations in cerebral hemodynamics. However, these effects are mitigated by the use of additional PAPR.

These two types of bias are often involved in estimating the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19 tests. Imperfect gold standard bias arises when estimating accuracy measures of chest CT while using the RT-PCR test as a gold standard, despite its tendency to produce false negative results. Meanwhile, verification bias occurs in some studies where the results from chest CT are verified by RT-PCR test in a subsample of suspected cases that is not representative of the original population. Consequently, the accuracy estimates of chest CT and RT-PCR tests could be seriously biased and lead to invalid inference. Our proposed method is able to correct these two types of bias in providing unbiased and more accurate estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the two tests. Our results suggest that chest CT has higher sensitivity and lower specificity than RT-PCR, and the accuracy estimates can serve as an important reference for assessing and comparing the performance of these two tests in the diagnosis of COVID-19, and could guide policy recommendations for the implementation of these tests.","output":"More Accurate Estimates of the Accuracy of RT-PCR and Chest CT Tests for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Weyl semimetals are crystals in which electron bands cross at isolated points in momentum space.

Recently, it was predicted that the amplitude of the CPGE associated with optical transitions near a Weyl node is proportional to its monopole charge. In chiral Weyl systems, nodes of opposite charge are nondegenerate, opening a window of wavelengths where the CPGE resulting from uncompensated Berry charge can emerge. Here, we report measurements of CPGE in the chiral Weyl semimetal RhSi, revealing a CPGE response in an energy window that closes at 0.65 eV, in agreement with the predictions of density functional theory.","output":"Helicity-dependent photocurrents in the chiral Weyl semimetal RhSi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) plays a key role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Zonisamide (ZNS) was originally developed as an antiepileptic drug. Studies have shown that ZNS suppresses ER stress-induced neuronal cell damage in the experimental models of Parkinson's disease. Herein, we investigated whether ZNS improved DCM by attenuating ER stress-induced apoptosis. C57BL/6J mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) and intraperitoneally injected with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and then treated with ZNS (40 mgkg-1d-1, i.g.) for 16 weeks. We showed that ZNS administration slightly ameliorated the blood glucose levels, but significantly alleviated diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy. Furthermore, ZNS administration significantly inhibited the Bax and caspase-3 activity, upregulated Bcl-2 activity, and decreased the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells in heart tissues. We analyzed the hallmarks of ER stress in heart tissues, and revealed that ZNS administration significantly decreased the protein levels of GRP78, XBP-1s, ATF6, PERK, ATF4, and CHOP, and elevated Hrd1 protein. In high glucose (HG)-treated primary cardiomyocytes, application of ZNS (3 M) significantly alleviated HG-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. ZNS application also suppressed activated ER stress in HG-treated cardiomyocytes. Moreover, preapplication of the specific ER stress inducer tunicamycin (10 ng/mL) eliminated the protective effects of ZNS against HG-induced cardiac hypertrophy and ER stress-mediated apoptosis.

The importance of type I interferon (IFN) production for the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection is highlighted by the increased severity of COVID-19 in patients with inborn errors of type I IFN response or auto-antibodies against IFN-. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a unique immune cell population specialized in recognizing and controlling viral infections through the production of high concentrations of type I IFN. In this study, we isolated pDCs from healthy donors and showed that pDCs are able to recognize SARS-CoV-2 and rapidly produce large amounts of type I IFN. Sensing of SARS-CoV-2 by pDCs was independent of viral replication since pDCs were also able to recognize UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and produce type I IFN. Transcriptional profiling of SARS-CoV-2 and UV-SARS-CoV-2 stimulated pDCs also showed a rapid type I and III IFN response as well as induction of several chemokines, and the induction of apoptosis in pDCs. Moreover, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung using primary human airway epithelial cells (pHAEs) and showed that co-culture of pDCs with SARS-CoV-2 infected pHAEs induces an antiviral response and upregulation of antigen presentation in pHAE cells. Importantly, the presence of pDCs in the co-culture results in control of SARS-CoV-2 replication in pHAEs. Our study identifies pDCs as one of the key cells that can recognize SARS-CoV-2 infection, produce type I and III IFN and control viral replication in infected cells. Importance Type I interferons (IFNs) are a major part of the innate immune defense against viral infections. The importance of type I interferon (IFN) production for the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection is highlighted by the increased severity of COVID-19 in patients with defects in the type I IFN response. Interestingly, many cells are not able to produce type I IFN after being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and cannot control viral infection. In this study we show that plasmacytoid dendritic cells are able to recognize SARS-CoV-2 and produce type I IFN, and that pDCs are able to help control viral infection in SARS-CoV-2 infected airway epithelial cells.","output":"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells produce type I interferon and reduce viral replication in airway epithelial cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Healthcare workers serve as the frontliners against the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and this puts them most at risk of infection as they attend to numerous patients with unknown status. This study aimed to examine stress, anxiety, and depression among healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients in Sarawak General Hospital (SGH), Malaysia. MATERIALS AND METHODS This cross-sectional observational study conducted in SGH during the pandemic with an online self-administered questionnaire composed of two parts, the socio-demographic characteristics, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). RESULTS A total of 105 healthcare workers responded to this study. A questionnaire in both Bahasa Melayu and English was used. The findings showed that all healthcare workers had mild anxiety, with the majority experiencing mild stress (57.1%), and almost half of the respondents experiencing mild depression (41%). Female subjects had a significant higher mean score in anxiety level and stress level compared to male subjects (10.03.20 vs. 8.62.93, p<0.05; 14.14.76 vs. 10.73.70, p<0.05, respectively). Staff who were transferred from other units to handle COVID-19 cases experienced more psychological symptoms. There were significant correlations between the depression, anxiety and stress levels among the healthcare workers and the number of children they had (r=0.739, p=0.001; r=0.642, p=0.001; r=1, p =0.001 respectively). However, the stress level among the healthcare workers was reversely correlated with their years of working experience (r=-0.199, p=0.042).

Histological analysis showed that the hair follicles in the mutants were arrested at stage 2 of hair development. The density of hair follicles in the mutant mice was also lower compared to that in the control mice. Overexpression of Fgf8 inhibited the proliferation of epidermal cells and simultaneously promoted apoptosis, leading to the arrest of hair follicle development. Further analysis showed that sonic hedgehog (Shh) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) were downregulated and upregulated, respectively. To summarize, our study demonstrates that FGF signaling plays an important role in the regulation of hair follicle development.","output":"Overexpression of Fgf8 in the epidermis inhibits hair follicle development."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is not known if new onset diabetes during Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19; NOD COVID) is phenotypically or biochemically different than new onset diabetes before COVID-19 (NOD).

Originating in early Autumn but discovered in December 2020, it spread rapidly and caused large waves of infections worldwide. The Alpha variant is notable for being defined by a long ancestral phylogenetic branch with an increased evolutionary rate, along which only two sequences have been sampled. Alpha genomes comprise a well-supported monophyletic clade within which the evolutionary rate is more typical of SARS-CoV-2. The Alpha epidemic continued to grow despite the continued restrictions on social mixing across the UK, and the imposition of new restrictions, in particular the English national lockdown in November 2020. While these interventions succeeded in reducing the absolute number of cases, the impact of these non-pharmaceutical interventions was predominantly to drive the decline of the SARS-CoV-2 lineages which preceded Alpha. We investigate the only two sampled sequences that fall on the branch ancestral to Alpha. We find that one is likely to be a true intermediate sequence, providing information about the order of mutational events that led to Alpha. We explore alternate hypotheses that can explain how Alpha acquired a large number of mutations yet remained largely unobserved in a region of high genomic surveillance: an under-sampled geographical location, a non-human animal population, or a chronically-infected individual. We conclude that the last hypothesis provides the best explanation of the observed behaviour and dynamics of the variant, although we find that the individual need not be immunocompromised, as persistently-infected immunocompetent hosts also display a higher within-host rate of evolution. Finally, we compare the ancestral branches and mutation profiles of other VOCs to each other, and identify that Delta appears to be an outlier both in terms of the genomic locations of its defining mutations, and its lack of rapid evolutionary rate on the ancestral branch. As new variants, such as Omicron, continue to evolve (potentially through similar mechanisms) it remains important to investigate the origins of other variants to identify ways to potentially disrupt their evolution and emergence.","output":"The origins and molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 (coronavirus) has spread all over the world with a high infection rate.

We aimed to explore associations between potential risk and protective factors and mental health more comprehensively, using the Complete State Model of Mental Health. An online survey of 1004 young Australians (55% female; M age = 21.23) was undertaken. Assessment of both mental illness and mental well-being enabled participants to be cross-classified into four mental health states. Those with Floundering (13%) or Struggling (47.5%) mental health reported symptoms of mental illness; a Languishing group (25.5%) did not report symptoms of mental illness but mental well-being was compromised relative to those who were Flourishing (14%) with high mental well-being. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine associations, adjusting for socio-demographic confounders. Protective factors associated with Flourishing mental health included being in secure employment, using screen time to connect with others, and reporting high levels of hope. Both incidental and purposive contact with nature were also associated with Flourishing, while a lack of green/bluespace within walking distance was associated with Languishing, absence of outdoor residential space was associated with Floundering, and lower neighbourhood greenness was associated with all three suboptimal mental health states.

SETTING: Patients were enrolled from October 2020 to March 2021 in an Italian dedicated COVID-19 ICU. PATIENTS: Twenty-one intubated patients with moderate or severe C-ARDS. INTERVENTIONS: First, patients were transported to the CT scan facility, and image acquisition was performed in prone, then supine position. Back to the ICU, gas exchange, respiratory mechanics, and ventilation and perfusion EIT-based analysis were provided toward the end of two 30 minutes steps (e.g., in supine, then prone position). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Prone position induced recruitment in the dorsal part of the lungs (12.5%  8.0%; p < 0.001 from baseline) and derecruitment in the ventral regions (C6.9%  5.2%; p < 0.001). These changes led to a global increase in recruitment (6.0%  6.7%; p < 0.001). Respiratory system compliance did not change with prone position (45  15 vs 45  18 mL/cm H(2)O in supine and prone position, respectively; p = 0.957) suggesting a decrease in atelectrauma.

Depletion of CD8+ T cells in convalescent animals partially abrogated the protective efficacy of natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2 re-challenge, suggesting the importance of cellular immunity in the context of waning or subprotective antibody titers. These data demonstrate that relatively low antibody titers are sufficient for protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques, and that cellular immune responses may also contribute to protection if antibody responses are suboptimal. We also show that higher antibody titers are required for therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques.

Optimising and standardising management through evidence-based guidelines may improve quality of care and therefore patient outcomes. METHODS: A task force from the European Respiratory Society and endorsed by the Chinese Thoracic Society identified priority interventions (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) for the initial version of this \\"living guideline\\" using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) format. The GRADE approach was used for assessing the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. Systematic literature reviews were performed, and data pooled by meta-analysis where possible. Evidence tables were presented and evidence to decision frameworks were used to formulate recommendations. RESULTS: Based on the available evidence at the time of guideline development (20 February, 2021), the panel makes a strong recommendation in favour of the use of systemic corticosteroids in patients requiring supplementary oxygen or ventilatory support, and for the use of anticoagulation in hospitalised patients. The panel makes a conditional recommendation for interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antagonist monoclonal antibody treatment and high-flow nasal oxygen or continuous positive airway pressure in patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure. The panel make strong recommendations against the use of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir. Conditional recommendations are made against the use of azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, colchicine, and remdesivir, in the latter case specifically in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. No recommendation was made for remdesivir in patients requiring supplemental oxygen. Further recommendations for research are made. CONCLUSION: The evidence base for management of COVID-19 now supports strong recommendations in favour and against specific interventions.

This paper provides learning and the outcomes of setting up a bespoke web-based platform using social media. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the establishment of a web-based, multicontextual research communication platform for parents and stakeholders of children with congenital anomalies using social media and to identify associated research and ethical and technical challenges. METHODS: The ConnectEpeople e-forum was developed using social media platforms with a stakeholder engagement process. A multilevel approach was implemented for reciprocal engagement between parents of children with congenital anomalies, researchers, health care professionals, and other stakeholders using private and invisible and public Facebook groups, closed Twitter groups, and YouTube. Ethical approval was obtained from Ulster University. RESULTS: Nonprofit organizations (N=128) were invited to engage with an initial response rate of 16.4% (21/128). Of the 105 parents contacted, 32 entered the private and invisible Facebook groups to participate in the coproduction research. Public Facebook page followers rose to 215, a total of 22 posts had an engagement of >10%, and 34 posts had a reach of over 100. Webinars included requested information on childhood milestones and behavior. YouTube coverage included 106 ConnectEpeople videos with 28,708 impressions. Project information was obtained from 35 countries. The highest Facebook activity occurred during the early morning hours. Achievement of these results required dedicated time management, social media expertise, creativity, and sharing knowledge to curate valuable content. CONCLUSIONS: Building and maintaining a multilayered online forum for coproduction and information sharing is challenging. Technical considerations include understanding the functionality and versatility of social media metrics. Social media offers valuable, easily accessible, quantitative, and qualitative data that can drive the reciprocal process of forum development. The identification and integration of the needs of the ConnectEpeople e-forum was a key driver in the dissemination of useful, meaningful, and accessible information. The necessary dedicated administration to respond to requests and posts and collate data required significant time and effort. Participant safety, the development of trust, and the maintenance of confidentiality were major ethical considerations. Discussions on social media platforms enabled parents to support each other and their children. Social media platforms are particularly useful in identifying common family needs related to early childhood development. This research approach was challenging but resulted in valuable outputs requiring further application and testing. This may be of particular importance in response to COVID-19 or future pandemics. Incorporating flexible, adaptable social media strategies into research projects is recommended to develop effective platforms for collaborative and impactful research and dissemination.","output":"Using Social Media as a Research Tool for a Bespoke Web-Based Platform for Stakeholders of Children With Congenital Anomalies: Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights the importance of strong and resilient health systems. Yet how much a society should spend on healthcare is difficult to determine because additional health expenditures imply lower expenditures on other types of consumption. Furthermore, the welfare-maximizing (efficient) aggregate amount and composition of health expenditures depend on efficiency concepts at three levels that often get blurred in the debate. While the understanding of efficiency is good at the micro- and meso-levelsthat is, relating to minimal spending for a given bundle of treatments and to the optimal mix of different treatments, respectivelythis understanding rarely links to the efficiency of aggregate health expenditure at the macroeconomic level. While micro- and meso-efficiency are necessary for macro-efficiency, they are not sufficient. We propose a novel framework of a macro-efficiency score to assess welfare-maximizing aggregate health expenditure. This allows us to assess the extent to which selected major economies underspend or overspend on health relative to their gross domestic products per capita. We find that all economies under consideration underspend on healthcare with the exception of the United States. Underspending is particularly severe in China, India, and the Russian Federation. Our study emphasizes that the major and urgent issue in many countries is underspending on health at the macroeconomic level, rather than containing costs at the microeconomic level.","output":"Macro-level efficiency of health expenditure: Estimates for 15 major economies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic harmed the world community including hemodialysis patients.

Methods: Retrospective review of 235 heart transplant patients at a large academic medical center identified 31 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection. Laboratory and clinical data were collected from our institution as well as other local hospitals patients had been treated at. Outcomes were followed from March 15, 2020 to March 15, 2021. All data was deidentified. Results: In a cohort of 235 heart transplant patients, 31 patients were identified after testing positive for COVID-19 infection. The mean and median age of patients was 51.9 and 56.0 years respectively. 71% of patients were male and 29% of patients were female.

In the present study, we report detection of porcine SaVs in pigs at different ages with clinical diarrhea using next-generation sequencing and genetic characterization. All seven cases have porcine SaV GIII strains detected and one pooled case was found to have a porcine SaV GVI strain IA27912-B-2018.

This study describes public sector providers experiences with implant and IUD removals in two districts of Senegal. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with providers trained to insert implants and IUDs from all public facilities offering long-acting reversible contraceptives. Data collection elements included a survey with 55 providers and in-depth interviews (IDIs) with eight other providers. We performed descriptive analysis of survey responses and analyzed qualitative data thematically. Results: Nearly all providers surveyed were trained in both implant and IUD insertion and removal;42% had received training in the last two years. Over 90% of providers felt confident inserting and removing implants and removing IUDs;15% were not confident removing non-palpable implants and 27% IUDs with non-visible strings. Challenges causing providers to refer clients or postpone removals include lack of consumables (38%) for implants, and short duration of use for implants (35%) and IUDs (20%). Many providers reported counseling clients presenting for removals to keep their method (58% implant, 31% IUD), primarily to attempt managing side effects. Among providers with removal experience, 78% had ever received a removal client with a deeply-placed implant and 33% with an IUD with non-visible strings. Qualitative findings noted that providers were willing to remove implants and IUDs before their expiration date but first attempted treatment or counseling to manage side effects. Providers reported lack of equipment and supplies as challenges, and mixed success with difficult removals. Conclusions: Findings on provider capacity to perform insertions and regular removals are positive overall. Potential areas for improvement include availability of equipment and supplies, strengthening of counseling on side effects, and support for managing difficult removals.","output":"Ensuring sufficient service capacity for removals of long-acting reversible contraceptives: a mixed-method study of provider experiences in Senegal: [version 1;peer review: awaiting peer review]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In people recovering from COVID-19, there is concern regarding potential long-term pulmonary sequelae and associated impairment of functional capacity.

Positive emotions can have an undoing effect on negative emotional arousal and broaden an individuals scope of action, and they can foster posttraumatic growth. This study aimed to examine relations between prioritizing positivity, styles of rumination, coping strategies, and posttraumatic growth. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-four Polish adults took part in the study, filling out questionnaires to measure prioritizing positivity, hope, and self-efficacy. Twelve to fifteen months later, 104 of them accepted the invitation to the second part of the study. The participants reported the intensity of rumination associated with the most critical event in their lives, which took place between the first and second stages of the study and the coping strategies they used. Posttraumatic growth and life satisfaction were also measured. RESULTS: Results from hierarchical regressions found that higher levels of prioritizing positivity, deliberate ruminations, and religious coping and lower level of intrusive ruminations were associated with posttraumatic growth. The results also indicate that self-esteem was a significant predictor of life satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the prospective study confirm that individual differences in prioritizing positivity can relate to a process of posttraumatic growth. Prioritizing positivity was associated with the use of an active coping strategy and deliberate but not intrusive ruminations. Previous studies on the role of prioritizing positivity have focused on the impact on the level of wellbeing of seeking positive emotions in everyday life.

We used an optical aerosol spectrometer and wearable particulate matter sensors to measure real-time aerosol concentration from the vantage point of the dentist during routine care in a variety of clinic configurations (eg, open bay, single room, partitioned operatories). We compared the impact of aerosol mitigation strategies (eg, ventilation and high-volume evacuation (HVE), and prevalence of particulate matter) in the dental clinic environment before, during, and after high-speed drilling, slow-speed drilling, and ultrasonic scaling procedures. RESULTS: Conical and ISOVAC HVE were superior to standard-tip evacuation for aerosol-generating procedures. When aerosols were detected in the environment, they were rapidly dispersed within minutes of completing the aerosol-generating procedure. Few aerosols were detected in dental clinics, regardless of configuration, when conical and ISOVAC HVE were used.

Risk of rupture was not significantly elevated during exposure to third-generation fluoroquinolones (IRR = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.33-3.37) and nonfluoroquinolones (IRR = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.80-1.47). In contrast, risk was significantly elevated during exposure to first- and second-generation fluoroquinolones (IRR = 2.94; 95% CI, 1.90-4.54). Findings were similar across subgroups stratified by sex and by recent corticosteroid use. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that third-generation fluoroquinolone use was not associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture. These antibiotics may be a safer option for patients in whom this risk is elevated, such as athletes.","output":"Association Between Third-Generation Fluoroquinolones and Achilles Tendon Rupture: A Self-Controlled Case Series Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relevance In 2019, our world is facing a new infectious disease COVID-19 Coronavirus has not spared cancer patients As everyone knows, cancer patients are very sensitive to infections, this is due to an immunodeficiency condition caused by special therapy for a malignant neoplasm To date, the clinical characteristics of cancer patients infected with COVID-19 remain largely unknown, so one of the ways to reduce mortality among this category of patients is to study the clinical features of coronavirus infection among patients with cancer Thus, we aimed to study these problems by conducting an urgent retrospective study of patients with critical diseases infected with COVID-19 Aim: to study the clinical features of coronavirus infection in patients with cancer Materials and methods of research In our work, we analyzed data from the database of the medical information system of the Republic of Kazakhstan, which included medical records, demographic characteristics, clinical signs, objective status, laboratory data, and instrumental data We selected 883 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in patients with various nosologies from 14 regions and 3 cities of national significance of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the period from March 13, 2020 to may 28, 2020 Research result The following clinical features were identified in patients with malignant neoplasms infected with Covid-19: in addition to typical signs such as cough, fever, weakness, there was also a reduction in breathing, this is with less physical activity, headache, General weakness, chills, sweating, decreased resistance to physical activity Two patients with malignancies had anemia and hypoproteinemia, which can negatively affect immunocompetence and increase sensitivity to respiratory pathogens Also, the age of the patient over 60 years and the presence of concomitant diseases in the anamnesis Conclusions So we need to pay more attention to cancer patients, especially those who are receiving active treatment, given the higher risk In most of the considered examples, we can talk about one or another manifestation of the disease as a consequence of COVID-19","output":"Clinical features of coronavirus infection among patients with cancer in the Republic of Kazakhstan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the Covid-19 has presented an unparalleled challenge for media management as well as for the media content.

In this context, we created CoviPsyHUS, local mental health prevention and care system dedicated explicitly to healthcare workers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in one of this region's tertiary hospitals. We deployed CoviPsyHUS gradually in 1 month. To date, CoviPsyHUS comprises 60 mental health professionals dedicated to 4 complementary components: (i) a mental health support hotline (170 calls), (ii) relaxation rooms (used by 2,120 healthcare workers with 110 therapeutic workshops offered), (iii) mobile teams (1,200 contacts with healthcare staff), and (iv) a section dedicated to patients and their families. Among the critical points to integrate mental health care system during a crisis, we identified: (i) massive dissemination of mental health support information with multimodal communication, (ii) clear identification of the mental health support system, (iii) proactive mobile teams to identify healthcare professionals in difficulty, (iv) concrete measures to relieve the healthcare professionals under pressure (e.g., the relay in communication with families), (v) support for primary needs (body care (physiotherapy), advice and first-line therapy for sleep disorders), and (vi) psychoeducation and emotion management techniques. The different components of CoviPsyHUS are vital elements in meeting the needs of caregivers in situations of continuous stress.

However, there are many open questions regarding their uptake and impact on cellular metabolism. In this study, lipid structures were assembled as a supported lipid bilayer on top of biopolymer-coated microcarriers based on the Layer-by-Layer assembly strategy. The functionalized microcarriers were then applied to various human and animal cell lines in addition to primary human macrophages (M). Here, their influence on cellular metabolism and their intracellular localization were detected by extracellular flux analysis and immunofluorescence analysis, respectively. The impact of microcarriers on metabolic parameters was in most cell types rather low. However, lipid bilayer-supported microcarriers induced a decrease in oxygen consumption rate (OCR, indicative for mitochondrial respiration) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, indicative for glycolysis) in Vero cells. Additionally, in Vero cells lipid bilayer microcarriers showed a more pronounced association with microtubule filaments than polymer-coated microcarrier. Furthermore, they localized to a perinuclear region and induced nuclei with some deformations at a higher rate than unfunctionalized carriers. This association was reduced through the application of the microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole. Thus, the effect of respective lipid structures as a drug delivery system on cells has to be considered in the context of the respective target cell, but in general can be regarded as rather low.","output":"The Metabolic Response of Various Cell Lines to Microtubule-Driven Uptake of Lipid- and Polymer-Coated Layer-by-Layer Microcarriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Papain-like protease (PLpro) of coronaviruses (CoVs) carries out proteolytic maturation of non-structural proteins that play a role in replication of the virus and performs deubiquitination of host cell factors to scuttle antiviral responses. Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the causative agent of bronchitis in chicken that results in huge economic losses every year in the poultry industry globally, encodes a PLpro. The substrate specificities of this PLpro are not clearly understood. Here, we show that IBV PLpro can degrade Lys(48)- and Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitin chains to monoubiquitin but not linear polyubiquitin. To explain the substrate specificities, we have solved the crystal structure of PLpro from IBV at 2.15-? resolution. The overall structure is reminiscent of the structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV PLpro. However, unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV PLpro that lacks blocking loop (BL) 1 of deubiquitinating enzymes, the IBV PLpro has a short BL1-like loop. Access to a conserved catalytic triad consisting of Cys(101), His(264), and Asp(275) is regulated by the flexible BL2. A model of ubiquitin-bound IBV CoV PLpro brings out key differences in substrate binding sites of PLpros. In particular, P3 and P4 subsites as well as residues interacting with the -barrel of ubiquitin are different, suggesting different catalytic efficiencies and substrate specificities. We show that IBV PLpro cleaves peptide substrates KKAG-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin and LRGG-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin with different catalytic efficiencies. These results demonstrate that substrate specificities of IBV PLpro are different from other PLpros and that IBV PLpro might target different ubiquitinated host factors to aid the propagation of the virus.","output":"Structural View and Substrate Specificity of Papain-like Protease from Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has severely affected nursing homes. Vulnerable nursing home residents are at high risk for adverse outcomes, but improved understanding is needed to identify risk factors for mortality among nursing home residents. Objective: To identify risk factors for 30-day all-cause mortality among US nursing home residents with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted at 351 US nursing homes among 5256 nursing home residents with COVID-19-related symptoms who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing between March 16 and September 15, 2020. Exposures: Resident-level characteristics, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, symptoms, chronic conditions, and physical and cognitive function. Main Outcomes and Measures: Death due to any cause within 30 days of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Results: The study included 5256 nursing home residents (3185 women [61%]; median age, 79 years [interquartile range, 69-88 years]; and 3741 White residents [71%], 909 Black residents [17%], and 586 individuals of other races/ethnicities [11%]) with COVID-19. Compared with residents aged 75 to 79 years, the odds of death were 1.46 (95% CI, 1.14-1.86) times higher for residents aged 80 to 84 years, 1.59 (95% CI, 1.25-2.03) times higher for residents aged 85 to 89 years, and 2.14 (95% CI, 1.70-2.69) times higher for residents aged 90 years or older. Women had lower risk for 30-day mortality than men (odds ratio [OR], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.60-0.80]). Two comorbidities were associated with mortality: diabetes (OR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.05-1.40]) and chronic kidney disease (OR, 1.33 [95%, 1.11-1.61]). Fever (OR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.41-1.96]), shortness of breath (OR, 2.52 [95% CI, 2.00-3.16]), tachycardia (OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.04-1.64]), and hypoxia (OR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.68-2.50]) were also associated with increased risk of 30-day mortality. Compared with cognitively intact residents, the odds of death among residents with moderate cognitive impairment were 2.09 (95% CI, 1.68-2.59) times higher, and the odds of death among residents with severe cognitive impairment were 2.79 (95% CI, 2.14-3.66) times higher. Compared with residents with no or limited impairment in physical function, the odds of death among residents with moderate impairment were 1.49 (95% CI, 1.18-1.88) times higher, and the odds of death among residents with severe impairment were 1.64 (95% CI, 1.30-2.08) times higher.

METHODS: Subjects were recruited and classified into one of the following four groups: normal controls (n = 52), diabetes without DR (n = 49), non-proliferative DR (n = 51) and proliferative DR (n = 38). Using OCTA, the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP) and the choriocapillaris vessel densities were measured and compared in different macular areas: the fovea (1-mm diameter circular area), parafovea (1-3-mm diameter ring) and perifovea (3-6-mm ring). RESULTS: With DR progression, vessel densities in the SCP and DCP as well as the choriocapillaris decreased, while the foveal avascular zone area increased (p < 0.001 for all). Compared with controls, the SCP and DCP vessel densities of the diabetes without DR group were decreased in all areas of the macula (p < 0.020 for all), while the choriocapillaris vessel density was decreased only in the perifoveal area (p = 0.823 for the foveal area; p = 0.631 for the parafoveal area; p = 0.039 for the perifoveal area). Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that all retinal and choroidal microvascular indices were significantly associated with the DR severity.

The aim was to evaluate survival outcomes of patients with N2 disease in multimodality trials of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. METHODS Systematic review and meta-analyses (random and fixed effects) were performed. Searches of Medline and Embase (1980-2013) were conducted. Abstracts from thoracic scientific meetings were searched. Reference lists of all relevant studies were reviewed. All studies of patients with N2 disease who received induction chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy and randomised to surgery or radiotherapy were included. No language restrictions were imposed. The main outcome was overall survival. RESULTS 805 publications were identified. 519 and 281 were excluded because they were not primary results from randomised trials (or did not include N2 disease) or did not compare surgery with radiotherapy, respectively. The final six trials consisted of 868 patients. In four trials, patients received induction chemotherapy and in two trials patients received induction chemoradiotherapy. The HR comparing patients randomised to surgery after chemotherapy was 1.01 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.23; p=0.954) whereas for patients randomised to surgery after chemoradiotherapy was 0.87 (0.75 to 1.01; p=0.068). The overall HR of all pooled trials was 0.92 (0.81 to 1.03; p=0.157).

Given the delays in achieving polio eradication and increased costs, we performed an updated economic analysis of the GPEI using an updated integrated global model, and considering the GPEI trajectory as of the beginning of 2020. Applying similar methods and assuming eradication achievement in 2023, we estimate incremental net benefits of the GPEI of 28 billion US$2019, which falls below the prior estimate. Delays in achieving polio eradication combined with the widescale introduction of relatively expensive inactivated poliovirus vaccine significantly increased the costs of the GPEI and make it less cost-effective, although the GPEI continues to yield expected incremental net benefits at the global level when considered over the time horizon of 1988-2029. The overall health and financial benefits of the GPEI will depend on whether and when the GPEI can achieve its goals, when eradication occurs, the valuation method applied, and the path dependence of the actions taken.

Accordingly, the aim of the present review was to determine ATS, risk factors, and mechanisms underlying ATS using scientific data and information obtained from Medline, Toxline, and regulatory agencies. Additional information was also extracted from websites of organizations, such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA), International Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers (IAMAT), and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Consequences of ATS attributed to air travel include sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia), mental/physical stress, gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory diseases, circulatory-related dysfunction, such as cardiac arrest and thrombosis and, at worst, mechanical and terrorism-related airplane crashes. Thus safety measures in the cabin before or after takeoff are undertaken to prevent illnesses or accidents related to flight. In addition, airport quarantine systems are strongly recommended to prepare for any ultimate adverse circumstances. Routine monitoring of environmental risk factors also needs to be considered.

In addition, using myelination as indicator and the anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) as measurement to establish the relationship between the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells and the development of oligodendrocytes, we determined the myelination state of the somatosensory cortex at day 14 postnatal. Rat dams were fed either a control (Cont) or an n-3 PUFA-deficient (Def) diet for 60 days (acclimatisation :14 days; gestation: 21 days; lactation:21 days). Pups lactated from dams throughout the experiment. The distribution pattern of astrocytes in pups on day 7 postnatal was immunohistochemically analysed using GFAP and brain lipid binding protein (BLBP) as markers for mature astrocytes and astrocyte-specific radial glial cells, respectively. It was observed that, when compared with Cont pups, GFAP-positive cells decreased, BLBP-positive cells increased and myelinated structures were sparser in the somatosensory cortices of Def pups. In the open field test on day 21 postnatal, behavioural parameters did not differ between groups. Our results indicated that inhibited maturation of astrocytes caused by maternal n-3 PUFA deficiency hindered the development of brain glial cells of neonatal rats and hence, maternal n-3 PUFA intake during the gestation and lactation periods may have been crucial for the brain cell composition of pups.","output":"Inhibited maturation of astrocytes caused by maternal n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake deficiency hinders the development of brain glial cells in neonatal rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is showing signs of geopolitical and geo-economical imbalance, which threatens the international community with new crisis shocks This is indicated by a slowdown in the growth of the world economy and trade, neo-protectionism and increasing sanction measures, financial \\"hand-wringing\\" of \\"undesirable\\" regimes, the incessant military actions in Syria, the \\"frozen\\", but with that not less the destructive conflict in Ukraine, and many other dangerous phenomena of international life More recently, they have been joined by another \\"black swan\\" - the unexpected event that could critically complicate the economic and political environment, both in individual countries and globally This is certainly the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), the various negative effects of which have yet to be fully assessed But one thing is already clear: coronavirus will have a negative impact on the world economy, \\"push\\" its reversal to the next global crisis and, as a result, the deterioration of the social situation Similarly, the powerful wave of mass sociopolitical protests that swept the world (including a number of Latin American states) requires its comprehensive analysis and reflection In this case, it is necessary to consider this phenomenon in two dimensions: a) the main causes and country features of protests;b) the conditioning of protests by the mega trends of global development, their connection with the fundamental processes that are changing the world order, formed in the age of neoliberal globalization This dual task is even more relevant, because, according to experts of the consulting company Eurasia Group, in 2020, new protests, particularly in Latin America, can become one of the main global risks The facts show that the main reason for the protests in the region has been a growing public discontent with the deepening income gap between the ruling class and the vast majority of the population, rampant corruption, the inability of authorities to resolve accumulated socio-economic problems for the greater public good and overcome the stagnation in which Latin American states live","output":"Protest Potential of the Latin America: Regional Aspect of Global Phenomenon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current study, we investigate the dynamic association of tourism, renewable energy, income, foreign direct investment (FDI), and carbon dioxide (CO(2)e) for Pakistan over 1990C2017.

The specimen collection procedure is time and resource-consuming, but more importantly, it places nurses at risk for potential infection. The practice of allowing patients to self-collect their diagnostic specimens may provide an alternative testing model for the current COVID-19 outbreaks. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy and patient perception of self-collected specimens for respiratory tract infection diagnostics. METHODS: A concise clinical review of the recently published literature was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 11 articles were included the review synthesis. The concept of self-collected specimens has a high patient acceptance rate of 83-99%. Self-collected nasal-swab specimens demonstrated strong diagnostic fidelity for respiratory tract infections with a sensitivity between 80-100%, this is higher than the 76% sensitivity observed with self-collected throat specimens. In a comparative study evaluating a professionally collected to a self-collected specimen for COVID-19 testing, a high degree of agreement (k = 0.89) was observed between the two methods.

RESULTS: We included 234 allo-HSCT recipients with 383 EvRh episodes. Out of 383 EvRh episodes, 98 (25%) had LRTD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified three independent factors associated with LRTD progression: Ig G < 400 mg/dL, community-acquired respiratory virus (CARV) co-infection and high-risk ISI. Inclusion of Ig G levels and CARV co-infection in the ISI improved its performance by significantly increasing the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) from 0.643 to 0.734 (P = .03). Likewise, the two conditions identified by multivariate analyses as associated with higher probability of mortality were high-risk ISI and EvRh infection within 6 months after transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the value of high-risk ISI in predicting both probability of EvRh LRTD and 3-month overall mortality.

This study was designed to add new biomarkers into conventional inflammatory panels to build an optimal combination panel, to better triage patients and predict their outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Biochemical parameters representing multi-organ functions, cytokines, acute-phase proteins, and other inflammatory markers were measured in COVID-19 patients on hospital admission. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, logistic regression, event-free survival (EFS), and Cox analyses were performed to screen and compare the predictive capabilities of the new panel in patients with different illness severity and outcome. RESULTS: This study included 120 patients with COVID-19, consisting of 32 critical, 28 severe, and 60 mild/moderate patients. Initial levels of the selected biomarkers showed a significant difference in the three groups, all of which influenced patient outcome and EFS to varying degrees. Cox proportional hazard model revealed that procalcitonin (PCT) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) were independent risk factors, while superoxide dismutase (SOD) was an independent protective factor influencing EFS. In discriminating the critical and mild patients, a panel combining PCT, IL-6, and neutrophil (NEUT) yielded the best diagnostic performance with an AUC of 0.99, the sensitivity of 90.60% and specificity of 100%. In distinguishing between severe and mild patients, SODs AUC of 0.89 was higher than any other single biomarker. In differentiating the critical and severe patients, the combination of white blood cell count (WBC), PCT, IL-6, IL-10, and SOD achieved the highest AUC of 0.95 with a sensitivity of 75.00% and specificity of 100%.

PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to report the findings, outcomes, and return to sport percentage among adolescent athletes with FAI treated with hip arthroscopy. METHODS A retrospective review of all patients younger than 18 years who underwent hip arthroscopy for FAI at a single institution was performed. All athletes who were attempting to return to sport and underwent hip arthroscopy were included. Patients with previous hip surgery and/or hip conditions were excluded. Arthroscopic procedures and an assessment of intra-articular findings were recorded. Patient-reported outcome measures were recorded at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively, and included the modified Harris hip score, the nonarthritic hip score, hip outcome score-sports subscale, visual analogue scale for pain, and patient satisfaction. Return to sport percentage and ability levels were also noted. RESULTS There were 96 eligible cases of adolescent athletes treated with hip arthroscopy; 81 (84.4%) hips in 69 patients had 2-year follow-up. Running/track and field was the most common sport (25), followed by soccer (12), dance (10), baseball/softball (9), and basketball (6). There were 61 females and 20 males, whose average age was 15.91.2 y (range: 13.1 to 18.0 y). The most common procedures were labral repair (81.5%), iliopsoas fractional lengthening (72.8%), femoroplasty (69.1%), and acetabuloplasty (66.7%). Capsular repair or plication was performed in most patients (81.5%).

Methods- We assessed consecutive adult patients admitted to 2 university hospitals with diagnosis of acute thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses and imaging assessment with magnetic resonance imaging, including paramagnetic-sensitive sequences. Demographics, imaging findings, clinical presentation, and functional outcome at 3 months were analyzed according to the presence of BS. Results- In 118 patients included, BS was observed in gradient-echo T2*weighted (T2*WI) in 16% and susceptibility-weighted imaging in 13% of cases.

Therefore, F glycoprotein seems to have at least two membrane binding sites, one on F(1) and the other on F(2). On the other hand, the disulfide bond which connects the HA(1) and HA(2) subunits of influenza virus is hardly cleaved under non-denaturing conditions. Addition of 8 M urea or 6 M guanidine HCl, which completely inactivates HA activity, was necessary for the splitting of this disulfide bond by thiol compounds. Interestingly, the HA(1) submit was released from the virion after the cleavage. Thus, unlike F(1) and F(2) of HVJ, the HA(1) subunit seems to have no hydrophobic binding site to the membrane. A model for the arrangement of these subunits on the viral membrane is proposed.","output":"The Presence and Cleavage of Interpeptide Disulfide: Bonds in Viral Glycoproteins(1)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This cross-sectional study explored variation of the prevalence of perceived stress, depression and anxiety among different self-identified gender identity groups in the Canadian population during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Anxiety, depression, and stress were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) respectively. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. Results: There were 8267 respondents to the online survey;982 (12.0%) were male-identified, 7120 (86.9%) female-identified, and 92 (1.1%) identified as a diverse gender group. Prevalence rates for clinically meaningful anxiety (333 (41.7%), 2882 (47.6%), 47 (61.0%)), depression (330 (40.2%), 2736 (44.3%), 46 (59.7%)), and stress (702 (79.6%), 5711 (86.4%), 74 (90.2%)) were highest among respondents who self-identified as other genderfollowed by female-identified and then male-identified, respectively. There were statistically significant differences between gender groups for mean scores on GAD-7 (F (2, 6929) = 18.02, p = 0.00), PHQ-9 (F (2191.4) = 11.17, p < 0.001), and PSS (F (2204.6) = 21.13, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Gender identity differences exist in terms of the prevalence and severity of anxiety, depressive, and stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Traces related to the intensity or deviation of organs caused by the disease are recorded systematically and patterned on the iris and its surroundings. The pattern that appears on the iris can be recognized by using image processing techniques. Based on the pattern in the iris image, this paper aims to provide an alternative noninvasive method for the early detection of DM and HC. In this paper, we perform detection based on iris images for two diseases, DM and HC simultaneously, by developing the invariant Haralick feature on quantized images with 256, 128, 64, 32, and 16 gray levels. The feature extraction process does early detection based on iris images. Researchers and scientists have introduced many methods, one of which is the feature extraction of the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Early detection based on the iris is done using the volumetric GLCM development, namely, 3D-GLCM. Based on 3D-GLCM, which is formed at a distance of d = 1 and in the direction of 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315, it is used to calculate Haralick features and develop Haralick features which are invariant to the number of quantization gray levels. The test results show that the invariant feature with a gray level of 256 has the best identification performance. In dataset I, the accuracy value is 97.92, precision is 96.88, and recall is 95.83, while in dataset II, the accuracy value is 95.83, precision is 89.69, and recall is 91.67.

Early detection of PSOD is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with acute stroke. In recent years, an association between reduced spontaneous swallowing frequency (SSF) and OD has been described. Likewise, the reduction of saliva substance P (SP) concentration has been associated with an increased risk of aspiration and a decrease in SSF. In this study we aimed to compare SSF, salivary SP concentration, hydration and nutritional status in post-stroke (PS) patients with and without OD. We included 45 acute PS patients (4.98  2.80 days from stroke onset, 62.22% men, 71.78  13.46 year). The Volume-Viscosity Swallowing Test (V-VST) was performed for clinical diagnosis of OD. SSF/minute was assessed through 10-min neurophysiological surface recordings including suprahyoid-electromyography and cricothyroid-accelerometry. Saliva samples were collected with a Salivette? to determine SP by ELISA. Hydration status was assessed by bioimpedance. Nutritional status was evaluated by Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form (MNA-sf) and blood analysis. Twenty-seven PS patients (60%) had OD; 19 (40%), impaired safety of swallow. SSF was significantly reduced in PSOD, 0.23  0.18 and PSOD with impaired safety, 0.22  0.18 vs 0.48  0.29 swallows/minute in PS without OD (PSnOD); (both p < 0.005). Nutritional risk was observed in 62.92% PSOD vs 11.11% PSnOD (p = 0.007) and visceral protein markers were also significantly reduced in PSOD (p < 0.05). Bioimpedance showed intracellular dehydration in 37.50% PSOD vs none in PSnOD. There were no differences for saliva SP concentrations. SSF is significantly reduced in PSOD in comparison with PSnOD.

We evaluate the risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and hepatic outcomes between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor users and nonusers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cirrhosis. METHODS We selected 2828 paired propensity score matched DPP-4 inhibitor users and nonusers from a cohort of T2DM with compensated liver cirrhosis between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2012. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the risk of main outcomes for DPP-4 inhibitor users. RESULTS The incidence rate of decompensated cirrhosis during follow-up was 2.20 and 1.53 per 100 patient-years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.77) for DPP-4 inhibitor users and nonusers, respectively. The aHRs (95% CI) of variceal bleeding and hepatic failure were 1.67 (1.11-2.52) and 1.35 (1.02-1.79), respectively, for DPP-4 inhibitor users over nonusers. The risk of all-cause mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma, and major cardiovascular events between DPP-4 inhibitor users and nonusers were not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS This study found that DPP-4 inhibitor users were associated with higher risks of decompensated cirrhosis and hepatic failure than did nonusers among patients with T2DM and compensated liver cirrhosis.

DESIGN Step-by-step explanation of the technique in a narrated video. INTERVENTION Contained In Bag Morcellation of myoma after laparoscopic myomectomy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Recent controversy regarding the risk of disseminating occult leiomyosarcomatous tissue during morcellation means we need to revise our current approach to tissue extraction at laparoscopic myomectomy and morcellation in general. Herein we present a novel technique, conceived by Dr. Danny Chou, called the Sydney Contained In Bag Morcellation technique for laparoscopic myomectomy. In this technique an EndoCatch bag (EndoCatch II Auto Suture Specimen Retrieval Pouch; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) is introduced in the typical fashion, the myoma is retrieved, and the mouth of the bag is exteriorized onto the abdominal wall. A 12-mm trocar is then introduced within the bag, and pneumoperitoneum is created before introducing an optical balloon tip port (KII Balloon Blunt Tip System; Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA) and the power morcellator device. Morcellation is then performed within the bag, under direct vision. This technique may offer a safer approach to morcellation because the bowel is not within the morcellation field and there is lower risk of disseminating occult leiomyosarcomatous tissue during morcellation. Subsequent to the morcellation process, suctioning of the bag removes any aerosolized particles of myoma, further minimizing the risk of possible dissemination. CONCLUSION This technique may enable a minimally invasive approach to myomectomy to continue as a viable option in the era since the warning by the US Food and Drug Administration.","output":"Sydney contained in bag morcellation for laparoscopic myomectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remdesivir was recently approved to treat COVID-19.

Among the six components identified in the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf, tryptanthrin and indigodole B (5aR-ethyltryptanthrin) exhibited potent antiviral activity in reducing the CPE and progeny virus production. The IC50 values against virus yield were 1.52 M and 2.60 M for tryptanthrin and indigodole B, respectively. Different modes of time-of-addition/removal assay indicated that tryptanthrin prevented the early and late stages of HCoV-NL63 replication, particularly by blocking viral RNA genome synthesis and papain-like protease 2 activity. Notably, tryptanthrin (IC50 = 0.06 M) and indigodole B (IC50 = 2.09 M) exhibited strong virucidal activity as well. This study identified tryptanthrin as the key active component of S. cusia leaf methanol extract that acted against HCoV-NL63 in a cell-type independent manner. The results specify that tryptanthrin possesses antiviral potential against HCoV-NL63 infection.","output":"Antiviral Action of Tryptanthrin Isolated from Strobilanthes cusia Leaf against Human Coronavirus NL63"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), during pregnancy is a problem worthy of attention, especially in patients with underlying diseases In this case report, we present a case of chronic active hepatitis B with COVID-19 in pregnancy A 31-year-old woman at 29 weeks of gestation who had a history of chronic hepatitis B virus infection discontinued antiviral treatment, was admitted to the hospital with chronic active hepatitis B, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection In this case, we applied liver protective and antiviral agents, and low-dose dexamethasone therapy to successfully treat the critically ill pregnant woman suffering from chronic active hepatitis B combined with COVID-19","output":"Chronic Active Hepatitis B with COVID-19 in Pregnancy: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Logo detection methods usually depend on logo shapes and need for training data or a-priori information on the processed images.

Material and methods: The study included 108 (33.4%) patients with known or unknown DM or prediabetes PD (fasting blood glucose 100-6 mg%) from a group of 323 COVID-19 patients. Age distribution in the first group with DM/PD: 15.7% <= 40 years old, 27.7% 41-60 years old, 52.7% 61-80 years old, 3.7% > 80 years old. Results: We noted a higher percentage in the age group 61-80 and > 80 years old in nondiabetic patients. 92 (85.16%) from the first group and 174 (80.9%) in the second group also associated obesity/overweight. DM/PD were not previously known in 33.4%. 40% required either introduction of insulin or increased doses, due to marked imbalances. Severity of COVID-19 was higher in the DM: 17.6% vs. 53.4% mild forms, 37% vs. 27.9% moderate pneumonias, 45.3% vs. 18.6% severe forms (CT: multiple bilateral \\"ground glass\\" infiltrates or consolidation;respiratory failure) with extrapulmonary complications. Fatality was 12% in the first group and 7.4% in the nondiabetic group. All patients associated increased inflammatory markers (CRP, LDH, ferritin) and lymphopenia. Conclusions: DM was an important risk factor for high severity and fatality of infection even in middle-aged people while SARS-CoV-2 infection determined an imbalanced DM and clinical de novo DM/PD. Obesity was a major risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 in both groups (with or without DM).

METHODS: From August 2018 to April 2020, 130 patients with alloimmune RSA who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into the control group (n = 65) and the study group (n = 65). The former received lymphocyte immunotherapy (LIT), and the latter received Bushen Tiaochong cycle therapy on the basis of LIT. The treatment ended at 12 w of pregnancy. The total score of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes, Th1 cytokine (IL-2), Th2 cytokine (IL-10), and related hormones (chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and progesterone (P)) were compared between the two groups before and after treatment. The positive rate of blocking antibody (BA), pregnancy success rate, and preterm birth rate were counted. RESULT: After treatment, the total score of TCM syndromes, IL-2 level, and Th1/Th2 ratio in the two groups decreased significantly, while the levels of IL-10, hCG, and P increased significantly, and the study group improved significantly compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The positive rate of BA and pregnancy success rate in the study group were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05).

Deeper understanding of vaccines immunogenicity in this population is crucial for adequately planning vaccines programs. The ONCOVac study aimed to comprehensively assess the immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 vaccine in terms of humoral and cellular response. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, single-center study including patients with solid tumours treated with Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i), immunotherapy (IT) or chemotherapy (CT). Patients were enrolled previously to vaccination with mRNA-1273. We also involved health care workers (HCW) to serve as a control group. We took blood samples before first dose administration (BL), after first dose (1D), and after second dose (2D). The primary objective was to compare the rate and magnitude of T-cell response after second dose whereas safety and humoral response were defined as secondary objectives. We also collected patient reported outcomes after both the first and second vaccine dose and a 6-month follow-up period to diagnose incident COVID-19 cases was planned. RESULTS: The rate of specific anti-S serologic positivity (anti-S IgG cut-off point at 7,14 BAU/ml) was significantly higher in HCW compared to PC after 1D (100% vs 83.8%; p=0.04), but similar after 2D (100% vs 95.8%; p=0.5). This difference after 1D was driven by PC treated with CT (100% vs 64.5%; p=0.001). Cellular response after 2D was significantly lower in PC than in HCW for both CD4+ (91.7% vs 59.7%; p=0.001) and CD8+ (94.4% vs 55.6%; p<0.001) T-cells. We found a difference on pre-existing CD4+ T-cell response in HCW comparing to PC (36% and 17%, p=0.03); without difference in pre-existing CD8+ T-cell response (31% and 23%, p=0.5). After excluding patients with pre-existing T-cell response, PC achieved even lower CD4+ (50.9% versus 95.5%, p<0.001) and CD8+ (45.5% versus 95.5%, p<0.001) T-cell response compared with HCW. Regarding safety, PC reported notably more adverse events than HCW (96.6% vs 69.2%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that PC showed a similar humoral response but a lower T-cell response following 2 doses of mRNA-1273 vaccination.

The calculated basic reproduction number of epidemics from the developed model coincided with reported values. There were three control measures considered in this paper: social distancing, self-quarantine and community quarantine. Each control measure was assessed individually at first. Later on, an artificial neural network was used to study the effects of different combinations of control measures. To help quantify the impacts of self-quarantine and community quarantine on outbreak control, both were scaled respectively. The results showed that self-quarantine was more effective than the others, but any individual control measure was ineffective in controlling outbreaks in urban communities. The results also showed that a high level of self-quarantine and general community quarantine, assisted with social distancing, would be recommended for outbreak control. ? 2021, Complex Systems Publications, Inc.

Specifically, the pandemic has demonstrated that burn disaster planning should involve non-burn disasters that threaten staff, supplies, or space. The ABA facilitated bed counts with the assistance of regional disaster coordinators from April through August of 2020. Our analysis examines the impact of the pandemic on burn surge and bed capacity in the U.S. METHODS: Bed availability was obtained by the ABA regional disaster coordinators through an initiative by the Organization and Delivery of Burn Care Committee. Bed availability was defined as immediately available burn beds and categorized as adult, pediatric, or flexible. Surge capacity was defined as the maximum number of patients that a burn center could admit in a surge situation. Data was deidentified by the central office with descriptive statistics to determine bed availability and surge capacity trends regionally and nationally. RESULTS: Bed counts were performed 6 times from 04/17/2020 through 08/14/2020. Response rates from the 137 North American burn centers varied from 86C96%. At least 6 burn centers (5%) were either closed or converted for COVID patients during the initial two bed counts. The total number of adult or pediatric burn beds was 2,082. Total bed availability decreased from 845 at the first survey down to 572 beds at the last survey. Surge capacity baseline was 1,668 beds and decreased from 1,132 beds in the initial survey down to 833 beds in the final survey. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a significant impact on burn bed availability due to the COVID-19 pandemic with a 37% reduction in available burn beds from April to August and a 26% reduction in surge capacity. This study demonstrates a substantial reduction in bed availability during the pandemic with additional analysis in process to examine regional trends.","output":"47 COVID-19 Impact on Burn Care- A Summary of Weekly Bed Counts and Surge Capacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Legal education is one of the most dynamic fields as it deals with varied interest groups and provides an array of programs including undergraduate, graduate, post-graduate and doctoral programs along with various courses and it is this diversity that raises very pertinent questions regarding the pedagogy to be employed.

AIMS: There is an urgent need to understand the risk and protective factors associated with poor mental well-being of UK HCWs working during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Shortly after the April 2020 UK COVID-19 peak 2773 HCWs completed a survey containing measures of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and stress, as well as questions around potential predictors such as roles, COVID-19 risk perception and workplace-related factors. Respondents were classified as high or low symptomatic on each scale and logistic regression revealed factors associated with severe psychiatric symptoms. Change in well-being from pre- to during COVID-19 was also quantified. RESULTS: Nearlya third of HCWs reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression, and the number reporting very high symptoms was more than quadruple that pre-COVID-19. Several controllable factors were associated with the most severe level of psychiatric symptoms: insufficient personal protective equipment availability, workplace preparation, training and communication, and higher workload. Being female, 'front line', previous psychiatric diagnoses, traumatic events, and being an allied HCW or manager were also significantly associated with severe psychiatric symptoms. Sharing stress, resilience and ethical support for treatment decisions were significantly associated with low psychiatric symptoms. Front-line workers showed greater worsening of mental health compared with non-front-line HCWs.

In 2020, the travel and gathering bans due to the global COVID-19 pandemic meant that these meetings were held virtually, primarily via videoconferencing. But can virtual meetings perform the same functions and deliver the same management outcomes as face-to-face meetings? This study is an initial investigation of the experiences, perceptions and attitudes of WCPO region government participants in a number of virtual regional fisheries meetings in 2020. Results indicate a strong preference for face-to-face regional meetings, with the perception that virtual meetings performed comparatively poorly at supporting a number of key meeting processes and outcomes. However, one-quarter to one-third of study participants consistently found no difference between format performance for many meeting processes and outcomes. Virtual formats were considered more appropriate for smaller and non-regional meetings, and allowed for greater staff attendance at meetings as well as cost and time savings for some, but not all, participants. Study participants believe that virtual regional meetings will be more common in the region in the future, despite nearly half indicating that virtual meeting are not a good fit for the region generally. Many of these experiences and perceptions are consistent with organisational behavior, communications media, and information systems literature. Some results appear unique to the regions socially and culturally diverse Pacific island countries and territories, which are relative newcomers to the global information and communication technology revolution.

In this study, we examined public support for phasing out sales and specific measures for moving towards a phase-out among a nationally representative sample of Australian adults. METHODS In December 2019, we used a probability-based online panel, Life in Australia?, to survey n=1939 Australian adults (n=1874 included in analyses due to missing data). RESULTS Almost two-thirds of respondents thought it would be 'a good thing' if there came a time when it was no longer legal to sell cigarettes in shops in Australia and only 16.7% thought it would be 'a bad thing'. After the concept of a phase-out was defined as removing a product from the Australian market over a set period, such as 5 years, but still allowing purchases online from overseas companies, 50.7% indicated support for such a phase-out and 61.8% thought it should happen within 10 years. Support was greater for specific measures such as licensing tobacco retailers (75.3%) and restricting sales to places children cannot enter (76.3%). Support tended to be consistent across demographic subgroups but was stronger among never and former smokers than among current smokers.

The disadvantages, however, include higher cost than outpatient treatment (including costs of meals and staff), greater disruption to patients' lives, and the use of a highly structured and strict schedule that may interrupt the development of patients' autonomy in taking responsibility for their recovery. This study investigated whether reducing costs of a DP and the disruption to patients' lives, and increasing opportunity to develop autonomy, impacted clinical outcomes. Three sequential DP formats were compared in the current study: Format 1 was the most expensive (provision of supported dinners three times/week and extended staff hours); Format 2 included only one dinner/week and provision of a take-home meal. Both formats gave greater support to patients who were not progressing well (i.e., extended admission and extensive support from staff when experiencing feelings of suicidality or self-harm). Format 3 did not provide this greater support but established pre-determined admission lengths and required the patient to step out of the program temporarily when feeling suicidal. Fifty-six patients were included in the analyses: 45% were underweight (body mass index (BMI) < 18.5), 96.4% were female, 63% were given a primary diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (or atypical anorexia nervosa), and mean age was 25.57 years. Clinical outcomes were assessed using self-reported measures of disordered eating, psychosocial impairment, and negative mood, but BMI was recorded by staff. Over admission, 4- and 8-week post-admission, and discharge there were no significant differences between any of the clinical outcomes across the three formats.

While much has been written about how grades discipline students, we argue that the grading regime implemented in US universities and colleges also disciplines individual faculty members as well as their programs and departments. Grading is one way in which a rhetoric of excellence is perpetuated, a rhetoric that enforces a capitalist ethic of production and profitability.

Fibroblasts from patients with mucolipidosis II, a disorder associated with mutations in GNPTAB, are refractory to EBOV, whereas cells from their healthy parents support infection. Impaired infection correlates with loss of the expression of cathepsin B, known to be essential for EBOV entry. GNPTAB activity is dependent upon proteolytic cleavage by the SKI-1/S1P protease. Inhibiting this protease with the small-molecule PF-429242 blocks EBOV entry and infection. Disruption of GNPTAB function may represent a strategy for a host-targeted therapy for EBOV.","output":"A genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase as a potential antiviral target for Ebola virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To bridge the gap between the source and target domains in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), the most common strategy puts focus on matching the marginal distributions in the feature space through adversarial learning. However, such category-agnostic global alignment lacks of exploiting the class-level joint distributions, causing the aligned distribution less discriminative. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel margin preserving self-paced contrastive Learning (MPSCL) model for cross-modal medical image segmentation. Unlike the conventional construction of contrastive pairs in contrastive learning, the domain-adaptive category prototypes are utilized to constitute the positive and negative sample pairs. With the guidance of progressively refined semantic prototypes, a novel margin preserving contrastive loss is proposed to boost the discriminability of embedded representation space. To enhance the supervision for contrastive learning, more informative pseudo-labels are generated in target domain in a self-paced way, thus benefiting the category-aware distribution alignment for UDA. Furthermore, the domain-invariant representations are learned through joint contrastive learning between the two domains. Extensive experiments on cross-modal cardiac segmentation tasks demonstrate that MPSCL significantly improves semantic segmentation performance, and outperforms a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.","output":"Margin Preserving Self-paced Contrastive Learning Towards Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans interact with computers through various devices. Such interactions may not require any physical movement, thus aiding people with severe motor disabilities in communicating with external devices. The brainCcomputer interface (BCI) has turned into a field involving new elements for assistive and rehabilitative technologies. This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to help BCI investigator and investors to decide which devices to select or which studies to support based on the current market examination. This examination of noninvasive EEG devices is based on published BCI studies in different research areas. In this SLR, the research area of noninvasive BCIs using electroencephalography (EEG) was analyzed by examining the types of equipment used for assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative BCIs. For this SLR, candidate studies were selected from the IEEE digital library, PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. The inclusion criteria (IC) were limited to studies focusing on applications and devices of the BCI technology. The data used herein were selected using IC and exclusion criteria to ensure quality assessment. The selected articles were divided into four main research areas: education, engineering, entertainment, and medicine. Overall, 238 papers were selected based on IC. Moreover, 28 companies were identified that developed wired and wireless equipment as means of BCI assistive technology. The findings of this review indicate that the implications of using BCIs for assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative technologies are encouraging for people with severe motor disabilities and healthy people. With an increasing number of healthy people using BCIs, other research areas, such as the motivation of players when participating in games or the security of soldiers when observing certain areas, can be studied and collaborated using the BCI technology.

There is limited understanding, however, of people's experiences of stigma, the underlying drivers, intersections with ethnicity, gender, and citizenship status, and how powerful discourses and social institutions create and perpetuate systems of stigma. This review aims to synthesise and critically analyse qualitative evidence to understand how stigma associated with mental health conditions and AOD use operates among people from migrant and ethnic minority groups. METHODS Qualitative evidence will be identified using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Applied Social Sciences Index and Sociological Abstracts. Two reviewers will screen the titles, abstracts and full-text articles. Eligible studies will include original, empirical, peer-reviewed qualitative evidence, published in English since 1990. Studies must examine stigma in relation to mental health conditions, illicit drug use or alcohol consumption among participants who are from migrant and ethnic minority backgrounds. Studies will be critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for qualitative studies and the level of confidence in the findings will be assessed using Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research. Data will be analysed using the 'best fit' framework synthesis approach, drawing on the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework. DISCUSSION This review will provide an in-depth understanding of the stigma associated with mental health conditions and AOD use among people from migrant and ethnic minority backgrounds.

The ongoing COVID-19 crisis requires understanding as to how the recovery processes should be implemented. This study aims to develop a model for determining the autonomous expenditure multiplier (AEM) values, considering the investment accelerator action. The scientific novelty consists of proving that the AEM is not only an effects enhancer of the government and private investment, but also a tool to specify on the regional industrial map of Russia where investment projects will allow significant economic growth. The works practical significance consists of determining the possibility of applying the AEM as a tool to improve investment efficiency. The key research method was paired linear regression analysis. Based on the developed model, the AEM values for the economies of the five Central Federal District regions are calculated. Additionally, authors provide an explanation on how AEM values correlate to regional economic specialization. For example, atypically low AEM values for Moscow can be explained by high daily workforce movement among Moscow and the Moscow region. The information support difficulties of the proposed model are defined, and the directions to overcome them are proposed. Empirical results show significant differences in the AEM values of the researched regions, and that the AEM as a management tool for interregional investment distribution will help to invest the limited resources of both the state and private businesses more effectively. Additionally, authors establish that the achieved results fall in line with real macroeconomic situations within the regions, which proves that the proposed model reflects real world processes.

Quarantine measures during Chinese New Year effectively alleviated the spread of the epidemic, but they simultaneously resulted in a decline in anthropogenic emissions from industry, transportation, and import and export of goods. Herein, we present the major chemical composition of non-refractory PM2.5 (NR-PM2.5) and the concentrations of gaseous pollutants in an urban site in Shanghai before and during the quarantine period of the COVID-19 epidemic, which was Jan. 8-23 and Jan. 24-Feb. 8, respectively. The observed results show that the reduction in PM2.5 can be mainly attributed to decreasing concentrations of nitrate and primary aerosols. Nitrate accounted for 37% of NR-PM2.5 before the quarantine period when there was no emission reduction. During the quarantine period, the nitrate concentration decreased by approximately 60%, which is attributed to a reduction in the NOx concentration. Ammonium, as the main balancing cation, showed an approximately 45% simultaneous decrease in concentration. The concentrations of chloride and hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols from primary emissions also declined due to limited human activities. By contrast, sulphate and oxygenated organic aerosols showed a slight decrease in concentration, with their contributions increasing to 27% and 18%, respectively, during the quarantine period, which resulted in two pollution episodes with PM2.5 exceeding 100 g/m3. This study provides a better understanding of the impact of quarantine measures on variations of the PM2.5 concentration and chemical compositions. Atmospheric oxidation capacities based on the oxidant (Ox = O3 + NO2) and oxidation ratios have been discussed for elucidating the source and formation of haze in an environment with lower anthropogenic emissions. With increasing contribution of secondary aerosols, lower NOx and nitrate concentrations did not completely avoid haze in Shanghai during the epidemic.","output":"Impact of quarantine measures on chemical compositions of PM2.5 during the COVID-19 epidemic in Shanghai, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causal agent of COronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19), an atypical pneumonia-like syndrome that emerged in December 2019. While SARS-CoV-2 titers can be measured by detection of viral nucleic acid, this method is unable to quantitate infectious virions. Measurement of infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved by tissue culture infectious dose-50 (TCID50 ), which detects the presence or absence of cytopathic effect in cells infected with serial dilutions of a virus specimen. However, this method only provides a qualitative infectious virus titer. Plaque assays are a quantitative method of measuring infectious SARS-CoV-2 by quantifying the plaques formed in cell culture upon infection with serial dilutions of a virus specimen. As such, plaque assays remain the gold standard in quantifying concentrations of replication-competent lytic virions. Here, we describe two detailed plaque assay protocols to quantify infectious SARS-CoV-2 using different overlay and staining methods. Both methods have several advantages and disadvantages, which can be considered when choosing the procedure best suited for each laboratory. These assays can be used for several research purposes, including titration of virus stocks produced from infected cell supernatant and, with further optimization, quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in specimens collected from infected animals. ? 2019 The Authors.

During the study, the wastewater samples from the RCH and the P were negative for SARS-CoV-2 based on qPCRs, except during the fourth week when was detected. Unexpectedly, the wastewater microbiome from RCH and P prior to week four was correlated with the samples collected from the HCF, suggesting a core bacterial community is expelled from the digest tract of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. The microbiota of wastewater sample positives for SARS-CoV-2 was strongly associated with enteric bacteria previously reported in patients with risk factors for COVID-19.

The StEP model accounts for imperfect data by considering probabilistic contacts between individuals based on spatial-temporal proximity of their movement trajectories, creating a robust movement network despite possible missing data and unseen transmission routes. We showcase the potential of StEP for contact tracing with outbreaks of multidrug-resistant bacteria and COVID-19 in a large hospital group in London, UK. In addition to the core structure of contacts that can be recovered using traditional methods of contact tracing, the StEP model reveals missing contacts that connect seemingly separate outbreaks. Comparison with genomic data further confirmed that these additional contacts indeed improve characterisation of disease transmission and so highlights how the StEP framework can inform effective strategies of infection control and prevention.","output":"Characterising contact in disease outbreaks via a network model of spatial-temporal proximity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BAX is a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family, which regulates the balance between cellular life and death. During homeostasis, BAX predominantly resides in the cytosol as a latent monomer but, in response to stress, transforms into an oligomeric protein that permeabilizes the mitochondria, leading to apoptosis. Because renegade BAX activation poses a grave risk to the cell, the architecture of BAX must ensure monomeric stability yet enable conformational change upon stress signaling. The specific structural features that afford both stability and dynamic flexibility remain ill-defined and represent a critical control point of BAX regulation. We identify a nexus of interactions involving four residues of the BAX core 5 helix that are individually essential to maintaining the structure and latency of monomeric BAX and are collectively required for dimeric assembly. The dual yet distinct roles of these residues reveals the intricacy of BAX conformational regulation and opportunities for therapeutic modulation.","output":"The conformational stability of pro-apoptotic BAX is dictated by discrete residues of the protein core"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Novara-COVID score was developed to help the Emergency Physician to decide which Coronavirus disease (COVID) patient required hospitalization at emergency department (ED) presentation and to which intensity of care.

The Novara-COVID score was systematically applied to all COVID patients since its introduction in clinical practice and adopted to decide patients' destination. The ability of the Novara-COVID score to predict in-hospital clinical stability and in-hospital mortality were evaluated through multivariable logistic regression and Cox Regression Hazard models, respectively. RESULTS Among the 480 COVID patients admitted to the ED, 338 were hospitalized: the Novara-COVID score was 0-1 in 49.7%, 2 in 24.6%, 3 in 15.4% and 4-5 in 10.3% of patients. Novara-COVID score values of 3 and 4-5 were associated with lower clinical stability with adjusted odds ratios of 0.28 [0.13-0.59] and 0.03 [0.01-0.12], respectively.

The Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia implemented MoH guidance by: 1) extending antiretroviral therapy (ART) refill duration to 6 multi-month dispensation (6MMD) and 2) task-shifting communication and mobilisation of those in HIV care to collect their next ART refill early. We assessed the impact of COVID-19 mitigation guidance on HIV care 3 months before and after guidance implementation. METHODS: We reviewed all ART pharmacy visit data in the national HIV medical record for PLHIV in care having 1 visit between 1 January30 June 2020 at 59 HIV care facilities in Lusaka Province, Zambia. We undertook a beforeCafter evaluation using mixed-effects Poisson regression to examine predictors and marginal probability of early clinic return (pharmacy visit >7 days before next appointment), proportion of late visit (>7 days late for next appointment) and probability of receiving a 6MMD ART refill. RESULTS: A total of 101 371 individuals (64% female, median age 39) with 130 486 pharmacy visits were included in the analysis. We observed a significant increase in the adjusted prevalence ratio (4.63; 95% CI 4.45 to 4.82) of early return before compared with after guidance implementation. Receipt of 6MMD increased from a weekly mean of 47.9% (95% CI 46.6% to 49.2%) before to 73.4% (95% CI 72.0% to 74.9%) after guidance implementation.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the development of at-home dance programs delivered digitally through live and pre-recorded media, but little is known about how participants may engage with and benefit from these resources. Objective. This study explored experiences and potential benefits of digital dance resources among healthy older adults and individuals with neurological conditions. Methods. An online survey consisting of fixed-choice and open questions was designed in collaboration with dance program providers and distributed between June and November 2020. Results. High levels of engagement in at-home dance programs were found among healthy older adults (N = 149) and individuals with PD (N = 178). Sensorimotor outcomes (e.g., balance, posture) were more widely reported among individuals with PD, while older adults reported similar numbers of sensorimotor and non-motor (e.g., mood, confidence) outcomes. The use of strategies (imagery and vocalising) during participation were differentially associated with outcomes in older adults and PD groups. At-home dance was found to offer convenience and flexibility, but participants missed the interaction, support and routine of in-person classes. The majority expressed a preference to continue with both digital and in-person participation in the future. Qualitative analysis of participants comments reinforced the quantitative findings, while also revealing that online dance could help to maintain connection and well-being, and identifying further considerations for improving accessibility and facilitating digital engagement.

However, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially the protected SARS-CoV-2 RNA (pRNA) with infectious particles in waterways, is still largely unexplored. In this study, we developed a model to estimate SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the risk source in the excretion of patients to the final exposure in surface water. The model simulated the spatial and temporal distribution of the viral pRNA concentrations in the surface water of the Elbe watershed from March 2020 to January 2021. The results show that the WWTPs with the maximum capacity of >10,000 population equivalents were responsible for 95% of the viral load discharged into the surface water. We estimated the pRNA concentrations in surface water to be 1.33  10?2 copiesL?1 on average in the watershed based on the model simulation on viral transmission. It had considerable variations in spatial and temporal scales, which are dominantly controlled by epidemic situations and virus transport with decay in water, respectively. A quantitative microbial risk assessment was conducted to estimate the viral infection probability from surface water ingestion with consideration of the influence of toilet usage frequency and gender/age population groups. All the infection probabilities in the study period were lower than the reference risk levels of 10?4 and 10?5. The individuals aged 15C34 years had the highest infection probability of 4.86  10?9 on average from surface water ingestion during swimming activities.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cohorting hospitalized patients with COVID-19 to reduce in-hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but it is unknown if occupational and non-occupational behaviors differ based on exposure to COVID-19 units. METHODS: We analyzed a subset of HCP from an ongoing CDC-funded SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance study. HCP were recruited from four Atlanta hospitals of different sizes and patient populations. All HCP completed a baseline REDCap survey. We used logistic regression to compare occupational activities and infection prevention practices among HCP stratified by exposure to COVID-19 units: low (0% of shifts), medium (1C49% of shifts) or high (50% of shifts). RESULTS: Of 211 HCP enrolled (36% emergency department [ED] providers, 35% inpatient RNs, 17% inpatient MDs/APPs, 7% radiology technicians and 6% respiratory therapists [RTs]), the majority (79%) were female and the median age was 35 years. Nearly half of the inpatient MD/APPs (46%) and RNs (47%) and over two-thirds of the RTs (67%) worked primarily in the ICU. Aerosol generating procedures were common among RNs, MD/APPs, and RTs (26C58% performed 1), but rare among ED providers (0C13% performed 1). Compared to HCP with low exposure to COVID-19 units, those with medium or high exposure spent a similar proportion of shifts directly at the bedside and were about as likely to practice universal masking. Being able to consistently social distance from co-workers was rare (33%); HCP with high exposure to COVID-19 units were less likely to report social distancing in the workplace compared to those with low exposure; however, this was not significantly different (OR 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3, 1.1). Concerns about personal protective equipment in COVID-19 units were similar across levels of exposure (Table 1). Table 1: Occupational activities and infection prevention behaviors of healthcare personnel stratified by level of exposure to COVID-19 units [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The proportion of time spent in dedicated COVID-19 units did not appear to influence time HCP spend directly at the bedside or infection prevention practices (social distancing and universal masking) in the workplace. Risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCP may depend more on factors acting at the individual level rather than those related to location of work.

As such, the corresponding mathematical models and their simulations are central tools to guide political decision-making. Typically, ODE-based models are considered, in which fractions of infected and healthy individuals change deterministically and continuously over time. In this work, we translate an ODE-based COVID-19 spreading model from literature to a stochastic multi-agent system and use a contact network to mimic complex interaction structures. We observe a large dependency of the epidemic's dynamics on the structure of the underlying contact graph, which is not adequately captured by existing ODE-models. For instance, existence of super-spreaders leads to a higher infection peak but a lower death toll compared to interaction structures without super-spreaders. Overall, we observe that the interaction structure has a crucial impact on the spreading dynamics, which exceeds the effects of other parameters such as the basic reproduction number R0. We conclude that deterministic models fitted to COVID-19 outbreak data have limited predictive power or may even lead to wrong conclusions while stochastic models taking interaction structure into account offer different and probably more realistic epidemiological insights.","output":"Importance of Interaction Structure and Stochasticity for Epidemic Spreading: A COVID-19 Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The recent discovery of SARS-CoV-2 and the disease COVID-19 which affects different organs and systems, mainly the respiratory one, representing a new challenge for physicians.

OBJECTIVE: to communicate a case of acute pancreatitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, to contribute to the knowledge of this new virus and its possible forms of presentation. CLINICAL CASE: An eleven-year-old male adolescent, with no history of contact with people confirmed or suspected of COVID-19, was admitted to the hospital with a 3-day history of periumbilical and epigastric abdominal pain, vomiting, and absence of stools, with no other symptoms. The laboratory tests showed increased pancreatic enzymes. Com puted tomography was compatible with acute edematous pancreatitis, without signs of biliary patho logy, diagnosing acute pancreatitis, at the same time that SARS-CoV-2 was isolated in the respiratory tract. Other possible differential diagnoses and history of epidemiological contact were ruled out. The patient was managed in the Critical Patient Unit with support measures. He evolved favorably, without respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be associated with atypical presentations, including acute pancreatitis.

Inflammatory factors have the potential to either enhance the efficiency of host immune responses or damage the host organs with immune overreaction in COVID-19. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the functions of inflammatory factors and serum markers that participate in disease progression. Methods: : In total, 54 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study. Disease severity was evaluated by clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and computed tomography (CT) scans. Data were collected at: admission, 3C5 days after admission, when severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection became negative, and composite endpoint. Results: : We found that the positive rate in sputum was three times higher than that in throat swabs. Higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer (D-D), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR) or lower lymphocyte counts suggested more severe disease, and the levels of cytokines and serum markers were intrinsically correlated with disease progression. When SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection became negative, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that LDH had the highest sensitivity independently, and four indicators (NLR, CRP, LDH, and D-D) when combined had the highest sensitivity in distinguishing critically ill patients from mild ones. Conclusions: : Monitoring dynamic changes in NLR, CRP, LDH, IL-6, and D-D levels, combined with CT imaging and viral RNA detection in sputum, could aid in severity evaluation and prognosis prediction and facilitate COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Combined Indexes of Serum NLR, CRP, LDH, IL-6 and D-Dimer Levels are a Biomarker of Disease Severity and Prognostic Predictor in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) has spread rapidly around the world since its emergence in humans last December.

A prerequisite for this devastating zoonosis was the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein to use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry. Although the S protein of the closest related bat virus, RaTG13, shows high similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein it does not efficiently interact with the human ACE2 receptor2. Here, we show that a single T403R mutation allows the RaTG13 S to utilize the human ACE2 receptor for infection of human cells and intestinal organoids. Conversely, mutation of R403T in the SARS-CoV-2 S significantly reduced ACE2-mediated virus infection. The S protein of SARS-CoV-1 that also uses human ACE2 also contains a positive residue (K) at this position, while the S proteins of CoVs utilizing other receptors vary at this location. Our results indicate that the presence of a positively charged amino acid at position 403 in the S protein is critical for efficient utilization of human ACE2.

METHODS: A cost-utility analysis, conducted from the base-case perspective of the National Health Service and personal and social services, estimated the incremental cost per incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and years in full capability (YFC). A secondary analysis combined the costs with a broad set of outcomes within a cost-consequence framework, from a societal perspective. A Markov-type decision-analytic model was developed to project short-term changes in physical activity to long-term outcomes and costs, over a 5- and 15-year time horizon. RESULTS: The results of the within-trial analysis show that SMS+ERS is highly likely to be cost-effective compared to ERS alone (ICER ?4270/QALY), but not compared to UC. Participants allocated to the SMS+ERS group also showed an improvement in YFC compared to ERS alone and UC. The long-term analysis revealed that SMS+ERS is likely to be a cost-effective option compared to ERS and UC over a 5-year, but not with a 15-year horizon, being then dominated by ERS alone. CONCLUSION: This research provides new evidence that SMS is a cost-effective add-on to ERS strategies.

METHODS A retrospective study was performed on 4,609 COVID-19 patients from five ethnic groups to assess the impact and distribution of different blood types and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. The study was carried out between November 2020 and June 2021 in the College of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University in collaboration with the General Directorate of Health Affairs, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. RESULTS Blood group (A, B, and O) distributions in 2,617 COVID-19 patients with local control populations was done. Our study found that in both Saudi and non-Saudi populations, blood groups O and A were associated with higher infection rates, whereas blood group AB was associated with lower infection rates (p=0.0001). COVID-19 seems to be associated with blood groups A, B, and AB (RR=3.23, 95% CI=2.702-3.821, p=0.0001). COVID-19 risk was lower in people with O blood group (RR=0.783, 95% CI=0.733-0.836, p=0.0001).

METHODS: We developed and evaluated a foundational telemedicine workshop during a pandemic (158 students in 28 groups) guided by principles to maximize learner engagement during remote learning, including use of discrete, time-limited activities (self-assessment, templated group exercises, review of brief multimedia, and active role-play.) RESULTS: Students completed pre- and postsession surveys to assess session impact. Of 158 students, 92 (58%) completed the presession survey, and 36 (23%) completed the postsession survey. There was an increase in confidence in all areas, particularly in skills related to starting the encounter, minimizing barriers, and taking the medical history. Learners reported the physical examination content as more useful than any other area and valued the exemplar videos provided.

We retrospectively compared postoperative outcomes with two different meshes commonly used in LIVHR. METHODS This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent incisional hernia repair between January 2008 and December 2010. Two meshes were used: Parietex? Composite (Covidien, New Haven, CT, USA) and the DynaMesh?-IPOM (FEG Textiltechnik mbH, Aachen, Germany). The two groups were compared with respect to recurrence rates, incidence of seroma and intestinal obstruction. RESULTS Among the 88 patients who underwent LIVHR, 75 patients (85.2%) presented with primary incisional hernia, 10 (11.4%) presented with a first recurrence and 3 (3.4%) presented with a second recurrence. Median follow-up was 53.6 months (range 40-61 months). 12.9% of patients had recurrence in the Parietex? Composite mesh group (n=62) in comparison to 3.8% in the DynaMesh?-IPOM mesh group (n=26; P=0.20). DynaMesh?-IPOM was associated with a significantly higher incidence of intestinal obstruction secondary to adhesions (11.5% vs. 0%, P=0.006) and lower incidence of seroma and haematoma formation compared to Parietex? composite mesh group (0% vs. 6.4% of patients; P=0.185). CONCLUSIONS LIVHR is a safe and feasible technique. Dynamesh?-IPOM is associated with a significantly higher incidence of adhesion related bowel obstruction, albeit with a lower incidence of recurrence, seroma and haematoma formation compared with Parietex? Composite mesh. However, there is a need for further well-designed, multicentre randomised controlled studies to investigate the use of these meshes.","output":"Parietex?

IVIG and SCIg are suitable alternatives to treat patients with PAD but vary in key ways. Existing evidence on patient preferences for Ig treatments given the complexities associated with IVIG and SCIg treatment is limited and fails to account for variations in preferences across patients. For this reason, we sought to evaluate PAD patient preferences for features of IVIG and SCIg across different patient characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 119 PAD patients completed a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey. The DCE asked respondents to make choices between carefully constructed treatment alternatives described in terms of generic treatment features. Choices from the DCE were analyzed to determine the relative influence of attribute changes on treatment preferences. We used subgroup analysis to evaluate systematic variations in preferences by patients age, gender, time since diagnosis, and treatment experience. RESULTS: Patients were primarily concerned about the duration of treatment side effects, but preferences were heterogeneous. This was particularly true around administration features. Time since diagnosis was associated with an increase in patients concerns with the number of needles required per infusion. Also, patients appear to prefer the kind of therapy they are currently using which could be the result of properly aligned patient preferences or evidence of patient adaptive behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity in preferences for Ig replacement treatments suggests that a formal shared decision making process could have an important role in improving patient care.","output":"Primary Immune Deficiency: Patients Preferences for Replacement Immunoglobulin Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the many challenges facing doctors in training during the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant reduction in postgraduate medical education in the form of formal teaching.

While efforts have been made to serve LGBT older adults, traditional forms of in person outreach and service may still be inaccessible to those living in rural areas, with restricted mobility, due to lack of transportation, during inclement weather, or in public health situations as the Covid-19 pandemic. We conducted focus group discussions to understand the role of virtual outreach in serving LGBT individuals' needs in their later years of life. Study participants expressed a desire for dating, community, aging in place, and affirming health care. However, their experience of internalized and institutional homophobia and ageism may act as barriers in fulfilling those needs. A dedicated virtual space has the potential to overcome these barriers by facilitating online get-togethers, support groups, dating events, having coming out resources, and exchanging information on LGBT friendly health services.

These variations in preparedness and policy may lead to different death tolls from Covid-19 as well as from other diseases. We applied an ensemble of 16 Bayesian probabilistic models to vital statistics data to estimate the impacts of the pandemic on weekly all-cause mortality for 40 industrialised countries from mid-February 2020 through mid-February 2021, before a large segment of the population was vaccinated in any of these countries. Taken over the entire year, an estimated 1,401,900 (95% credible interval 1,259,700-1,572,500) more people died in these 40 countries than would have been expected had the pandemic not taken place. This is equivalent to 140 (126-157) additional deaths per 100,000 people and a 15% (13-17) increase in deaths over this period in all of these countries combined. In Iceland, Australia and New Zealand, mortality was lower over this period than what would be expected if the pandemic had not occurred, while South Korea and Norway experienced no detectable change in mortality. In contrast, the populations of the USA, Czechia, Slovakia and Poland experienced at least 20% higher mortality. There was substantial heterogeneity across countries in the dynamics of excess mortality. The first wave of the pandemic, from mid-February to the end of May 2020, accounted for over half of excess deaths in Scotland, Spain, England and Wales, Canada, Sweden, Belgium and Netherlands. At the other extreme, the period between mid-September 2020 and mid-February 2021 accounted for over 90% of excess deaths in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Latvia, Montenegro, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.

Home confinement during COVID-19 made this less feasible. Our objective was to ascertain whether a transition to virtual online meetings among TS members took place, and whether it was potentially effective. METHODS: Two thousand one hundred fifty-two long-standing USA members of Narcotics Anonymous (NA) were surveyed to ascertain their recovery-related experiences and their relation to the transition to virtual meetings. RESULTS: During the previous week (ie, during COVID-19) respondents attended more virtual meetings ([Formula: see text] = 4.13[SD4.64]) than they had attended both face-to-face meetings before COVID-19 ([Formula: see text] = 3.35[SD2.05]), and also face-to-face meetings during COVID-19 ([Formula: see text] = 0.75[SD1.8]). Many of the meetings were accessed from sites remote from their homes (44.4%), even overseas (21.5%). The majority (64.9%) found virtual meetings at least as effective in promoting their abstinence as were face-to-face meetings, and 41.8% estimated the same for newcomers. A shorter period of antecedent abstinence from drugs and increased loneliness were associated with increased craving during the transition period. Relative to Whites, Black respondents were less distressed, with a lesser increase in craving, and currently attended more virtual meetings. Data provided by a national program reflected a large increase in virtual TS attendance since the onset of the pandemic.

However, there has been no recent comprehensive review of this emerging field. This paper summarises how mathematical models have informed the field of HCAI and how methods have developed over time. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL plus and Global Health databases were systematically searched for dynamic mathematical models of HCAI transmission and/or the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings. RESULTS: In total, 96 papers met the eligibility criteria. The main research themes considered were evaluation of infection control effectiveness (64%), variability in transmission routes (7%), the impact of movement patterns between healthcare institutes (5%), the development of antimicrobial resistance (3%), and strain competitiveness or co-colonisation with different strains (3%). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly modelled HCAI (34%), followed by vancomycin resistant enterococci (16%). Other common HCAIs, e.g. Clostridum difficile, were rarely investigated (3%). Very few models have been published on HCAI from low or middle-income countries. The first HCAI model has looked at antimicrobial resistance in hospital settings using compartmental deterministic approaches. Stochastic models (which include the role of chance in the transmission process) are becoming increasingly common. Model calibration (inference of unknown parameters by fitting models to data) and sensitivity analysis are comparatively uncommon, occurring in 35% and 36% of studies respectively, but their application is increasing. Only 5% of models compared their predictions to external data. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission models have been used to understand complex systems and to predict the impact of control policies. Methods have generally improved, with an increased use of stochastic models, and more advanced methods for formal model fitting and sensitivity analyses. Insights gained from these models could be broadened to a wider range of pathogens and settings.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on depressive symptoms in recovered patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in a quasi-experimental design. A sample of 150 recovered patients with COVID-19 who referred to Imam Reza Hospital in Tabriz city, were selected by random sampling method. The patients emotionalCpsychological status was assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory, and they entered the treatment process according to the inclusion criteria. As a therapeutic intervention, a scientific and valid approach called CBT was implemented, which two occupational therapists performed in eight treatment sessions in the context of a social communication application. Paired sample t-test was used to analyze the time sequence of quantitative data due to its normality. RESULTS: After the last session of the intervention, the effect of this therapeutic approach on reducing the depressive symptoms of patients was evaluated. According to the findings, the Beck score of the participants decreased significantly after the intervention (MD = ?45/9, P < 0/001).

The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the SyMS in a sample of patients with NMOSD. METHODS: A non-interventional, cross-sectional study in adult subjects with NMOSD (Wingerchuk 2015 criteria) was conducted at 13 neuroimmunology clinics applying the SyMS. A non-parametric item response theory procedure, Mokken analysis, was performed to assess the underlying dimensional structure and scalability of items and overall questionnaire. All analyses were performed with R (v4.0.3) using the mokken library. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were studied (mean age: 47.5  15 years, 80% female, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score: 3.0 [interquartile range 1.5, 4.5]). Symptom severity was low (median SyMS score: 19.0 [interquartile range 10.0, 32.0]). The SyMS showed a robust internal reliability (Cronbachs alpha: 0.90 [95% confidence interval 0.86, 0.93]) and behaved as a unidimensional scale with all items showing scalability coefficients > 0.30. The overall SyMS scalability was 0.45 conforming to a medium scale according to Mokkens criteria. Fatigue and body pain were the domains with the highest scalability coefficients.

Application of the da Vinci S or Si robotic platforms could potentially overcome these challenges. OBJECTIVE Compare our initial experience with robotic assisted laparoendoscopic single-site (R-LESS) pyeloplasty to our latter experience with C-LESS pyeloplasty (ie, after the initial 15 patients). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-institution retrospective observational cohort study involved consecutive patients who presented with symptomatic ureteropelvic junction obstruction and who were deemed suitable for single-incision pyeloplasty by the treating surgeon. MEASUREMENTS Demographic, clinical, perioperative, and early postoperative comparative outcomes. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Ten patients each underwent R-LESS or C-LESS pyeloplasty by a single surgeon between March 2009 and July 2011. For R-LESS and C-LESS groups, age, gender distribution, body mass index, proportion of patients with prior abdominal surgery, estimated blood loss, and hospital length of stay were statistically similar. Mean operative time was significantly longer for R-LESS (226 vs 188 min; p=0.007). C-LESS pyeloplasty alone required an accessory port for the anastomosis in 10 of 10 cases. Two conversions to standard laparoscopy and two postoperative complications occurred in 3 of 10 patients in the C-LESS group, compared with no conversions and one postoperative complication in the R-LESS group (p=0.26). Study limitations are a retrospective design, a modest number of patients, and a lack of quantification of subjective outcomes such as instrument clashing and maneuverability. CONCLUSIONS Adaptation of the da Vinci Si robotic surgical platform to laparoendoscopic single-site pyeloplasty appears to reduce the physical learning curve for this complex procedure. Future prospective, comprehensive evaluation of additional outcomes including subjective parameters, cosmesis, and longer term functional outcomes will help better define its role in minimally invasive dismembered pyeloplasty and better estimate its associated learning curve.","output":"Perioperative comparison of robotic assisted laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) pyeloplasty versus conventional LESS pyeloplasty."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and quickly became a global pandemic.

Four groups of 30 molecules each were considered: oxadiazolone, oxadiazolthione, thiadiazolone, and thiadiazolthione isomers. The compounds were categorized into six groups according to permutations of three heteroatoms in the five-membered ring. Additionally, each of the constitutional isomer was considered to have five tautomers conserving stable five-membered ring: two NH tautomers, two rotameric OH (or SH) forms and one CH(2) tautomer. It appeared that the largest difference between oxadiazolone O and S analogues is produced by the kind of chalcogen atom in the ring, which is strained when the O atom is in the ring while much less strained when the S-atom, of much larger van der Waals radius, is built into the ring. The external chalcogen is only modifying the general energetic factors. The comparison of energetics of analogous groups of molecules with thiadiazole and oxadiazole rings is done in details as well as differences resulting from different external chalcogen atoms are discussed as well. The presence of water surrounding was mimicked with the IEF-PCM implicit water model which did not change general isomer relative stability picture, but for some special cases indicated an extra stability of the forms with external OH or SH groups. The aromaticity monitored by the structural HOMA aromaticity index shows that the systems are not additionally stabilized by pi-electron delocalization. The fair linear correlation between the aromaticity indices of oxadiazolones and oxadiazolthiones shows that the pi-electron system in the studied systems is not sensitive to change of the external chalcogen group.","output":"On constitutional isomers and tautomers of oxadiazolones and their mono- and disulfur analogues (C(2)H(2)N(2)XY; X, Y = S, O)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an industry already short of workers, hospitals and healthcare facilities are facing serious staffing shortages in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic As publ","output":"Lower Barriers to Immigrant Healthcare Workers to Help Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the ability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-elicited antibodies to neutralize and protect against emerging variants of concern and other sarbecoviruses is key for guiding vaccine development decisions and public health policies.

Anxiety and depression levels both declined across the first 20 weeks following the introduction of lockdown in England (b=-193, SE=026, p<00001 for anxiety; b=-252, SE=028, p<00001 for depressive symptoms). The fastest decreases were seen across the strict lockdown period (between weeks 2 and 5), with symptoms plateauing as further lockdown easing measures were introduced (between weeks 16 and 20). Being a woman or younger, having lower educational attainment, lower income, or pre-existing mental health conditions, and living alone or with children were all risk factors for higher levels of anxiety and depression at the start of lockdown. Many of these inequalities in experiences were reduced as lockdown continued, but differences were still evident 20 weeks after the start of lockdown. INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that the highest levels of depression and anxiety occurred in the early stages of lockdown but declined fairly rapidly, possibly because individuals adapted to circumstances. Our findings emphasise the importance of supporting individuals in the lead-up to future lockdowns to try to reduce distress, and highlight that groups already at risk for poor mental health before the pandemic have remained at risk throughout lockdown and its aftermath.

We sought to characterize patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) identified after admission for COVID-19. METHODS: All adult patients admitted to Montefiore Medical Center from March 1, 2020, to April 10, 2020, and undergoing lower extremity venous duplex for DVT evaluation were included. Patients admitted with suspicion of COVID-19 were divided into severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative groups based on in-hospital test results. Patients without clinical suspicion for COVID-19 were not tested. A retrospective case-control study design was used to identify potential risk factors for DVT in patients with COVID-19. Demographic, radiographic, and laboratory values were abstracted and analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, 3404 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the hospital. Of the 135 SARS-CoV-2 patients who underwent duplex scanning, there were 18 (13.3%) noted to have DVT compared with 72 of the 711 patients (10.1%) who were either SARS-CoV-2 negative or untested. The odds ratio for DVT in COVID-19 was 1.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.78-2.34; P = .289). Baseline characteristics for COVID-19 patients with and without DVT were overall similar. COVID-19 patients with DVT had an elevated median first d-dimer (18.88 g/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 7.79-20.00] vs 2.55 g/mL [IQR, 1.45-6.28]; P = .002; reference value, <0.5 g/mL), average in-hospital d-dimer (median, 11.93 g/mL [IQR, 8.25-16.97] vs 3.54 g/mL [IQR, 2.05-8.53]; P < .001) and median fibrinogen level (501.0 [IQR, 440.0-629.0] vs 654.5 [IQR, 535.8-780.0]; P = .002; reference range, 187-502 mg/dL). There was a trend to significance for COVID-19 patients with DVT compared with without DVT in median d-dimer levels at the time of the duplex (13.61 g/mL [IQR, 4.04-19.97] vs 3.58 g/mL [IQR, 2.51-9.62]; P = .055) and median ferritin levels (1679.0 ng/mL [IQR, 1168.0-2577.0] vs 1103.0 ng/mL [IQR, 703.5-2076.5]; P = .055; reference range, 25-270 ng/mL). Twelve of the 18 patients with COVID who developed DVT did so despite chemical thromboprophylaxis, and 2 developed DVT despite therapeutic anticoagulation CONCLUSIONS: We found only a modestly increased risk of DVT in patients with COVID-19, likely underestimated owing to limitations in duplex testing early in the epidemic. Elevated d-dimer and a less elevated fibrinogen are associated with DVT in patients with COVID-19 who seem to form thrombus despite conventional chemical thromboprophylaxis. Additionally, an increasing d-dimer over time may be a reflection of the development of DVT in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Clinical characteristics of acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis diagnosed by duplex in patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Post-infectious/immune mediated effects of COVID-19 infection include descriptions of Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) in patients usually with respiratory failure and after 1-2 weeks from the onset of viral illness.

But pathogens cannot been seen as unique entities; their intra-specific genetic variability represented in variants, strains, antigenic types or genetic lineages may cause different impacts at the population level (Nelson & Holmes, 2007; Greenspan et al., 2018). The global spread of pathogens has been largely facilitated by globalization of transport, which particularly intensified during the last century (O'Hanlon et al., 2018). As seen with SARS-CoV-2, air travel can rapidly spread a pathogen globally (Wells et al., 2020). Furthermore, after initial introduction subsequent translocations of a pathogen may cause the contact of different variants facilitating the rise of novel genotypes that may have higher pathogenicity or transmissibility (Nelson & Holmes, 2007; Greenspan et al., 2018). Chytridiomycosis is an EID caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), that infects amphibian skin causing population declines to extinction in susceptible species. Now a wildlife pandemic, Bd has been recognized as the single pathogen causing the greatest loss of biodiversity on Earth (Scheele et al., 2019). Recent advances in genetics have made novel tools for pathogen detection and characterization more accessible and reliable (Boyle et al., 2004; Byrne et al., 2019). In this issue of Molecular Ecology Resources, Ghosh et al. (2021) develop a new genotyping qPCR assay targeting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Bd, and based on non-invasive swab samples (Fig. 1), discriminate between the two most globally widespread and pathogenic genetic lineages of Bd.

METHODS We recruited 37 patients with primary progressive MS and 21 healthy controls for an observational cohort study. Structural connectomes were reconstructed based on diffusion-weighted imaging data using probabilistic tractography and analyzed with graph theory. RESULTS We observed the same topological organization of brain networks in patients and controls. Consistent with the originally defined rich-club regions, we identified superior frontal, precuneus, superior parietal, and insular cortex in both hemispheres as rich-club nodes. Connectivity within the rich club was significantly reduced in patients with MS (p = 0.039). The extent of reduced rich-club connectivity correlated with clinical measurements of mobility (Kendall rank correlation coefficient  = -0.20, p = 0.047), hand function ( = -0.26, p = 0.014), and information processing speed ( = -0.20, p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS In patients with primary progressive MS, the fundamental organization of the structural connectome in rich-club and peripheral nodes was preserved and did not differ from healthy controls.

The fixed-effect model and generalized method of moments were used to check the nexus between the constructs. Findings: The results revealed that green finance along with capital formation and government educational expenditures have a positive association with the economic development of ASEAN countries.

These limitations provide opportunities to future researchers and authors to expand the scope and accuracy of their study. This research investigation has been supported by the data collected from a single source. Though data collection is maintained correctly, it is still recommended to the upcoming scholars to acquire data to reconfirm the same findings using multiple data sources. The data collected from using some specific data source may be limited in scope and may hinder the comprehensive elaboration of the underlying variables and their mutual relationship. Therefore, the utilization of multiple sources of data collection gives data sufficient to meet the requirement of an okay quality research study. The study is about the economies of ASEAN countries. It checks the influences of green finance development on economic activities and the country's economic growth in ASEAN countries' economies. Thus, its results are valid only in the economies of these countries, and this research investigation lacks generalizability. For generalizability, the authors must consider the underlying variables in the world's vast economies. They must adopt a standard scale to judge the impacts of green financial development on economic development. Besides, the study analyzes the economic factors, economic conditions and their effects on the country's position in the world economy in the face of a severe epidemic like COVID-19.

Literature shows that collectively experienced situations can motivate people to help each other. Since societal discontent is conceptualized as a collective phenomenon, we argue that it could influence intention to help others, particularly those who suffer from coronavirus. Thus, in the present study, we aimed (a) to explore the relationship between societal discontent and intention to help at the individual level and (b) to investigate a possible moderating effect of societal discontent at the country level on this relationship. To fulfil our purposes, we used data collected in 42 countries (N = 61,734) from the PsyCorona Survey, a cross\\\\national longitudinal study.

The Krijtmolen Alliantie is a network of health and social care providers with the ambition to realize such a performance intelligence driven governance model in line with the Triple Aim. This study seeks to identify what performance intelligence is available and how it can be improved. METHODS: This case study was conducted in the district of Amsterdam Noord, the Netherlands, and employed 23 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in health and social care, a feasibility analysis of available administrative data, and a reflection meeting with board members of the Krijtmolen Alliantie. Information needs for performance intelligence by the stakeholders were mapped and a data landscape of the district covered by the network was drafted. Finally, in the reflection meeting with board members of the Krijtmolen Alliantie the information needs and data landscape were aligned with governing needs, resulting in priority domains around which to strengthen the data infrastructure for governance of the integrated health and social care delivery network. RESULTS: The Krijtmolen Alliantie encompasses a network of providers with a diverse range of catchment areas. There are indicators on population health and welfare, however they have limited actionability for providers due to a misalignment with their respective catchment areas. There is a barrier in data exchange between health and social care providers. It is difficult to construct one indicator for per capita cost in the Dutch health data infrastructure as health and social care are subdivided in financing siloes. Priority domains for improvement of performance intelligence for the Krijtmolen Alliantie are: 1) Per capita and per patient cost data integration that would allow combined accountability through aligning financial incentives to facilitate integrated care, and 2) combined patient experience and outcome measures to reflect network quality of care and patient experience performance. CONCLUSION: Available performance intelligence lacks actionability for the governance of integrated care networks. Our recommendation is to align performance intelligence with the regional governance responsibilities of stakeholders for health and social care delivery.

However, the prediction of DTIs using wet-lab experimental methods is generally expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, different machine learning-based methods have been developed for this purpose, but there are still substantial unknown interactions needed to discover. Furthermore, data imbalance and feature dimensionality problems are a critical challenge in drug-target datasets, which can decrease the classifier performances that have not been significantly addressed yet. This paper proposed a novel drug-target interaction prediction method called PreDTIs. First, the feature vectors of the protein sequence are extracted by the pseudo-position-specific scoring matrix (PsePSSM), dipeptide composition (DC) and pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC); and the drug is encoded with MACCS substructure fingerings. Besides, we propose a FastUS algorithm to handle the class imbalance problem and also develop a MoIFS algorithm to remove the irrelevant and redundant features for getting the best optimal features. Finally, balanced and optimal features are provided to the LightGBM Classifier to identify DTIs, and the 5-fold CV validation test method was applied to evaluate the prediction ability of the proposed method. Prediction results indicate that the proposed model PreDTIs is significantly superior to other existing methods in predicting DTIs, and our model could be used to discover new drugs for unknown disorders or infections, such as for the coronavirus disease 2019 using existing drugs compounds and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 protein sequences.","output":"PreDTIs: prediction of drug-target interactions based on multiple feature information using gradient boosting framework with data balancing and feature selection techniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research aims to determine the relationship between the quality of airline service attributes and overall satisfaction.

In accordance with Herzberg, Mausner, and Snydermans (1959) two-factor theory, the findings of this research have determined that the quality of certain service attributes, such as cleanliness, food and beverages, and in-flight entertainment, affects the variations of positive ratings as a satisfier.

A descriptive analysis was performed and a multivariate cluster analysis technique pam (partitioning around medoids) was applied. RESULTS: Two groups of countries were identified. The first group, mostly countries with stricter measures to contain the spread of the virus, reported more difficulties (limitations in accessing basic or health needs) and fears (concerns regarding the impact of the pandemic); whereas most of the second group consisted of countries with less restrictive measures, and reported fewer difficulties. Only 37% responded that a policy was put into place to protect individuals with diabetes, either delivering their medicines and supplies at home (16%) or providing them at once enough for 2-3 months (21%). All respondents reported that one of the main fear was to \\"be infected and not to receive adequate treatment\\" and/or \\"getting infected if going to the hospital or medical appointments\\".

However, response to BRAF inhibitors is tumor-type specific. Significant improvement in survival is seen in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma, but other cancer types, such as colorectal cancers, are generally less sensitive. We examined the frequency and characteristics of BRAF-mutated LGSC and described the response to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. PATIENTS AND METHODS Mutations were assessed in LGSC (N = 65) by using targeted, exome, and whole-genome sequencing. Patient characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcome were assessed, and the median follow-up time was more than 5 years. BRAF inhibitors were trialed in two patients with a somatic BRAF V600E mutation: one patient received dabrafenib monotherapy and was monitored clinically, biochemically (cancer antigen [CA]-125 levels), and with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Expression of the BRAF V600E protein in this patient was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Among patients with LGSC, nine (13.8%) of 65 had a somatic BRAF mutation. Of the nine patients with BRAF mutation-positive LGSC, four experienced progressive disease that did not respond to conventional chemotherapy. Two of the patients experienced progression quickly and died as a result of disease progression, and two received targeted treatment. Two patients with BRAF V600E mutation received BRAF inhibitors at relapse and both achieved durable responses. CONCLUSION BRAF mutations are not uncommon in patients with LGSC and should be routinely tested, because BRAF inhibitors can be an effective treatment for these patients. The results highlight the need for targeted treatment in this rare tumor type, and a prospective study is needed to formally assess the response rate and clinical benefit.","output":"BRAF Mutations in Low-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer and Response to BRAF Inhibition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As part of the PLoS Medicine series on Global Health Diplomacy, Lai-Han Chan and colleagues provide a case study of China's growing engagement in global health diplomacy following the SARS epidemic.","output":"China's Engagement with Global Health Diplomacy: Was SARS a Watershed?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the initial description of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in September 2012, a total of 1038 cases of MERS-CoV including 460 deaths have been reported from Saudi Arabia.

A distinguishing feature of this new model is that it allows us to consider a set up under general latency and infectious period distributions. To some extent, queuing systems with infinitely many servers and a Markov chain with time-varying transition rate are the very technical underpinning of the paper. Although more general, the Markov chain is as tractable as previous models for exponentially distributed latency and infection periods. It is also significantly simpler and more tractable than semi-Markov models with a similar level of generality. Based on the notion of stochastic stability, we derive a sufficient condition for a shrinking epidemic in terms of the queuing system's occupation rate that drives the dynamics. Relying on this condition, we propose a class of ad-hoc stabilising mitigation strategies that seek to keep a balanced occupation rate after a prescribed mitigation-free period. We validate the approach in the light of recent data on the COVID-19 epidemic and assess the effect of different stabilising strategies. The results suggest that it is possible to curb the epidemic with various occupation rate levels, as long as the mitigation is not excessively procrastinated.","output":"A Novel Stochastic Epidemic Model with Application to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Huashi Baidu Formula (HSBDF) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula consisting of fourteen parts, which has been proven effective for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinically. However, the therapeutic mechanism of the effect of HSBDF on COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS The components and action targets of HSBDF were searched in the TCMSP, YaTCM, PubChem, and TargetNet databases. Disease targets related to ACE2 were screened in single-cell sequence data of colon epithelial cells from other reports. The therapeutic targets of HSBDF for COVID-19 were obtained by integrated analysis, and the protein-protein interaction was analyzed using the STRING database. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) processes were analyzed using the OmicsBean and Metascape databases. The communication between networks [component-target (C-T) network, component-target-pathway (C-T-P) network, herb-target (H-T) network, target-pathway (T-P) network, and meridian-tropism (M-T) network] was constructed by Cytoscape software. The Cloud computing molecular docking platform was used to verify the molecular docking. RESULTS The obtained 223 active ingredients and 358 targets of HSBDF. The 5,555 COVID-19 disease targets related to ACE2 were extracted, and 84 compound-disease common targets were found, of which the principal targets included ACE, ESR1, ADRA1A, and HDAC1. A total of 3,946 items were seized by GO enrichment analysis, mainly related to metabolism, protein binding, cellular response to the stimulus, and receptor activity. The enriched KEGG pathways screened 46 signaling pathways, including the reninangiotensin system, the renin secretion, NF-kappa B pathway, the arachidonic acid metabolism, and the AMPK signaling pathway. The molecular docking results showed that the bioactive components of HSBDF have an excellent binding ability with main proteins related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSIONS HSBDF might act on SARS-CoV-2 through multiple components, targets, and pathways. Here we reveal preliminary results of the mechanism of action of HSBDF on SARS-CoV-2, providing a theoretical basis for future clinical applications.","output":"The pharmacological mechanism of Huashi Baidu Formula for the treatment of COVID-19 by combined network pharmacology and molecular docking."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We previously isolated a porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain, PC177, by blind serial passaging of the intestinal contents of a diarrheic piglet in Vero cell culture. Compared with the highly virulent U.S. PEDV strain PC21A, the tissue culture-adapted PC177 (TC-PC177) contains a 197-amino-acid (aa) deletion in the N-terminal domain of the spike (S) protein. We orally inoculated neonatal, conventional suckling piglets with TC-PC177 or PC21A to compare their pathogenicities. Within 7 days postinoculation, TC-PC177 caused mild diarrhea and lower fecal viral RNA shedding, with no mortality, whereas PC21A caused severe clinical signs and 55% mortality. To investigate whether infection with TC-PC177 can induce cross-protection against challenge with a highly virulent PEDV strain, all the surviving piglets were challenged with PC21A at 3 weeks postinoculation. Compared with 100% protection in piglets initially inoculated with PC21A, 88% and 100% TC-PC177- and mock-inoculated piglets had diarrhea following challenge, respectively, indicating incomplete cross-protection. To investigate whether this 197-aa deletion was the determinant for the attenuation of TC-PC177, we generated a mutant (icPC22A-S1197) bearing the 197-aa deletion from an infectious cDNA clone of the highly virulent PEDV PC22A strain (infectious clone PC22A, icPC22A). In neonatal gnotobiotic pigs, the icPC22A-S1197 virus caused mild to moderate diarrhea, lower titers of viral shedding, and no mortality, whereas the icPC22A virus caused severe diarrhea and 100% mortality. Our data indicate that deletion of this 197-aa fragment in the spike protein can attenuate a highly virulent PEDV, but the virus may lose important epitopes for inducing robust protective immunity.IMPORTANCE The emerging, highly virulent PEDV strains have caused substantial economic losses worldwide. However, the virulence determinants are not established. In this study, we found that a 197-aa deletion in the N-terminal region of the S protein did not alter virus (TC-PC177) tissue tropism but reduced the virulence of the highly virulent PEDV strain PC22A in neonatal piglets. We also demonstrated that the primary infection with TC-PC177 failed to induce complete cross-protection against challenge by the highly virulent PEDV PC21A, suggesting that the 197-aa region may contain important epitopes for inducing protective immunity. Our results provide an insight into the role of this large deletion in virus propagation and pathogenicity. In addition, the reverse genetics platform of the PC22A strain was further optimized for the rescue of recombinant PEDV viruses in vitro This breakthrough allows us to investigate other virulence determinants of PEDV strains and will provide knowledge leading to better control PEDV infections.","output":"Deletion of a 197-Amino-Acid Region in the N-Terminal Domain of Spike Protein Attenuates Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus in Piglets."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new outbreak of coronavirus from December 2019 has brought attention to an old viral enemy and has raised concerns as to the ability of current protection measures and the healthcare system to handle such a threat.

The overarching goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide the first comprehensive summary of the findings of published studies thus far describing COVID-19 lung imaging data in the pediatric population. METHODS A systematic literature search of PubMed was performed to identify studies assessing lung-imaging features of COVID-19 pediatric patients (0-18 years). A single-arm meta-analysis was conducted to obtain the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS A total of 29 articles (n=1026 children) based on chest CT images were included. The main results of this comprehensive analysis are as follows: (1) Over a third of pediatric patients with COVID-19 (35.7%, 95% CI: 27.5%-44%) had normal chest CT scans and only 27.7% (95% CI: 19.9%-35.6%) had bilateral lesions; (2) the most typical pediatric chest CT findings of COVID-19 were ground-glass opacities (GGO) (37.2%, 95% CI: 29.3%-45%) and the presence of consolidations or pneumonic infiltrates (22.3%, 95% CI: 17.8%-26.9%); (3) the lung imaging findings in children with COVID-19 were overall less frequent and less severe than in adult patients; and (4) typical lung imaging features of viral respiratory infections in the pediatric population such as increased perihilar markings and hyperinflation were not reported in children with COVID-19.

SPSS software version V21 was used to perform Binary logistic regression for calculating the odds ratio (OR) of the categorical variables. The outcomes, looked for in the analysis, were poor control of glycaemic parameters like HbA1c (defined by >7%), FBS (defined by >150 mg/dL) and, PPBS (defined by >200 mg/dL) and the exposure variables were Screen time spent by the person per day for all the three glycaemic parameters and, doctors visit and, daily exercise for HbA1c outcome. Results: A total of 173 patients had a screen time (henceforth, it means time spent on social media) of less than 2 hours/day in the study sample. Among the 173 patients, 73 (42.2%) had achieved HbA1c less than 7%, whereas the remaining 100 (57.8%) had HbA1c more than 7%. On the other hand, 56 patients had a screen time of more than 2 hours, of which 44 (72.73%) had HbA1c more than 7%. Among the 173 patients, only 89 (51.44%) had an FBS value of more than 150 mg/dL as compared to 46 (82.12%) with a screen time of more than 2 hours. Out of these 173 patients, only 43 (24.86%) had a PPBS value of more than 200 mg/dL as compared to 41 (73.21%) with a screen time of more than 2 hours. It was found that the odds of having a poor glycaemic control as per HbA1c, FBS and PPBS is 2.67 times higher (95%CI: 1.91-6.95), 4.34 times higher (95%CI: 1.52-4.76) and, 8.26 times higher (95%CI: 4.26-11.83) in the cohort with a screen time of more than 2 hours as compared to the cohort with a screen time of less than 2 hours, respectively. Conclusion: There seems to be an increased risk of uncontrolled glycaemic indices with increased screen time and, decreased work out. This is a small study and the findings need to be corroborated with larger sample size.","output":"Effect of Screen time on Glycaemic control of Type 2 Diabetes patients during COVID-19 Outbreak: A Survey based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To investigate the short-term effects of COVID-19 pandemic related unintended treatment lapses on neovascular age related macular degeneration (nAMD) patients. METHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional study, 140 patients who had at least one anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection for nAMD within 12 months before COVID-19 pandemic and who had at least 3 months of unintended lapse for control visits during pandemic were recruited and underwent a detailed opthalmological examination and optical coherence tomography imaging. RESULTS: Of these 140 eyes, 113 (80.7%) were active with presence of either intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid and necessitated intravitreal anti-VEGF injections; and 20 (14.3%) of them complicated with subretinal hemorrhage. The mean interval of clinical visits and intravitreal antiVEGF injections were found to be prolonged during COVID-19 pandemics, which demonstrates a statistically significant lapse for both (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003 consecutively). The decreased visual acuity due to lapse was positively correlated with number of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections at last 6 months before COVID-19 pandemic (r = 0.217, p = 0.010) and central subfoveal thickness at first post-COVID-19 visit (r = 0.175, p = 0.038); and negatively correlated with follow-up duration (r = ?0.231, p = 0.006) and number of control visits (r = ?0.243, p = 0.004). Fifteen (16.9%) of the 89 patients who had drusen in the fellow eye before COVID-19 pandemic evolved to nAMD with an accompanying subretinal and/or intraretinal fluid. CONCLUSION: Unintended lapses during COVID-19 pandemic resulted with poor functional and structural outcomes for nAMD patients, especially for those at the beginning of the treatment period and who still have an unstable clinical course.","output":"Treatment of neovascular age related macular degeneration during COVID-19 pandemic: The short term consequences of unintended lapses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A novel antiviral agent, remdesivir (RDV), is a promising candidate treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the absence of any proven therapy MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective case series included 10 patients with a clinically and laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia who had received RDV for 5 days (n = 5) or 10 days (n = 5) in the Phase III clinical trial of RDV (GS-US-540-5773) conducted by Gilead Sciences The clinical and laboratory data for these patients were extracted RESULTS: One patient in the 10-day group received RDV for only 5 days because of nausea and elevated liver transaminases No patient had respiratory comorbidity Seven patients had bilateral lesions and three had unilateral lesions on imaging All patients had received other medications for COVID-19, including lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, before administration of RDV Five patients required supplemental oxygen and one required mechanical ventilation All patients showed clinical and laboratory evidence of improvement Half of the patients developed elevated liver transaminases and three had nausea There were no adverse events exceeding grade 2 CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that RDV could be a therapeutic option for COVID-19 A well-designed randomized controlled clinical trial is now needed to confirm the efficacy of RDV in patients with COVID-19","output":"Clinical Experience with Use of Remdesivir in the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: a Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As an economic, social, and cultural activity, tourism shapes the relationship between visitors and local communities in tourist destinations. While tourism generates economic growth and employment opportunities for residents, its benefits come with a social cost. This article high-lights the results of an online survey that was carried out at the beginning of 2021 in the seven major Galician cities along the Route of Santiago de Compostela (the Way of St. James) in Spain, which is a historical, natural, and cultural tourist attraction that is inscribed in the UNESCOs World Heritage List in the category of cultural assets. The goal of the research work was to get to know first-hand the opinion of local communities about the positive and negative effects of tourism in their cities, on the Route of Santiago, and in the region of Galicia as a whole. Research work shows that residents perception of tourism leans toward the positive side, although it also reveals the need for tourism planners to involve host communities in tourism development.

The latter counterbalances the Th1 response, which is critical for antiviral immunity. Clonal mast cell activation disorders (cMCADs, such as mastocytosis and clonal mast cell activation syndrome) are characterized by abnormal mast cell accumulation and/or activation. No data on the antiviral immune response in patients with MCADs have been published. Objective To study a comprehensive range of outcomes in cMCAD patients with PCR- or serologically confirmed COVID-19 and to characterize the specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response in this setting. Methods Clinical follow-up and outcome data were collected prospectively over a 12-month period by members of the French Centre de Rfrence des Mastocytoses rare disease network. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell activity was measured with an enzyme-linked immunospot assay, and humoral responses were evaluated by assaying circulating levels of specific IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibodies. Results Overall, 32 cMCAD patients were evaluated. None required non-invasive or mechanical ventilation. Two patients were admitted to hospital for oxygen and steroid therapy. The SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response was characterized in 21 of the 32 patients. Most had high counts of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific, interferon (IFN)--producing T-cells and high titers of neutralizing anti-spike IgGs. The patients frequently showed spontaneous T-cell IFN- production in the absence of stimulation; this production was correlated with basal circulating tryptase levels (a marker of the mast cell burden).

METHODS We studied 509 confirmed COVID-19 patients from the San Raffaele Hospital of Milan and 480 pre-pandemic organ donor sera collected in 2010-2012. Using fluid-phase luciferase immune precipitation (LIPS) assays, we characterized IgG, IgM, IgA antibodies to the spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), S1+S2, nucleocapsid, and ORF6 to 10 of SARS-CoV-2, to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 betacoronaviruses spike S2, and the H1N1Ca2009 flu virus hemagglutinin. Sequential samples at 1 and 3 months post-hospital discharge were also tested in 95 patients for SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies. RESULTS Antibodies developed rapidly against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens in 95% of patients by 4 weeks post-symptoms onset and IgG to the RBD increased until the 3rd month of follow-up. We observed a major synchronous expansion of antibodies to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 spike S2. A likely co-infection with influenza was neither linked to a more severe presentation of the disease nor to a worse outcome. Of the measured antibody responses positivity for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD was predictive of survival. CONCLUSIONS The measurement of antibodies to selected epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 antigens can offer a more accurate assessment of the humoral response in patients and its impact on survival. The presence of partially cross-reactive antibodies with other betacoronoviruses is likely to impact on serological assay specificity and interpretation.","output":"COVID-19 survival associates with the immunoglobulin response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike Receptor Binding Domain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19's widespread distribution is wreaking havoc on people's lives all over the world. This pandemic has also had a significant impact on energy consumption. Its influence can be seen in the power system's operation and the market as well. The power consumers' habits and demand curves have been changed at a breakneck pace. In this work, a one-year mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem has been developed to compare the power consumption between 2019 and 2020 in the United States as an example regarding the COVID-19 pandemic effect in order to better prepare for possible similar future events. 100% renewable single microgrids (SMGs) are studied using wind turbines and photovoltaics. Batteries are also employed since it is inevitable when the system uses renewables. Additionally, it is possible for the SMGs to trade power with the main grid as needed. The effect of the SMGs clustering to form the multi-microgrids (MMGs) is also considered. In order to investigate the risk of the system during the COVID-19 and formation of MMG, downside risk constraints are applied to the proposed model. Furthermore, a stylized short-run consumers demand model is proposed, using elasticity and assessed responses regarding the average household consumption for households during on-peak and off-peak periods. The simulation results show that COVID-19 generally reduces the demand, increases the profit of the system, and decreases the economic risk of the power systems operation. Moreover, SMGs clustering to organize MMG dramatically enhances the profit of the system as well as improves the risk level of the system.","output":"Demand and Price Fluctuations Effect on Risk and Profit of Single and Clustered Microgrids during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the usual working of many hospitalization units (or wards). Few studies have used electronic nursing clinical notes (ENCN) and their unstructured text to identify alterations in patients' feelings and therapeutic procedures of interest. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze positive or negative sentiments through inspection of the free text of the ENCN, compare sentiments of ENCN with or without hospitalized patients with COVID-19, carry out temporal analysis of the sentiments of the patients during the start of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and identify the topics in ENCN. METHODS: This is a descriptive study with analysis of the text content of ENCN. All ENCNs between January and June 2020 at Guadarrama Hospital (Madrid, Spain) extracted from the CGM Selene Electronic Health Records System were included. Two groups of ENCNs were analyzed: one from hospitalized patients in postCintensive care units for COVID-19 and a second group from hospitalized patients without COVID-19. A sentiment analysis was performed on the lemmatized text, using the National Research Council of Canada, Affin, and Bing dictionaries. A polarity analysis of the sentences was performed using the Bing dictionary, SO Dictionaries V1.11, and Spa dictionary as amplifiers and decrementators. Machine learning techniques were applied to evaluate the presence of significant differences in the ENCN in groups of patients with and those without COVID-19. Finally, a structural analysis of thematic models was performed to study the abstract topics that occur in the ENCN, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling. RESULTS: A total of 37,564 electronic health records were analyzed. Sentiment analysis in ENCN showed that patients with subacute COVID-19 have a higher proportion of positive sentiments than those without COVID-19. Also, there are significant differences in polarity between both groups (Z=5.532, P<.001) with a polarity of 0.108 (SD 0.299) in patients with COVID-19 versus that of 0.09 (SD 0.301) in those without COVID-19. Machine learning modeling reported that despite all models presenting high values, it is the neural network that presents the best indicators (>0.8) and with significant P values between both groups. Through Structural Topic Modeling analysis, the final model containing 10 topics was selected. High correlations were noted among topics 2, 5, and 8 (pressure ulcer and pharmacotherapy treatment), topics 1, 4, 7, and 9 (incidences related to fever and well-being state, and baseline oxygen saturation) and topics 3 and 10 (blood glucose level and pain). CONCLUSIONS: The ENCN may help in the development and implementation of more effective programs, which allows patients with COVID-19 to adopt to their prepandemic lifestyle faster. Topic modeling could help identify specific clinical problems in patients and better target the care they receive.","output":"Exploring Sentiment and Care Management of Hospitalized Patients During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic Using Electronic Nursing Health Records: Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In this study, we compared patient outcomes between the 120-W thulium laser (Vela?XL) prostate enucleation (ThuLEP) and bipolar transurethral enucleation of the prostate (B-TUEP) techniques. METHODS: We excluded patients with concomitant prostate cancer and bladder cancer and prospectively analyzed patients with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) who underwent ThuLEP and B-TUEP from October 2018 to January 2021 in our institution. Patients demographics, comorbidities, prostate volumes, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) were recorded. Perioperative outcomes including intraoperative blood loss, prostate resection percentage of the transition zone, postoperative pain score (numeric rating scale, NRS), complications, changes in postoperative uroflowmetry parameters, IPSS, and the rate of reuse of BPH medications were also evaluated. RESULTS: The data of a total of 111 patients (ThuLEP: 49, B-TUEP: 62) met the inclusion criteria were collected and analyzed prospectively. Our results revealed no significant differences between ThuLEP and B-TUEP in terms of operation time, prostate tissue enucleated, and days of hospitalization. However, patients in the ThuLEP group reported less pain after surgery than those in the B-TUEP group, and a higher proportion of patients in the B-TUEP group returned to the emergency department due to complications within one month postoperatively, with hematuria being the main cause. No significant differences were observed between the groups in changes in uroflowmetry parameters and IPSS at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of ThuLEP was comparable to that of B-TUEP in terms of maximal flow rate, voiding volume, IPSS, and quality of life. ThuLEP also had several advantages over B-TUEP, including less blood loss and less postoperative pain. Therefore, ThuLEP can be considered a treatment of choice for BPH/bladder outlet obstruction, specifically for patients with a bleeding tendency and fear of pain.","output":"Comparison of Outcome and Quality of Life Between Thulium Laser (Vela(TM) XL) Enucleation of Prostate and Bipolar Transurethral Enucleation of the Prostate (B-TUEP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study aimed to assess the influence of risk cognitive and characteristics of mobile phones using on sleep quality during the COVID-19 epidemic.

Our methodology was based on the analysis of three fake news reports related to the negationist campaign against the Covid-19 pandemic, each of which was taken as a prototype of the following categories proposed by Hirschman (1992): perversity, futility, and jeopardy theses. The results indicate that fake news should be understood as an inherently digital phenomenon that uses well-developed argumentative strategies as its objective is to cause discredit and doubt in the public opinion. Therefore, if we take the average citizen into account, fake news is highly persuasive and consequently should be considered of extreme danger to society and its democratic and scientific principles.

Measuring T-cell responses may complement antibody tests currently in use as correlates of protection but there are not validated T-cell responses applicable to large number of samples. Objective: To assess the feasibility of using T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 S peptides by commercially available whole blood interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) as a correlate of protection. Patients: Twenty health care workers before and after vaccination. Methods: Antibody test to SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins in parallel with one IGRA assay and two detection techniques than can be automated. Results: IGRA test detected T-cell responses in naturally exposed and vaccinated HCW already after first vaccination dose. the correlation by the two detection methods, CLIA and ELISA, very high (R>0.9) and sensitivity and specificity ranged between 100 and 86% and 100-73% respectively. Even though there was a very high concordance between antibody and the IGRA assay in the ability to detect immune response to SARS-CoV-2 there was a relatively low quantitative correlation. In the small group primed by natural infection, one vaccine dose was sufficient to reach immune response plateau. IGRA was positive in one Ig (S) antibody negative vaccinated immunosuppressed HCW illustrating another advantage of the IGRA test. Conclusion: Whole blood IGRA tests amenable to automation, as the one here reported, constitute a promising additional tool for measuring the state of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2; they are applicable to large number of samples and may become valuable correlates of protection to COVID-19, particularly for vulnerable groups at risk of being re-exposed to infection, as are health care workers.","output":"T-cell responses as a correlate of COVID-19 vaccination.

Purpose: The purpose of this research was to explore this proposition on a large scale limited to a United States context. To that end, two studies emerged. Methods: In the first study, a large corpus of articles encouraging computer use from Teaching Children Mathematics was used to explore talk about how to use computers in the classroom using a content analysis method. The second study used weighted sample survey methods with corrections and jackknife replications for ANOVA tests to determine whether there were statistically significant differences between exposure time to computers during 4th grade math and standardized test scores on the TIMSS math knowledge and application subtests generalized to the United States population of students. Results: The results of the first study indicated that computer use talk fell under the domains of geometry, graphing functions, and base ten blocks. The second study indicated non-significant results on both tests, which was interpreted as a valuable finding. Conclusions: Several conclusions emerged for these studies. The most poignant ones included that common core standards do not require or mention technology use in obtaining math objectives in the 4th grade. It is concluded that the TIMSS survey results suggest that some of the findings might be due to lack of availability of computers for students and professional development opportunities for faculty. It is also concluded that there is a continuity between the recent 2000s and the use of computers in the lower grades during COVID-19, where reports show learning losses, despite talk of it as a teaching method.","output":"Computer discourse and use as determinants of student math outcomes: performativity and action at work in the lower school grades"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus entry is a multistep process.

However, the excessive inflammatory response can damage host tissues and pose serious threats. Exopolysaccharide (EPS), one of the postbiotics, is secreted from lactic acid bacteria. Although many studies have described the beneficial effects of EPS, such as its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, its underlying mechanisms have remained to be poorly understood. Thus, we identified that EPS obtained from Lactobacillus plantarum L-14 was a homogeneous polysaccharide primarily comprised of glucose. To examine these anti-inflammatory effects, an inflammatory response was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration to mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells that were pretreated with EPS. The anti-inflammatory effects of EPS were identified by analyzing the changes within inflammatory markers at the molecular level. We demonstrate here that EPS suppressed proinflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-, and interleukin-1, and downregulated the expression of an inducible nitric oxide synthase known to lead to oxidative stress. It was also confirmed that EPS had anti-inflammatory effects by blocking the interaction of LPS with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), as demonstrated by using the known TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242. In addition, we found that EPS itself could suppress the expression of TLR4. Consequently, our data suggest that EPS can be a potential target for the development of natural product-derived medicine for treating inflammatory diseases related to TLR4.","output":"Exopolysaccharide Isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum L-14 Has Anti-Inflammatory Effects via the Toll-Like Receptor 4 Pathway in LPS-Induced RAW 264.7 Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sex is considered an important risk factor for asthma onset and exacerbation.

There was limited evidence to support associations of genetically proxied lipid traits, systolic blood pressure or type 2 diabetes liability with risk of sepsis or severe covid-19. Similar findings were generally obtained when using Mendelian randomization methods that are more robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic variants, although the precision of estimates was reduced. Conclusions: Our findings support a causal effect of elevated BMI and smoking on risk of sepsis and severe covid-19. Clinical and public health interventions targeting obesity and smoking are likely to reduce sepsis and covid-19 related morbidity, along with the plethora of other health-related outcomes that these traits adversely affect.","output":"Cardiometabolic traits, sepsis and severe covid-19 with respiratory failure: a Mendelian randomization investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), produces protean manifestations and causes indiscriminate havoc in multiple organ systems.

This pandemic, which under decent public health provisions might have been a controlled disease, is producing the most severe crisis after the Great Depression and has been used to implement forms of massive social control hardly conceivable in advanced democracies. Butterfly effects are well-known in complexity sciences. However, social scientists have still difficulties in understanding how a grain can make the sandcastle fall down. On the contrary, we are now under the actual risk of starting a new normal without dealing with the deep routes and origins of this crisis, with the dominant intellectual discourse pushing for maintaining and indeed reinforcing the status quo, established power and social blocks.

We investigated the presence of virions and pathological changes in surgical rectal tissues of a clinically confirmed COVID-19 patient with rectal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Here, the clinical data were collected during hospitalization and follow-up of this patient. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on the rectal tissue specimens obtained from surgical resection, succus entericus and intestinal mucosa of ileostomy, and rectal mucosa during follow-up after recovery. Ultrathin sections of surgical samples were observed for SARS-CoV-2 virions using electron microscopy. Histopathological examination was performed using hematoxylin-eosin stain. Immunohistochemical analysis and immunofluorescence were carried out on rectal tissues to evaluate the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, and immune cell infiltrations. RESULTS: The patient had fever and cough on day 3 postoperatively, was diagnosed with COVID-19 on day 7, and was discharged from the hospital on day 41. RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in surgically resected rectal specimens, but not in samples collected on 37 day after discharge. Notably, coincidence with rectal tissues of surgical specimens tested nucleic acid positive for SARS-CoV-2, typical coronavirus virions in rectal tissue were observed under electron microscopy.

Models included state-level social distancing measures, Census Bureau demographics, daily weather information, and daily air pollution. The primary measures included minimum and maximum daily temperature, precipitation, ozone concentration, PM2.5 concentrations, and U.V. light index. RESULTS: A 1 F increase in the minimum temperature was associated with 1.9% (95% CI, 0.2% to 3.6%) increase in deaths 20 days later. An ozone concentration increase of 1 ppb (part per billion) decreased daily deaths by 2.0% (95% CI, 0.1% to 3.6%); ozone levels below 38 ppb negatively correlated with deaths.

Nevertheless, the challenges associated with the use of observational data can undermine the results of the studies. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of using observational data for vaccine effectiveness studies by examining granular weekly effectiveness. DESIGN, SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used Columbia University Medical Center data linked to State and City Immunization Registries to assess the weekly effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We conducted manual chart review of cases in week one in both groups along with a set of sensitivity analyses for Pfizer- BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen vaccines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used propensity score matching with up to 54,987 covariates and fitted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios and constructed Kaplan-Meier plots for two main outcomes (COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-associated hospitalization). RESULTS: The study included 179,666 patients. We observed increasing effectiveness after the first dose of mRNA vaccines with week 6 effectiveness approximating 84% (95% CI 72C91%) for COVID-19 infection and 86% (95% CI 69C95) for COVID-19-associated hospitalization. When analyzing unexpectedly high effectiveness in week one, chart review revealed that vaccinated patients are less likely to seek care after vaccination and are more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 during the encounters for other conditions. Sensitivity analyses showed potential outcome misclassification for COVID-19 ICD10-CM diagnosis and the influence of excluding patients with prior COVID-19 infection and anchoring in the unexposed group. Overall vaccine effectiveness analysis in fully vaccinated patients matched the results of the randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Observational data can be used to ascertain vaccine effectiveness if potential biases are accounted for. The data need to be scrutinized to ensure that compared groups exhibit similar health seeking behavior and are equally likely to be captured in the data. Given the difference in temporal trends of vaccine exposure and baseline characteristics, indirect comparison of vaccines may produce biased results.","output":"COVID-19 vaccination effectiveness rates by week and sources of bias"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first step in influenza virus infection is the binding of hemagglutinin to sialic acid-containing glycans present on the cell surface. Over 50 different sialic acid modifications are known, of which N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are the two main species. Animal models with 2,6 linked Neu5Ac in the upper respiratory tract, similar to humans, are preferred to enable and mimic infection with unadapted human influenza A viruses. Animal models that are currently most often used to study human influenza are mice and ferrets. Additionally, guinea pigs, cotton rats, Syrian hamsters, tree shrews, domestic swine, and non-human primates (macaques and marmosets) are discussed. The presence of NeuGc and the distribution of sialic acid linkages in the most commonly used models is summarized and experimentally determined. We also evaluated the role of Neu5Gc in infection using Neu5Gc binding viruses and cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH)(?/?) knockout mice, which lack Neu5Gc and concluded that Neu5Gc is unlikely to be a decoy receptor. This article provides a base for choosing an appropriate animal model. Although mice are one of the most favored models, they are hardly naturally susceptible to infection with human influenza viruses, possibly because they express mainly 2,3 linked sialic acids with both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc modifications.

It can be defined as 'the foundational process one experiences during the transformation from lay person to physician'. In order for this transformation to occur, medical values and principles are internalised. A robust professional identity is key to confident practice as a medical professional. As such, research regarding what works to encourage identity development is popular. New models of educational delivery, such as the increasingly popular Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship model (LICs), present an interesting opportunity to investigate impact on identity. As no previous literature reviews focus on identity development within LICs, it is unclear what is already known about their impact. Therefore, a scoping review synthesising current knowledge and mapping areas for future research is necessary. METHODS Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review steps will be used as a methodological framework. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, ERIC, PsychINFO, Google Scholar, JSTOR, Scopus, and Web of science will be searched (from inception onwards). We will include single studies of any design (e.g. quantitative and qualitative) and reviews examining professional identity within Longitudinal Integrated Clerkships involving health profession students. Two reviewers will complete all screening and data abstraction independently. Deductive coding will be presented as a quantitative textual meta-analysis. Inductive coding will be presented in narrative format. DISCUSSION This scoping review will explore professional identity formation within LICs, evaluating any known impact of the educational model and mapping the ways in which identity within LICs has been researched. Mapping of current knowledge should highlight whether LICs as an educational model can influence professional identity development and outline gaps in what is known about their impact to date. Theory used in LIC-based identity research will also be mapped, in order to summarise the main theoretical orientations of research to date. It is anticipated that through such evidence synthesis, directions for future research will become clear.

However, these messages can perpetuate misconceptions, false information, and stigma. OBJECTIVE: This study used Twitter data to understand stigma against people with dementia propagated during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We collected 1743 stigma-related tweets using the GetOldTweets application in Python from February 15 to September 7, 2020. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the tweets. RESULTS: Based on our analysis, 4 main themes were identified: (1) ageism and devaluing the lives of people with dementia, (2) misinformation and false beliefs about dementia and COVID-19, (3) dementia used as an insult for political ridicule, and (4) challenging stigma against dementia. Social media has been used to spread stigma, but it can also be used to challenge negative beliefs, stereotypes, and false information. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia education and awareness campaigns are urgently needed on social media to address COVID-19-related stigma. When stigmatizing discourse on dementia is widely shared and consumed amongst the public, it has public health implications. How we talk about dementia shapes how policymakers, clinicians, and the public value the lives of people with dementia. Stigma perpetuates misinformation, pejorative language, and patronizing attitudes that can lead to discriminatory actions, such as the limited provision of lifesaving supports and health services for people with dementia during the pandemic.

The patient's body mass index was 23.7 kg/m2, but he had an elevated visceral fat area (125 cm2). His laboratory data showed mildly elevated liver enzymes, whereas plasma fasting glucose and serum insulin levels were 91 mg/dL and 52.3 U/mL, respectively. In a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, the serum insulin level reached the highest value of 1124 U/mL at 180 minutes.

It was speculated that the INSR gene variant, in addition to visceral fat accumulation, was the main cause of hyperinsulinemia and reactive hypoglycemia, and the remaining 2 variants were also partly responsible for hyperinsulinemia.

In this study, we determined the energetic costs of the APR in the subterranean rodent Ctenomys talarum, as well as the effects of the exposure to LPS on body temperature, body mass loss, and behavior in this species. Furthermore, we monitored levels of circulating endotoxin after LPS exposure. Our results suggest that in C. talarum, the APR is energetically costly, resulting in a 14% increase in metabolic rate. Animals exposed to LPS experienced a short-term thermal response, weight loss, and changes in their behavior that included more time spent resting and with their eyes totally or partially closed. However, the magnitude of the effects of LPS exposure varied between sexes and among animals. Also, there was a clear peak in circulating endotoxin levels in plasma 3 h postinjection (hpi) and a significant decrease of these levels 24 hpi, but peak endotoxin concentration values recorded were highly variable among animals. In light of these results, ecological determinants of immune function variation in tuco-tucos are discussed considering the roles of pace of life, habitat, and degree of pathogen exposure in these subterranean rodents.","output":"Acute-Phase Immune Response Involves Fever, Sickness Behavior, and an Elevated Metabolic Rate in the Subterranean Rodent Ctenomys talarum."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enteroviruses (EVs) from the D species are the causative agents of a diverse range of infectious diseases in spite of comprising only five known members.

Despite their ubiquity and potential impact, knowledge of host immunity to coronaviruses remains incomplete, partly owing to the lack of overt pathogenicity of endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs), which typically cause common colds. However, the need for deeper understanding became pressing with the zoonotic introduction of three novel coronaviruses in the past two decades, causing severe acute respiratory syndromes in humans, and the unfolding pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This renewed interest not only triggered the discovery of two of the four HCoVs, but also uncovered substantial cellular and humoral cross-reactivity with shared or related coronaviral antigens. Here, we review the evidence for cross-reactive B cell memory elicited by HCoVs and its potential impact on the puzzlingly variable outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The available data indicate targeting of highly conserved regions primarily in the S2 subunits of the spike glycoproteins of HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 by cross-reactive B cells and antibodies. Rare monoclonal antibodies reactive with conserved S2 epitopes and with potent virus neutralising activity have been cloned, underscoring the potential functional relevance of cross-reactivity. We discuss B cell and antibody cross-reactivity in the broader context of heterologous humoral immunity to coronaviruses, as well as the limits of protective immune memory against homologous re-infection. Given the bidirectional nature of cross-reactivity, the unprecedented current vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 is expected to impact HCoVs, as well as future zoonotic coronaviruses attempting to cross the species barrier. However, emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with resistance to neutralisation by vaccine-induced antibodies highlight a need for targeting more constrained, less mutable parts of the spike. The delineation of such cross-reactive areas, which humoral immunity can be trained to attack, may offer the key to permanently shifting the balance of our interaction with current and future coronaviruses in our favour.","output":"Heterologous humoral immunity to human and zoonotic coronaviruses: Aiming for the achilles heel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a telerehabilitation intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of children and young adults with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).

Two questionnaires were completed both by parents and therapists to assess feasibility and acceptability. Neither technical issues nor clinical obstacles were found. The quality of the therapeutic relationship played a key role in the intervention. Synchronous telerehabilitation provided several advantages both for patients and therapists. Moreover, the patient centered intervention eased the burden of the caregivers at a time of high stress.

SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Extended symptoms may develop after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We refer to these as post-COVID-19 symptoms and they are grouped according to time duration. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to follow all COVID-19 infected patients in a family practise, to observe all post-COVID-19 symptoms, symptom development rates and to document how long they last. METHOD 282 SARS-CoV-2 patients were followed mainly through telephone interviews between 01. 09. 2020 and 01. 09. 2021. Post-COVID-19 symptoms were monitored for 15-42 weeks every 4 weeks (30-50 weeks in cases of delayed hypsomia). RESULTS Symptoms lasting longer than a month developed in 67% of all patients (170 cases). The most frequent symptoms were fatigue (79 cases, 29%) and hyposmia (74 cases, 27%). The latter mainly developed in non-smokers, affecting 2,5% of all COVID-19 patients beyond 43 weeks. Fatigue affected 46% of all post-COVID-19 patients. Sick leave was significantly longer among these patients (19.7 vs. 12.3 days in patients with no fatigue). Severe post-COVID-19 fatigue in non-hospitalized patients presented in a sydrome-like appearance displaying palpitations, fatigue, dyspnoea, sleep disturbances, loose stools and postural complaints. These regrediated after 19 weeks. DISCUSSION Post-COVID-19 symptoms often develop after a mild COVID-19 infection. Severity of COVID-19 infection and severity of post-COVID-19 symptoms often do not correlate. Groups of hospitalized and non-hospitalized post-acute COVID patients with fatigue can be distinguished by many attributes. CONCLUSION Mild COVID-19 infections may also be followed up by severe fatigue, but it spontenaously regrediates. Long-term effects of COVID-19 are permanent hyposmia and fatigue (the latter affect some hospitalized COVID-19 patients).

Consequently, there has been a need to identify health-promoting resources in order to mitigate the psychological impact of the pandemic on HCW. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate the association of sense of coherence (SOC), social support and religiosity with self-reported mental symptoms and increase of subjective burden during the COVID-19 pandemic in HCW. METHODS: Our sample comprised 4324 HCW of four professions (physicians, nurses, medical technical assistants (MTA) and pastoral workers) who completed an online survey from 20 April to 5 July 2020. Health-promoting resources were assessed using the Sense of Coherence Scale Short Form (SOC-3), the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory (ESSI) and one item on religiosity derived from the Scale of Transpersonal Trust (TPV). Anxiety and depression symptoms were measured with the PHQ-2 and GAD-2. The increase of subjective burden due to the pandemic was assessed as the retrospective difference between burden during the pandemic and before the pandemic. RESULTS: In multiple regressions, higher SOC was strongly associated with fewer anxiety and depression symptoms. Higher social support was also related to less severe mental symptoms, but with a smaller effect size, while religiosity showed minimal to no correlation with anxiety or depression. In professional group analysis, SOC was negatively associated with mental symptoms in all groups, while social support only correlated significantly with mental health outcomes in physicians and MTA. In the total sample and among subgroups, an increase of subjective burden was meaningfully associated only with a weaker SOC. CONCLUSION: Perceived social support and especially higher SOC appeared to be beneficial for mental health of HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the different importance of the resources in the respective occupations requires further research to identify possible reasons.","output":"Sense of coherence, social support and religiosity as resources for medical personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic: A web-based survey among 4324 health care workers within the German Network University Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has facilitated the efficient and effective dissemination of healthcare information and helped governments keep in touch with their citizens. Research has indicated that social media can exert negative and positive influences on users' mental health. One negative effect is social media fatigue caused by information overload. However, under the current pandemic, comprehensive research has yet to be executed on the effect exerted by social media on users' health beliefs and subjective well-being (SWB). Consequently, we conducted our research to probe the influence of social media on users' perceptions of COVID-19 prevention. This study established a research model based on 340 valid responses to an online questionnaire survey from Taiwan. SmartPLS 3.0 was used to verify the developed measurement and structural models. We found social media users' incidental and focused knowledge gain positively related to their social media intensity. In addition, social media intensity positively correlated with health beliefs and SWB. Accordingly, we can determine that proper social media use can enhance health beliefs.

It is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, a disease that can have mortality rates as high as 100% in suckling piglets. PEDV causes severe economic loss, and has been in existence for decades. A panzootic starting in 2010 renewed interest in the development of a universal vaccine toward PEDV. This report details several design changes made to a Hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg)-based recombinant vaccine strategy, and their effect in vivo. Initially, several multi-antigen vaccine candidates were able to elicit antibodies specific to three out of four B-cell epitopes inserted into the chimeric proteins. However, a lack of virus neutralization led to a redesign of the vaccines. The focus of the newly redesigned vaccines was to elicit a strong immune response to the YSNIGVCK amino acid motif from PEDV. Genetically modified new vaccine candidates were able to elicit a strong antibody (Ab) response to the YSNIGVCK epitope, which correlated with an increased ability to neutralize the CO strain of PEDV. Additionally, the location of the inserted PEDV epitopes within the vector protein was shown to affect the immune recognition toward the native HBcAg during vaccination.","output":"Epitope selection and their placement for increased virus neutralization in a novel vaccination strategy for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus utilizing the Hepatitis B virus core antigen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyses the socio-economic impact of the noble Corona virus (COVID-19) on Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region as well as the role and opportunities of Islamic finance post COVID-19.

Such countries see great profitability from their marine resources while also facing challenges that come with a bordering sea. Despite this fact, there has been limited research into the optimal way for West African Coastal States to coexist with, and sustainably use their marine resources, a research deficit that is mainly due to a lack of infrastructure for in-situ work, lack of capacity development, and comprehensive datasets to undertake oceanographic research. The Coastal Ocean Environment Summer School in Ghana (COESSING; www.coessing.org) was developed to help meet some of these challenges. Each summer since 2015, ocean scientists (e.g., biologists, chemists, physicists, hydrologists) from the USA and Europe have collaborated with West African colleagues to lead a week-long intensive summer school in Accra, Ghana, alternating in location between the Regional Maritime University and the University of Ghana. The school receives in excess of 100 participants drawn from universities, government agencies, and the private sector organizations, mainly from Ghana and neighboring Liberia, Nigeria, Togo, and Benin, among others. The format of the school includes morning lectures, afternoon field trips, and hands-on laboratory exercises and one-on-one coaching of students. Important to the COESSING program is the satellite oceanography component which introduces participants to the extensive and often free, remotely sensed oceanographic datasets. Participants develop skills that allow them to access, process, and analyze these datasets in order to better understand regional oceanographic phenomena, such as upwelling, pollution, habitat characterization, sea level rise, and coastal erosion. Following the school, facilitators keep in touch with program participants, helping them acquire and analyze data for their studies, dissertations, and often graduate school applications, etc. In summary, schools such as COESSING are critical not only for science in the region but for the global ocean community as such training develops eager, bright minds while leading to improved regional observing and modeling strategies in severely under-sampled seas. Here, we describe a unique case in which satellite oceanography has led to such outcomes for countries bordering the Gulf of Guinea, West Africa.","output":"Enhancing Satellite Oceanography-Driven Research in West Africa: a Case Study of Capacity Development in an Underserved Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a serious public health concern worldwide.

A significant correlation has been found between air pollution and COVID-19 infections and mortality in some countries in the world. The available data also indicate that exposure to air pollution may influence COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, exposure to air pollution may increase vulnerability and have harmful effects on the prognosis of patients affected by COVID-19 infections. Further research should be conducted considering some potential confounders such as age and pre-existing medical conditions along with exposure to NO2, PM2.5 and other air pollutants to confirm their detrimental effects on mortalities from COVID-19.","output":"The Effects of Air Pollution on COVID-19 Infection and Mortality-A Review on Recent Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been recommended as the best respiratory support for preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). However, the best NIV technique to be used as first intention in RDS management has not yet been established. Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may be synchronized (SNIPPV) or non-synchronized to the infants breathing efforts. The aim of the study is to evaluate the short-term effects of SNIPPV vs. NIPPV on the cardiorespiratory events, trying to identify the best ventilation modality for preterm infants at their first approach to NIV ventilation support. METHODS: An unmasked randomized crossover study with three treatment phases was designed. All newborn infants < 32 weeks of gestational age with RDS needing NIV ventilation as first intention or after extubation will be consecutively enrolled in the study and randomized to the NIPPV or SNIPPV arm. After stabilization, enrolled patients will be alternatively ventilated with two different techniques for two time frames of 4 h each. NIPPV and SNIPPV will be administered with the same ventilator and the same interface, maintaining continuous assisted ventilation without patient discomfort. During the whole duration of the study, the patients cardiorespiratory data and data from the ventilator will be simultaneously recorded using a polygraph connected to a computer. The primary outcome is the frequency of episodes of oxygen desaturation. Secondary outcomes are the number of the cardiorespiratory events, FiO(2) necessity, newborn pain score evaluation, synchronization index, and thoracoabdominal asynchrony. The calculated sample size was of 30 patients. DISCUSSION: It is known that NIPPV produces a percentage of ineffective acts due to asynchronies between the ventilator and the infants breaths. On the other hand, an ineffective synchronization could increase work of breathing. Our hypothesis is that an efficient synchronization could reduce the respiratory work and increase the volume per minute exchanged without interfering with the natural respiratory rhythm of the patient with RDS. The results of this study will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the synchronization, demonstrating whether SNIPPV is the most effective non-invasive ventilation mode in preterm infants with RDS at their first approach to NIV ventilation.

While for adults the evidence base has increased over the years, progress feedback in the therapy of children and adolescents has not been sufficiently investigated. This manuscript describes the trial protocol of the OPTIE study: a randomized trial that tests the efficacy of a progress feedback system in children and adolescents under conditions of routine care. METHODS: The study is based on a randomized parallel-group trial with two treatment groups (routine, feedback) at an outpatient unit of a university hospital. The target sample size is 439 families consisting of children and adolescents aged 6 to17 years old with internalizing and/or externalizing symptoms. Both the patients and the therapists are independently assigned to the treatment groups by stratified block randomization. In both treatment groups patients receive routine care behavioral therapy for a study-related 12 months; additionally, in the feedback group, a progress feedback system with three components is applied (monitoring, report, and supervision). For three informants (caregiver, child [ 11 years], therapist) surveys are conducted every 6 weeks (e.g., symptoms, goals, motivation). For both treatment groups, comparison data is collected at baseline and at six and 12 months after the beginning of the intervention (pre, inter, post), and includes five informants (blinded clinician, therapist, caregiver, child [ 11 years], teacher). DISCUSSION: The OPTIE study will contribute to the evidence base of progress feedback in children and adolescents and has the potential to uncover treatments effects in the small to medium range. Noteworthy features are the inclusion of children younger than 10 years old and the consideration of a blinded clinician rating.

METHODS: Community-dwelling participants (N = 113) aged 65 years or older completed the Swedish versions of the GDS-15 and PHQ-9 and were then interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to establish the presence or absence of current major depressive episodes (MDEs). Areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated for each scale, as well as the sensitivity, specificity, and Youdens index for different cut-off values. RESULTS: Seventeen participants met the criteria for MDEs. The AUC was 0.97 for the GDS-15 and 0.95 for the PHQ-9. A cut-off of 6 on the GDS-15 yielded a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 88%, and a Youdens index of 0.82.

Wellens syndrome, or left anterior descending T-wave syndrome, is diagnosed by a pattern of electrocardiographic (ECG) changes that include inverted or biphasic T waves in leads V2CV3. CASE REPORT: A 75-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of fatigue and progressive shortness of breath who acutely decompensated, necessitating mechanical ventilator support. Initial lab workup revealed COVID-19 positivity, which was confirmed by repeat testing. A routine ECG obtained during her hospitalization and compared with her baseline revealed diffuse T-wave inversions of her precordial leads, which was highly suggestive of Wellens syndrome. Cardiac enzymes obtained were slightly elevated and an echocardiogram did not demonstrate wall motion abnormalities. The patient was initiated on non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction protocol with heparin infusion for 48 hours and dual antiplatelet therapy, in addition to beta blockade. Repeat ECGs showed complete resolution of Wellens syndrome shortly after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, Wellens syndrome is a significant indicator of left anterior descending artery stenosis and is commonly associated with acute medical illness. COVID-19 pneumonia has been associated with many adverse cardiovascular outcomes, with ischemia and arrhythmia becoming increasingly more common. Diagnosis of Wellens often includes coronary angiography; however, during the current pandemic, many authorities have recommended medical management alone during the acute phase of care, depending on the severity of concomitant illness.","output":"A 75-Year-Old Woman with COVID-19 Pneumonia and Wellens Syndrome Diagnosed by Electrocardiography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the considerable excitement caused by COVID-19 and the first telework measures, many management issues became apparent and some questions quickly arose, especially about efficiency of employees' work and conditions for successful telework adoption.

How much employees feel able to do their work remotely now and why? To answer these questions, we conducted a survey over several weeks, that involved employees coming from different industries (N=170), in order to collect their experience, skills and motivations for teleworking. The results show that adoption of telework is real for the respondents. Those who have experienced it present a strong motivation and a real capacity to use it, with almost no technological barriers.

Viruses adhering to solid particles in wastewater treatment processes will end up as sewage sludge, and therefore insufficient sludge treatment may result in viral particles dissemination into the environment. Here, we review data on viruses' presence in sewage sludge, their detection and concentration methods, and information on human health issues associated with sewage sludge land application. We used combinations of the following keywords in the Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), and PubMed databases, which were published between 2010 and January 21th, 2022: sludge (sewage sludge, biosolids, sewage solids, wastewater solids) and virus (enteric virus, viral particles, viral contamination, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus). The sources were searched twice, once with and then without the common enteric virus names (adenovirus, rotavirus, norovirus, enterovirus, hepatitis A virus). Studies suggest adenovirus and norovirus as the most prevalent enteric viruses in sewage sludge. Indeed, other viruses include rotavirus, hepatitis A virus, and enterovirus were frequently found in sewage sludge samples. Untreated biological sludge and thickened sludge showed more viral contamination level than digested sludge and the lowest prevalence of viruses was reported in lime stabilized sludge. The review reveals that land application of sewage sludge may pose viral infection risks to people due to accidently ingestion of sludge or intake of crops grown in biosolids amended soil.

Victims of sexual assault encountered in prehospital and emergency department (ED) settings have legal as well as medical needs. A series of procedures must be carefully followed to facilitate forensic evidence collection and law enforcement investigation. A literature review detected a paucity of published guidance on the management of sexual assault patients in the ED, and no information specific to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Investigators sought to update the San Diego County sexual assault guidelines, created in collaboration with health care professionals, forensic specialists, and law enforcement, through a consensus iterative review process. An additional objective was to create a SAFET-I Tool for use by frontline providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: The authors present a novel SAFET-I Tool that outlines the following five components of effective sexual assault patient care: stabilization, alert system activation, forensic evidence consideration, expedited post-assault treatment, and trauma-informed care. This framework can be used as an educational tool and template for agencies interested in developing or adapting existing sexual assault policies. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of clinical guidance for ED providers that integrates the many aspects of sexual assault patient care, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 has been designated an epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), which has placed a tremendous burden on nearly all countries, especially those with weak health systems. However, Deep Learning (DL) has been applied in several applications and many types of detection applications in the medical field, including thyroid diagnosis, lung nodule recognition, fetal localization, and detection of diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, various clinical imaging sources, like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-ray, and Computed Tomography (CT), make DL a perfect technique to tackle the epidemic of COVID-19. Inspired by this fact, a considerable amount of research has been done. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has been used in this study to discover, assess, and integrate findings from relevant studies. DL techniques used in COVID-19 have also been categorized into seven main distinct categories as Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), Conventional Neural Networks (CNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Autoencoders, and hybrid approaches. Then, the state-of-the-art studies connected to DL techniques and applications for health problems with COVID-19 have been highlighted. Moreover, many issues and problems associated with DL implementation for COVID-19 have been addressed, which are anticipated to stimulate more investigations to control the prevalence and disaster control in the future. According to the findings, most papers are assessed using characteristics such as accuracy, delay, robustness, and scalability. Meanwhile, other features are underutilized, such as security and convergence time. Python is also the most commonly used language in papers, accounting for 75% of the time.

METHODS: Retrieving the complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from India and subjecting them to analysis on phylogenetic clade diversity, Spike (S) protein mutations and their functional consequences such as immune escape features and impact on infectivity. Whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 isolates (n = 4,326) deposited from India during the period from January 2020 to December 2020 is retrieved from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) and various analyses performed using in silico tools. RESULTS: Notable clade dynamicity is observed indicating the emergence of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants across the country. GR clade is predominant over the other clades and the distribution pattern of clades is uneven. D614G is the commonest and predominant mutation found among the S-protein followed by L54F. Mutation score prediction analyses reveal that there are several mutations in S-protein including the RBD and NTD regions that can influence the virulence of virus. Besides, mutations having immune escape features as well as impacting the immunogenicity and virulence through changes in the glycosylation patterns are identified. CONCLUSIONS: The study has revealed emergence of variants with shifting of clade dynamics within a year in India. It is shown uneven distribution of clades across the nation requiring timely deposition of SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

Therefore, an increasing number of patients present with recurrent hernias after having failed anterior and laparoscopic repairs. This study reports our experience with single-incision laparoscopic (SIL) intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) repair for these hernias. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients referred with multiply recurrent inguinal hernias underwent SIL-IPOM from November 1 2009 to October 30 2013. A 2.5-cm infraumbilical incision was made and a SIL surgical port was placed intraperitoneally. Modified dissection techniques, namely, \\"chopsticks\\" and \\"inline\\" dissection, 5.5 mm/52 cm/30 angled laparoscope and conventional straight dissecting instruments were used. The peritoneum was incised above the symphysis pubis and dissection continued laterally and proximally raising an inferior flap, below a previous extraperitoneal mesh, while reducing any direct/indirect/femoral/cord lipoma before placement of antiadhesive mesh that was fixed into the pubic ramus as well as superiorly with nonabsorbable tacks before fixing its inferior border with fibrin sealant. The inferior peritoneal flap was then tacked back onto the mesh. RESULTS There were 9 male patients who underwent SIL-IPOM. Mean age was 55 years old and mean body mass index was 26.8 kg/m2. Mean mesh size was 275 cm2. Mean operation time was 125 minutes with hospital stay of 1 day and umbilical scar length of 21 mm at 4 weeks' follow-up.

A longitudinal model-based clustering system on the disease trajectories over time was used to identify vulnerable clusters of counties that would benefit from allocating additional resources by federal, state and county policymakers. County-level COVID-19 cases and deaths, together with a set of potential risk factors were collected for 3050 U.S. counties during the 1st wave of COVID-19 (Mar25CJun3, 2020), followed by similar data for 1344 counties (in the sunbelt region of the country) during the 2nd wave (Jun4CSep2, 2020), and finally for 1055 counties located broadly in the great plains region of the country during the 3rd wave (Sep3CNov12, 2020). We used growth mixture models to identify clusters of counties exhibiting similar COVID-19 MIR growth trajectories and risk-factors over time. The analysis identifies more vulnerable clusters during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd waves of COVID-19. Further, tuberculosis (OR 1.3C2.1C3.2), drug use disorder (OR 1.1), hepatitis (OR 13.1), HIV/AIDS (OR 2.3), cardiomyopathy and myocarditis (OR 1.3), diabetes (OR 1.2), mesothelioma (OR 9.3) were significantly associated with increased odds of being in a more vulnerable cluster.

The epidemiology was investigated based on infection rate, death rate, case fatality rate, Gender, Age group, and Medical conditions (Comorbid and Symptomatic). The overall median age of infected male was 58 years and of female was 45 years. While average mortality age in male was 60 years and of female was 65 years which is greater than the global average of 50 years. The results also report that specially after age of 40 years in both men and women, chances of infection are more while comorbidities increase the infection rate. The men are more susceptible to infection than women. In case of asymptomatic distribution trend was vice versa with 69.4% women and 30.6% in men. Second, most infected age group was reduced by 20 years in case of men with 47.37% infection for age group of 20C39 years.

Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. Descriptive analysis was then performed. Results A total of 12 studies involving 12 pregnant females, and 21 juveniles with MERS were included. The results of studies showed that the male to female ratio of juveniles patients was 1 to 1.63 and the age ranged from 9 months to 16 years. The primary transmission route of juveniles cases was family contact infection, accounting for 57.1% (12/21). Asymptomatic juveniles accounted for 57.1% (12/21), and the most common symptoms were fever, cough and shortness of breath. Some patients exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. The positive rate of MERS-CoV RCT test was 100.0% (21/21). As for chest radiograph, 73.7% (14/19) cases showed no obvious lesions, and juveniles with lesions were mainly bilateral. 3 patients with underlying diseases developed severe cases, the mortality was 9.5% (2/21). The age range of pregnant women was 27 to 39, with the gestational age from 6 to 38 weeks. The primary transmission route for pregnant women was nosocomial infection, accounting for 57.1% (4/7). Fever, cough, shortness of breath were common manifestations, while abdominal pain occurred in two female patients. The positive rate of MERS-CoV RCT test was 100.0% (11/11). The chest radiograph findings were mainly bilateral lesions, accounting for 55.6% (5/9). 80.0% of whole pregnant females were severe cases (8/10), 4 of them died, with the 50.0% (4/8) mortality in severe pregnant cases.

This cDNA has 1606 base pairs with a 251 bp 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) and a 15 bp 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). The gene encodes a protein with 376 amino acids residues. The expression levels of the -tubulin gene in S. chinensis were investigated among fundatrigeniae and overwintering larvae rearing under either natural conditions, or at 7.5 C and 18 C. No significant differences (P > 0.01) in gene expression levels were found in insects under these conditions. It is indicates that the -tubulin gene is highly conserved and then it may be used as a reference for further research in gene expression and reproduction determination in this important aphid.","output":"Full-length cloning, sequence analysis and expression detection of the -tubulin gene from the Chinese gall aphid (Schlechtendalia chinensis)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vegetarian diets can satisfy nutritional requirements and have lower environmental impacts than those containing meat.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine potential tradeoffs between vegetarian meals lower impacts but potentially higher FW compared to meat-containing meals. To examine this, seven consecutive days of plate FW data from Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) patients were collected and recorded from 471 meals. Mean total FW and associated greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) were higher among meat-containing meals (293 g/plate, 604 g CO(2)-eq/plate) than vegetarian meals (259 g/plate, 357 g CO(2)-eq/plate) by 34 g (p = 0.05) and 240 g CO(2)-eq (p < 0.001), respectively. Statistically significant differences were observed in both FW and associated GHGE across major food categories, except fruit, when comparing vegetarian and meat-containing meals. Overall, vegetarian meals were preferable to meat-containing meals served at LLUMC both in terms of minimizing FW and lowering environmental impacts. Other institutions serving vegetarian meal options could expect similar advantages, especially in reduced GHGE due to the high CO(2) embodied in meat.","output":"Comparison of Plate Waste between Vegetarian and Meat-Containing Meals in a Hospital Setting: Environmental and Nutritional Considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutrophils play significant roles in immune homeostasis and as neutralizers of microbial infections.

However, their roles in viral immunity are not well understood. In this review, we present an overview of neutrophil heterogeneity and its impact on the course and severity of viral respiratory infectious diseases.

OBJECTIVE This study aims to evaluate the correlation between the face mask and AV in a group of university students, triggering factors, the awareness, and attitudes of the students. METHODS A face-to-face survey was conducted to 200 participants (84 males, 116 females) who composed of third and fifth grade medical faculty students. The questionnaire compiled the demographic data, skin care habits, mask wearing habits, skin lesions developed on their faces with the use of face masks, awareness and attitudes of the students. RESULTS The mean age of the participants was 21.391.34 (range, 19-26 years). While 40.5% of the students developed new AV, 20.5% had exacerbation of their old AV. Lesions developed most frequently in the cheek (51%), chin (45.5%) regions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, being female (p=0.04), prolonged masks use (p=0.001), and fewer mask changes throughout the day (p=0.01) were found to be associated with the development of AV. Moreover, 90.5% of students stated that the face mask could cause the development of AV. The most frequent protective precautions of the students were the intermittent removal of face masks and regular handwashing. CONCLUSION The use of face masks triggers the development of AV in young people. Wearing masks over long periods of time without breaks and infrequently changing one's mask throughout the day may lead to the development of new or worsening of AV in young populations.","output":"The Development of Acne Vulgaris Due to Face Masks During the Pandemic and Risk Awareness and Attitudes of a Group of University Students."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Expanding conservation efforts to private land is paramount to halt biodiversity loss and achieve global conservation targets Individual landowners can play disproportionately important roles by establishing private parks and managing them with biodiversity-focused objectives However, several constraints hinder the expansion of such initiatives, and little is known about their extent, characteristics and keys for success Here, we provide insights on the conditions that favoured the establishment and conservation outcomes of a private reserve in central Spain whose management has been fully conservation-oriented for the past two decades We report on the actions implemented to accomplish four key targets that aimed at protecting and enhancing wildlife populations, and on the landholder's motivations to devote his personal resources to pursue this goal After acquiring the land, the landowner has made efforts to restore native wildlife populations after decades of poaching and intensive cattle raising Key actions included re-establishing degraded vegetation and fostering keystone rabbit populations to sustain carnivore populations Water bodies are maintained to provide drinking points and foster aquatic animal populations;nest boxes target birds and bats Many actions resulted from advice from multiple stakeholders, including public administration officers, academics, local residents and NGOs The estate's formal conservation status has made it a partner in major conservation projects, including repeated releases of captively bred Iberian lynx The landowner's determination for long-term conservation was formalised through a legal protected-area status The condition that drove the creation of the reserve was the landowner's intrinsic motivation, which resulted from conservation ethic, personal identity and the desire to share and educate about the multiple values of nature Additionally, several external conditions, such as accessibility and appropriate reserve size (biophysical conditions), the lack of need for economic activities (economic), a positive and pro-active relationship with multiple stakeholders (social-cultural), the protected-area status and the capacity to make decisions independently (governance-related), have helped sustain the project The landholder suggests that public policy should reduce the bureaucratic burden to intrinsically motivated landowners and provide them technical advice, trust and financial incentives to expand conservation on private land","output":"Enabling conditions for the implementation and conservation outcomes of a private nature reserve"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pre-trained word embedding models become widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP), but they disregard the context and sense of the text.

METHODS: Analyses included community-dwelling adults  70 years old with specimen collection between 4 April (epidemiological week 14) and 1 May (week 17) 2021. Adjusted VE was estimated by test-negative design. Cases were reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test-positive for SARS-CoV-2, and controls were test-negative. Vaccine status was defined by receipt of a single-dose  21 days before specimen collection, but a range of intervals was assessed. Variant-specific VE was estimated against viruses genetically characterized as Alpha, Gamma or non-VOC lineages. RESULTS: VE analyses included 16 993 specimens: 1226 (7%) test-positive cases and 15 767 test-negative controls. Of 1131 (92%) genetically characterized viruses, 509 (45%), 314 (28%), and 276 (24%) were Alpha, Gamma, and non-VOC lineages, respectively.

Sepsis leads to mortality, particularly in low-income countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Klebsiella pneumoniae, an opportunistic pathogen is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis. The success of K. pneumoniae as a pathogen can be attributed to its multidrug-resistance and hypervirulent-pathotype. Though the WHO still recommends ampicillin and gentamicin for the treatment of neonatal sepsis, K. pneumoniae is rapidly becoming untreatable in this susceptible population. With escalating rates of cephalosporin use in health-care settings, the increasing dependency on carbapenems, a last resort antibiotic, has led to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP). CRKP is reported from around the world causing outbreaks of neonatal infections. Carbapenem resistance in CRKP is largely mediated by highly transmissible plasmid-encoded carbapenemase enzymes, including KPC, NDM, and OXA-48-like enzymes. Further, the emergence of a more invasive and highly pathogenic hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP) pathotype in the clinical context poses an additional challenge to the clinicians. The deadly package of resistance and virulence has already limited therapeutic options in neonates with a compromised defense system. Although there are reports of CRKP infections, a review on neonatal sepsis due to CRKP/ hvKP is scarce. Here, we discuss the current understanding of neonatal sepsis with a focus on the global impact of the CRKP, provide a perspective regarding the possible acquisition and transmission of the CRKP and/or hvKP in neonates, and present strategies to effectively identify and combat these organisms.","output":"Neonatal Sepsis: The Impact of Carbapenem-Resistant and Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"These guidelines from the AST Infectious Diseases Community of Practice review the diagnosis and management of pneumonia in the post\\\\transplant period.

This study reviewed the main findings of different studies implemented from 2015 to 2021 to analyse the biosecurity situation at Belgian cattle farms, including attitudes and behaviours of cattle farmers and rural veterinarians regarding biosecurity measures. Specifically, the objective was to perform a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis of the situation and propose a new conceptual framework improving the level of biosecurity in the cattle sector. Biosecurity in cattle farming remains relatively low and faces multiple challenges. Its future improvement requires the different stakeholders to agree on shared goals and objectives and to carefully consider animal, public and environmental health, as well as socioeconomic and cultural factors. Further cost efficiency studies are required to identify the most important biosecurity measures and convince the stakeholders of their utility and benefits. Cattle farmers rely mainly on rural veterinarians for technical guidance and consider them as trustful informants. To be more effective in promoting these good practices, rural veterinarians need a proper guidance from the authorities, a proper training on biosecurity and communication, as well as an enabling environment.","output":"Biosecurity at Cattle Farms: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide and poses greatly threat to global health. COVID-19 also has an unneglected effect on migraine patients. Migraine attack frequency as one of migraine characteristics, its impact during COVID-19 deserves further research. We aimed to evaluate whether migraine attack frequency during COVID-19 pandemic differed from pre-COVID-19, and explore their possible influencing factors during the pandemic. METHOD This prospective cohort study enrolled 187 migraine patients who came from the Department of Neurology of West China Hospital from October 2019 to December 2019. After inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 157 patients were included. We collected demographic data, clinical characteristics and epidemiological contact information and followed up on March 2020. Then Paired-Samples T test, logistic regression and interaction tests were used to analyze data. RESULT We found that value of migraine attack frequency was 2.47  1.12 before and 3.54  1.79 during COVID-19 (P<0.0001). Then we divided patients into two group based on the difference of migraine attack frequency between COVID-19 period and pre-COVID-19 and employed logistic regression analysis. In the logistic regression analysis, divorced status (OR=6.53, P=0.0453), good sleep pre-COVID-19 and poor sleep during COVID-19 (OR=3.11, P=0.0432) had independent effect on migraine attack frequency during COVID-19 pandemic. And we found no interaction in the poor sleep during COVID-19 between various subgroups. CONCLUSION Migraineurs may suffer from more frequent migraine attack during COVID-19 pandemic. Pay more attention to marital status and assessment of sleep status may contribute to adjusting suitable treatment strategies of migraine patients during pandemic.","output":"Impact of Headache Frequency and Sleep during the COVID-19 Pandemic among Migraine Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El tratamiento inmunosupresor que recibe el receptor de un trasplante de rgano slido dificulta la respuesta defensiva frente a la infeccin.

Methods: A total of 191 cases of diagnosed and suspected COVID-19 patients admitted in Febrary 2020 in Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital were included. The patients were divided into 2019-nCoV continuous positive group, 2019-nCoV positive to negative group, and 2019-nCoV suspect group according to the results of pharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection. In addition, 27 patients without COVID-19 were set as control group to test the specificity. The serum samples were collected, and colloidal gold and chemiluminescence method were used to detect total antibodies (IgM+IgG) and IgM. SPSS 24.0 was used to compare the difference in antibody detection rates between the two methods. Results: The specificity of total antibodies (IgM+IgG) and IgM detection was 100%. Two methods of total antibody detection had no significant difference in continuous positive group (P=1.00).

Methods: Prospective study, evaluating the longitudinal profile of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in a random sample of 331 seropositive healthcare workers (HCW) of Spanish Hospitals Group. Serial measurements of serum IgG-anti-SARS-CoV-2 were obtained at baseline (April-May,2020), and in 2 follow-up visits. Linear mixed models were used to investigate antibody kinetics and associated factors. Results: A total of 306 seropositive subjects (median age: 44.7years;69.9 % female) were included in the final analysis. After a median follow-up of 274 days between baseline and final measurement, 235(76.8%) maintained seropositivity. Antibody titers decreased in 82.0%, while remained stable in 13.1%. Factors associated with stability of antibodies over time included age45 years, higher baseline titers, severe/moderate infection and high-grade exposure to COVID-19 patients. In declining profile, estimated mean antibody half-life was 146.3 days(95%CI:138.6-154.9) from baseline. Multivariate models show independent longer durability of antibodies in HCW with high-risk exposure to COVID-19 patients (+14.1 days;95%CI:0.6-40.2) and with symptomatic COVID-19 (+14.1 days;95%CI:0.9-43.0).

Many countries started the vaccination rollout of children in 2021; still, information about effectiveness in the real-world setting is scarce. The aim of our study was to evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-associated-hospitalisations in the 3-17-year population during the Omicron outbreak. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including individuals aged 3-17 registered in the online vaccination system of the Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 were administered to 12-17-year subjects; and BBIBP-CorV to 3-11-year subjects. Vaccinated group had received a two-dose scheme by 12/1/2021. Unvaccinated group did not receive any COVID-19 vaccine between 12/14/2021-3/9/2022, which was the entire monitoring period. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-associated hospitalisations was calculated as (1-OR) x100. Findings: By 12/1/2021, 1,536,435 individuals aged 3-17 who had received zero or two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were included in this study. Of the latter, 1,440,389 were vaccinated and 96,046 not vaccinated.

VE for the entire population was 82.7% during the period of Delta and Omicron overlapping circulation and decreased to 67.7% when Omicron was the only variant present. Interpretation: This report provides evidence of high vaccine protection against associated-hospitalisations in the paediatric population during the Omicron outbreak but suggests a decrease of protection when Omicron became predominant. Application of a booster dose in children aged 3-11 warrants further consideration.","output":"Effectiveness of BBIBP-CorV, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines against hospitalisations among children and adolescents during the Omicron outbreak in Argentina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cloud computing is an important milestone in the development of distributed computing as a commercial implementation, and it has good prospects. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an important service mode in cloud computing. It combines massive resources scattered in different spaces into a unified resource pool by means of virtualization technology, facilitating the unified management and use of resources. In IaaS mode, all resources are provided in the form of virtual machines (VM). To achieve efficient resource utilization, reduce users' costs, and save users' computing time, VM allocation must be optimized. This paper proposes a new multiobjective optimization method of dynamic resource allocation for multivirtual machine distribution stability. Combining the current state and future predicted data of each application load, the cost of virtual machine relocation and the stability of new virtual machine placement state are considered comprehensively. A multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm (MOGANS) was designed to solve the problem. The simulation results show that compared with the genetic algorithm (GA-NN) for energy saving and multivirtual machine redistribution overhead, the virtual machine distribution method obtained by MOGANS has a longer stability time. Aiming at this shortage, this paper proposes a multiobjective optimization dynamic resource allocation method (MOGA-C) based on MOEA/D for virtual machine distribution.

It requires systems coordination and is enacted through activities of patients, informal carers and professionals. This study compares practice to idealised descriptions of what should happen; identifying when, how and why process disturbances impact on quality and safety. Our objectives are to: 1. Document an intended model (phase 1, scoping review). 2. Refine the model with study of practice (phase 2, ethnography). 3. Use the model to pinpoint hot (viewed as problematic by participants) and cold spots (observed as problematic by researchers) within or when patients move across three contexts-hospice, hospital and community (home). 4. Create learning recommendations for quality and safety targeted at underlying themes and contributing factors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The review will scope Ovid Medline, CINAHL and Embase, Google Scholar and Imagesno date limits, English language only. The Population (palliative), Concept (medication use), Context (home, hospice, hospital) framework defines inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data will be extracted to create a model illustrating how processes ideally occur, incorporating multiple steps of typical episodes of prescribing and medication use for symptom control. Direct observations, informal conversations around acts of prescribing and medication use, and semistructured interviews will be conducted with a purposive sample of patients, carers and professionals. Drawing on activity theory, we will synthesise analysis of both phases. The analysis will identify when, how and why activities affect patient safety and experience. Generating a rich multivoiced understanding of the process will help identify meaningful targets for improvement. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval granted by the Camden & Kings Cross NHS Regional Ethics Committee (21/LO/0459). A patient and public involvement (PPI) coinvestigator, a multiprofessional steering group and a PPI engagement group are working with the research team. Dissemination of findings is planned through peer-reviewed publications and a stakeholder (policymakers, commissioners, clinicians, researchers, public) report/dissemination event.","output":"Getting palliative medications right across the contexts of homes, hospitals and hospices: protocol to synthesise scoping review and ethnographic methods in an activity theory analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical findings, plasma viral load, cytokines and chemokines of a 4-month-old infant with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were assessed at different phases of the disease.

A previous one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for detecting A/H1N1pdm virus (H1pdm rRT-PCR assay) was improved since the former probe had a low melting temperature and low tolerance to viral mutation. To help with the screening of the A/H1N1pdm virus, rRT-PCR assays were also developed for detecting human seasonal A/H1N1 (H1 rRT-PCR assay) and A/H3N2 influenza viruses (H3 rRT-PCR assay). H1pdm, H1, and H3 rRT-PCR assays were evaluated using in vitro-transcribed control RNA, isolated viruses, and other respiratory pathogenic viruses, and were shown to have high sensitivity, good linearity (R 2 =0.99), and high specificity. In addition, the improved H1pdm rRT-PCR assay could detect two viral strains of A/H1N1pdm, namely, A/Aichi/472/2009 (H1N1)pdm and A/Sakai/89/2009 (H1N1)pdm, which have mutation(s) in the probe-binding region of the hemagglutinin gene, without loss of sensitivity. Using the three rRT-PCR assays developed, 90 clinical specimens collected between May and October 2009 were then tested. Of these, 26, 20, and 2 samples were identified as positive for A/H1pdm, A/H3, and A/H1, respectively, while 42 samples were negative for influenza A viruses.

Males numbered 284 (50.5%), and females 278 (49.5%). Most of the patients in our study were aged 2-5 years (preschool children) (44.8%). The average number of medications prescribed per encounter was 2.37; 59.2% (789) of medicines were fixed-dose combination (FDC) products and two-thirds of FDCs were respiratory medicines (521). The most commonly prescribed medicines were respiratory medicines (47% of the total medicines prescribed). Others were antimicrobials (30.7%) and analgesic-antipyretics (18.8%). Among respiratory medicines, cough and cold preparations (prescribed in 13 different FDC products in 25 brand names) were prescribed most frequently (62%) followed by nasal preparations (21%) and beta(2) adrenergic agonist inhalers (9.2%). Ninety-eight percent of nasal preparations were isotonic saline drops (129).

To date, no effective treatments exist and current prophylactic therapy access is limited and is only 50% effective. To attenuate the risk of RSV infection, we hypothesized that bioengineering of either the virus particle or host cell via the covalent grafting of methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) [mPEG] would prevent infection. To this end, the anti-viral effects of grafting concentration, linker chemistry and polymer length on RSV infection was assessed. For viral modification, short chain polymers (2 kDa) were significantly more effective than long chain (20 kDa) polymers. In contrast, modification of host cells with small polymers provided no (0%) protection while long chain polymers effectively prevented infection. For example, at 48 hours post-infection at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 and grafting concentrations of 5, 7.5, and 15 mm, 20 kDa mPEG decreased infection by 45, 83, and 91%, respectively. Importantly, both viral and host cell PEGylation strategies were able to provide near complete protection against RSV infection of both non-polarized and polarized cells.

The aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. METHODS: The literature was systematically reviewed in MedLine without language restrictions. In addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard textbooks on the topic were reviewed. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were included. RESULTS: Most gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. (including VRE), Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), or Streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. Many gram-negative species, such as Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Shigella spp., can also survive for months. A few others, such as Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus vulgaris, or Vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. Candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. Persistence of other yeasts, such as Torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (Candida parapsilosis, 14 days). Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, SARS or rhino virus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, HAV, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. Blood-borne viruses, such as HBV or HIV, can persist for more than one week. Herpes viruses, such as CMV or HSV type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from only a few hours up to 7 days. CONCLUSION: The most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.","output":"How long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces?

METHODS The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in adults with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units across the US. Secondary outcomes were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (AKI-RRT), thrombotic events, and seven blood markers of inflammation and thrombosis. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted models were used. RESULTS Among the 4908 study patients mean (SD) age was 60.9 (14.7) years, 3095 (62.8%) were male, and 2552 (52.0%) were obese. In multivariable models, BMI was not associated with mortality. Higher BMI beginning at 25 kg/m2 was associated with a greater risk of ARDS and AKI-RRT but not thrombosis. There was no clinically significant association between BMI and inflammatory or thrombotic markers. CONCLUSIONS In critically ill patients with COVID-19, higher BMI was not associated with death or thrombotic events but was associated with a greater risk of ARDS and AKI-RRT.

However, influenza vaccination rates among EMS professionals are poorly quantified. OBJECTIVES We sought to document vaccination rates of EMS professionals and identify predictors of vaccination uptake. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional survey of North Carolina EMS professionals after the 2007-2008 influenza season. The survey assessed vaccination status as well as beliefs regarding influenza illness and vaccine effectiveness similar to the constructs of the Health Belief Model. Prediction of vaccine uptake was modeled using logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 601 EMS professionals completed the survey. Among the respondents, 47.9% reported receiving the influenza vaccination; vaccination rates varied among rural, suburban, and urban respondents (p = 0.01). Significant differences were found between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups regarding employer vaccine recommendation (odds ratio [OR] = 3.6, p < 0.01), employer-offered influenza training (OR = 1.5, p < 0.01), employer-offered vaccination (OR = 3.3, p < 0.01), and belief in vaccine safety (OR = 27.5, p < 0.01) and effectiveness (OR = 9.5, p < 0.01). Most respondents believed they were at higher risk for influenza, the risk of adverse reactions was outweighed by prevention of disease, the vaccine was safe and effective, and vaccination protected themselves and their patients; however, only 9.1% supported mandatory vaccination. Those who were not vaccinated cited reasons such as belief in personal health as a protector against influenza, concerns about vaccine effectiveness, and the lack of an employer mandate. Predictors of vaccination included previous influenza diagnosis, perceived higher risk compared with that in the general population, belief in vaccine effectiveness, belief of favorable risk benefit ratio, employer vaccine recommendation, and age. CONCLUSION In this multicenter evaluation of EMS professionals, influenza vaccination rates were unacceptably low. Previous influenza infection, employer vaccine recommendation, a perception of increased risk for contracting the illness, and favorable beliefs about vaccine effectiveness were all predictive of vaccination acceptance.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old female is hospitalized with hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID 19 pneumonia. Patient developed ARDS, pneumomediastinum, and septic shock with secondary bacterial infection requiring mechanical ventilator support and antibiotic therapy. Patient had a prolonged complicated hospital course with multiorgan failure including kidney injury, lacunar stroke and developed severe critical illness myopathy. Patient underwent tracheostomy and was discharge to long term acute care facility to wean from the ventilator. Due to persistent need of supplemental oxygen and intermittent tachycardia, chest X ray was performed which showed alveolar and interstitial infiltrates. Subsequently, CT angiogram chest was performed which showed no pulmonary embolism but a 7 cm left lung upper lobe mass extending from hilum along the mediastinum. Positron emission tomography (PET) performed showed minimal uptake in the mass without enhanced uptake in any other location. Percutaneous biopsy was pursued which showed numerous oval spindle cells clusters with rare lymphocyte suggestive of spindle cell thymoma. During rehabilitation, patient was later diagnosed with myasthenia gravis and planned to undergo thymectomy after functional status of the patient improves. DISCUSSION: Thymomas are the most common epithelial cell tumor of the anterior mediastinum composed of neoplastic epithelial cells with a variable number of lymphocytes which determines various histologic subtypes of thymic neoplasms based on Worl Health Organization (WHO) classification. Histologic subtyping of thymoma need complete resection of tumor but core biopsy can differentiate thymoma from carcinoma. Our patient had WHO type A spindle cell thymoma which is composed of fusiform or oval spindle cells with rare lymphocytes. It accounts for 22% of all thymomas with no gender predilection and mean age of diagnosis is sixth decade. Thymomas are commonly located in prevascular anterior mediastinum but, rarely, as described in our patient it can present as hilar mass extending along the mediastinal pleural into the left upper lobe which can mimic lung tumor. Prognosis is based on resectability of tumor, staging and histologic features. CONCLUSIONS: Thymomas can mimic lung malignancy on imaging studies and need histologic exam to confirm the diagnosis.

METHOD: A total of 675 first-year university students completed a full assessment of behavioral and emotional functioning at the beginning of the spring semester 2020. Of these, 576 completed the same assessment at the end of the spring semester, 600 completed at least 1 item from a COVID-related survey after the onset of COVID pandemic, and 485 completed nightly surveys of mood and wellness behaviors on a regular basis before and after the onset of the COVID crisis. RESULTS: Externalizing problems (mean = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.06 to 0.33, p = .004) and attention problems (mean = -0.60, 95% CI = -0.40 to 0.80, p < .001) increased after the onset of COVID, but not internalizing symptoms (mean = 0.18, 95% CI = -0.1 to 0.38, p = .06). Students who were enrolled in a campus wellness program were less affected by COVID in terms of internalizing symptoms (? = 0.40, SE = 0.21, p = .055) and attention problems (? = 0.59, SE = 0.21, p = .005) than those who were not in the wellness program.

RESULTS: We identified multiple mAbs from antibody phage display library made from COVID-19 patients and further characterized the R3P1-E4 clone, which effectively suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection and rescued the lethal phenotype in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Crystal structural analysis not only explained why R3P1-E4 had selectively reduced binding and neutralizing activity to SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying K417 mutations, but also allowed us to engineer mutant antibodies with improved neutralizing activity against these variants. Thus, we screened out R3P1-E4 mAb which inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and related mutations in vitro and in vivo. Antibody engineering improved neutralizing activity of R3P1-E4 against K417 mutations.

By May 10, 2020, it caused more than 280 000 deaths all over the world. Preliminary data reported a high prevalence of CoV-2 infection and mortality due to severe acute respiratory syndrome related CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in kidney-transplanted patients (KTRs). Nevertheless, the outcomes and the best treatments for SARS-CoV-2-affected KTRs remain unclear. METHODS: In this report, we describe the clinical data, the treatments, and the outcomes of 5 KTRs with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to our hospital in Ancona, Marche region, Italy, from March 17 to present. Due to the severity of SARS-CoV-2, immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors, antimetabolites, and mTOR-inhibitors were stopped at the admission. All KTRs were treated with low-dose steroids. 4/5 KTRs were treated with hydroxychloroquine. All KTRs received tocilizumab up to one dose. RESULTS: Overall, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in KTRs in the Marche region was 0.85%. 3/5 were admitted in ICU and intubated. One developed AKI with the need of CRRT with Cytosorb. At present, two patients died, two patients were discharged, and one is still inpatient in ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The critical evaluation of all cases suggests that the timing of the administration of tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, could be associated with a better efficacy when administered in concomitance to the drop of the oxygen saturation. Thus, in SARS-CoV-2-affected KTRs, a close biochemical and clinical monitoring should be set up to allow physicians to hit the virus in the right moment such as a sudden reduction of the oxygen saturation and/or a significant increase in the laboratory values such as D-dimer.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney transplant recipients: Experience of the italian marche region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims: To describe the epidemiological characteristics of patients admitted for COVID19 from March 2020 to January 2021 in our hospital under treatment with statins.

With these task data as the basis, it can generate three-dimensional visualizations, e.g. about the overall progress or the competences of individual developers. Developers, stakeholders and end users can meet in the collaborative virtual environment as avatars and establish a spatial structure with the task cards and visualizations. Therefore, VIAProMa with its adapted and customized mixed reality project management features supports both the shared meetings and the information flow in the project. The shared environment makes it a suitable tool for DevOpsUseXR, an extension to the DevOps workflow, where end users are able to participate in the development process in mixed reality.

We present the only contemporary reported case of COVID-19 myocarditis leading to recovery with utilization of biventricular impella for temporary mechanical circulatory support. No cases have been reported regarding utilization of Bi-V impella as therapy for management of SARS-CoV-2.. Case Report We present a 35 year old-woman with history of systemic sclerosis who was found to have 5 days of generalized malaise associated with fevers and cough. On arrival she was found tachycardic at 112 bpm and febrile 101.8 F. She tested positive for COVID-19 via nasal CPR. Cardiac enzymes were found elevated on admission with troponin T elevated at 0.28. On day two of hospitalization patient had spontaneous PEA arrest secondary to hypoxemia. Transthoracic echocardiogram(TTE) revealed EF <10% and RV impairment which compare to prior which had normal ejection fraction. Labs showed elevated lactic acidosis of 10. Invasive hemodynamics assessment RA 21 mmHg, PA 32/23(mean 26 mmHg) and PCWP 18 mmHg. Calculated PAPi 0.76, CO 2.1 L/min and CI of 1.2 L/min/m^2. Decision was made to place right and left sided ventricular impellas for mechanical circulatory support. She was started on IVIG for COVID-19 myocarditis along with remdesivir and solumedrol. After two weeks of continuous temporary mechanical circulatory support(TMCS), patient hemodynamics improved and she was able to be weaned from her need for TMCS. Repeat echocardiogram demonstrated recovery and remodeling with an LVEF of 60% and no significant valvular disease. She was discharge home at day 23 with no neurological deficit. Summary The use of biventricular continuous microaxial flow devices during acute COVID-19 myocarditis is key to allow ventricular rest and optimal offloading without the increased risk of surgically placed TMCS such as Centrimag or VA or VV ECMO. With recent emergency use by the FDA, its wide adaptation remains sparse. Our case demonstrates a unique approach to management of COVID-19 myocarditis. It is the only reported case in the literature utilizing biventricular Impella devices for circulatory support without the concurrent use of ECMO. Due to the success in this patient, this promising approach warrants continued investigation in the management of COVID myocarditis and cardiogenic shock.","output":"The First Reported Case of COVID-19 Myocarditis Managed with Biventricular Impella Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COV1D-19 pandemic, about 60 million of Italians stayed at home.

As drugs and vaccines of COVID-19 remain in development, accurate virus detection plays a crucial role in the current public health crisis. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) kits have been reliably used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, whereas isothermal nucleic acid amplification-based point-of-care automated kits have also been considered as a simpler and rapid alternative. However, as these kits have only been developed and applied clinically within a short timeframe, their clinical performance has not been adequately evaluated to date. We describe a comparative study between a newly developed cross-priming isothermal amplification (CPA) kit (Kit A) and five RT-qPCR kits (Kits BCF) to evaluate their sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and accuracy. METHODS: Fifty-two clinical samples were used including throat swabs (n = 30), nasal swabs (n = 7), nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 7) and sputum specimens (n = 8), comprising confirmed (n = 26) and negative cases (n = 26). SARS-CoV-2 detection was simultaneously performed on each sample using six nucleic acid amplification kits. The sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) and the accuracy for each kit were assessed using clinical manifestation and molecular diagnoses as the reference standard. Reproducibility for RT-qPCR kits was evaluated in triplicate by three different operators using a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive sample. On the basis of the six kits evaluation results, CPA kit (Kit A) and two RT-qPCR Kits (Kit B and F) were applied to the SARS-CoV-2 detection in close-contacts of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: For Kit A, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV/NPV and accuracy were 100%. Among the five RT-qPCR kits, Kits B, C and F had good agreement with the clinical diagnostic reports (Kappa  0.75); Kits D and E were less congruent (0.4  Kappa < 0.75). Differences between all kits were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The reproducibility of RT-qPCR kits was determined using a coefficients of variation (CV) between 0.95% and 2.57%, indicating good reproducibility.

OBJECTIVES This review aimed to provide updated information on the burden and risk factors of wrTBI among the working adult population. METHODS Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched using a combination of TBI, work, and epidemiology text words and medical subject headings. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion. Meta-analyses were conducted to estimate prevalence and mortality of wrTBI and a narrative synthesis was conducted to provide additional context. RESULTS Pooled proportions meta-analyses estimate that 17.9% of TBIs were work-related and 6.3% of work-related injuries resulted in TBI, with 3.6% of wrTBI resulting in death. Populations of wrTBI were predominantly male (76.2%) and were 40.4 years of age, on average. The most commonly reported industries for wrTBI were education and training, healthcare and social assistance, construction, manufacturing, and transportation. Falls, being struck by an object or person, motor vehicle collisions, and assaults were the most commonly reported mechanisms of wrTBI.

To examine this association and to establish a suitable cut-off value for AUC24/MIC, a multicentre prospective observational study was conducted in patients with MRSA bacteraemia. Data were collected on all patients aged 18 years with MRSA bacteraemia treated with vancomycin for 72 h without dialysis. The MIC was determined by broth microdilution (BMD) and Etest. Treatment failure was defined as (i) 30-day mortality, (ii) persistent bacteraemia (7 days) and (iii) recurrence (30 days after completion of therapy). AUC24 was estimated by a Bayesian approach based on individual vancomycin concentrations. The AUC24/MIC cut-off value for differentiating treatment success and failure was calculated by Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. In total, 117 patients were enrolled, among which vancomycin treatment failure occurred in 38 (32.5%). In univariate analysis, high vancomycin MIC and low trough levels were unrelated to treatment outcomes. In the CART analysis, low vancomycin AUC24/MIC [<392.7 (BMD) and <397.2 (Etest)] was associated with treatment failure.

It is detrimental to the consolidation of immunization program achievements and elimination of vaccine-targeted diseases. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in China and explore its contributing factors. A national cross-sectional online survey among Chinese adults (18 years old) was conducted between August 6, 2021 and August 9 via a market research company. We collected sociodemographic information; lifestyle behavior; quality of life; the knowledge, awareness, and behavior of COVID-19; the knowledge, awareness, and behavior of COVID-19 vaccine; willingness of COVID-19 vaccination; accessibility of COVID-19 vaccination services; skepticism about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine; doctor and vaccine developer scale; and so on. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate the associations by using logistic regression models. A total of 29,925 residents (48.64% men) were enrolled in our study with mean age of 30.99 years. We found an overall prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy at 8.40% (95% CI, 8.09C8.72) in primary vaccination and 8.39% (95% CI, 8.07C8.70) in booster vaccination. In addition, after adjusting for potential confounders, we found that women, higher educational level, married residents, higher score of health condition, never smoked, increased washing hands, increased wearing mask, increased social distance, lower level of vaccine conspiracy beliefs, disease risks outweigh vaccine risk, higher level of convenient vaccination, and higher level of trust in doctor and developer were more willing to vaccinate than all others (all p < 0.05). Age, sex, educational level, marital status, chronic disease condition, smoking, healthy behaviors, the curability of COVID-19, the channel of accessing information of COVID-19 vaccine, endorsement of vaccine conspiracy beliefs, weigh risks of vaccination against risks of the disease, making a positive influence on the health of others around you, and lower trust in healthcare system may affect the variation of willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine (all p < 0.05). The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was modest in China, even with the slight resulting cascade of changing vaccination rates between the primary and booster vaccination.

Variable outcomes of the infection and disease severity can be influenced by pre-existing risk factors. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS, targets the gut mucosal immune system and impairs epithelial barriers and mucosal immunity. We sought to determine the impact and mechanisms of pre-existing HIV infection increasing mucosal vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. We investigated changes in the expression of ACE2 and other SARS-CoV-2 receptors and related pathways in virally inflamed gut by using the SIV infected rhesus macaque model of HIV/AIDS. Immunohistochemical analysis showed sustained/enhanced ACE2 expression in the gut epithelium of SIV infected animals compared to uninfected controls. Gut mucosal transcriptomic analysis demonstrated enhanced expression of host factors that support SARS-CoV-2 entry, replication, and infection. Metabolomic analysis of gut luminal contents revealed the impact of SIV infection as demonstrated by impaired mitochondrial function and decreased immune response, which render the host more vulnerable to other pathogens. In summary, SIV infection resulted in sustained or increased ACE2 expression in an inflamed and immune-impaired gut mucosal microenvironment. Collectively, these mucosal changes increase the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity and result in ineffective viral clearance. Our study highlights the use of the SIV model of AIDS to fill the knowledge gap of the enteric mechanisms of co-infections as risk factors for poor disease outcomes, generation of new viral variants and immune escape in COVID-19.","output":"Altered Expression of ACE2 and Co-receptors of SARS-CoV-2 in the Gut Mucosa of the SIV Model of HIV/AIDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and has led to drastic reductions in non-urgent medical visits. Deferral of these visits may have critical health impact, including delayed diagnosis for melanoma and other skin cancers. We examined the influence of the pandemic on skin biopsy rates in a large population-based cohort. METHODS: Using a universal health care claims dataset from Ontario, we examined skin biopsies from January 6, 2020 to September 27, 2020, and compared these to the same period for 2019. Those diagnosed with anogenital cancers, younger than 20 years, residing out-of-province and with lapses in coverage were excluded. The sensitivity and specificity of claims diagnoses compared to a validated algorithm to identify keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), or to the cancer registry for melanoma was evaluated. Factors associated with biopsy during the early pandemic were investigated with modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: A precipitous drop in total skin biopsies (15% of expected), biopsies for KC (18%) and melanoma (27%) was seen with the onset of COVID-19 cases (p<0.01). Claims diagnoses were of high specificity for KC (99%), and for melanoma (98%), though sensitivity was less (61%, 28% respectively). In adjusted analysis, the elderly (80+ years), females and residents of certain regions were less likely to be biopsied during the pandemic. Subsequently, there were substantial improvements in biopsy rates over 10 weeks. However, compared to 2019, a large backlog of expected cases still remained 28 weeks after lockdown (45,710 all biopsy, 9,104 KC, 595 melanoma). INTERPRETATION: A drastic reduction in skin biopsies is noted early in the COVID-19 pandemic; this disproportionately affected the elderly, females and certain geographic regions. Though biopsies subsequently increased, a large backlog of cases remained after almost half a year. This will have implications for downstream care of skin cancer. Efforts should be made to limit diagnostic delay.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on skin cancer diagnosis: A population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional knowledge, along with archaeological and linguistic evidence, documents that California supports cultural and linguistically diverse Indigenous populations.

To increase platelet supply, we assessed the operational impact and effect on platelet quality of splitting units prior to storage. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Using production figures, we modeled the impact on unit numbers, platelet counts, and volumes of splitting only apheresis double donations into three units (yielding ? doses), or all standard dose units in half. To assess quality, eight pools of three ABO/Rh-matched apheresis (Trima Accel) double donations in plasma were split to ? and ? volumes in both Terumo and Fresenius storage bags. These were irradiated and subject to maximal permitted periods of nonagitation (3  8 h) before comparing platelet quality markers (including pH, CD62P expression) to Day 9 of storage. RESULTS Splitting all double donations into three predicted inventory expansion of 23% overall whereas halving all standard dose units clearly doubles stock. In our study, ? and ? doses contained 153  15  109 (~138 ml) and 113  11  109 (~102 ml) platelets respectively. Following storage, higher pH was observed in ? than in ? doses and in Terumo compared to Fresenius bags. The higher pH was reflected in better quality markers, including lower CD62P expression. Despite the differences, on Day 8 (of pH monitoring at expiry) all ? doses and most ? doses were pH 6.4.

Therefore, more effective therapeutics are urgently required. Sinapic acid is a phenolic phytochemical with significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective potential. RATIONALE AND PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: This study was conducted to evaluate hepatoprotective effect of this phytochemical in acetaminophen-induced model of ALI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male C57BL/6 mice were treated p.o. with sinapic acid (10 or 50 mg/kg) 3 times at 72, 24, and 1 h before APAP (300 mg/kg; i.p.) challenge. Functional factors of liver dysfunction were determined along with hepatic assessment of oxidative stress and inflammatory indexes and histopathological analysis was also conducted. Sinapic acid (50 mg/kg) properly decreased serum levels of ALT, ALP, and AST besides reducing liver level of ROS, MDA, IL-6, TNF-, NF-kB, and MPO and improved sirtuin 1, HO-1, Nrf2, SOD activity, and MMP with no significant effect on IL-1? and catalase activity in addition to decreasing activity of lysosomal enzymes including cathepsin B and ?-galactosidase. Also, sinapic acid at the higher dose ameliorated liver histopathological changes due to APAP and properly reversed NF-kB and Nrf2 immunoreactivity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that sinapic acid pretreatment effectively protects liver against adverse and hepatotoxic effect of APAP through its antioxidant- and anti-inflammatory potential linked to NF-kB/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and also via regulation of sirtuin 1, mitochondrial integrity, and lysosomal stabilization.","output":"Sinapic acid ameliorates paracetamol-induced acute liver injury through targeting oxidative stress and inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using as a template the crystal structure of COVID-19 main protease, we developed a pharmacophore model of functional centers of the protease inhibitor-binding pocket.

Moreover, no antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 was reported to date. Recently published reports on statin therapy on COVID-19 patients indicated that statin therapy is associated with a better clinical outcome and a significant reduction in mortality risk.MethodsBlind docking of the critical structural and functional proteins of SARS-CoV-2 like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, M-protease of 3-CL-Pro, Helicase, and the Spike proteins ( wild type and mutants) with the statin molecules were performed using the Schrodinger docking tool. Prevalent mutations in the spike protein were determined by analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences deposited in GISAID, using the NextAlign aligner tool. Wild type and mutant spike proteins were modeled using the Swiss Model server and subjected to energy minimization via YASARA server. The percentage of the allowed region was determined by the Ramachandran plot. The MD simulation studies of free protein templates and protein-ligand complex were performed using NAMD (Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics) program;v 2.8.ResultsWe observed that fluvastatin and pitavastatin showed fair binding affinities to RNA polymerase, 3-CL-Pro, and spike-double mutant with similar docking scores. But of all the target proteins, fluvastatin showed the strongest binding affinity to the helicase with the glide score, emodel score, and glide energy values of -11.333, -66.511 and -58.72 (kcal/mol), respectively. Pitavastatin having similar chemical properties like fluvastatin (logP and pKa values) exhibited strong biding affinities to RdRp, 3-CL-Pro, and S-double mutant.

Interestingly, PAK1-deficient mutant of melanocytes produces less melanin (only a half compared with the wild-type) in the presence of either serum (PDGF) or -MSH (alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone). These observations indicate that the major \\"pathogenic\\" kinase PAK1 is responsible for both shortening the healthy lifespan, and PDGF/-MSH-dependent melanogenesis. For screening of PAK1-blocking probiotic bacteria or their products, their anti-melanogenic as well as longevity promoting properties were examined. Recently it was found that C. elegans fed with Lactobacillus rhamnosus in Xinjiang cheese lives 40% longer than the worm fed with the standard E. coli. Interestingly, a Chinese traditional medicine called \\"ChiBai\\" fermented with the Lactobacillus rhamnosus also inhibited the -MSH-induced melanogenesis, and this bacteria itself produces butyric acid that blocks the oncogenic HDAC (histone deacetylase)-PAK1 signaling pathway. These findings strongly suggest, if not proven, that anti-melanogenic activity of Lactobacillus and many other probiotic bacteria might serve as a reliable indicator for their longevity promoting activity.

We previously showed that sputum neutrophils from infants with severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis have decreased SIRL-1 surface expression compared to blood neutrophils, and that SIRL-1 surface expression is rapidly lost from in vitro activated neutrophils. This led us to hypothesize that activated neutrophils lose SIRL-1 by ectodomain shedding. Here, we developed an ELISA and measured the concentration of soluble SIRL-1 (sSIRL-1) in RSV bronchiolitis and hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which are both characterized by neutrophilic inflammation. In line with our hypothesis, sSIRL-1 concentration was increased in sputum compared to plasma of RSV bronchiolitis patients, and in serum of hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to control serum. In addition, we show that in vitro activated neutrophils release sSIRL-1 by proteolytic cleavage, which can be prevented by proteinase 3 inhibition. Finally, we found that SIRL-1 shedding is prevented by extracellular adherence protein (Eap) from S. aureus. Notably, we recently showed that SIRL-1 is activated by PSM3 from S. aureus, suggesting that S. aureus may counteract SIRL-1 shedding to benefit from preserved inhibitory function of SIRL-1.

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness and impact of the typhoid conjugate vaccine Typbar-TCV against S Typhi among children in an outbreak setting of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) S Typhi in Pakistan. METHODS: This cohort study was done from Feb 21, 2018, to Dec 31, 2019. A census survey of all households located in the Qasimabad and Latifabad subdistricts of Hyderabad, Pakistan, was done at baseline, and 174 005 households were registered in the census. The Typbar-TCV immunisation campaign was initiated at temporary vaccination centres and 207 000 children aged 6 months to 10 years were vaccinated from Feb 21, 2018, to Dec 31, 2018. Social mobilisers informed parents about the vaccination process. Vaccination records were maintained electronically and linked with the household census surveys. Active surveillance for suspected and blood-culture-confirmed S Typhi was established in hospitals, clinics, and laboratories to assess the following outcomes: cases of suspected typhoid fever, culture-confirmed S Typhi, and antimicrobial resistance. An age-stratified cohort of 1100 vaccinated children was randomly selected from the vaccination registry, tested for Vi-IgG antibodies (data not reported), and followed up fortnightly (via telephone calls or household visits) until Dec 31, 2019, for ascertainment of outcomes during the study period. 20 847 vaccinated and unvaccinated children were randomly selected from the census registry as a quality control cohort and followed up from Oct 1 to Dec 31, 2019, for ascertainment of outcomes. Vaccine effectiveness against suspected, culture-confirmed, and XDR S Typhi was calculated. FINDINGS: 23 407 children from the census registry and surveillance system were included in the vaccine effectiveness analysis. 13 436 (574%) children were vaccinated, 12 214 (522%) were male, and 10 168 (434%) were aged 6C59 months. 5378 (230%) of 23 407 children had suspected S Typhi, among whom 775 (144%) had culture-confirmed S Typhi and 361 (686%) of 526 had XDR S Typhi. Vaccine effectiveness was 55% (95% CI 52C57) against suspected S Typhi (regardless of culture confirmation), 95% (93C96) against culture-confirmed S Typhi, and 97% (95C98) against XDR S Typhi. INTERPRETATION: Typbar-TCV is effective in protecting children against S Typhi infection in an outbreak setting, and was able, with moderate deployment, to curtail a major XDR S Typhi outbreak in a densely populated setting. The vaccine shows efficacy against S Typhi irrespective of antimicrobial resistance.

We aimed to develop a life expectancy table using a recently published simulation model for individuals with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: The simulation model was developed using data from a real-world population of patients with type 1 diabetes selected from the Swedish National Diabetes Register. The following six important risk factors were included in the life table: sex; age; current smoking status; BMI; eGFR; and HbA(1c). For each of 1024 cells in the life expectancy table, a synthetic cohort containing 1000 individuals was created, with other risk factors assigned values representative of the real-world population. The simulations were executed for all synthetic cohorts and life expectancy for each cell was calculated as mean survival time of the individuals in the respective cohort. RESULTS: There was a substantial variation in life expectancy across patients with different risk factor levels. Life expectancy of 20-year-old men varied from 29.3 years to 50.6 years, constituting a gap of 21.3 years between those with worst and best risk factor levels. In 20-year-old women, this gap was 18.9 years (life expectancy range 35.0C53.9 years). The variation in life expectancy was a function of the combination of risk factor values, with HbA(1c) and eGFR consistently showing a negative and positive correlation, respectively, with life expectancy at any level combination of other risk factors. Individuals with the lowest level (20 kg/m(2)) and highest level of BMI (35 kg/m(2)) had a lower life expectancy compared with those with a BMI of 25 kg/m(2). Non-smokers and women had a higher life expectancy than smokers and men, respectively, with the difference in life expectancy ranging from 0.4 years to 2.7 years between non-smokers and smokers, and from 1.9 years to 5.9 years between women and men, depending on levels of other risk factors. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The life expectancy table generated in this study shows a substantial variation in life expectancy across individuals with different modifiable risk factors. The table allows for rapid communications of risk in an easily understood format between healthcare professionals, health economists, researchers, policy makers and patients. Particularly, it supports clinicians in their discussion with patients about the benefits of improving risk factors.

Epidemiologists at the WA DOH established the Daily Literature Situation Report (Lit Rep), within the agency's incident management team, to support public health and state leaders in evidence-based decision making. However, from January to May, the scale of the pandemic response and daily volume of emerging information grew beyond the capacity of the WA DOH epidemiology team tasked with gathering, reviewing, summarizing, and disseminating it daily. OBJECTIVE: To ensure public health leaders maintained awareness of the rapidly evolving scientific literature during the pandemic to support evidence-based practice. DESIGN: The WA DOH contracted the University of Washington (UW) Alliance for Pandemic Preparedness to assemble a team of faculty and students to continue producing the Lit Rep. MAIN OUTCOME: In addition to the daily Lit Rep, the UW team developed in-depth reports addressing questions from public health leadership and further evolved the methodology for the daily reports to support long-term sustainability and broader accessibility.

RESULTS: Of 318 FRs, 225 (80.2%) underwent serology testing (LE: 163/207 [78.7%]; FF: 92/111 [82.9%]). The prevalence of positive serology for all FRs tested was 3/255 (1.2%). Two LE (1.2%) and one FF (1.1%) had positive serology (P = 1.0). Two hundred and twenty-four FRs responded to a survey regarding prior symptoms and testing. Fifty-eight (25.9%) FRs (44 LE; 14 FFs) reported the presence of COVID-19-like symptoms. Of these, only nine (15.5%) received reverse transcriptase C polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing; none were positive. Two of the three FRs with positive serology reported no COVID-19-like symptoms and none of these responders had received prior nasal RT-PCR swabs. The overall community positive RT-PCR rate was 0.36%, representing a three-fold higher rate of positive seroprevalence amongst FRs compared with the general population (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: Amongst a cohort of municipal FRs with low community COVID-19 prevalence, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-19 IgG Ab was three-fold greater than the general community. Two-thirds of positive FRs reported a lack of symptoms. Only 15.5% of FRs with COVID-19-like symptoms received RT-PCR testing. In addition to workplace control measures, increased testing availability to FRs is critical in limiting infection spread and ensuring response capability.","output":"Prevalence of COVID-19 IgG Antibodies in a Cohort of Municipal First Responders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has strained testing capabilities worldwide.

Defensins had been reported to effectively inhibit the proliferation of bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. Here, we screened the anti-HBV activity of 25 scorpion-derived peptides most recently characterized by our group. Through evaluating anti-HBV activity and cytotoxicity, we found that BmKDfsin4, a scorpion defensin with antibacterial and Kv1.3-blocking activities, has a comparable high inhibitory rate of both HBeAg and HBsAg in HepG2.2.15 culture medium and low cytotoxicity to HepG2.2.15. Then, our experimental results further showed that BmKDfsin4 can dose-dependently decrease the production of HBV DNA and HBV viral proteins in both culture medium and cell lysate. Interestingly, BmKDfsin4 exerted high serum stability. Together, this study indicates that the scorpion defensin BmKDfsin4 also has inhibitory activity against HBV replication along with its antibacterial and potassium ion channel Kv1.3-blocking activities, which shows that BmKDfsin4 is a uniquely multifunctional defensin molecule.

Objective: This study introduces a fully unsupervised method of mitigating correlation bias, demonstrated with sentiment classification on COVID-19 social media data. Methods: Correlation bias in sentiment classification often arises in conversations about controversial topics. Therefore, this study uses adversarial learning to contrast clusters based on sentiment classification labels, with clusters produced by unsupervised topic modeling. This discourages the neural network from learning topic-related features that produce biased classification results. Results: Compared to a baseline classifier, neural contrastive clustering approximately doubles accuracy on bias-prone sentences for human-labeled COVID-19 social media data, without adversely affecting the classifier's overall F1 score. Despite being a fully unsupervised approach, neural contrastive clustering achieves a larger improvement in accuracy on bias-prone sentences than a supervised masking approach. Conclusions: Neural contrastive clustering reduces correlation bias in sentiment text classification. Further research is needed to explore generalizing this technique to other neural network architectures and application domains.","output":"Neural Contrastive Clustering: Fully Unsupervised Bias Reduction for Sentiment Classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: We aimed to assess prevalence of IgG antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and factors associated with seropositivity in a large cohort of healthcare workers (HCWs).

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and ketofol on recovery after laparoscopic surgery in pediatric patients. METHODS Two hundred children with median age of 5 years who underwent laparoscopic surgery were randomized into two groups. Propofol 1% was used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia in group I, while ketamine-propofol combination (ketofol) was used in group II. Ketamine-propofol combination (ketofol) was prepared in the same applicator for group II. Ketofol ratios of 1:4 and 1:7 were used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia, respectively. A reduced McFarlan infusion dose was used in group I (1.2, 1.0, and 0.8 mL/kg/h for 15, 15, and 30 min, respectively), while a McFarlan infusion dose was used in group II (1.5, 1.3, and 1.1 mL/kg/h for 15, 15, and 30 min, respectively). Extubating time, duration of anesthesia, and length of stay in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) were recorded. RESULTS Extubating time was significantly lower in the ketofol group than in the propofol group (240 s vs. 530 s; p < 0.00001). Significantly shorter duration of anesthesia (47 min vs. 60 min; p < 0.00001) as well as length of stay in the PACU (35 min vs. 100 min; p < 0.00001) were recorded in ketofol compared to the propofol group. Total fentanyl (100 g (interquartile range, IQR 80, 125) vs. 50 g (IQR 40, 60); p < 0.00001) and propofol (260 mg (IQR 200, 350) vs. 160 mg (IQR 120, 210); p < 0.00001) consumption per body weight were significantly lower in the ketofol group.

In Algeria, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on 25 February, 2020, and the number of confirmed cases of it has increased day after day. To overcome this difficult period and a catastrophic scenario, a model-based prediction of the possible epidemic peak and size of COVID-19 in Algeria is required. METHODS: We are concerned with a classical epidemic model of susceptible, exposed, infected and removed (SEIR) population dynamics. By using the method of least squares and the best fit curve that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, we estimate the epidemic parameter and the basic reproduction number ?(0). Moreover, we discuss the effect of intervention in a certain period by numerical simulation. RESULTS: We find that ?(0) = 4.1, which implies that the epidemic in Algeria could occur in a strong way. Moreover, we obtain the following epidemiological insights: the intervention has a positive effect on the time delay of the epidemic peak; the epidemic size is almost the same for a short intervention; a large epidemic can occur even if the intervention is long and sufficiently effective. CONCLUSION: Algeria must implement the strict measures as shown in this study, which could be similar to the one that China has finally adopted.","output":"Parameter estimation and prediction for coronavirus disease outbreak 2019 (COVID-19) in Algeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modern lifestyle and adversities such as the COVID-19 pandemic pose challenges for our physical and mental health.

Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019s effects during pregnancy. Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death. Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset. Data suggest an incubation period of 5 days (range, 2C14 days). Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49C56 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness. Children have been rarely reported. Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54C73%). Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea. Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17C29% of hospitalized patients. Overall case fatality rate appears to be 1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate. In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults. Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases. All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse. For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients. Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion. Four of 5 women with severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks gestation delivered preterm. For Middle East respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died. Two pregnancies ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm. No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome. Currently no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Because coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring. Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations.

METHODS: An exploratory qualitative inquiry via at-a-distance semi-structured interviews and group discussions engaged a purposefully selected sample of oral health care workers and patients in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Participants were asked to appraise a preparedness model by considering how to prepare for oral care during a pandemic, while answering open-ended questions about the model content and visual presentation. Interviews and group discussions occurred between April 2020 and January 2021, were audio recorded, and transcribed verbatim. An inductive coding process was used to identify themes, subthemes, and categories of information until saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Seventy-four participants, including 19 dentists, 15 dental hygienists, 10 certified dental assistants, 9 administrators, and 21 patients, suggested modifications to the recently developed preparedness model. Individual interviews (41 participants) and group discussions (33 participants in groups ranging from 2 to 9 attendees each) lasted for an average of 53 min. Eighty-four hours of audio recordings led to more than 1110 single-spaced pages of transcripts. The thematic analysis identified 82 codes, 12 categories, and four main themes: life-long learning, critical thinking, personal and professional risk, and patient-centred care. These themes were understood within provider characteristics and social and environmental contexts. Participants highlighted the need for the model to focus on information and communication, developing awareness and understanding, inferring risks, and performing oral health care during a threat such as a pandemic or disease outbreak. A modified portrayal of the model was suggested to better represent participants' perspectives.

This study examines the public's perceptions of the pandemic, assesses the extent to which participants have adhered to a range of recommended health-protective behaviours to prevent infection and evaluates whether anxiety about COVID-19 or perceptions related to the pandemic are associated with greater adherence to these behaviours. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional, survey-based design was used. Data were collected using an electronic survey distributed to students, staff and faculty at universities in the three major cities of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi, Al Ain and Dubai, between the 23rd and 31st of April 2020. A total of 634 participants were included in the analysis. METHODS: Participants reported whether they had adhered to health-protective behaviours such as spatial distancing, increased hygiene and disinfection and diminished time spent outside their homes. They also reported the perceived efficacy of a range of behaviours aimed at reducing risk for contracting COVID-19. Data relating to perception of risk, negative consequences of contracting the disease, perceived longevity of the illness and perceptions of the accuracy of the information read about COVID-19 were collected. Anxiety related to COVID-19 was also assessed, as well as a range of demographic variables. Binary logistic regressions were used to examine whether the demographic variables, perceived efficacy ratings and the perception variables were associated with overall adherence. RESULTS: A total of 44.8% of the sample reported adherence to all the examined behaviours. Participants who were employed, those with some or completed postsecondary education and those with a chronic illness diagnosis were more likely to adhere to the precautionary behaviours. The perception of personal risk of infection (odds ratio [OR]: 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-0.98), perception of substantial life consequences of becoming infected (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.75-0.10) and the perception that the public health information was clear (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57-0.83) were all positively related with behavioural adherence. The health-protective behaviours were all perceived as being highly efficacious in combating infection, and these efficacy ratings were also positively associated with greater behavioural adherence (OR: 0.41-0.77). Having read the official government public health information was related to greater behavioural adherence (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.23-0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Dissemination of reliable public health information during a public health crisis is essential. This study's results highlight the importance of providing the public with information that is clear and consistent and, moreover, emphasises the efficacy of the recommended behaviours as this is likely to improve adherence. When individuals perceive themselves to be at personal risk and are aware of the severity of the consequences posed by the illness, they are more likely to adopt caution. However, in this sample, the trustworthiness of the information portrayed in the media and the perceived duration of the pandemic - whether this would resolve soon or persist well into the future - did not impact adherence.","output":"Public perceptions, anxiety and the perceived efficacy of health-protective behaviours to mitigate the spread of the SARS-Cov-2/ COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to worsen the global problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Preclinical students had a higher mean score for anger (p=0.002). Conversely, students in the clinical phase had higher scores for anxiety (p=0.005) and sadness (p=0.027). The regression analysis of emotional responses and coping strategies suggests that avoidant coping is a predictor of anger (p=0.003) and sadness (p=0.005).

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to combine the evidence from prospective studies addressing the association between thyroid function and type 2 diabetes risk. METHODS: We systematically searched in Embase, Medline (Ovid), Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar for prospective studies assessing the association of thyroid function and incident type 2 diabetes. Data extraction was performed using a standardized protocol by 2 independent reviewers. We assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI using random-effects models. RESULTS: From the 4574 publications identified, 7 met our inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative synthesis. Six publications were included in the meta-analysis. Studies assessed hypothyroidism (6 studies), hyperthyroidism (5 studies), thyrotropin (TSH) in the reference range (4 studies), and free thyroxine (FT4) in the reference range (3 studies) in relation to incident type 2 diabetes. The pooled HR for the risk of type 2 diabetes was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.05-1.52) for hypothyroidism, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.90-1.49) for hyperthyroidism, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.96-1.17) for TSH in the reference range, and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-0.98) for FT4 in the reference range. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests an increased type 2 diabetes risk in people with hypothyroidism and lower FT4 levels in the reference range.

In this case, bispectral index (BIS) monitoring, a specific electroencephalogram-derived monitoring, can be used to find the optimal seizure induction time during anesthesia to elicit adequate seizures. A measurement of seizure adequacy in electroencephalogram is the postictal suppression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of seizure induction time on the degree of postictal suppression by comparing BIS versus no-BIS monitoring in MST and ECT. METHODS Twenty patients with treatment-resistant depression were randomly assigned to either MST or ECT. Each patient underwent 3 treatments with the determination of seizure induction time by defined prestimulation BIS (BIS condition) and 3 treatments with determination of seizure induction time by controlled clinical trial protocol (no-BIS condition). Statistical analysis was calculated by repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS The degree of postictal suppression was more pronounced in both MST and ECT, with BIS monitoring. In this connection, no differences between MST and ECT were found. Seizure induction time was significantly later in the BIS condition (181.3  6 seconds) compared with the no-BIS condition (114.3  12 seconds) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Adequacy of seizures, in the form of the degree of postictal suppression, was superior by determining the seizure induction time with BIS in both MST and ECT.

The restrictions imposed by government agencies impacted the daily lives of citizens, influencing several health behaviors, such as physical activity (PA). Thus, the present study aimed to assess the prevalence of physical inactivity (PI) and its associated factors before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A population-based household seroepidemiological survey was conducted in two Brazilian municipalities located in the state of Minas Gerais, in which 1750 volunteers were interviewed between October and December 2020. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire in an electronic format. The moments considered for the PI analysis were M0 (before the pandemic), M1 (from March to July 2020), and M2 (from October to December 2020). Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to examine the factors associated with PI before (M0) and during the pandemic (M1 and M2). Results The prevalence of PI was higher in the first months of the pandemic (M1) (67.3%;95% confidence interval (CI): 62.4-71.9) than in the months from October to December 2020 (M2) (58.7%;95% CI: 52.8-64.3);however, at both times (M1 and M2), PI was more prevalent than in the period before the pandemic started (M0) (39.7%;95% CI: 35.6-43.8). Individuals who were overweight, obese, and had low educational levels were more likely to be physically inactive. At both M1 and M2, individuals who worked at a home office were less likely to have PI. Conclusions The results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively influenced PA, substantially increasing the prevalence of PI.

Coronaviruses belong to enveloped ssRNA viruses and are classified into four genera: Alpha coronavirus, Beta coronavirus, Gamma coronavirus and Delta coronavirus. It is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily during a personal contact via bigger respiratory droplets. These droplets with viruses can be directly inhaled by other people or can lend on the surfaces with the possibility of further spreading. The ocular surface has been suggested as one of possible infection entries. Human eye has its own renin-angiotensin system with present ACE2 receptors, which bind the virus through spike protein. The most common symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection are fever, cough and dyspnoea. Several clinical entities, such as conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis have been associated with this infection. The most common ophthalmologic symptom associated with COVID-19 disease is conjunctivitis. Some studies indicate that eye symptoms are commonly present in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and that it is possible to detect viral RNA from the conjunctival sac of these patients. In ophthalmologic praxis, we manage not only the therapy of the eye structures\` inflammation in relation with this infection, but also the overall management of the visits and the supervision of the patients who are at risk and positive for coronavirus.

METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review for studies of fetoscopic or open fetal surgery performed since 1990, recording maternal complications during fetal surgery, the remainder of pregnancy, delivery, and after the index pregnancy. RESULTS One hundred sixty-six studies were included, reporting outcomes for open fetal (n = 1193 patients) and fetoscopic surgery (n = 9403 patients). No maternal deaths were reported. The risk of any maternal complication in the index pregnancy was 20.9% (95%CI, 15.22-27.13) for open fetal and 6.2% (95%CI, 4.93-7.49) for fetoscopic surgery. For severe maternal complications (grades III to V Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications), the risk was 4.5% (95% CI 3.24-5.98) for open fetal and 1.7% (95% CI, 1.19-2.20) for fetoscopic surgery. In subsequent pregnancies, open fetal surgery increased the risk of preterm birth but not uterine dehiscence or rupture. Nearly one quarter of reviewed studies (n = 175, 23.3%) was excluded for failing to report the presence or absence of maternal complications. CONCLUSIONS Maternal complications occur in 6.2% fetoscopic and 20.9% open fetal surgeries, with serious maternal complications in 1.7% fetoscopic and 4.5% open procedures.

METHODS AND RESULTS Antifungal effect of the classical nasal drop, Anu taila, against Mucor spp. was investigated through microbiological, cytological, analytical chemical (HPLC and GS/MS/MS) and field emission scanning electron microscopic (FE-SEM) approaches. Anu taila pre-treated spores germinated late, resulting in reduced infectivity, observed as milder monocytic immune response. Conversely, Anu taila pre-treated THP-1 cells exhibited an improved immune response, through TNF-, against Mucor spores. Repeated Anu taila application abolished fungal microarchitectures faster than Amphotericin B, evident from rapid replacement of hyphae, sporangiophores and sporangia with fused biomass, in the FESEM images. Anu taila downregulated sterol-C5-desaturase-coding ERG3 gene, crucial for ergosterol biosynthesis and resultant structural integrity, in Mucor spp. CONCLUSION Taken together, Anu taila was found effective against Mucor spp., with both prophylactic and curative implications, attributable to its phytochemical composition.

Ang II, still considered the main effector of RAS was believed to act only as a circulating hormone via angiotensin receptors, AT1 and AT2. Since then, an expanded view of RAS has gradually emerged. Local tissue RAS systems have been identified in most organs. Recently, evidence for an intracellular RAS has been reported. The new expanded view of RAS therefore covers both endocrine, paracrine and intracrine functions. Other peptides of RAS have been shown to have biological actions; angiotensin 2C8 heptapeptide (Ang III) has actions similar to those of Ang II. Further, the angiotensin 3C8 hexapeptide (Ang IV) exerts its actions via insulin\\\\regulated amino peptidase receptors. Finally, angiotensin 1C7 (Ang 1C7) acts via mas receptors. The discovery of another ACE2 was an important complement to this picture. The recent discovery of renin receptors has made our view of RAS unexpectedly complex and multilayered.

METHODS: 73 anaesthetised rats (acid aspiration model) were ventilated (protective or non-protective) for up to 4 hours to generate a spectrum of lung injury. CT was performed (inspiratory and expiratory) at baseline each hour, paired inspiratory and expiratory images were superimposed and voxels tracked in sequential scans. In nine patients with ARDS, paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans from the first intensive care unit week were analysed. RESULTS: In experimental studies, regions of lung with unstable inflation (ie, partial or reversible airspace filling reflecting local strain) were the areas in which subsequent progression of injury was greatest in terms of progressive infiltrates (R=0.77) and impaired compliance (R=0.67, p<0.01).

Study Design: We performed a retrospective chart review of 113 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without MIS-C admitted at Children's Hospital of Michigan (CHM) from March to August 2020. Patient demographic details, laboratory data, imaging studies, echocardiography reports, and treatment data were collected. Results: Of the 92 patients included in the final analysis, 22 (24%) developed AKI with 8/22 (36%) developing stage 3 AKI. The prevalence of AKI was much higher in patients with MIS-C 15/28 (54%) vs. those with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection 7/64 (11%), (p < 0.001). Overall, when compared to patients without AKI, patients with AKI were older in age (11 vs. 6.5 years, p = 0.007), African American (86 vs. 58%, p = 0.028), had MIS-C diagnosis (68 vs. 19%, p < 0.001), required ICU admission (91 vs. 20%, p < 0.001), had cardiac dysfunction (63 vs. 16%, p < 0.001), required inotropic support (59 vs. 6%, p < 0.001) and had a greater elevation in inflammatory markers. In a multivariate analysis, requirement of inotropes [Odds Ratio (OR)?22.8, p < 0.001], African American race (OR-8.8, p = 0.023) and MIS-C diagnosis (OR-5.3, p = 0.013) were the most significant predictors for AKI. All patients had recovery of kidney function, and none required kidney replacement therapy. Conclusion: Children with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C are at risk for AKI, with the risk being significantly greater with MIS-C. The pathogenesis of AKI in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be a combination of both renal hypo-perfusion and direct renal parenchymal damage whereas in MIS-C, the renal injury appears to be predominantly pre-renal from cardiac dysfunction and capillary leak from a hyperinflammatory state. These factors should be considered by clinicians caring for these children with a special focus on renal protective strategies to aid in recovery and prevent additional injury to this high-risk subgroup.","output":"Acute Kidney Injury in Pediatric Acute SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C): Is There a Difference?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. The aim of this study was to investigate patient outcomes and nutritional deficiencies following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) during a follow-up of two years. Methods. Over a period of 56 months, all consecutive patients who underwent SG were documented in this prospective, single-center, observational study. The study endpoints included operative time, complication rates, nutritional deficiencies and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL). Results. From September 26, 2005 to May 28, 2009, 82 patients (female : male = 48 : 34) with a mean age of 43.3 years (range: 22-64) and a preoperative BMI of 52.5 kg/m2 (range: 36.8-77.0) underwent SG. Major complications were observed in 9.8% of the patients, with 1 death. During follow up 51.2% of patients were supplemented with iron, 36.6% with zinc, 37.8% with calcium, 26.8% with vitamin D, 46.3% with vitamin B12 and 41.5% with folic acid. %EWL was 54.3, 65.3 and 62.6% after 6, 12 and 24 months. Conclusion. SG as a single step procedure is an effective bariatric intervention. Nutritional deficiencies after SG can be detected by routine nutritional screening.

Evidence from (voluntary) task switching studies suggests performance-contingent reward as one modulating factor. Depending on the immediate reward history, reward prospect seems to promote either cognitive stability or flexibility: Increasing reward prospect reduced switch costs and increased the voluntary switch rate, suggesting increased cognitive flexibility. In contrast, remaining high reward prospect increased switch costs and reduced the voluntary switch rate, suggesting increased cognitive stability. Recently we suggested that increasing reward prospect serves as a meta-control signal toward cognitive flexibility by lowering the updating threshold in working memory. However, in task switching paradigms with two tasks only, this could alternatively be explained by facilitated switching to the other of two tasks. To address this issue, a series of task switching experiments with uncued task switching between three univalent tasks was conducted. Results showed a reduction in reaction time (RT) switch costs to a nonsignificant difference and a high voluntary switch rate when reward prospect increased, whereas repetition RTs were faster, switch RTs slower, and voluntary switch rate was reduced when reward prospect remained high. That is, increasing reward prospect put participants in a state of equal readiness to respond to any target stimulus-be it a task repetition or a switch to one of the other two tasks. The study thus provides further evidence for the assumption that increasing reward prospect serves as a meta-control signal to increase cognitive flexibility, presumably by lowering the updating threshold in working memory.","output":"How Sequentially Changing Reward Prospect Modulates Meta-control: Increasing Reward Prospect Promotes Cognitive Flexibility."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To ensure the safety and quality of vaccines, especially the newest RNA-vaccines against COVID-19, is one of the World Health Organization's current highest priorities.

RESULTS: Of 4481 publications retrieved, 386 met the eligibility criteria for this study. These publications covered a wide range of conditions, but the majority were based on one or only a small number of neurological conditions. In particular, publications concerned with three discrete areas of neurological practice - multiple sclerosis (MS), epilepsy/seizure and Parkinson's disease - accounted for 60% of the total. MS was the focus of the highest proportion of eligible studies (35%), yet in the recent Global Burden of Neurological Disease study it ranks only 14th out of 15 neurological disorders for DALY rates. In contrast, migraine is the neurological disorder with the highest ranking of DALYs globally (after stroke) and yet it was represented by only 4% of eligible studies.

Factors affecting the adoption of surgical innovation are not well understood and proposed models of adoption do not accurately correlate with historical evidence. This protocol is for a systematic review that aims to identify the qualitative evidence relating to surgeon views regarding the adoption of novel surgical innovation into clinical practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidance will be performed. Two independent reviewers will search the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews. Inclusion criteria are studies which report on the views of surgeons who adopt a novel surgical innovation into clinical practice. Each article will be screened for inclusion and assessed according to a Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. Data will be synthesised and analysed according to thematic analysis. Given the anticipated yield of a small heterogeneous body of evidence meeting the eligibility criteria for the review, a narrative-based summary is planned. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This review does not require formal ethical approval as it does not involve direct patient contact or patient-identifiable data.

The colonization strategy employed was highly variable through time, ranging from the construction of militarized fortresses (Middle Kingdom 2050-1650 BCE) to an amicable co-existence approach (New Kingdom 1550-1050 BCE). Egyptian tactics also varied spatially, depending on several factors including a colonized community's utility to the empire and the potential for revolt. Using a large dataset (n = 341), this paper compares osteoarthritis between seven Nubian communities to (1) evaluate whether imperial strategy impacted osteoarthritis severity and (2) assess whether rates of osteoarthritis differed between colonized communities. Age-controlled analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) suggests there was significant variation in the frequency and severity of osteoarthritis throughout the empire. The Middle Kingdom C-Group, an indigenous Nubian population that lived outside the Egyptian-built and -occupied fortresses, displayed the highest rates of osteoarthritis for nearly all joint systems. Osteoarthritis then decreased during the postcolonial Second Intermediate Period (1650-1550 BCE) and again increased during the recolonization of the New Kingdom. However, there is significant variation of osteoarthritis at three New Kingdom sites, each of which experienced a differing colonization approach. This study suggests that the varying imperial strategies utilized by the Egyptian Empire may have impacted the physical activities and daily lives of Nubians and that these tactics were not equal throughout Nubia but were tailored to communities. It is therefore difficult to discuss a singular outcome of colonization;rather, these interpretations need to be nuanced with community-level archaeological context.","output":"The embodiment of colonial strategy: Osteoarthritis in ancient Nubia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tinnitus represents a relatively common condition in the global population accompanied by various comorbidities and severe burden in many cases. Nevertheless, there is currently no general treatment or cure, presumable due to the heterogeneity of tinnitus with its wide variety of etiologies and tinnitus phenotypes. Hence, most treatment studies merely demonstrated improvement in a subgroup of tinnitus patients. The majority of studies are characterized by small sample sizes, unstandardized treatments and assessments, or applications of interventions targeting only a single organ level. Combinatory treatment approaches, potentially targeting multiple systems as well as treatment personalization, might provide remedy and enhance treatment responses. The aim of the present study is to systematically examine established tinnitus therapies both alone and in combination in a large sample of tinnitus patients. Further, it wants to provide the basis for personalized treatment approaches by evaluating a specific decision support system developed as part of an EU-funded collaborative project (Unification of treatments and interventions for tinnitus patients; UNITI project). METHODS/STUDY DESIGN: This is a multi-center parallel-arm randomized clinical trial conducted at five different clinical sites over the EU. The effect of four different tinnitus therapy approaches (sound therapy, structured counseling, hearing aids, cognitive behavioral therapy) applied over a time period of 12 weeks as a single or rather a combinatory treatment in a total number of 500 chronic tinnitus patients will be investigated. Assessments and interventions are harmonized over the involved clinical sites. The primary outcome measure focuses on the domain tinnitus distress assessed via the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory. DISCUSSION: Results and conclusions from the current study might not only provide an essential contribution to combinatory and personalized treatment approaches in tinnitus but could also provide more profound insights in the heterogeneity of tinnitus, representing an important step towards a cure for tinnitus.

AIM: To determine the effect of MERS-CoV on the immune response in infected patients and investigate cytokine production in the A549 epithelial cell line in response to a recombinant MERS-CoV spike protein (rSP) in the presence or absence of anti-dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) antibody (3 independent experiments). Cytokine levels were measured using a cytokine ELISA array. METHODS: A Bio-Plex multiplex assay and cytokine ELISA were used in our study to measure the cytokine levels. RESULTS: Comparative analysis of MERS-CoV-infected patients (4 samples) and noninfected healthy controls (HCs) (5 samples) showed that serum levels of the following cytokines and chemokines were significantly higher in MERS-CoV patients than in the HCs (*p < 0.05): interferon (IFN)-2 (43.4 vs 5.4), IFN- (17.7 vs 6.2), IFN- (43.4 vs 9.7), interleukin (IL)-8 (13.7 vs 0), IL-2 (11.2 vs 3), IL-27p28 (57.8 vs 13.8), and IL-35 (167.5 vs 87.5). DISCUSSION: Our results revealed that MERS-CoV infection induced a slight increase in IFN levels but triggered a more pronounced increase in expression of the regulatory cytokines IL-27 and IL-35. A recombinant version of the full-length MERS-CoV spike protein increased the expression of IL-8 (160 pg/mL), IL-2 (100 pg/mL) and IL-12 (65 pg/mL) in A549 lung epithelial cells compared to that in the unstimulated control cells. The presence of anti-DPP4 antibody did not affect cytokine suppression or induction in A549 cells in vitro but decreased the level of IL-8 from 160 pg/mL to 65 pg/mL. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV can decrease IFN levels to interfere with the IFN pathway and enhance the production of regulatory cytokines.

We also explore how changes in search patterns relate to income support policies and to COVID-19 death rates. METHOD Using Google Trends data and an event-study design, as well as a difference-in-differences analysis, we investigate the association between country specific stay-at-home orders and internet searches including the following words: insomnia, stress, anxiety, sadness, depression, and suicide. RESULTS We find three main patterns. First, searches for insomnia peak but then decline. Second, searches for stress, anxiety, and sadness increase and remain high throughout the lockdown. Third, there is no substantial change in depression-related or suicide-related searches after the lockdown. In terms of potential mechanisms, our results suggest that searches declined for suicide and insomnia following the passage of each country's income support, while in countries with higher COVID-19-related death rates, searches for insomnia, stress, and anxiety increased by more.

Thus, the deletion reduced the efficiency of spike processing and attenuates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, the QTQTN motif also contains residues that are glycosylated4, and disruption its glycosylation also attenuates virus replication in a TMPRSS2-dependent manner. Together, our results reveal that three aspects of the S1/S2 cleavage site - the FCS, loop length, and glycosylation - are required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis.","output":"QTQTN motif upstream of the furin-cleavage site plays key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

With a target of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030, EHE initially scales up effective HIV prevention and care in 57 localities that comprise the greatest proportion of annual HIV diagnoses in the United States (US). However, the EHE effort has been eclipsed by another infectious disease 11 months into the Initiative's implementation. SARS-COV-2, a novel coronavirus, has infected more than eight million Americans and at least 223 000 (as of 23 October 2020) have succumbed to the disease. This commentary explores the social conditions that place communities of colour at greater risk for COVID-19 and HIV, and assesses challenges to EHE in a post-COVID-19 universe. DISCUSSION: One of the many common threads between HIV and COVID-19 is the disproportionate impact of each disease among communities of colour. A recent report by the National Academy of Sciences surmised that as much as 70% of health outcomes are due to health access, socio-economic factors and environmental conditions. Social determinants of health associated with greater HIV burden in Black and Brown communities have re-emerged in epidemiological studies of disproportionate COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in communities of colour. Using data from the scientific literature, this commentary makes direct comparisons between HIV and COVID-19 racial disparities across the social determinants of health. Furthermore, I examine three sets of challenges facing EHE: (1) Challenges that hamper both the EHE and COVID-19 response (i.e. insufficiently addressing the social determinants of health; amplification of disparities as new health technologies are introduced) (2) Challenges posed by COVID-19 (i.e. diverting HIV resources to address COVID-19 and tapering of EHE funding generally); and (3) Challenges unrelated to COVID-19 (i.e. emergence of new and related health disparities; repeal of the Affordable Care Act and long-term viability of EHE). CONCLUSIONS: Racism and discrimination place communities of colour at greater risk for COVID-19 as well as HIV. Achieving and sustaining an end to the U.S. HIV epidemic will require structural change to eliminate conditions that give rise to and maintain disparities.","output":"New pathogen, same disparities: why COVID-19 and HIV remain prevalent in U.S. communities of colour and implications for ending the HIV epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has put community pharmacists at the frontline of prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. Pharmacies had to reorganize and implement several different interventions and measures within a very short time frame. OBJECTIVES: 1) To map the current reported practice and trends and to review the literature on pharmacy-based interventions on COVID-19 provided in Europe; 2) To identify knowledge gaps and future avenues for pharmacy research, policy, and practice in response to public health emergencies. METHODS: We used a mixed methods approach combining country mapping of current practices of pharmacy interventions on COVID-19 reported by pharmacy associations in Europe with a scoping review of published literature. RESULTS: We mapped current practices on 31 pharmacy interventions on COVID-19 in 32 countries in Europe. Almost all preventive measures to reduce health risks have been provided in most countries. Other frequent interventions reflected preparedness for stockpiling, increased demand for services and products, and important patient care interventions exceeding dispensing role. Expanded powers granted to pharmacies and legislation passed in view of COVID-19 enabled services that improve access to medicines and relevant products, patient screening and referral including point-of-care antigen testing, support to vulnerable patients, and COVID-19 vaccination. We identified 9 studies conducted in pharmacies in 7 countries in Europe. Most studies are cross-sectional and/or descriptive. Pharmacy associations played an important supporting role by developing and updating guidance and emergency plans to assist community pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS: A wide array of pharmacy interventions on COVID-19 was implemented in several countries within a very short time frame. Research on pharmacy interventions on COVID-19 is still in its infancy but confirmed the wide array of interventions provided and expanded powers granted to pharmacies.

This study aims to further characterize the anticonvulsant profile of these drugs. METHODS: HEPP and Cl-HEPP were evaluated in various standardized acute seizure and toxic tests in female Swiss-OF1 mice. RESULTS: Toxicities of HEPP and Cl-HEPP were limited; doses up to 30 mg/kg did not result in hypothermia, reduced spontaneous locomotor activity, or failure of the rotarod test, with doses >15 mg/kg potentiating pentobarbital-induced sleep. In maximal electroshock-induced seizures, 20 mg/kg Cl-HEPP protected 100 % of mice; lower doses shortened post-ictal recovery. Seizure protection occurred against subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole and picrotoxin, being limited against N-methyl-d-aspartate. In bicuculline test, clonic or fatal tonic seizures were decreased, onset delayed, and recovery improved; ED50 values (dose protecting 50 % of the animals) were 37.5 and 25 mg/kg for HEPP and Cl-HEPP, respectively. In magnesium deficiency-dependent audiogenic seizures (MDDAS), ED50 values were 3 and 8 mg/kg for Cl-HEPP and HEPP, respectively. The components of MDDAS (latency, wild running, seizure, and recovery phases) in unprotected animals were only minimally affected by near ED50 doses of Cl-HEPP and HEPP. DISCUSSION: HEPP and, to a greater extent, Cl-HEPP provide anti-seizure protections in several acute seizure tests in mice at nontoxic doses. These results are consistent with the action of these drugs on diverse molecular targets directly resulting from their MGBR antagonistic properties. However, other mechanisms might occur possibly for the protection given in the MES test. Finally, a similarity in the modulation of MDDAS components between the two phenyl alcohol amides and ethosuximide could also be based on the MGBR antagonistic properties of the former, given the recently re-evaluated therapeutic relevant targets of the latter.","output":"Anticonvulsive profile of two GABAB receptor antagonists on acute seizure mice models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The PLOS Medicine editors discuss prospects for health and development in the coming decade.","output":"Plans and prospects for the 2020s: Beyond peak health?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perioperative COVID\\\\19 infections in patients suffering from end\\\\stage renal disease (ESRD) are more likely to become severe, with a high mortality rate, than those in other patients.

The disease characteristics and demographic data were collected by phone calls during the first, third, and fourth weeks using a researcher-made questionnaire. Finally, the data were analyzed by univariate logistic regression and cross-tabulation using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 20. RESULTS: In the first week of follow-up, 23(5.8%) patients died, of whom seven patients were female and 16 were male (mean age of death: 70.733.27). Out of 41 (10.3%) patients with underlying diseases, 7 (17.1%) died; but out of 359 (89.8%) cases with no history of disease only 16 (4.5%) died. The risk of death in subjects with a history of underlying diseases was 3.27 times higher than those without a history of disease (P = 0.02) (OR = 3.27, 95% CI, 1.20C8.87); and this risk was 1.41 times higher in patients with more family members (P = 0.04) (OR = 1.41, 95% CI, 1.01C1.97).

However, many patients are skeptical about having several surgeries, as they may result in additional anesthesiological risks as well as multiple visible scars. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of prophylactic mastectomy and breast reconstruction combined with simultaneous transmammary salpingo-oophorectomy for BRCA carriers. MATERIALS AND METHODS Of the six patients (1 %) who chose prophylactic mastectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy at our hospital four patients had BRCA-1 mutations, one patient had a BRCA-2 mutation and one patient had a family inheritance pattern with no mutations. All patients chose to reduce their risk for mammary and ovarian cancer by undergoing bilateral mastectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Prophylactic mastectomy with immediate reconstruction was performed, followed by bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with a procedure that relies on transmammary access and reduces the number of necessary surgeries without compromising cosmetic results, surgical risks and operating time. RESULT The mean age of the patients was 46.7  1.8 years (SD). The mean operative time was 190.2  13.7 min. No complications were observed during the operations. The mean intra-operative loss of blood was 363.3  77.9 ml. The operative method was successful in all six cases and was performed with no complications. All of the patients were satisfied with the cosmetic results. CONCLUSION In conclusion, prophylactic mastectomy and breast reconstruction combined with simultaneous laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy via transmammary access is feasible, easy to perform and provides an intriguing and novel approach to female BRCA carriers who desire operative prophylactic measures in one surgical session with no visible abdominal scars and no additional risks and complications.","output":"Prophylactic mastectomy with immediate reconstruction combined with simultaneous laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy via a transmammary route: a novel surgical approach to female BRCA-mutation carriers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND since the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak a growing number of symptoms and deficits associated with the new pathology have emerged, among them cochlear damage in otherwise asymptomatic COVID-19 patients has been described.

METHODS: This longitudinal study will involve follow-up of a cohort of 25,000 individuals (5,000 per site) aged 2 years and above recruited from five existing demographic surveillance sites in India. The cohort will be tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against S1/S2 spike protein subunits of SARS-CoV-2 in four rounds; once at baseline and subsequently, at intervals of 4 months for a year between January 2021 and January 2022. Neutralization assays will be carried out in a subset of seropositive samples in each round to quantify the antibody response and to estimate the durability of antibody response.

METHODS Between 2003 and 2009, 121 patients underwent LSG (16, two-stage; 105, primary). Of the patients, 66% were women, mean age 38.8  10.9 (15.0-64.0), and body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) 48.7  9.3 (33.7-74.8). Bovine pericardium (Peri-Strips Dry [PSD]) was used to reinforce the staple line. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used, as appropriate. The paired t test was used to assess change from baseline; bivariate analyses and logistic regression were used to identify preoperative patient characteristics predictive of suboptimal weight loss. RESULTS Mean operative time was 105 min (95-180), and mean hospitalization was 5.6 days (1-14). There was no mortality. There were 6 (5.0%) complications: 1 intraoperative leak, 1 stricture, 1 trocar-site bleed, 1 renal failure, and 2 wound infections. There were no postoperative staple-line leaks. Following 15 concomitant hiatal hernia operations, 3 (20%) recurred: 1 revised to RYGB and 2 in standby. Two post-LSG hiatal hernias of the two-stage series required revisions because of symptoms. BMI decreased 24.7% at 6 months (n = 55) to 37.5  9.3 (22.2-58.1); %EWL was 48.1  19.3 (15.5-98.9). Twelve-month BMI (n = 41) was 38.4  10.5 (19.3-62.3); %EWL was 51.7  25.0 (8.9-123.3). Forty-eight-month BMI (n = 13) was 35.6  6.8 (24.9-47.5); %EWL was 61.1  12.2 (43.9-82.1) (p < 0.001). Preoperative BMI was predictive of >70% of patients who experienced <50% EWL at 6 months. At 2 weeks, 100% of type 2 diabetes patients (n = 23) were off medication (mean HbA(1C), 5.9  0.5%; glycemia, 90.0  19.9 mg/dL (p < 0.01) at 3 months).

Tissue-specific differentiation and survival of alveolar macrophages relies on niche-derived factors, such as colony stimulating factor 2 (CSF-2) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-). However, the nature of the downstream molecular pathways that regulate the identity and function of alveolar macrophages and their response to injury remains poorly understood. Here, we identify that the transcriptional factor EGR2 is an evolutionarily conserved feature of lung alveolar macrophages and show that cell-intrinsic EGR2 is indispensable for the tissue-specific identity of alveolar macrophages. Mechanistically, we show that EGR2 is driven by TGF- and CSF-2 in a PPAR--dependent manner to control alveolar macrophage differentiation. Functionally, EGR2 was dispensable for lipid handling, but crucial for the effective elimination of the respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. Finally, we show that EGR2 is required for repopulation of the alveolar niche following sterile, bleomycin-induced lung injury and demonstrate that EGR2-dependent, monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages are vital for effective tissue repair following injury. Collectively, we demonstrate that EGR2 is an indispensable component of the transcriptional network controlling the identity and function of alveolar macrophages in health and disease.

The \\"Virtual Diabetes Outpatient Clinic for Children and Adolescents 2.0\\" (VIDIKI 2.0) study investigated the effect of monthly and supplementary video consultations on standard care over one year. The qualitative substudy investigated the experiences of families with a child newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who received at least four weekly supplementary video consultations. METHODS: Guideline-based qualitative interviews were conducted with seven families with children under the age of eight and T1DM onset shortly before study entry. The answers were analyzed using a qualitative content analysis approach, particularly inductive category formation. RESULTS: Families of patients with T1DM onset have questions, almost daily, concerning various aspects of insulin therapy. The offer of high-frequency video consultations can reduce the number of trips to the diabetes team, facilitate the organization of daily life and increase the sense of security.

The new transcript, termed MIRb-ACE2, exhibits specific expression patterns across the aerodigestive and gastrointestinal tracts and is highly responsive to IFN stimulation. In contrast, canonical ACE2 expression is unresponsive to IFN stimulation. Moreover, the MIRb-ACE2 translation product is a truncated, unstable ACE2 form, lacking domains required for SARS-CoV-2 binding and is therefore unlikely to contribute to or enhance viral infection.","output":"Tissue-specific and interferon-inducible expression of nonfunctional ACE2 through endogenous retroelement co-option"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Visual Snow (VS) refers to the persistent visual experience of static in the whole visual field of both eyes. It is often reported by patients with migraine and co-occurs with conditions like tinnitus and tremor. The underlying pathophysiology of the condition is poorly understood. Previously we hypothesised, that VSS may be characterised by disruptions to rhythmical activity within the visual system1. To test this, data from 18 patients diagnosed with visual snow syndrome (VSS), and 16 matched controls, were acquired using Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants were presented with visual grating stimuli, known to elicit decreases in alpha-band (8-13Hz) power and increases in gamma-band power (40-70Hz). Data were mapped to source-space using a beamformer. Across both groups, decreased alpha power and increased gamma power localised to early visual cortex. Data from primary visual cortex (V1) were compared between groups. No differences were found in either alpha or gamma peak frequency or the magnitude of alpha power, p>.05. However, compared with controls, our VSS cohort displayed significantly increased V1 gamma power, p=.035. This new electromagnetic finding concurs with previous fMRI and PET findings suggesting that in VSS, the visual cortex is hyper-excitable. The coupling of alpha-phase to gamma amplitude (i.e., phase-amplitude coupling, PAC) within V1 was also quantified. Compared with controls, the VSS group had significantly reduced alpha-gamma PAC, p<.05, indicating a potential excitation-inhibition imbalance in VSS, as well as a potential disruption to top-down noise-cancellation mechanisms. Overall, these results suggest that rhythmical brain activity in primary visual cortex is both hyperexcitable and disorganised in VSS, consistent with visual snow being a condition of thalamocortical dysrhythmia.","output":"Cortical Oscillatory Dysrhythmias in Visual Snow Syndrome: A MEG Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Eastern Mediterranean Region continues to face a severe scale of emergencies as a direct result of conflict and political instability in a number of countries. As of 2020, nine countries out of 22 countries in the region affected by protracted and ongoing wars and conflict, left more than 62 million people in dire need of access to quality health care and adequate response measures. COVID-19 exacerbates the humanitarian needs of the people especially in countries that suffer from humanitarian crises, and drains the already overstretched health care systems. This study was conducted to derive major takeaways and lessons learned from the COVID-19 response in humanitarian and low resource settings that may assist similar vulnerable and fragile settings in different regions in view of a possible next pandemic. METHODS: The study involved a desk review, document analysis, and key informant interviews with key stakeholders from the Eastern Mediterranean Region. RESULTS: A total of 35 key informant interviews were carried out with health professionals working in humanitarian and low resource settings in the region. This study focuses on the information gathered from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.

We reported on the significant impact of the initial surge of the pandemic on wellbeing and job performance (Banerjee et al. 2021). As the pandemic continues, it is imperative to understand experiences and concerns to better inform support measures for the oncology workforce. Methods: Three anonymous online surveys were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (S1, Apr/May 2020;S2, Jul/Aug 2020;S3, Feb/Mar 2021). Longitudinal analysis of responses at these timepoints were conducted. Here, we present responses to questions on job demands and resources, and perceived job performance since COVID-19 (JP-CV). Results: We analysed 3894 individual responses (S1, n=1520;S2, n=942;S3, n=1432): 53% (n=1961/3731) female, 45% (n=1679/3731) =/<40 years, 31% (n=1132/3692) non-white ethnicity, >100 countries.

During the peak of the pandemic, Australia closed both its state and international borders to all travelers and interstate travel was very tightly regulated. Community pharmacists and pharmacy staff were one of the very few primary healthcare workers still serving their communities during these periods of strict lockdown. In this personal view article, the challenges and their toll on the mental health and wellbeing of these essential workers are described. KEY FINDINGS: Community pharmacists and pharmacy staff were under immense pressure to remain open and serve their communities amidst rapidly changing legislation and, at times, conflicting advice from the range of Australian health agencies. Rapid changes to workload and workflow were combined with the dilemma of balancing professional obligations with the personal duty of keeping themselves and their sometimes geographically distant families safe. Fluctuating demands and traumatic situations found community pharmacy staff often feeling distressed and underprepared. SUMMARY: Despite a global pandemic following a season of extraordinary bushfires, it has barely been acknowledged that community pharmacy staff are one of the highest risk groups for long-term psychological impacts. To our knowledge, very little research has addressed the toll of these cataclysmic events on this group of essential healthcare workers.","output":"Bushfires, COVID-19 and Australian community pharmacists: ongoing impact on mental health and wellbeing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical education (PE) is, in general, one of the most important skills developed for human healthiness.

The inequities between those who need care and those who receive adequate care are larger for racial and ethnic minority groups and people living in underserved communities. The pandemic is associated with an exacerbation of these inequities, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality for the most vulnerable populations. AIMS This Perspective summarizes longstanding and evolving challenges to the provision of high quality care for people with mental illness, describes the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) commitment to addressing those challenges, and embeds salient research priorities most germane to the health policy readership of this journal. METHODS Example funding announcements and extant funding priorities are highlighted to demonstrate NIMH's commitment to health services research during the pandemic. The collaborative care model is presented as an evidence-supported service delivery model that could be delivered via telehealth. Recent studies that compare the utilization of routine telehealth services during the pandemic, when compared to in-person services pre-pandemic, are summarized. RESULTS In FY2020, NIMH invested $171,194,275 in health services research. Over the past two years, NIMH led or participated on dozens of funding announcements that call for mental health services research to help improve the provision of care for people with mental illness. Service delivery models like collaborative care can offer effective intervention via telehealth. The practice community can deliver routine services via telehealth at volumes similar to pre-pandemic in-person levels. However, wide variation in telehealth utilization exists, with inequities associated with racial and ethnic groups and underserved rural locations. A limitation is that clinical outcomes are not routinely available from administrative datasets. DISCUSSION There continues to be an urgent need for health policy research and collaboration with the health policy community as part of the research enterprise. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVISION AND USE NIMH encourages and often requires strong research practice partnerships to help ensure findings will be of value to end users and make their way into the practice setting. There is a need to study pandemic related changes in financing, delivery, receipt, and outcomes of mental health care. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICIES Despite robust evidence, clinical practice guideline recommendations, and established financing mechanisms, uptake of service delivery models that can be delivered in part or in full via telehealth (e.g., the collaborative care model) is poor. IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH In the era of COVID-19, the charge to the mental health services research community is urgent: (i) develop strategies to better implement, scale, and sustain existing evidence-supported treatments and services and (ii) develop, test, and evaluate new solutions to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, and value of care.","output":"PERSPECTIVE: A Mental Health Services Research Agenda in the Era of COVID-19: Steadfast Commitment to Addressing Evolving Challenges."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a rapidly growing pandemic with its first case identified during December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Due to the rampant rise in the number of cases in China and globally, WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11th March 2020. The disease is transmitted via respiratory droplets of infected patients during coughing or sneezing and affects primarily the lung parenchyma. The spectrum of clinical manifestations can be seen in COVID-19 patients ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe disease resulting in mortality. Although respiratory involvement is most common in COVID-19 patients, the virus can affect other organ systems as well. The systemic inflammation induced by the disease along with multisystem expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor which allows viral entry into cells, explains the manifestation of extra-pulmonary symptoms affecting the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hematological, renal, musculoskeletal, and endocrine system. Here, we have reviewed the extensive literature available on COVID-19 about various clinical presentations based on the organ system involved as well as clinical presentation in specific population including children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised patients.

However, the individual attributes as related to changes in physical activity during the pandemic in Japan have been scarcely investigated. The present study explored the relationships among individual attributes including demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic characteristics, work situation changes, perception of anxiety, and changes in walking and sedentary behaviors, during the pandemic in Japan. To obtain data indicating individual circumstances during the first wave of the pandemic in Japan, we conducted a nationwide online survey from May 19 to May 23, 2020 (n = 1,200). To observe changes in walking behavior objectively and retrospectively, we collected data on the number of daily steps as measured by the iPhones Health application. Path analysis was employed to examine relationships between individual attributes and changes in walking and sedentary behaviors. Decreased physical activity, especially, decreased walking behavior among younger individuals and those living in highest-density neighborhoods were identified. There was increased sedentary behavior among females. Moreover, individuals with higher socioeconomic status (SES) tended to become inactive due to work-from-home/standby-at-home and individuals with lower SES tended to become inactive due to decreased amount of work. Decreased walking behavior and increased sedentary behavior were associated with a perception of strong anxiety related to the pandemic. Our findings would be helpful in considering measures to counteract health risks during the pandemic by taking into account individual backgrounds.","output":"Relationships among changes in walking and sedentary behaviors, individual attributes, changes in work situation, and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug discovery must be guided not only by medical need and commercial potential, but also by the areas in which new science is creating therapeutic opportunities, such as target identification and the understanding of disease mechanisms.

Other important proteins involved in this process include disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17) also known as tumour necrosis factor-&#945;-converting enzyme and transmembrane serine protease 2. ACE2 converts angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin (1-7), to balance the renin angiotensin system. Membrane-bound ACE2 ectodomain shedding is mediated by ADAM17 upon viral spike binding, Ang II overproduction and in several diseases. The shed soluble ACE2 (sACE2) retains its catalytic activity, but its precise role in viral entry is still unclear. Therapeutic sACE2 is claimed to exert dual effects; reduction of excess Ang II and blocking viral entry by masking the spike protein. Nevertheless, the paradox is why SARS-CoV-2 comorbid patients struggle to attain such benefit in viral infection despite having a high amount of sACE2. In this review, we discuss the possible detrimental role of sACE2 and speculate on a series of events where protease primed or non-primed virus-sACE2 complex might enter the host cell. As extracellular virus can bind many sACE2 molecules, sACE2 level could be reduced drastically upon endocytosis by the host cell. A consequential rapid rise in Ang II level could potentially aggravate disease severity through Ang II-angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) axis in comorbid patients. Hence, monitoring sACE2 and Ang II level in coronavirus disease 2019 comorbid patients are crucial to ensure safe and efficient intervention using therapeutic sACE2 and vaccines.","output":"Potential detrimental role of soluble ACE2 in severe COVID-19 comorbid patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Six undescribed 4-quinolone alkaloids, including four racemic mixtures, ()-oxypenicinolines A-D, and two related ones, penicinolines F and G, together with seven known analogues, were isolated from the mangrove-derived fungus Penicillium steckii SCSIO 41025 (Trichocomaceae).

We aimed to produce consensus-based guidelines on the prioritisation of revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures. METHOD: Twenty-three revision TKA scenarios were assigned priority (NHS England/Royal College of Surgeons scale) by the British Association for Surgery of the Knee (BASK) Revision Knee Working Group (n = 24). Consensus agreement was defined as &#8805;70% respondents (18/24) giving the same prioritisation. Two voting rounds were undertaken; procedures achieving <70% agreement were given their most commonly assigned priority. RESULTS: 18/23 procedures achieved &#8805;70% agreement. Three were P1a (surgery within <24 h); DAIR for sepsis, peri-prosthetic fracture (PPF) fixation and PPF-revision TKA. Three were P1b (<72 h); debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR) for a stable patient, flap coverage for an open knee, and acute extensor mechanism rupture. Eight were P2 (<4 weeks), including aseptic loosening at risk of collapse, inter-stage patients with poor functioning spacers. Five were P3 (<3 months), including second stage revision for infection, revision for instability with limited mobility. Four were P4 (can wait >3 months) e.g. aseptic loosening. CONCLUSION: Sepsis and PPF surgery are the most urgent procedures. Although most procedures should be undertaken within one to three months (P2/3), these cases represent a small revision practice volume; P4 cases (e.g. aseptic loosening without risk of collapse) make up most surgeons' caseload.

When the European Food Safety Authority evaluated the hazards of edible insects as a potential source of pathogenic viruses for humans and livestock, the novel zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 had not yet emerged but other pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS (SARS-CoV) and MERS (MERS-CoV) were known. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, animal sources of protein for human consumption are being evaluated for the risks of being a transmission vector of coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2. Insects lack a receptor that can bind SARS-CoV-2, thus preventing the virus from replicating in insects, unlike some vertebrate livestock species and companion animals. Despite extensive monitoring, coronaviruses have never been recorded in insect microbiomes. Contamination of insects produced for food or feed may occur during the production process, resulting from rearing substrate or from insect farmers. However, the currently permitted rearing substrates do not include animal products and the farming process is highly automated, thus limiting interactions between farmers and insects. If contamination would still occur, the fact that the insects in production are not hosts to SARS-CoV-2 precludes virus replication and the further processing of the insects will destroy the contamination.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, obesity prevalence in children and adolescents had plateaued in many high-income countries despite levels of severe obesity having increased. However, in low-income and middle-income countries, obesity prevalence had risen. During the pandemic, weight gain among children and adolescents has increased in several jurisdictions. Obesity is associated with cardiometabolic and psychosocial comorbidity as well as premature adult mortality. The development and perpetuation of obesity is largely explained by a bio-socioecological framework, whereby biological predisposition, socioeconomic, and environmental factors interact together to promote deposition and proliferation of adipose tissue. First-line treatment approaches include family-based behavioural obesity interventions addressing diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviours, and sleep quality, underpinned by behaviour change strategies. Evidence for intensive dietary approaches, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic and bariatric surgery as supplemental therapies are emerging; however, access to these therapies is scarce in most jurisdictions.

The international experience of digital contact tracing apps during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates how challenging their design and deployment are. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to derive and summarize best practice guidance for the design of the ideal digital contact tracing app. METHODS: A collaborative cross-disciplinary approach was used to derive best practice guidance for designing the ideal digital contact tracing app. A search of the indexed and gray literature was conducted to identify articles describing or evaluating digital contact tracing apps. MEDLINE was searched using a combination of free-text terms and Medical Subject Headings search terms. Gray literature sources searched were the World Health Organization Institutional Repository for Information Sharing, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control publications library, and Google, including the websites of many health protection authorities. Articles that were acceptable for inclusion in this evidence synthesis were peer-reviewed publications, cohort studies, randomized trials, modeling studies, technical reports, white papers, and media reports related to digital contact tracing. RESULTS: Ethical, user experience, privacy and data protection, technical, clinical and societal, and evaluation considerations were identified from the literature. The ideal digital contact tracing app should be voluntary and should be equitably available and accessible. User engagement could be enhanced by small financial incentives, enabling users to tailor aspects of the app to their particular needs and integrating digital contact tracing apps into the wider public health information campaign. Adherence to the principles of good data protection and privacy by design is important to convince target populations to download and use digital contact tracing apps. Bluetooth Low Energy is recommended for a digital contact tracing app's contact event detection, but combining it with ultrasound technology may improve a digital contact tracing app's accuracy. A decentralized privacy-preserving protocol should be followed to enable digital contact tracing app users to exchange and record temporary contact numbers during contact events. The ideal digital contact tracing app should define and risk-stratify contact events according to proximity, duration of contact, and the infectiousness of the case at the time of contact. Evaluating digital contact tracing apps requires data to quantify app downloads, use among COVID-19 cases, successful contact alert generation, contact alert receivers, contact alert receivers that adhere to quarantine and testing recommendations, and the number of contact alert receivers who subsequently are tested positive for COVID-19. The outcomes of digital contact tracing apps' evaluations should be openly reported to allow for the wider public to review the evaluation of the app. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, key considerations and best practice guidance for the design of the ideal digital contact tracing app were derived from the literature.","output":"Best Practice Guidance for Digital Contact Tracing Apps: A Cross-disciplinary Review of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid and pandemic spread of COVID-19 has led to unprecedented containment policies in response to overloaded health care systems.

Worryingly in England, inequalities across some groups and places are worsening, highlighted and exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. While there has been growing interest in exploring public understandings of health inequalities, few studies have explored the views of young people. Our study seeks to redress this by exploring young people's perspectives of inequalities in health. Methods Working with existing youth organisations, we recruited young people (aged 13-21) from six youth groups in areas of high deprivation across three geographical locations in England. Each group took part in three interlinked focus groups (n = 18), the majority of which were run online using video conferencing platforms. Focus groups were co-delivered with partnering youth organisations during 2021. They involved participatory concept mapping activities, and the discussion of health related news articles. Results Key themes emerged around young people's perspectives of: i) factors influencing health within their local area;ii) understandings of inequalities in health;and iii) key messages to convey to those with a role in addressing health inequalities at a place level. Conclusions Our study highlights the importance of exploring and understanding young people's perspectives of inequalities in order to better shape policies which are supported by the communities and people they impact. Key messages Young people have a nuanced, experiential understanding of key factors influencing their health and inequalities in health within their local areas.

Every day, millions of people were subjected to diagnostic testing for Covid-19, all over the world. Molecular tests helped in the diagnosis of current infection by detecting the presence of viral genome whereas serological tests helped in detecting the presence of antibody in blood as well as contributed to vaccine development. This testing helped in understanding the immunogenicity, community prevalence, geographical spread and conditions post-infection. However, with the contagious nature of the virus, biological specimen sampling involved the risk of transmission and spread of infection. Clinic or pathology visit was the most concerning part. Trained personnel and resources was another barrier. In this scenario, microsampling played an important role due to its most important advantage of remote, contactless, small volume and self-sampling. Minimum requirements for sample storage and ease of shipment added value in this situation. The highly sensitive instruments and validated assay formats assured the accuracy of results and stability of samples.

A new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Wuhan, China, and its related disease, called COVID-19, has induced one of the most dangerous crises at a global level since World War II. The ultra-fast transmission rate of the virus and the high mortality rate led the World Health Organization (WHO) to officially declare the situation a pandemic. Governments, for their part, were forced to implement unprecedented mobility restrictions and cease a large part of their economic activities. These facts triggered multiple reactions from people who expressed their feelings mainly through social networks (like Twitter), using them as vectors of information and opinion. In this paper, a study carried out in different Spanish speaking countries (Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Spain) is presented, which addresses the manner in which the evolution of the pandemic outbreak has affected the emotions expressed by individuals on Twitter over the last 13 months (from March 2020 to March 2021). We used a total of 3 million tweets to achieve this task. We made use of a well-known framework called EmoWeb to capture the dynamic variation in the sentimental value of pandemic-related words.

As a first line of defense against respiratory infections, innate immune responses, including the production of type I and III interferons (IFNs), play an important role. Upon infection with RSV, multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can recognize RSV-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and mount innate immune responses. Retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) have been identified as important innate receptors to mount type I IFNs during RSV infection. However, type I IFN levels remain surprisingly low during RSV infection despite strong viral replication. The poor induction of type I IFNs can be attributed to the cooperative activity of 2 unique, nonstructural (NS) proteins of RSV, i.e., NS1 and NS2. These viral proteins have been shown to suppress both the production and signaling of type I and III IFNs by counteracting a plethora of key host innate signaling proteins. Moreover, increasing numbers of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are being identified as targets of the NS proteins in recent years, highlighting an underexplored protein family in the identification of NS target proteins. To understand the diverse effector functions of NS1 and NS2, Goswami and colleagues proposed the hypothesis of the NS degradasome (NSD) complex, a multiprotein complex made up of, at least, NS1 and NS2. Furthermore, the crystal structure of NS1 was resolved recently and, remarkably, identified NS1 as a structural paralogue of the RSV matrix protein. Unfortunately, no structural data on NS2 have been published so far. In this review, we briefly describe the PRRs that mount innate immune responses upon RSV infection and provide an overview of the various effector functions of NS1 and NS2. Furthermore, we discuss the ubiquitination effector functions of NS1 and NS2, which are in line with the hypothesis that the NSD shares features with the canonical 26S proteasome.","output":"Respiratory syncytial virus nonstructural proteins 1 and 2: Exceptional disrupters of innate immune responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to investigate whether implicit linguistic biases exist in letters of recommendation (LORs) for applicants to radiation oncology (RO) residency.

Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software was used to evaluate LORs for length and a dictionary of predetermined themes. Language was evaluated for gender bias using a publicly available gender bias calculator. Non-parametric tests were used to compare linguistic domain scores. The median number of the LORs per applicant was 4 (range 3C5). No significant differences by applicant gender were detected in LIWC score domains or gender bias calculator (P > 0.05). However, LORs for applicants from racial/ethnic backgrounds underrepresented in medicine were less likely to include standout descriptors (P = 0.008). Male writers were less likely to describe applicant characteristics related to patient care (P < 0.0001) and agentic personality (P = 0.006). LORs written by RO were shorter (P < 0.0001) and included fewer standout descriptors (P = 0.014) but were also more likely to include statements regarding applicant desirability (P = 0.045) and research (P = 0.008).

To find the presence of the clustering pattern in the dataset, we use Global Morans I. A value of Global Morans I greater than zero shows the clustering in the data set. Dataset is temporal, and for each type of case, the value Global Morans I > 0, shows the presence of clustering. Local Morans I find the location of cluster i.e., the hotspot. The dataset is granulated at the district level. A district with a high Local Morans I surrounded by a high Local Morans I value is considered the hotspot. Monte Carlo simulation with 999 simulations is taken to find the statistical significance. So, for the 99% significance level, the p-value is taken as 0.001. A hotspot that satisfies the p-value threshold is considered the statistically significant hotspot. The footprint of the hotspot is found from the coverage of the hotspot. Finally, a change vector is defined that finds the pattern of change in the time series of the hotspots footprint.

Methods: From May 1997 to May 2001, 65 patients underwent surgical debulking and PDT as part of an ongoing phase II trial for disseminated IP cancer. Perioperative data were reviewed retrospectively, and statistical analyses were performed to determine whether any identifiable factors were associated with the need for mechanical ventilation for longer than 1 day and with the occurrence of postoperative complications. Results: Forty-three women and 22 men (mean age, 49 years) were treated. Operative time averaged 9.8 hours, and mean estimated blood loss was 1450 mL. The mean crystalloid requirement for the first 48 hours after surgery was 29.3 L, and 49 patients required blood products. Twenty-four patients were intubated for longer than 24 hours, with a mean of 8.3 days for those intubated longer than 1 day. The median ICU stay was 4 days. Overall, 110 complications developed in 45 (69%) of the 65 patients. Significant complications included 6 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, 28 patients with infectious complications, and 4 patients with anastomotic complications. Statistical analyses revealed that surgery-related factors were significantly associated with these complication outcomes. Conclusions: Patients who undergo surgical debulking and IP PDT develop a significant capillary-leak syndrome after surgery that necessitates massive volume resuscitation, careful ICU monitoring, and, frequently, prolonged ventilatory support.","output":"Intraperitoneal Photodynamic Therapy Causes a Capillary-Leak Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic underscores the importance of finding effective and safe ways to combat the virus, and to optimally understand the immune response elicited upon natural infection. This likely involves all components of the immune system, both innate and adaptive. The impetus for the rapid development of prophylactic treatment options has led to an intense focus on neutralizing antibodies (Abs), and many novel and specialized platforms have been designed to achieve that goal. B-cell immunity relies on the generation of a diverse repertoire of Abs. Their structural variation is defined in terms of amino acid composition that is encoded in the genome or acquired through somatic mutations. Yet, key examples of frequently neglected antibody diversification mechanisms involving post-translational modifications such as N- or O-linked glycosylation are present in significant portions of the population. During the last few years, these and other beyond gene sequence determined humoral immune response mechanisms have in some specific cases revealed their potent immunomodulatory effects. Nonetheless, such more unusual mechanisms have not received much attention in the context of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, with specific focus on the latter, this paper presents, (1) the rationale for considering beyond sequence determined strategies, (2) evidence for their possible involvement in Covid-19 disease evolution, (3) consequences for vaccine design exemplified by one of the vaccine candidates that is currently undergoing trial, and (4) more general implications. Based on a critical interpretation of published literature, the hypotheses developed in this study point to a crucial role of non-genetic antibody diversification mechanisms in disease evolution to counteract unique immunogenicity determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The involvement of post translational mechanisms may also help explain the widely varied immune response observed, not only among different patient groups, but also in terms of their observed incompatibility with SARS-CoV-2 infection in several human cell types. The article highlights potentials and challenges of these refined humoral immune response mechanisms to most optimally target non-genetic viral evasion strategies.","output":"Rarely Recognized Antibody Diversification in Covid-19 Evolution to Counteract Advanced SARS-CoV-2 Evasion Strategies, and Implications for Prophylactic Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The C. elegans genome encodes nineteen functional Argonaute proteins that utilize 22G-RNAs, 26G-RNAs, miRNAs, or piRNAs to regulate their target transcripts. Only one of these proteins is essential under normal laboratory conditions: CSR-1. While CSR-1 has been studied in various developmental and functional contexts, nearly all studies investigating CSR-1 have overlooked the fact that the csr-1 locus encodes two isoforms. These isoforms differ by an additional 163 amino acids present in the N-terminus of CSR-1a. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce GFP::3xFLAG epitopes into the long (CSR-1a) and short (CSR-1b) isoforms of CSR-1, we identified differential expression patterns for the two isoforms. CSR-1a is expressed specifically during spermatogenesis and in select somatic tissues, including the intestine. In contrast, CSR-1b, is expressed constitutively in the germline. Essential functions of csr-1 described in the literature coincide with CSR-1b. In contrast, CSR-1a plays tissue specific functions during spermatogenesis, where it integrates into a spermatogenesis sRNA regulatory network including ALG-3, ALG-4, and WAGO-10 that is necessary for male fertility. CSR-1a is also required in the intestine for the silencing of repetitive transgenes. Sequencing of small RNAs associated with each CSR-1 isoform reveals that CSR-1a engages with 22G- and 26G-RNAs, while CSR-1b interacts with only 22G-RNAs to regulate distinct groups of germline genes and regulate both sperm and oocyte-mediated fertility.","output":"Two isoforms of the essential C. elegans Argonaute CSR-1 differentially regulate sperm and oocyte fertility through distinct small RNA classes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To compare three sterilizing methods for reusable medical goggles METHODS: A total of 180 medical goggles of the same brand and same model were randomly divided into three groups In group A the goggles were first soaked with 2000 mg/L chlorine-containing disinfectant and then cleaned manually;goggles in other two groups were sterilized using pre-programmed automatic spray cleaning and disinfection machine, the disinfection program was set to 90 for 5 min in group B and 70 for 30 min in group C The quality of the sterilization was monitored by visual inspection with luminous magnifying glass and residual protein detection assay User satisfaction on cleanliness of medical goggles, clarity of mirror surface and suitability of elastic bands was investigated with questionnaire survey RESULTS: The qualification rates verified by visual inspection were 82 4%, 84 6%and 98 3%in group A, B and C, respectively, the qualification rate in group C was significantly higher than those in group B and group C (all P0 05) A total of 54 questionnaires were submitted for the survey The satisfaction rates were 100 0%, 90 7%and 94 4% for cleanliness of medical goggles, clarity of mirror surface and suitability of elastic bands, respectively CONCLUSIONS: Machinery sterilization set 70 for 30 min has better cleaning and sterilizing effects for reusable medical goggles","output":"[Comparison of three medical goggle sterilizing approaches]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sickle cell disease is a common hereditary genetic disorder, that can lead to chronic anemia and hemolysis, following several viral and bacterial infections Data on this patient associated with SarS-cov-2 infection are scarce, but it was reported that sickle cell disease could be protective in this patient population from fatal coviD-19 disease our case supports the hypothesis that sickle cell disease is protective towards severe coviD-19","output":"Acute lung failure due to COVID-19 in a patient with sickle cell anemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The inclusion of social determinants of health is mandated for undergraduate medical education. However, little is known about how to prepare preclinical students for real-world screening and referrals for addressing social determinants of health. OBJECTIVE: This pilot projects objective was to evaluate the feasibility of using a real-world, service-based learning approach for training preclinical students to assess social needs and make relevant referrals via the electronic medical record during the COVID-19 pandemic (May to June 2020). METHODS: This project was designed to address an acute community service need and to teach preclinical, second-year medical student volunteers (n=11) how to assess social needs and make referrals by using the 10-item Social Determinants of Health Screening Questionnaire in the electronic health record (EHR; Epic platform; Epic Systems Corporation). Third-year medical student volunteers (n=3), who had completed 6 clinical rotations, led the 2-hour skills development orientation and were available for ongoing mentoring and peer support. All student-patient communication was conducted by telephone, and bilingual (English and Spanish) students called the patients who preferred to communicate in Spanish. We analyzed EHR data extracted from Epic to evaluate screening and data extracted from REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) to evaluate community health workers notes. We elicited feedback from the participating preclinical students to evaluate the future use of this community-based service learning approach in our preclinical curriculum. RESULTS: The preclinical students completed 45 screening interviews. Of the 45 screened patients, 20 (44%) screened positive for at least 1 social need. Almost all of these patients (19/20, 95%) were referred to the community health worker. Half (8/16, 50%) of the patients who had consultations with the community health worker were connected with a relevant social service resource. The preclinical students indicated that project participation increased their ability to assess social needs and make needed EHR referrals. Food insecurity was the most common social need. CONCLUSIONS: Practical exposure to social needs assessment has the potential to help preclinical medical students develop the ability to address social concerns prior to entering clinical clerkships in their third year of medical school. The students can also become familiar with the EHR prior to entering third-year clerkships. Physicians, who are aware of social needs and have the electronic medical record tools and staff resources needed to act, can create workflows to make social needs assessments and services integral components of health care. Research studies and quality improvement initiatives need to investigate how to integrate screening for social needs and connecting patients to the appropriate social services into routine primary care procedures.","output":"Social Determinants of Health Screening by Preclinical Medical Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Service-Based Learning Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We build a nonlinear dynamic model with currency, demand deposits and bank reserves.

With multilingual populations increasing worldwide, patients frequently need to be tested in more than one language. There is still no reliable testing instrument, as the available batteries have been developed for specific languages. Heterogeneity in the selection criteria for stimuli leads to differences, for example, in the size, color, image quality, and even names associated with pictures, making direct cross-linguistic comparisons difficult. Here we present MULTIMAP, a new multilingual picture naming test for mapping eloquent areas during awake brain surgery. Recognizing that the distinction between nouns and verbs is necessary for detailed and precise language mapping, MULTIMAP consists of a database of 218 standardized color pictures representing both objects and actions. These images have been tested for name agreement with speakers of Spanish, Basque, Catalan, Italian, French, English, Mandarin Chinese, and Arabic, and have been controlled for relevant linguistic features in cross-language combinations.

Stressful situations increase alcohol craving and consumption in alcohol use disorder (AUD) and non-AUD drinkers. Thus, we assessed how COVID-19 related stress may have affected drinking behaviours in the general population. DESIGN: We developed an online cross-sectional survey, Habit Tracker (HabiT), which measured changes in drinking behaviours before and during COVID-19 quarantine. We also assessed psychiatric factors such as anxiety, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and impulsivity (Short-Impulsive Behavior Scale). Lastly, we related drinking behaviours to COVID-19 specific stress factors. SETTING: HabiT was released internationally, with individuals from 83 countries participating. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were included if they were 18 years of age or older and confirmed they were proficient in English. The survey was completed by 2873 adults with 1346 usable data (46.9% accurately completed). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were change in amount and severity of drinking behaviours before and during quarantine, and current drinking severity during quarantine. RESULTS: Although drinking behaviours decreased overall during quarantine, 36% reported an increase in alcohol use. Those who increased alcohol use during quarantine were older individuals (95% CI 0.04 to 0.1, p<0.0001), essential workers (95% CI ?0.58 to ?0.1, p=0.01), individuals with children (95% CI ?12.46 to 0.0, p=0.003), those with a personal relationship with someone severely ill from COVID-19 (95% CI ?2 to ?0.38, p=0.01) and those with higher depression (95% CI 0.67 to 1.45, p<0.0001), anxiety (95% CI 0.61 to 1.5, p=0.0002), and positive urgency impulsivity (95% CI 0.16 to 0.72, p=0.009). Furthermore, country-level subsample analyses indicated that drinking amount (95% CI 9.36 to 13.13, p=0.003) increased in the UK during quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight a role for identifying those vulnerable for alcohol misuse during periods of self-isolation and underscore the theoretical mechanism of negative emotionality underlying drinking behaviours driven by stress. Limitations include a large degree of study dropout (n=1515). Future studies should assess the long-term effects of isolation on drinking behaviours.","output":"Assessing international alcohol consumption patterns during isolation from the COVID-19 pandemic using an online survey: highlighting negative emotionality mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We observed wide variation in the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases in 300 communities making up Los Angeles County, the largest county by population in the United States The surge in incidence from October 19, 2020 to January 10, 2021, accounting for two-thirds of all confirmed cases since the start of the epidemic, was concentrated in communities with a high prevalence of multi-generational households This indicator of household structure was a more important predictor of the surge in incidence than the prevalence of households with low income or with at least one high-risk worker Based upon a spatial adaptation of the standard SIR model, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19, adjusted for underascertainment of both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, ranged from under 10% in low multi-generational communities to over 30% in high multi-generational communities ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature","output":"Los Angeles County SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic: Critical Role of Multi-generational Intra-household Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airborne transmission is mainly associated with poorly ventilated and crowded indoor environments where people stay for long periods of time.

Our goal is to (i) compare and investigate the effect of some common extreme events modeling methods to explore which method can be practical in reality and (ii) accelerate the deep learning training process, which commonly uses deep recurrent neural network (RNN), by implementing the asynchronous local Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) framework among multiple compute nodes.

From direct interviews prior to (T1), and then in the same individuals after the pandemic onset (T2), we assessed the influence of personal psychiatric history on changes in symptoms and wellbeing. METHODS: Two hundred and four (19C69 years/117 female) individuals from a multigenerational family study were followed clinically up to T1. Psychiatric symptom changes (T1-to-T2), their association with lifetime psychiatric history (no, only-past, and recent psychiatric history), and pandemic-specific worries were investigated. RESULTS: At T2 relative to T1, participants with recent psychopathology (in the last 2 years) had significantly fewer depressive (mean, M = 41.7 v. 47.6) and traumatic symptoms (M = 6.6 v. 8.1, p < 0.001), while those with no and only-past psychiatric history had decreased wellbeing (M = 22.6 v. 25.0, p < 0.01). Three pandemic-related worry factors were identified: Illness/death, Financial, and Social isolation. Individuals with recent psychiatric history had greater Illness/death and Financial worries than the no/only-past groups, but these worries were unrelated to depression at T2. Among individuals with no/only-past history, Illness/death worries predicted increased T2 depression [B = 0.6(0.3), p < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: As recent psychiatric history was not associated with increased depression or anxiety during the pandemic, new groups of previously unaffected persons might contribute to the increased pandemic-related depression and anxiety rates reported.

Participants in groups ACC received a single dose (25 g; 05 mL) of Vi-DT test vaccine via intramuscular injection from one of three good manufacturing practice lots (group A received lot 1, group B received lot 2, and group C received lot 3), and those in group D received a single dose (25 g; 05 mL) of the Vi-TT vaccine via intramuscular injection. All participants, site staff (except for those who administered the study vaccines), and those assessing the outcomes were masked to group assignment. The co-primary endpoints were: (1) non-inferiority of immunogenicity of the Vi-DT vaccine (pooled groups ACC) versus the Vi-TT vaccine (group D), measured by the anti-Vi IgG seroconversion rate at 4 weeks after vaccination; and (2) the lot-to-lot consistency of the Vi-DT vaccine, measured by immune equivalence of the anti-Vi IgG geometric mean titre (GMT) at 4 weeks after receipt of the three Vi-DT vaccine lots (lot 1 vs lot 2, lot 1 vs lot 3, and lot 2 vs lot 3). Non-inferiority of the Vi-DT vaccine compared with the Vi-TT vaccine was shown if the lower limit of the 975% CI for the difference between the seroconversion rates in Vi-DT vaccine groups ACC combined versus Vi-TT vaccine group D was above the predefined non-inferiority margin of ?10%. Lot-to-lot immune equivalence was shown if the upper and lower bounds of the two-sided 9917% CI around the GMT ratio for each pairwise lot-to-lot comparison was between 067 and 150, which is the predefined equivalence margin recommended by WHO. The co-primary immunogenicity endpoints were assessed in all randomised participants who had received their assigned vaccine and had completed at least one post-baseline immunogenicity assessment. Safety was descriptively summarised by group and age strata, and was assessed in all participants who had received one dose of the investigational vaccine. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03933098. FINDINGS: Between Nov 20, 2019, and March 10, 2020, 1854 individuals were screened, of whom 1800 were enrolled and randomly assigned to groups ACD (450 participants in each group). 1786 (992%; 443 in group A, 450 in group B, 447 in group C, and 446 in group D) were included in the immunogenicity assessments at 4 weeks post vaccination, and all 1800 participants were included in the safety analysis. In the immunogenicity analysis, the anti-Vi-IgG seroconversion rate in all age strata was 9933% (975% CI 9861 to 9968; 1331 of 1340 participants) in Vi-DT vaccine groups ACC and 9888% (9710 to 9957; 441 of 446) in Vi-TT vaccine group D. The difference in seroconversion rates between Vi-DT vaccine groups ACC combined versus Vi-TT group D was 047% (975% CI ?068 to 161), indicating non-inferiority of the Vi-DT vaccine. Anti-Vi-IgG GMT ratios at 4 weeks post-vaccination were 102 (9917% CI 085 to 122) for lot 1 versus lot 2, 102 (085 to 123) for lot 1 versus lot 3, and 101 (084 to 121) for lot 2 versus lot 3, indicating lot-to-lot equivalence according to the predefined, WHO-recommended equivalence margin. The proportion of participants reporting adverse events was similar between Vi-DT vaccine groups ACC and Vi-TT vaccine group D; 260 (193%) of 1350 participants in Vi-DT vaccine groups ACC and 115 (256%) of 450 in Vi-TT vaccine group D reported solicited adverse events within 7 days after vaccination, and 208 (154%) in Vi-DT vaccine groups ACC and 76 (169%) in Vi-TT vaccine group D reported unsolicited adverse events within 4 weeks after vaccination. Seven serious adverse events (four [03%] participants in Vi-DT vaccine groups ACC and three [07%] in Vi-TT vaccine group D), including one death in the Vi-TT vaccine group, were reported during the 24-week follow-up period, none of which were considered related to the investigational product. INTERPRETATION: When administered as a single dose, the Vi-DT test vaccine was safe, immunogenic, and non-inferior to the Vi-TT vaccine at 4 weeks post vaccination. Equivalent immunogenicity of the three lots of Vi-DT vaccine was also shown, supporting the manufacturing process of this vaccine. Once prequalified by WHO, this vaccine could be an option for purchase by UN agencies. FUNDING: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Virtual care (VC) represents a potential solution. However, few quantitative data support its rapid implementation and positive associations with service capacity and quality. OBJECTIVE: To examine the outcomes of a cancer centerCwide virtual care program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study applied a hospitalwide agile service design to map gaps and develop a customized digital solution to enable at-scale VC across a publicly funded comprehensive cancer center. Data were collected from a high-volume cancer center in Ontario, Canada, from March 23 to May 22, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcome measures were care delivery volumes, quality of care, patient and practitioner experiences, and cost savings to patients. RESULTS: The VC solution was developed and launched 12 days after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 22 085 VC visits (mean, 514 visits per day) were conducted, comprising 68.4% (range, 18.8%-100%) of daily visits compared with 0.8% before launch (P < .001). Ambulatory clinic volumes recovered a month after deployment (3714-4091 patients per week), whereas chemotherapy and radiotherapy caseloads (1943-2461 patients per week) remained stable throughout. No changes in institutional or provincial quality-of-care indexes were observed. A total of 3791 surveys (3507 patients and 284 practitioners) were completed; 2207 patients (82%) and 92 practitioners (72%) indicated overall satisfaction with VC. The direct cost of this initiative was CAD$ 202 537, and displacement-related cost savings to patients totaled CAD$ 3 155 946. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that implementation of VC at scale at a high-volume cancer center may be feasible. An agile service design approach was able to preserve outpatient caseloads and maintain care quality, while rendering high patient and practitioner satisfaction. These findings may help guide the transformation of telemedicine in the post COVID-19 era.","output":"Implementation and Outcomes of Virtual Care Across a Tertiary Cancer Center During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread morbidity and mortality as well as disruption to peoples lives and livelihoods around the world;this has occurred as a result of both infection with the virus itself and the health protection measures taken to curb its spread. There are concerns that rates of suicide, suicidal behaviours and self-harm may rise during and in the aftermath of the pandemic. Given the likely rapidly expanding research evidence base on the pandemics impact on rates of suicide, suicidal behaviours and self-harm and emerging evidence about how best to mitigate such effects, it is important that the best available knowledge is made readily available to policymakers, public health specialists and clinicians as soon as is possible. To facilitate this, we plan to undertake a living systematic review focusing on suicide prevention in relation to COVID-19. Method: Regular automated searches will feed into a web-based screening system which will also host the data extraction form for included articles. Our eligibility criteria are wide and include aspects of incidence and prevalence of suicidal behaviour, effects of exposures and effects of interventions in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, with minimal restrictions on the types of study design to be included. The outcomes assessed will be death by suicide;self-harm or attempted suicide (including hospital attendance and/or admission for these reasons);and suicidal thoughts/ideation. There will be no restriction on study type, except for single case reports. There will be no restriction on language of publication. The review will be updated at three-monthly intervals if a sufficient volume of new evidence justifies doing so. Conclusions: Our living review will provide a regular synthesis of the most up-to-date research evidence to guide public health and clinical policy to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on suicide.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study conducted between May 18 and June 26, 2020, during which HCWs at a large inner-city teaching hospital in NYC received voluntary antibody testing. The main outcome was presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies indicating previous infection. Seroprevalence and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for seropositivity by type and location of work were calculated using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 2,749 HCWs tested, 831 tested positive, yielding a crude seroprevalence of 30.2% (95% CI, 29%-32%). Seroprevalence ranged from 11.1% for pharmacy staff to 44.0% for nonclinical HCWs comprised of patient transporters and housekeeping and security staff, with 37.5% for nurses and 20.9% for administrative staff. Compared to administrative staff, aORs (95% CIs) for seropositivity were 2.54 (1.64-3.94) for nurses; 2.51 (1.42-4.43) for nonclinical HCWs; between 1.70 and 1.83 for allied HCWs such as patient care technicians, social workers, registration clerks and therapists; and 0.80 (0.50-1.29) for physicians. Compared to office locations, aORs for the emergency department and inpatient units were 2.27 (1.53-3.37) and 1.48 (1.14-1.92), respectively. CONCLUSION: One-third of hospital-based HCWs were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 by the end of the first wave in NYC. Seroprevalence differed by job function and work location, with the highest estimated risk for nurses and the emergency department, respectively.

Spike glycoprotein engages host Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for entry into host cells, where the receptor recognition and attachment of spike glycoprotein to the ACE2 receptors is a prerequisite step and key determinant of the host cell and tissue tropism. Binding of spike glycoprotein to the ACE2 receptor triggers a cascade of structural transitions, including transition from a metastable pre-fusion to a post-fusion form, thereby allowing membrane fusion and internalization of the virus. From ancient times people have relied on naturally occurring substances like phytochemicals to fight against diseases and infection. Among these phytochemicals, flavonoids and non-flavonoids have been the active sources of different anti-microbial agents. We performed molecular docking studies using 10 potential naturally occurring compounds (flavonoids/non-flavonoids) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and compared their affinity with an FDA approved repurposed drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Further, our molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and energy landscape studies with fisetin, quercetin, and kamferol revealed that these molecules bind with the hACE2-S complex with low binding free energy. The study provided an indication that these molecules might have the potential to perturb the binding of hACE2-S complex.

But also on the cellular material much emphasis has been taken with the aim using its cytology as diagnostic parameter. However, very few informations were obtained about the protein material also washed out during the endobronchial lavage. As it was demonstrated by immunological methods the proteins of the extra-cellular lining material consist of serum identical proteins and those being obviously specific for the lung tissue. As found, most serum identical proteins occure in the same amounts as found in the blood serum, and the molecular weight in general range up to 160,000 daltons indicating that there must be a restriction in passage of high molecular weight proteins through the lumen walls of the endothelium. Some proteins, IgG, IgA, do occure in a higher level in the extra-cellular lining material leading to the suggestion that these proteins were synthesized and secreted by the lung tissue itself.  The molecular weight of the lung specific proteins range from 16,000C340,000 daltons. Under reducing conditions however, for all species listed, two classes of subunits ?36,000 and 12,000 daltons  result, indicating that these proteins might have comparable functions in the different species. The exact function of these specific proteins as well as the serum identical proteins till now is not known. One can only speculate that the serum identical proteins will have the same function in plasma and the lung, and that the specific proteins are involved in the formation in the surfactant system.

Main outcome measuresFive outcome measures within 28 days of a positive covid-19 test: i) death from any cause; ii) any A&E attendance; iii) any emergency hospital admission; iv) critical care admission; and v) total length of hospital stay. ResultsImplementation of the programme was not associated with mortality or length of hospital stay. Implementation was associated with increased health service utilisation with a 12% increase in the odds of A&E attendance (95% CI: 6%-18%) and emergency hospital admission (95% CI: 5%-20%) and a 24% increase in the odds of critical care admission in those admitted (95% CI: 5%-47%).

Adding to this challenge is the fact that real-time data often deviates from the unimodal Gaussian distribution assumption and may show some complex mixed patterns. Motivated by this, we develop a deep learning-based time-series model for probabilistic forecasting called Auto-regressive Mixed Density Dynamic Diffusion Network(ARM3Dnet), which considers both people's mobility and disease spread as a diffusion process on a dynamic directed graph. The Gaussian Mixture Model layer is implemented to consider the multimodal nature of the real-time data while learning from multiple related time series.

Meantime, a significant decrease of the m 6 A modification level in mRNA, but an increased in the ut RNA were observed in avian BMDCs upon the prevalent IBV (QX) infection. Interestingly, an opposite consequence was seen in avian BMDCs during the IBV (M41) infection. Further study found that both non-structural protein 7 (NSP7) and NSP16 inhibited the maturation and cytokines secretion of BMDCs, as well as their antigen-presentation ability. Lastly, we found that gga-miR21, induced and increased by both NSP7 and NSP16, inhibited the antigen presentation of avian BMDCs. Taken together, our results illustrated how IBV inhibited the antigen-presentation of avian DCs and provide a clue for the systemic transmission of the COVID-19.Funding Statement: This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFD500706), the Jiangsu Excellent Youth Natural Science Foundation (BK20190077), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31702197) to J.L.

However, little has been said about oxidative stress status (OSS) of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU). Material and Methods: Biomarkers of the systemic OSS included antioxidants (9 assays), trace elements (3 assays), inflammation markers (4 assays) and oxidative damage to lipids (3 assays). Results: Blood samples were drawn after 9 (7C11) and 41 (39C43) days of ICU stay, respectively in 3 and 6 patients. Vitamin C, thiol proteins, reduced glutathione, -tocopherol, -carotene and PAOT(?) score were significantly decreased compared to laboratory reference values. Selenium concentration was at the limit of the lower reference value. By contrast, the copper/zinc ratio (as a source of oxidative stress) was higher than reference values in 55% of patients while copper was significantly correlated with lipid peroxides (r = 0.95, p < 0.001). Inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein and myeloperoxidase) were significantly increased when compared to normals. Conclusions: The systemic OSS was strongly altered in critically ill COVID-19 patients as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation but also by deficits in some antioxidants (vitamin C, glutathione, thiol proteins) and trace elements (selenium).","output":"Oxidative Stress Status in COVID-19 Patients Hospitalized in Intensive Care Unit for Severe Pneumonia.

By reducing such miss rate, Artificial Intelligence may increase the detection of colorectal neoplasia leading to a higher degree of Colorectal Cancer (CRC) prevention. METHODS: Patients undergoing CRC screening or surveillance were enrolled in 8 centres (Italy, UK, US), and randomized (1:1) to undergo two same-day, back-to-back colonoscopies with or without Artificial Intelligence (AI, deep learning CADe) in 2 different arms, namely AI followed by colonoscopy without AI or vice-versa. Adenoma miss rate (AMR) was calculated as the number of histologically-verified lesions detected at second colonoscopy divided by the total number of lesions detected at first and second colonoscopy. Mean number of lesions detected in the second colonoscopy and proportion of false negative subjects (no lesion at first colonoscopy and at least 1 at second) were calculated. Odds Ratio and 95% Confidence Intervals were adjusted by endoscopist, age, sex, and indication for colonoscopy. Adverse events were also measured. RESULTS: A total of 230 subjects (116 AI first, 114 Std colonoscopy first) were included in the study analysis. AMR was 15.5% (38/246) and 32.4% (80/247) in the arm with AI and non-AI colonoscopy first, respectively (Adjusted OR [95% CI]: 0.38 [0.23; 0.62]). In detail, AMR was lower for AI-first for the <5 mm (15.9% vs 35.8%; OR: 0.34 [0.21; 0.55]) and non-polypoid lesions (16.8% vs. 45.8%; OR: 0.24[0.13; 0.43]), and it was lower both in the proximal (18.3% vs. 32.5%; OR: 0.46 [0.26; 0.78]) and distal colon (10.8% vs. 32.1%; OR: 0.25 [0.11; 0.57]). Mean number of adenomas at second colonoscopy was lower in the AI-first group as compared to non-AI colonoscopy first (0.330.63 vs 0.700.97, p<0.001). False negative rates were 6.8% (3/44 patients) and 29.6% (13/44) in the AI and non-AI first arms, respectively (OR [95% CI]: 0.17 [0.05; 0.67]). No difference in the rate of AE was found between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: AI resulted in an approximately two-fold reduction in miss rate of colorectal neoplasia, supporting AI-benefit in reducing perceptual errors for small and subtle lesions at standard colonoscopy.","output":"Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Miss Rate of Colorectal Neoplasia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, synthesis of fifteen novel bis indole based Schiff bases (SBs) 4a-o was conducted by condensation of 2-(1-aminobenzyl)benzimidazole with symmetrical bis-isatins linked via five alkyl chains (n = 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).

Therefore, tools need to be applied to identify the most suitable and efficient location and type of NBS. Within the CLEVER-cities H2020 project, the Greenpass method has been chosen to evaluate different design solutions regarding thermal comfort and physiological equivalent temperature (PET), energy, water and air fluxes. The Greenpass system comprises of standardized tools, reports and a unique set of Key Performance Score (KPS) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI). This paper deals with the impact assessment of NBS by the use of the innovative Greenpass system for the CLEVER-cities project Fischbeker H?fe in Hamburg, Germany to ensure human health and well-being improvements for the citizens. To that end and considering the climate change context, thermal comfort is a KPI with high relevance in terms of the NBS co-benefits. Based on the PET within a project area Greenpass calculates the Thermal Comfort Score (TCS). The share of the different PET classes within the project area is multiplied with a weighting factor and summarized to the TCS. The results of the climate resilience analysis of the urban development area Fischbeker H?fe in Hamburg are presented and discussed in comparison to a conventional architecture that disregards NBS, showing improvement with regards to four out of five KPS. Based on the evaluation results, advice is given to the co-creative design team on how to further improve the design towards climate resilience. The Greenpass system has proven to be a powerful and tailored tool to support climate resilient urban design and architecture.

A significant reduction of stroke admission was observed between the ischemic stroke group (235 vs. 588 cases) and the intracerebral hemorrhage group (136 vs. 150 cases) when compared with the same period last year (p < 0.001). The mean door-to-needle time (DNT) and door-to-puncture time (DPT) was 62 and 124 min, respectively. Compared to the same period last year, a significant change was observed in DNT (62  12 vs. 47  8 min, p = 0.019) but not in DPT (124  58 vs. 135  23 min, p = 0.682).

The scope and diversity of these unwanted events highlight the need to evaluate the resilience of a system to a specific disruptive circumstance. The broad scope and generic form of the previous studies limit their usefulness as a practical tool for analyzing the factors affecting system performance. To overcome this problem, we are only focusing on the behavior of systems that produce, distribute, and deliver food, energy, and water (FEW) during and after the occurrence of a sudden shortage of labor. Resilience metrics are first developed to measure the resilience of the FEW systems. Next, the performance levels of the FEW systems are clearly defined based on the FEW demands that are not served. Third, the labor intensity of FEW productions is calculated to assess the impact of a sudden labor shortage. This study recognizes the complex interdependencies among the FEW systems and, thus, aims to examine their resilience as a single system. Last, the labor shortage in the USA caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is chosen as a use case to measure the system performance and role of adjustments on the FEW systems. The results show that a labor shortage can significantly impact the FEW system performance, possibly due to the high energy dependency of food and water systems and the high cost of storing energy. Also, the current food system has shown more resilience to a sudden labor shortage compared to the energy and water systems because of the availability of various food alternatives to meet the demand for each food category.","output":"Resilience of food, energy, and water systems to a sudden labor shortage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has proven to be highly pathogenic, making it a global public health threat.

It has been proposed that psychiatric disorders may be risk factors and/or consequences of COVID-19 infection. However, observational studies could be affected by confounding bias. Methods We performed bi-directional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate causal relationships between liability to COVID-19 (and severe/critical infection) and a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders or traits. We employed the latest GWAS summary statistics from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. A variety of MR methods including those accounting for horizontal pleiotropy were used. Results Overall we observed evidence that liability to COVID-19 or severe infection may be causally associated with higher risks of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder (BD) (especially BD II), schizophrenia (SCZ), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and suicidal thought (ST) when compared to the general population. On the other hand, liability to a few psychiatric traits/disorders, for example ADHD, alcohol and opioid use disorders may be causally associated with higher risks of COVID-19 infection or severe disease. In genetic correlation analysis, cannabis use disorder, ADHD, and anxiety showed significant and positive genetic correlation with critical or hospitalized infection. All the above findings passed multiple testing correction at a false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05. For pneumonia, in general we observed a different pattern of associations, with bi-directional positive associations with depression- and anxiety-related phenotypes. Conclusions In summary, this study provides evidence for tentative bi-directional causal associations between liability to COVID-19 (and severe infection) and a number of neuropsychiatric disorders.

In the second wave, the risk of COVID-19 death remained elevated for people from Pakistani (ASMR: 339.9 [95% CI: 303.7-376.2] and 166.8 [141.7-191.9] deaths per 100,000 population in men and women) and Bangladeshi (318.7 [247.4-390.1] and 127.1 [91.1-171.3] in men and women) background but not for people from Black ethnic groups. Adjustment for geographical factors explained a large proportion of the differences in COVID-19 mortality in the first wave but not in the second wave. Despite an attenuation of the elevated risk of COVID-19 mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and health status, the risk was substantially higher in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background in both the first and the second waves. Between the first and second waves of the pandemic, the reduction in the difference in COVID-19 mortality between people from Black ethnic background and people from the White British group shows that ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality can be addressed. The continued higher rate of mortality in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background is alarming and requires focused public health campaign and policy changes.","output":"Ethnic differences in COVID-19 mortality during the first two waves of the Coronavirus Pandemic: a nationwide cohort study of 29 million adults in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We aimed to evaluate the significance of continuing audiovestibular practice during the Covid-19 pandemic in the audiology clinic of the university hospital Methods: The precautions, test procedures, and risk factors associated with the practice of audiology were evaluated The number and diagnoses of the cases between 23 March and 23 May 2020 were also compared with the results of the same 2 months in 2019 in an attempt to evaluate the alterations in the audiology practice Results: The audiology practice has continued during the pandemic, and numerous audiovestibular tests like newborn hearing screening, pure tone and speech audiometry, auditory brainstem response (ABR) test, bedside vestibular assessment, videomystagmography (VNG), caloric test, vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP), computerized dynamic posturography (CDP), video head impulse test (vHIT), intraoperative cochlear implant measurement, and postop cochlear implant fittings were performed The number of tests has decreased significantly in the course of the pandemic (p &lt; 0 01) No evidence of Covid-19 disease was detected in the audiology staff and patients In general, no major risk was seen during testing under protective measures except for vestibular testing which induced vomiting and taking out the mask for lip reading during cochlear implant fitting in the elderly Conclusion: It is possible to perform audiovestibular tests during the Covid-19 pandemic by wearing necessary protective equipment and disinfecting the potential surfaces Vomiting during vestibular tests, uncovering the nose and mouth for lip reading, and small-sized test cabins are the main risk factors of contamination in the audiology clinics","output":"Significance of continuing audiovestibular practice during Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic is stressing healthcare services to an unprecedented extent. There is anecdotal evidence of reduction in organ donation and transplantation (ODT) activity across the world. METHODS The weekly organ donation and liver transplant numbers over a 3-month period (17th Feb 2020 till 17th May 2020) for the USA, UK and India were compared to their previous year's activity. Liver transplant activity in 6 centers from these countries with varying local COVID-19 caseload was also compared. RESULTS The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant contraction in organ donation and liver transplantation in all 3 countries. Peak reduction ranged from 25% in the USA to over 80% in the UK and India. The reduction was different for deceased donor and living donor liver transplantation and varied between centers within a country. There was early evidence of recovery of deceased donation in the USA and UK and resumption of living donor liver transplantation activity in India towards the end of the study period. A number of policy changes were undertaken at national and transplant center levels to ensure safe transplantation despite significant redirection of resources to combat the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS There was a substantial reduction in organ donation and liver transplantation activity across the 3 countries with signs of recovery towards the end of the study period. Multiple factors including COVID-19 severity, stress on resources and influence of regulatory agencies and local factors are responsible for the reduction and recovery.","output":"Trinational Study Exploring the Early Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Organ Donation and Liver Transplantation at National and Unit Levels."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem worldwide that has been exacerbated by antibiotic misuse worldwide. Growing antibiotic resistance can be attributed to as well as leads to severe infections, complications, prolonged hospital admissions, and higher mortality. One of the most important goals of administering antimicrobials is to avoid establishing antibiotic resistance during therapy. This can be done by drastically lowering worldwide antimicrobial usage, both in present and future. While current management methods to legislate antimicrobials and educate the healthcare community on the challenges are beneficial, they do not solve the problem of attaining an overall reduction in antimicrobial usage in humans. Application of rapid microbiological diagnostics for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, use of inflammation markers to guide initiation and duration of therapies, reduction of standard antibiotic course durations, individualization of antibiotic treatments, and dosing considering pharmacokinetics are all possible strategies to optimize antibiotic use in everyday clinical practice and reduce the risk of inducing bacterial resistance. Furthermore, to remove any impediments to proper prescribing, strategies to improve antibiotic prescribing and antibiotic stewardship programs should enable clinical reasoning and enhance the prescribing environment. In addition, the well-established association between antimicrobial usage and resistance should motivate efforts to develop antimicrobial treatment regimens that facilitate the evolution of resistance.

METHODS: Six months after the switch of the treatment regimen from PRN to T&E, answers of a 16-item questionnaire of 105 patients under IVI therapy regarding age, sex and treatment preference (T&E or PRN regimen), as well as burden and anxiety resulting from therapy, were evaluated. Analysis of associations between answers of the questionnaire was executed using Pearsons Chi(2) test and MannCWhitney U test. P values  0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Nearly all patients (90.5%) felt well informed about disease and therapy. Comparing treatment regimen, 13.7% thought PRN was better and 23.3% felt T&E was better. The majority considered PRN and T&E to be equal (60.3%). No significant association between treatment regimen and age (p = 0.15), gender (p = 0.35) and duration of IVI therapy (p = 0.42) was seen. The examination results are associated with fear in the majority of patients (53.3%). Fear about the IVI was indicated by 47.6% of individuals and was significantly associated with pain during treatment (p = 0.0003), pain after treatment (p = 0.004) and fear about unfavourable examination results regarding disease activity (p = 7.94  10(?7)). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients are satisfied with the IVI therapy and the treatment regimen. Fear of the IVI and particularly of unfavourable examination results demonstrate the high treatment burden for patients undergoing anti-VEGF therapy.

A separate, patient-reported study associated famotidine use with improvements in mild to moderate symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath.

Intrinsic host factors, such as age, can influence disease severity. Glycosylation plays a critical role in influenza pathogenesis; however, the molecular drivers of influenza outcomes remain unknown. In this work, we characterized the host glycomic response to the H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1pdm09) as a function of age-dependent severity in a ferret model. Using our dual-color lectin microarray technology, we examined baseline glycosylation and glycomic response to infection in newly weaned and aged animals, models for young children and the elderly, respectively. Compared to adult uninfected ferrets, we observed higher levels of -2,6-sialosides, the receptor for H1N1pdm09, in newly weaned and aged animals. We also observed age-dependent loss of O-linked -2,3-sialosides. The loss of these highly charged groups may impact viral clearance by mucins, which corresponds to the lower clearance rates observed in aged animals. Upon infection, we observed dramatic changes in the glycomes of aged animals, a population severely impacted by the virus. In contrast, no significant alterations were observed in the newly weaned animals, which show mild to moderate responses to the H1N1pdm09. High mannose, a glycan recently identified as a marker of severity in adult animals, increased with severity in the aged population. However, the response was delayed, in line with the delayed development of pneumonia observed.

Using SPSS Modeler 14.1 software, association rules and Bayesian network were applied to explore the correlation between symptoms and their contribution to syndrome. RESULTS There were 121 questionnaires referring to syndrome of lung damp-heat accumulation in total 654 questionnaires. The symptoms with frequency > 40% were fever (53.72%), cough (47.93%), red tongue (45.45%), rapid pulse (43.80%), greasy fur (42.15%), yellow tongue (41.32%), fatigue (40.50%) and anorexia (40.50%).

A novel rat two-hit ALI model was developed that uses a complement stimulus for the second hit, leading to a robust immune-mediated ALI, characterized by leukopenia, neutrophil infiltration of the lung tissue as well as neutrophil extracellular trap (NETs) formation and cytokine storm. ReAlta's lead compound, RLS-0071, is a PEGylated peptide with dual acting anti-inflammatory activity that inhibits classical and lectin complement activation, as well as neutrophil-mediated NETosis in vitro. The efficacy of RLS-0071 on ALI, complement activation, NET formation and inflammatory cytokine release was assessed in this preclinical animal model. Methods: Wistar rats were infused intravenously with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1st hit), followed by incompatible red blood cells (RBC) 30 min later (2-hit). At 4 hours, blood was collected to assess C5a levels, free DNA (NET biomarker) and cytokine levels. Lung tissue was recovered for histological analysis. RLS-0071 administration prior to RBC transfusion (prophylaxis dosing) and at fixed times (30 seconds to 180 minutes) after 2-hit (rescue dosing) was examined to assess the impact of the compound on lung histology, C5a, free DNA as well as inflammatory cytokine levels. Results: Scoring of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) lung sections showed a significant reduction in lung injury with single prophylaxis dose of RLS-0071 given 30 minutes before the second hit preserving lung histology in the animals. Analysis of the sections in which the images were converted to black and white pixels quantified by ImageJ (NIH) were used to derive a lung injury score (0-5) as shown below. RLS-0071 delivered as prophylaxis or rescue significantly reduced neutrophil infiltration, C5a levels, free DNA levels in the blood and pro inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6, TNF and IL-17. Rescue dosing demonstrated that RLS-0071 could significantly prevent lung damage when delivered up to 180 minutes after the 2-hit. Conclusion: Animals receiving RLS-0071 showed lung tissue architecture comparable to controls. RLS-0071 demonstrated the ability to prevent downstream C5a proinflammatory signaling via complement modulation consistent with the observed reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines production such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF.

Along with high monetary health care costs for sepsis treatment, there is a lasting impact on lives of sepsis survivors and their caregivers. Early identification is necessary to reduce the negative impact of sepsis and to improve patient outcomes. Prehospital data are among the earliest information collected by health care systems. Using these untapped sources of data in machine learning (ML)-based approaches can identify patients with sepsis earlier in emergency department (ED). OBJECTIVES: This integrative literature review aims to discuss the importance of utilizing prehospital data elements in ED, summarize their current use in developing ML-based prediction models, and specifically identify those data elements that can potentially contribute to early identification of sepsis in ED when used in ML-based approaches. METHOD: Literature search strategy includes following two separate searches: (1) use of prehospital data in ML models in ED; and (2) ML models that are developed specifically to predict/detect sepsis in ED. In total, 24 articles are used in this review. RESULTS: A summary of prehospital data used to identify time-sensitive conditions earlier in ED is provided. Literature related to use of ML models for early identification of sepsis in ED is limited and no studies were found related to ML models using prehospital data in prediction/early identification of sepsis in ED. Among those using ED data, ML models outperform traditional statistical models. In addition, the use of the free-text elements and natural language processing (NLP) methods could result in better prediction of sepsis in ED. CONCLUSION: This study reviews the use of prehospital data in early decision-making in ED and suggests that researchers utilize such data elements for prediction/early identification of sepsis in ML-based approaches.","output":"Can Prehospital Data Improve Early Identification of Sepsis in Emergency Department?

However, it utilizes time-consuming procedures and expensive instruments, making it infeasible for point-of-care (POC) analysis especially in resource-limited settings. In this work, a multicolorimetric ELISA biosensor integrated on a paper/polymer hybrid microfluidic device was developed for rapid visual detection of disease biomarkers at point of care, without using costly equipment. This multicolormetric ELISA platform was built on multiple distinct color variants resulted from the catalytic oxidation of 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and the etching of gold nanorods (AuNRs). The vivid color changes could be easily distinguished by the naked eye, and their red mean values allowed quantitative biomarker detection, without using any sophisticated instruments. When this multicolorimetric ELISA was integrated on a paper/polymer hybrid analytical device, it not only provided integrated processing and high portability but also enabled fast assays in about 50 min due to the unique advantages of paper/polymer hybrid devices. The limit of detection of 9.1 ng/L of the hepatitis C virus core antigen, a biomarker for hepatitis C, was achieved using this multicolorimetric ELISA platform. This multicolor ELISA analytical device provides a new versatile, user-friendly, affordable, and portable immunosensing platform with high potential for on-site detections of various viruses, proteins, and biomarkers for low-resource settings such as at home, public venues, rural areas, and developing nations.

MEGs spatial resolution critically depends on the approach used to solve the ill-posed inverse problem in order to transform sensor signals into cortical activation maps. Over recent years non-globally optimized solutions based on the use of adaptive beamformers (BF) gained popularity. When operating in the environment with a small number of uncorrelated sources the BFs perform optimally and yield spatial super-resolution. However, the BFs are known to fail when dealing with correlated sources acting like poorly tuned spatial filters with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the output timeseries and often meaningless cortical maps of power distribution. This fact poses a serious limitation on the broader use of this promising technique especially since fundamental mechanisms of brain functioning, its inherent symmetry and task-based experimental paradigms result into a great deal of correlation in the activity of cortical sources. To cope with this problem, we developed a novel beamformer approach that preserves high spatial resolution in the environments with correlated sources. At the core of our method is a projection operation applied to the vectorized sensor-space covariance matrix. This projection does not remove the activity of the correlated sources from the sensor-space covariance matrix but rather selectively handles their contributions to the covariance matrix and creates a sufficiently accurate approximation of an ideal data covariance that could hypothetically be observed should these sources be uncorrelated. Since the projection operation is reciprocal to the PSIICOS method developed by us earlier (Ossadtchi et al. (2018)) we refer to the family of algorithms presented here as ReciPSIICOS. We asses the performance of the novel approach using realistically simulated MEG data and show its superior performance in comparison to the well established MNE and classical BF approaches. We have also applied our approach to the MEG datasets from the two experiments involving two different auditory tasks. The analysis of experimental MEG datasets showed that beamformers from ReciPSIICOS family, but not MNE and the classical BF, discovered the expected bilateral focal sources in the primary auditory cortex and detected motor cortex activity associated with the audio-motor task. Moreover, ReciPSIICOS beamformers yielded cortical activity estimates with amplitude an order of magnitude higher than that obtained with the classical BF, which indicates the severeness of the signal cancellation problem when applying classical beamformers to MEG signals generated by synchronous sources.","output":"Modified covariance beamformer for solving MEG inverse problem in the environment with correlated sources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AimsOpioid dependence has high risks.

Patient participants reported similar levels of satisfaction between the Telemedicine and Face to Face groups. The themes generated in relation to Face-to-Face were no difference, easy, kind staff and liking being part of research. For Telemedicine, themes were less travel, good experience, easier to access, good communication, saves time and saves money. For instance, one patient stated Clear, easy to access less travel and another patient stated I struggle with travel. I found it easier. Of 19 staff participant research interviews completed, Staff reported Good or Very Good experience with telemedicine which was equivalent for Face-to-Face consultations. Eleven staff had experience of telemedicine consultations during the trial. They reported similar themes to patients with telemedicine leading to less travel, beneficial to patient care, improves attendance and was innovative technology. One staff member reported satisfaction with telemedicine due to Time, travel and money reduction. When questioned on the downsides to telemedicine, technological issues were mainly related to connection issues and sound issues.ConclusionIn the first known RCT of Telemedicine versus Face-to-Face consultations for patients with opioid dependence attending prescriber review, we found that both patients and staff were satisfied with telemedicine as compared to face-to-face consultations.

METHODS: This is a retrospective single-centre study based on review of medical charts, conducted during the outbreak peak (March 27-April 18, 2020) in a Lombard dementia facility, including 59 elderly subjects with dementia and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. FINDINGS: Of the 59 residents, 57 (96?6%) tested positive (mean age: 82?8; women: 66?7%). Comorbidities were present in all participants, with 18/57 (31?6%) having three or more concomitant diseases.

Eleven/21 DOC patients (52?4%) had hypoactive delirium, while hyperactive delirium occurred in ten/21 (47?6%). Lymphopenia was present in almost all subjects (median: 1?3  10(9)/L). Overall mortality rate was 24?6% (14/57) and dementia severity per se had no impact on short-term mortality due to COVID-19. DOC was strongly associated with higher mortality (p<0?001).

Here we report the isolation of two highly potently neutralizing mAbs (THSC20.HVTR04 and THSC20.HVTR26) from an Indian convalescent donor, that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 VOCs at picomolar concentrations including the delta variant (B.1.617.2).

A national sero-epidemiological survey suggests higher cumulative incidence of infection in older individuals than in younger individuals. However, little is known about the epidemic dynamics in different age groups, including the relative effect of the lockdown measures introduced on March 15, and strengthened on March 30 to April 14, 2020 when only essential workers continued to work. METHODS: We used data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE in Spanish) on the daily number of reported COVID-19 cases (by date of symptom onset) in eleven 5-year age groups: 15C19y through 65C69y. For each age group g, we computed the proportion E(g) of individuals in age group g among all reported cases aged 15C69y during the pre-lockdown period (March 1C10, 2020) and the corresponding proportion L(g) during two lockdown periods (March 25-April 3 and April 8C17, 2020). For each lockdown period, we computed the proportion ratios PR(g)=L(g)/E(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, PR(g1)>PR(g2) implies a relative increase in the incidence of detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in the age group g1 compared with g2 for the later vs. early period. RESULTS: For the first lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 50C54y (PR=1.21; 95% CI: 1.12,1.30) and 55C59y (PR=1.19; 1.11,1.27).

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that different outbreak control measures led to different changes in the relative incidence by age group. During the first lockdown period, when non-essential work was allowed, individuals aged 40C64y, particularly those aged 50C59y presented with higher COVID-19 relative incidence compared to pre-lockdown period, while younger adults/older adolescents (together with persons aged 50C59y) had increased relative incidence during the later, strengthened lockdown.

The purpose of our study was to assess a novel stem with an embedded sensor that can remotely and objectively monitor a patient's mobility after TKA. METHODS: A single anatomically designed knee system was implanted in concert with an interconnected tibial stem extension containing 3D accelerometers, 3D gyroscopes, a power source, and a telemetry transmission capability in 3 cadaveric pelvis to toe specimens. The legs were moved by hand to preset tibial positions at full knee extension, midflexion, flexion, and back to midflexion and extension for a total of 16 trials across 6 knees. RESULTS: Sensor data were successfully transmitted with good quality of signal to an external base station. Good correlation to the range of motion of the tibia was found (mean error 0.1 degrees; root mean square error 3.8 degrees). The signal from the heel drop tests suggests the sensor could detect heel strike during activities of daily living in vivo and the potential for additional signal processing to analyze vibratory and motion patterns detected by the sensors. A frequency domain analysis of a properly cemented and poorly cemented implant during the heel drop test suggests a difference in accelerometer signal in these implant states.

METHODS: A total of 174 psychiatric medical staff (namely 97 doctors, 68 nurses, and nine administrators) and 27 controls were included in the current study. A self-designed questionnaire was used to collect their general demographic information (age, gender, marriage, occupation, profession, smoking history, alcohol consumption history, tea drinking history, previous history of anxiety and depression) as well as their subjective experience, such as nausea, vomiting, coughing, worry, fear, etc, during nasopharyngeal swab collection. The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used to assess the subjects pain and state anxiety, respectively. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences (p>0.05) in age, marriage, smoking history, a history of anxiety and depression, pain scores, and anxiety scores between different professions and genders. The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated that the male gender was negatively correlated with being anxious (r=-0.148, p=0.037) and nervous (r=-0.171 p=0.016), although there was no significant difference in pain and anxiety between men and women. In addition, marriage might help women resist negative emotions. CONCLUSIONS: 1) There will be mild discomfort during nucleic acid testing, but not enough to cause pain and anxiety; 2) women are more likely to be anxious and nervous during the nucleic acid testing.","output":"The Nasopharynx Swab Test for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Is Mild and Will Not Cause Significant Pain and Anxiety: A Cross-Sectional Study Based on Psychiatrists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) is a zinc-dependent ubiquitous transmembrane ectoenzyme that is widely present in different types of cells.

Due to the limited results, until specific treatments are available, other therapeutic approaches need to be considered. The endocannabinoid system is found in multiple systems within the human body, including the immune system. Its activation can lead to beneficial results such as decreased viral entry, decreased viral replication, and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-&#945;, or IFN-?3. Moreover, endocannabinoid system activation can lead to an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines, mainly represented by IL-10. Overall, the cannabinoid system can potentially reduce pulmonary inflammation, increase the immunomodulatory effect, decrease PMN infiltration, reduce fibrosis, and decrease viral replication, as well as decrease the 'cytokine storm'.

With concern for higher rates of marijuana use among those who vape nicotine, the presence of marijuana-related terms in store names was also assessed. A census of stores that were classified online as vape shops/stores or vaporizer stores were telephoned in April-May 2018 (n=739) and July-September 2019 (n=919) to verify whether vape products and other tobacco products (OTP) were sold. We computed the percent of stores that closed, opened, and started/stopped selling OTP. Multilevel models tested whether these events varied by store type and by neighborhood demographics. Within 16 months, 11.5% of 739 stores had closed and 29.8% of 919 stores at follow-up had opened. Closings were more likely among vape-only than vape+OTP stores (AOR=2.51, 95% CI=1.47,4.29);vape-only stores were less likely to open (AOR=0.46, 95% CI=0.34,0.62). Regardless of store type, the odds of a store opening increased as the proportion of non-Hispanic/Latino White residents in the census tract increased (AOR=1.47, 95% CI=1.18,1.85). Overall, 2.0% of stores (vape-only and vape+OTP) had marijuana-related names at baseline and 3.5% at follow-up. The observed change (1.6% to 5.8%) was greatest in Oklahoma City, where the state legalized medical marijuana between baseline and follow-up. More stores were opening than closing in six U.S. metropolitan statistical areas before statewide sales restrictions on flavored tobacco and COVID-19.

Where the media places responsibility during a pandemic is therefore important to study as blame is commonly used as a tool to influence public behavior but can also lead to the subjective persecution of groups. The aim of this paper is to investigate where the media places responsibility for COVID-19 in Australia. Specifically, we identify the key themes and frames that are present and observe how they changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to government actions and progression of the pandemic. Understanding media representations of the COVID-19 pandemic will provide insights into ways in which responsibility is framed in relation to health action. Newspaper articles from the Australian and the Sydney Morning Herald were sampled between January 20 and March 31 2020 on every second Monday. Factiva was used to identify and download newspaper articles using the following search criteria: COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR Wuhan virus OR corona virus OR Hebei virus OR wet market OR (Wuhan AND virus) OR (market AND Wuhan and virus) or (China AND Virus) or (Novel AND Virus). Articles were imported into Nvivo and thematic and framing analyses were used. The results show that framing of the pandemic was largely based on societal issues with the theme of economic disruption prevalent throughout the study time period. Moral evaluations of the pandemic were infrequent initially but increased co-incident with the first signs of flattening of the curve. Explicit examples of blame were very rare but were commonly implied based on the causal origin of the virus. The Australian printed media were slow to report on the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition they were reluctant to apportion blame until the end of the study period, after confirmed case rates had begun to slow. This is interpreted as being due to an evaluation of the pandemic risks as low by the media and therefore the tools of othering and blame were not used until after the study period when the actual risks had begun to abate, more consistent with an inquiry than a mediating mechanism.","output":"How the Media Places Responsibility for the COVID-19 PandemicAn Australian Media Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper deals with the problem of modeling counterfactual reasoning in scenarios where, apart from the observed endogenous variables, we have a latent variable that affects the outcomes and, consequently, the results of counterfactuals queries. This is a common setup in healthcare problems, including mental health. We propose a new framework where the aforementioned problem is modeled as a multivariate regression and the counterfactual model accounts for both observed and a latent variable, where the latter represents what we call the patient individuality factor ([Formula: see text] ). In mental health, focusing on individuals is paramount, as past experiences can change how people see or deal with situations, but individuality cannot be directly measured. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first counterfactual approach that considers both observational and latent variables to provide deterministic answers to counterfactual queries, such as: what if I change the social support of a patient, to what extent can I change his/her anxiety? The framework combines concepts from deep representation learning and causal inference to infer the value of [Formula: see text] and capture both non-linear and multiplicative effects of causal variables. Experiments are performed with both synthetic and real-world datasets, where we predict how changes in peoples actions may lead to different outcomes in terms of symptoms of mental illness and quality of life. Results show the model learns the individually factor with errors lower than 0.05 and answers counterfactual queries that are supported by the medical literature.

Consequently, this study (1) estimated the concentrations of phthalates in fabric face coverings, (2) estimated the potential consumer exposures, and compared them to health guidance values (HGVs), and (3) advised on voluntary phthalate testing in textiles and/or face coverings. Precautionary upper-bound phthalate mass in face coverings was estimated from phthalate concentrations in clothing articles. Exposure to phthalates was predicted to occur predominantly via inhalation and direct dermal contact;however, for both routes, the doses were below HGVs, indicating that, based on the limited materials characterized in the literature, a health risk was unlikely. Further, the limit of 0.1% (w/w) set for individual or sum of phthalates in child care articles in the U.S. and other countries was deemed protective for children and adult face coverings.

The epidemiology of candidemia has changed globally over the past 20 years. South African surveillance demonstrated a shift in epidemiology from Candida albicans to non-albicans species including Candida parapsilosis and Candida auris. Hospital-level candidemia incidence from South Africa has not been reported previously. METHODS: We performed a retrospective laboratory-based analysis of blood cultures with confirmed causative agents of candidemia. Ward type, department, gender and admission to critical care units were captured. Data were analysed in Microsoft Excel, Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and Epitools. RESULTS: The incidence of candidemia during the study period was 2.87 per 1000 admissions. The total proportion of non-albicans species causing candidemia was 425/618 (69.7%). Overall, 65.4% of candidemia cases occurred in non-critical care units. There was a significant increase in the proportion of C. auris isolates between 2016 and 2020 (p < 0.001).

Methods All heart recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection reported in the French national registry CRISTAL between February 1st and September 30th 2020 were included in the study (n=86). Patient characteristics were extracted from CRISTAL. Cumulative number of cases by month since February (Figure 1) and case fatality rate (CFR) were calculated. Mortality rates from February to September in the whole 2019 and 2020 recipient cohorts were compared. Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Results Of the 86 patients included (median age (IQR) 59 years (46-67), 69% male gender, median time from transplantation 6.9 years (3.0-15.2)) 77% required hospitalization including 39% in ICU.

Changes in serotonergic tone have been reported to shift oscillations between the combined delta-theta (2.5-8 Hz) and the alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency ranges. Such frequency shifts may constitute a useful biomarker for the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). We utilized quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to measure shifts in prefrontal rhythmic oscillations early in treatment with either the SSRI escitalopram or placebo, and examined the relationship between these changes and remission of depressive symptoms. Prefrontal delta-theta and alpha power were calculated for 194 subjects with moderate MDD prior to and one week after start of treatment. Changes at one week in delta-theta and alpha power, as well as the delta-theta/alpha ratio, were examined in three cohorts: initial (N = 70) and replication (N = 76) cohorts treated with escitalopram, and a cohort treated with placebo (N = 48). Mean delta-theta power significantly increased and alpha power decreased after one week of escitalopram treatment, but did not significantly change with placebo treatment. The delta-theta/alpha ratio change was a specific predictor of the likelihood of remission after seven weeks of medication treatment: a large increase in this ratio was associated with non-remission in escitalopram-treated subjects, but not placebo-treated subjects. Escitalopram and placebo treatment have differential effects on delta-theta and alpha frequency oscillations. Early increase in delta-theta/alpha may constitute a replicable biomarker for non-remission during SSRI treatment of MDD.","output":"Escitalopram but not placebo modulates brain rhythmic oscillatory activity in the first week of treatment of Major Depressive Disorder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To give insight into human resource (HR) policy makers of the impact of the abrupt change in working conditions as reported from their primary stakeholders - the employees Design/methodology/approach Reported from a first-person point of view, 192 employees from Kuwait who are currently working from home were surveyed as to how the lockdown circumstances have impacted their conventional work expectations The study compares the old working conditions (OWC) to the current working conditions (CWC) to give insight into the overall sentiments of the abrupt changes to the workplace Findings It was found that most employees agreed that OWC need to be reviewed, and that the general sentiment was almost equally split on the efficiency of CWC in comparison to OWC, yet the majority was enjoying the flexible conditions Moreover, the majority of respondents found that overall conventional work elements either remained the same or had been impacted positively rather than negatively Also, if given an option of a hybrid model inclusive of partly working remotely and partly working on-site, a considerable majority reported that they are able to efficiently conduct atleast 80% of their work expectation Finally, it was found that employee expectation is changing as they consider post COVID-19 conditions Research limitations/implications This research was conducted using virtual crowd-sourcing methods to administer the survey and may have been enhanced should other methods have been integrated for data gathering Also, a more comprehensive phenomenological approach could have been incorporated to add a qualitative method to the investigation This could have freed the results of answer limitation and experience bias Moreover, it is good practice to involve both quantitative and qualitative elements to any research when possible Finally, future research can benefit from a bigger pool of participants so as to gain a clearer picture Originality/value This research will give policy makers a look at what needs to be reviewed/changed for a successful roll-out of remote work in accordance with their original strategies","output":"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on conventional work settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination against viruses has rarely been associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). An association with the COVID-19 vaccine is unknown. We performed a population-based study of National Health Service (NHS) data in England and a multicentre surveillance study from UK hospitals, to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and GBS. Firstly, we present a retrospective analysis of every GBS patient in England in the National Immunoglobulin Database (NID) linked with their COVID-19 vaccination data. Cases of GBS identified in the National Immunoglobulin Database (NID) from 8 December 2021 to 8 July 2021 were linked to data from the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) in England to identify exposure to a COVID-19 vaccine. For the NID/NIMS linked dataset, GBS cases temporally associated with vaccination within a 6-week risk window of any COVID-19 vaccine were identified. Secondly, we prospectively collected incident UK GBS cases from 1 January 2021 to 7 November 2021 in a separate UK multicentre surveillance database, regardless of vaccine exposure, with vaccine timings and GBS phenotypic data. For this multicentre UK surveillance dataset, we explored phenotypes of reported GBS cases to identify features of COVID-19 vaccine-associated GBS. 996 GBS cases were recorded in the NID from January to October 2021. A spike of GBS cases above the 2016-2020 average occurred in March-April 2021. In England, among all cases of GBS, 198 occurred within 6 weeks of the first-dose COVID-19 vaccination (0.618 cases per 100,000 vaccinations, 176 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), 21 tozinameran (Pfizer), 1 mRNA-1273 (Moderna)). The excess of GBS occurs with a peak at 24 days; first-doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 accounted for the excess. No excess was seen for second-dose vaccination. The absolute number of excess GBS cases was between 98-140 cases for first-dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination from January-July 2021. First-dose tozinameran and second-dose of any vaccination showed no excess GBS risk. 121 patients were reported in the separate multicentre surveillance dataset with no phenotypic or demographic differences identified between vaccinated and non-vaccinated GBS cases. Data from the linked NID/NIMS dataset suggest that first-dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19vaccination is associated with an excess GBS risk of 0.576 (95%CI 0.481-0.691) cases per 100,000 doses. However, further data reported from a multicentre surveillance dataset suggest that no specific clinical features, including facial weakness, are associated with vaccination-related GBS compared to non-vaccinated cases. The pathogenic cause of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19specific first dose link warrants further study.","output":"COVID-19 vaccination and Guillain-Barre syndrome: analyses using the National Immunoglobulin Database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) infection causes acute atrophic enteritis in the turkey poults, leading to significant economic loss in the U.S. turkey industry. Rapid detection, differentiation, and quantitation of TCoV are critical to the diagnosis and control of the disease. A specific one-step real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) assay for detection and quantitation of TCoV in the turkey tissues was developed using a dual-labeled fluorescent probe. The fluorogenic probe labeled with a reporter dye (FAM, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamin) and a quencher dye (AbsoluteQuencher?) was designed to bind to a 186 base-pair fragment flanked by the two PCR primers targeting the 3 end of spike gene of TCoV. The assay was performed on different avian viruses and bacteria to determine the specificity as well as serial dilutions of TCoV for the sensitivity. Three animal trials were conducted to further validate the assay. Ten-day-old turkey poults were inoculated orally with 100 EID(50) of TCoV. Intestinal tissues (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum), feces from the cloacal swabs, or feces from the floor were collected at 12 h, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and/or 14 days post-inoculation (DPI). RNA was extracted from each sample and subjected to the RRT-PCR. The designed primers and probe were specific for TCoV. Other non-TCoV avian viruses and bacteria were not amplified by RRT-PCR. The assay was highly sensitive and could quantitate between 10(2) and 10(10) copies/l of viral genome. The viral RNA in the intestine segments reached the highest level, 6  10(15) copies/l, in the jejunum at 5 DPI. Eighty-four intestine segments assayed by the developed RRT-PCR and immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA) revealed that there were 6 segments negative for TCoV by both assays, 45 positive for TCoV by IFA, and 77 positive for TCoV by RRT-PCR. Turkey coronavirus was detected in the feces from the cloacal swabs or floor 1C14 DPI; however, the viral RNA load varied among different turkey poults at different intervals from different trials. The highest amount of viral RNA, 2.8  10(10) copies/l, in the feces was the one from the cloacal swab collected at 1 DPI. The average amount of TCoV RNA in the cloacal fecal samples was 10 times higher than that in the fecal droppings on the floor. Taken together, the results indicated that the developed RRT-PCR assay is rapid, sensitive, and specific for detection, differentiation, and quantitation of TCoV in the turkey tissues and should be helpful in monitoring the progression of TCoV induced acute enteritis in the turkey flocks.","output":"Specific real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for detection and quantitation of turkey coronavirus RNA in tissues and feces from turkeys infected with turkey coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent data have revealed that fructose-rich diet triggers inflammation and lipid synthesis.

Few nationwide data are available to compare risk factors, treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 patients after ICU admission. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate baseline characteristics, treatments and 30-day outcomes of patients admitted to Swedish ICUs with COVID-19. DESIGN: Registry-based cohort study with prospective data collection. SETTING: Admissions to Swedish ICUs from 6 March to 6 May 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to Swedish ICUs. EXPOSURES: Baseline characteristics, intensive care treatments and organ failures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A multivariable model was used to determine the independent association between potential predictor variables and death. RESULTS: We identified 1563 patients with complete 30-day follow-up. The 30-day all-cause mortality was 26.7%. Median age was 61 [52 to 69], Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was 53 [46 to 59] and 62.5% had at least one comorbidity. Median PaO2/FiO2 on admission was 97.5 [75.0 to 140.6] mmHg, 74.7% suffered from moderate-to-severe acute respiratory failure. Age, male sex [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.5 (1.1 to 2.2)], SAPS III score [aOR 1.3 (1.2 to 1.4)], severe respiratory failure [aOR 3.0 (2.0 to 4.7)], specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy [aOR 1.4 (1.0 to 1.9)] and continuous renal replacement therapy [aOR 2.1 (1.5 to 3.0)] were associated with increased mortality. Except for chronic lung disease, the presence of comorbidities was not independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-day mortality rate in COVID-19 patients admitted to Swedish ICUs is generally lower than previously reported despite a severe degree of hypoxaemia on admission. Mortality was driven by age, baseline disease severity, the presence and degree of organ failure, rather than pre-existing comorbidities.

This approach uses mutagenic drugs to increase viral mutation rates and burden viral populations with mutations that reduce the number of infectious progeny. We investigated the effectiveness of lethal mutagenesis as a strategy against influenza virus using three nucleoside analogs, ribavirin, 5-azacytidine, and 5-fluorouracil. All three drugs were active against a panel of seasonal H3N2 and laboratory-adapted H1N1 strains. We found that each drug increased the frequency of mutations in influenza virus populations and decreased the virus' specific infectivity, indicating a mutagenic mode of action. We were able to drive viral populations to extinction by passaging influenza virus in the presence of each drug, indicating that complete lethal mutagenesis of influenza virus populations can be achieved when a sufficient mutational burden is applied. Population-wide resistance to these mutagenic agents did not arise after serial passage of influenza virus populations in sublethal concentrations of drug. Sequencing of these drug-passaged viral populations revealed genome-wide accumulation of mutations at low frequency. The replicative capacity of drug-passaged populations was reduced at higher multiplicities of infection, suggesting the presence of defective interfering particles and a possible barrier to the evolution of resistance. Together, our data suggest that lethal mutagenesis may be a particularly effective therapeutic approach with a high genetic barrier to resistance for influenza virus. IMPORTANCE Influenza virus is an RNA virus that causes significant morbidity and mortality during annual epidemics. Novel therapies for RNA viruses are needed due to the ease with which these viruses evolve resistance to existing therapeutics. Lethal mutagenesis is a broad-spectrum strategy that exploits the high mutation rate and the low mutational tolerance of most RNA viruses. It is thought to possess a higher barrier to resistance than conventional antiviral strategies. We investigated the effectiveness of lethal mutagenesis against influenza virus using three different drugs. We showed that influenza virus was sensitive to lethal mutagenesis by demonstrating that all three drugs induced mutations and led to an increase in the generation of defective viral particles. We also found that it may be difficult for resistance to these drugs to arise at a population-wide level. Our data suggest that lethal mutagenesis may be an attractive anti-influenza strategy that warrants further investigation.","output":"Effective lethal mutagenesis of influenza virus by three nucleoside analogs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goals of this scoping literature review are to (1) aggregate the current research involving socially assistive robots in the setting of geriatric psychiatry and (2) examine the outcome measures used in these studies and determine where the gaps and needs are.

We investigated the extent of adverse psychological reactions in two medical staff groups in China, and explored the importance of online psychological assistance for them. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey including Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was utilized to assess anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to match sex and age between the two groups. Differences in the prevalence of adverse psychological reactions between the two groups were compared by a Chi-square test. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to search for associated adverse psychological reaction factors of two groups. Results: A total of 2,920 medical staff took part in the survey, including 470 frontline and 2,450 non-frontline medical staff. The risk of the frontline group experiencing anxiety, depression, insomnia-early, insomnia-middle, and insomnia-late were 1.16, 1.28, 1.26, 1.22, 1.28 times those of the non-frontline group after PSM. For frontline medical staff, the spinsterhood state (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.00C1.51; P = 0.05) was a risk factor for anxiety.

Post the COVID ?19 pandemic outbreak in India in March 2020;many industry sectors had been experiencing a general slowdown in business. Retail was one such sector identified, which had faced a slowdown. A recent Edelweiss report suggested a 39% dip in revenues of DMart stores that were owned and operated by Avenue Supermarts Limited (ASL). The PS team had been following the impressive growth story of DMart since 2017 when they had made a historic market debut with the initial public offering. Over the years the company had grown and emerged as one of the most valued listed retailers in the Indian retail space in the fiscal year 2019C2020. However, much had changed, as the imposition of the countrywide lockdown in March 2020. Based on the Government of India and local government directives nearly 50% of the stores had to be temporarily shut. The case highlights the dynamics of the Indian retail market with multiple players and formats and the changes in consumer behaviour. ASL had used its DMart Ready online app and DMart on Wheels to service the needs of its customers during the period of the lockdown. The PS team wanted to make a business consulting pitch to DMart to help them revive their growth trajectory. What could be the best advice that the PS team could offer to DMart in their pitch?

Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 100 asymptomatic Lebanese subjects that have tested positive for SARS-CoV2. Fifty patients received standard preventive treatment, mainly supplements, and the experimental group received a single dose (according to body weight) of ivermectin, in addition to the same supplements the control group received. Results: There was no significant difference (p = 0.06) between Ct-values of the two groups before the regimen was started (day zero), indicating that subjects in both groups had similar viral loads. At 72 h after the regimen started, the increase in Ct-values was dramatically higher in the ivermectin than in the control group.

(2) Issue a separate path query for each single POI, i.e., a single reachability query requires answering many path queries. None of these solutions scales to large networks with many POIs. We propose a novel and lightweight reachability index. The key idea is to partition the network into cells. Then, in contrast to other approaches, we expand the network cell by cell. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world networks confirm the efficiency and the effectiveness of our index-based reachability query solution.","output":"An Efficient Index for Reachability Queries in Public Transport Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The urgent need for, but limited availability of, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines worldwide has led to widespread consideration of dose sparing strategies, particularly single vaccine dosing of individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses following a single-dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine in 155 previously SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals participating in a population-based prospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients. Participants varied widely in age, comorbidities, COVID-19 severity and time since infection, ranging from 1 to 15 months. Serum antibody titers were determined at time of vaccination and one week after vaccination. Responses were compared to those in SARS-CoV-2-naive health care workers after two BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine doses. Results Within one week of vaccination, IgG antibody levels to virus spike and RBD proteins increased 27 to 29-fold and neutralizing antibody titers increased 12-fold, exceeding titers of fully vaccinated SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (95% credible interval (CrI): 0.56 to 0.67 v. control 95% CrI: -0.16 to -0.02). Pre-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers had the largest positive mean effect size on titers following vaccination (95% CrI (0.16 to 0.45)). COVID-19 severity, the presence of comorbidities and the time interval between infection and vaccination had no discernible impact on vaccine response. Conclusion A single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine up to 15 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection provides neutralizing titers exceeding two vaccine doses in previously uninfected individuals. These findings support wide implementation of a single-dose mRNA vaccine strategy after prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Single-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a prospective cohort of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An air-water interface enables molecular assemblies and conformations to be controlled according to their intrinsic interactions and anisotropic stimuli. The chirality and conformation of binaphthyl derivatives have been controlled by tuning molecular aggregated states in solution. In this study, we have tuned molecular aggregated states of monobinaphthyldurene (MBD) by applying different mechanical stimuli to control the conformation at the air-water interface. Density functional theory calculations indicate that MBD exists essentially in two conformations, namely, 1-MBD (most stable) and 2-MBD (less stable). MBD was mechanically dissolved in appropriate lipid matrices using the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) method, while pure MBD was self-assembled at the dynamic air-water interface in the absence of or by applying vortex motions (vortex LB method). In MBD mixed monolayer, surface pressure-molecular area measurements and atomic force microscopy observations suggest that separate lipids and MBD phases transform to mixed phases induced by the dissolution of MBD into the lipid matrices during mechanical compression at the air-water interface. Circular dichroism measurements indicate that molecular conformation changes from 1-MBD to 2-MBD in passing from a separated phase to a mixed MBD/lipid phase. In addition, the molecular aggregated states and conformations of MBD depend on the spreading volume and vortex flow rate when applying the vortex LB method. Molecular conformations and aggregated states of MBD could be controlled continuously by applying a mechanical stimulus at the air-water interface.","output":"Mechanical Tuning of Aggregated States for Conformation Control of Cyclized Binaphthyl at the Air-Water Interface."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is evidence that loneliness and unemployment each have a negative impact on public health. Both are experienced across the life course and are of increasing concern in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review seeks to examine the strength and direction of the relationship between loneliness and unemployment in working age individuals, and in particular the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle with combined healthcare outcomes. A systematic search was undertaken in Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and EconLit from inception to December 2020. PRISMA reporting guidelines were followed throughout this review, study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist and results were summarised in a narrative synthesis. English language studies evaluating the relationship between loneliness and unemployment in higher income western countries were included. Thirty-seven studies were identified; 30 cross-sectional and 7 longitudinal. Loneliness was measured by a direct question or loneliness scale while unemployment was self-reported or retrieved from a national register. A positive association between unemployment and increased loneliness was observed across all studies. Thus, across the life-course a clear yet complex relationship exists between unemployment and greater experience of loneliness. The magnitude of this relationship increases with the severity of loneliness and appears to peak at age 30C34 and 50C59. Logistic regression provided the greatest consistency at statistical significance revealing at least a 40% increase in the likelihood of reporting loneliness when unemployed. Recent longitudinal studies identified in this review found higher levels of loneliness following job loss, but also that loneliness was predictive of unemployment suggesting potential bi-directionality in the relationship. This bi-directionality may create a multiplier effect between loneliness and unemployment to form a self-reinforcing relationship and greater health concerns for those most at risk. Thus, review findings suggest the need for cross-sector awareness and intervention to tackle both loneliness and unemployment.","output":"Does unemployment lead to greater levels of loneliness?

Further, the phenomenon of overtourism is addressed quantitatively using different indicators, including tourism density and intensity. According to these indicators, the center of Budapest (formed by districts I, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX) has been strongly affected by the presence of tourists, while districts physically far from the center have been less affected. This fact suggests the heterogeneity of the city in terms of overtourism. The number one catalyst of the negative impacts of foreign visitors behavior is party tourism (ruin pub tourism), which involves an unconventional use of the Hungarian capital. Finally, using an unconventional optimization method called fuzzy linear programming, we attempt to explore the challenging problem of identifying the optimal number of tourists for the city. The results of the study have important theoretical, methodological, and practical implications. On the theoretical side, we offer a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon of overtourism in Budapest. Methodologically, the integrated approach in terms of data gathering and unconventional analytical methodologies (comprised of a case study analysis, the assessment of effective indicators for measuring the discussed phenomenon, and the demonstration of the sustainable number of visitors) represents a novel perspective about the extent of overtourism in Budapest. On the practical side, our findings provide valuable guidance for policymakers to help mitigate the problem of overtourism in the city. With regard to future research, we suggest extending and updating the results presented in this study to develop more sustainable tourism strategies.","output":"Addressing the Phenomenon of Overtourism in Budapest from Multiple Angles Using Unconventional Methodologies and Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oil-dependent countries face a twin-shock: in addition to the COVID-19 outbreak, they are facing an oil price collapse In this paper, we study the impact of this dual shock on the forecasted GDP growth in Africa using the COVID-19 outbreak as a natural experiment We use the IMF World Economic Outlook's GDP growth forecasts before and after the outbreak We find that COVID-19 related deaths result in -2 75 percentage points forecasted GDP growth loss in the all sample while oil-dependence induces -7 6 percentage points loss We document that the joint shock entails higher forecasted growth loss in oil-dependent economies (-10 75 percentage points) Based on oil price forecasts and our empirical findings, we identify five recovery policies with high potential: social safety net policy, economic diversification, innovation and technological transformation, fiscal discipline, and climate-friendly recovery policy ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Coping with a dual shock: The economic effects of COVID-19 and oil price crises on African economies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted connections between health and social structural phenomena that have long been recognized in bioethics but have never really been front and center-not just access to health care, but fundamental conditions of living that affect public health, from income inequality to political and environmental conditions.

The results of our decomposition highlight how these opposing trends related to rising differences in enrollments and an increasingly positive correlation between an institution's enrollment level and its expenditures per student. Our decomposition results also show that both between-group differences and within-group differences contributed to the observed trends. Further examination of within-group differences reveals that inequality patterns differed meaningfully by institutional type, with doctoral universities and private baccalaureate colleges possessing higher levels of inequality and a more positive correlation between per-student expenditures and enrollments than master's institutions and public associate's colleges.","output":"Decomposing financial inequality across U.S. higher education institutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is effective in achieving established diabetes treatment targets, but durability is unknown. Objective To compare durability of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass added to intensive lifestyle and medical management in achieving diabetes control targets. Design, Setting, and Participants Observational follow-up of a randomized clinical trial at 4 sites in the United States and Taiwan, involving 120 participants who had a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 8.0% or higher and a body mass index between 30.0 and 39.9 (enrolled between April 2008 and December 2011) were followed up for 5 years, ending in November 2016. Interventions Lifestyle-intensive medical management intervention based on the Diabetes Prevention Program and LookAHEAD trials for 2 years, with and without (60 participants each) Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery followed by observation to year 5. Main Outcomes and Measures The American Diabetes Association composite triple end point of hemoglobin A1c less than 7.0%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg at 5 years. Results Of 120 participants who were initially randomized (mean age, 49 years [SD, 8 years], 72 women [60%]), 98 (82%) completed 5 years of follow-up. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups: mean (SD) body mass index 34.4 (3.2) for the lifestyle-medical management group and 34.9 (3.0) for the gastric bypass group and had hemoglobin A1c levels of 9.6% (1.2) and 9.6% (1.0), respectively. At 5 years, 13 participants (23%) in the gastric bypass group and 2 (4%) in the lifestyle-intensive medical management group had achieved the composite triple end point (difference, 19%; 95% CI, 4%-34%; P = .01). In the fifth year, 31 patients (55%) in the gastric bypass group vs 8 (14%) in the lifestyle-medical management group achieved an HbA1c level of less than 7.0% (difference, 41%; 95% CI, 19%-63%; P = .002). Gastric bypass had more serious adverse events than did the lifestyle-medical management intervention, 66 events vs 38 events, most frequently gastrointestinal events and surgical complications such as strictures, small bowel obstructions, and leaks. Gastric bypass had more parathyroid hormone elevation but no difference in B12 deficiency. Conclusions and Relevance In extended follow-up of obese adults with type 2 diabetes randomized to adding gastric bypass compared with lifestyle and intensive medical management alone, there remained a significantly better composite triple end point in the surgical group at 5 years. However, because the effect size diminished over 5 years, further follow-up is needed to understand the durability of the improvement.

Here, increased ENPP2 mRNA levels were detected in immune cells from nasopharyngeal swab samples of COVID-19 patients, and increased ATX serum levels were found in severe COVID-19 patients. ATX serum levels correlated with the corresponding increased serum levels of IL-6 and endothelial damage biomarkers, suggesting an interplay of the ATX/LPA axis with hyperinflammation and the associated vascular dysfunction in COVID-19. Accordingly, dexamethasone (Dex) treatment of mechanically ventilated patients reduced ATX levels, as shown in two independent cohorts, indicating that the therapeutic benefits of Dex include the suppression of ATX. Moreover, large scale analysis of multiple single cell RNA sequencing datasets revealed the expression landscape of ENPP2 in COVID-19 and further suggested a role for ATX in the homeostasis of dendritic cells, which exhibit both numerical and functional deficits in COVID-19.

Here we explored the attenuated phenotype of a commercially available QX live vaccine, IB Primo QX, in specific pathogens free broilers. At hatch, birds were inoculated with QX vaccine or its virulent progenitor IBV-D388, and postmortem swabs and tissues were collected each day up to eight days post infection to assess viral replication and morphological changes. In the trachea, viral RNA replication and protein expression were comparable in both groups. Both viruses induced morphologically comparable lesions in the trachea, albeit with a short delay in the vaccinated birds. In contrast, in the kidney, QX vaccine viral RNA was nearly absent, which coincided with the lack of any morphological changes in this organ. This was in contrast to high viral RNA titers and abundant lesions in the kidney after IBV D388 infection. Furthermore, QX vaccine showed reduced ability to reach and replicate in conjunctivae and intestines including cloaca, resulting in significantly lower titers and delayed protein expression, respectively. Nephropathogenic IBVs might reach the kidney also via an ascending route from the cloaca, based on our observation that viral RNA was detected in the cloaca one day before detection in the kidney. In the kidney distal tubular segments, collecting ducts and ureter were positive for viral antigen.

Here, we report differences in underlying cardiovascular comorbidities and clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Texas and in New York state. METHODS: We established a multicenter retrospective registry including patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 15 and July 12, 2020. Demographic and clinical data were manually retrieved from electronic medical records. We focused on the following outcomes: mortality, need for pharmacologic circulatory support, need for mechanical ventilation, and need for hemodialysis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Patients in the Texas cohort (n = 296) were younger (57 vs. 63 years, p value <0.001), they had a higher BMI (30.3 kg/m2 vs. 28.5 kg/m2, p = 0.015), and they had higher rates of diabetes mellitus (41 vs. 30%; p = 0.014). In contrast, patients in the New York state cohort (n = 218) had higher rates of coronary artery disease (19 vs. 10%, p = 0.005) and atrial fibrillation (11 vs. 5%, p = 0.012). Pharmacologic circulatory support, mechanical ventilation, and hemodialysis were more frequent in the Texas cohort (21 vs. 13%, p = 0.020; 30 vs. 12%, p < 0.001; and 11 vs. 5%, p = 0.009, respectively). In-hospital mortality was similar between the 2 cohorts (16 vs. 18%, p = 0.469). After adjusting for differences in underlying comorbidities, only the use of mechanical ventilation remained significantly higher in the participating Texas hospitals (odds ratios [95% CI]: 3.88 [1.23, 12.24]). Median time to pharmacologic circulatory support was 8 days (interquartile range: 2, 13.8) in the Texas cohort compared to 1 day (0, 3) in the New York state cohort, while median time to in-hospital mortality was 16 days (10, 25.5) and 7 days (4, 14), respectively (both p < 0.001).

PARTICIPANTS: From among 124 public and private facilities invited to participate, we received 71 (57%) responses. Of these responses, 50 HBTS from 27 LMICs performed on-site blood transfusions. RESULTS: Most LMIC HBTS perform blood collection to generate blood products for their patients (36/47, 77%); few relied exclusively on an external supply of blood products (11/47, 23%). The primary reason for blood transfusion was adult anaemia for non-malignant conditions (17/112, 15%). Testing methods varied by gross national income per capita. Blood transfusion delays to patients were common (17/30, 57%) attributed to inadequate blood inventories (13/29, 45%). Other barriers included lack of regular clinician education about transfusion (8/29, 28%) and sustainable financial models for the HBTS (4/29, 14%). CONCLUSION: This survey describes the status of HBTS in diverse LMICs, illustrating that the availability of blood products remains a principal problem, requiring HBTS to generate its own facilitys blood supply. Currently, blood shortages are not reported as a patient-specific adverse event making systematic tracking of delays in transfusion difficult. These findings highlight areas for further exploration related to the lack of available blood inventories for transfusions at HBTS in LMICs.","output":"Status of hospital-based blood transfusion services in low-income and middle-income countries: a cross-sectional international survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic brought dramatic changes in the delivery of primary health care across the world, presumably changing the number of consultations for infectious diseases and antibiotic use. We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on infections and antibiotic prescribing in Dutch primary care. All patients included in the routine health care database of the Julius General Practitioners' Network were followed from March through May 2019 (n = 389,708) and March through May 2020 (n = 405,688). We extracted data on consultations for respiratory/ear, urinary tract, gastrointestinal and skin infections using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) codes. These consultations were combined in disease episodes and linked to antibiotic prescriptions. The numbers of infectious disease episodes (total and those treated with antibiotics), complications, and antibiotic prescription rates (i.e., proportion of episodes treated with antibiotics) were calculated and compared between the study periods in 2019 and 2020. Fewer episodes were observed during the pandemic months than in the same months in 2019 for both the four infectious disease entities and complications such as pneumonia, mastoiditis and pyelonephritis. The largest decline was seen for gastrointestinal infections (relative risk (RR), 0.54; confidence interval (CI), 0.51 to 0.58) and skin infections (RR, 0.71; CI, 0.67 to 0.75). The number of episodes treated with antibiotics declined as well, with the largest decrease seen for respiratory/ear infections (RR, 0.54; CI, 0.52 to 0.58). The antibiotic prescription rate for respiratory/ear infections declined from 21% to 13% (difference -8.0% (CI, -8.8 to -7.2)), yet the prescription rates for other infectious disease entities remained similar or increased slightly. The decreases in primary care infectious disease episodes and antibiotic use were most pronounced in weeks 15-19, mid-COVID-19 wave, after an initial peak in respiratory/ear infection presentation in week 11, the first week of lock-down. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on the presentation of infectious disease episodes and antibiotic use in primary care in the Netherlands. Consequently, the number of infectious disease episodes treated with antibiotics decreased. We found no evidence of an increase in complications.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Antibiotic Prescribing for Common Infections in The Netherlands: A Primary Care-Based Observational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed health care, forcing providers to adopt and implement telehealth technology to provide continuous care for their patients. Amid this rapid transition from in-person to remote visits, differences in telehealth utilization have arisen among neurosurgical subspecialties. In this study, we analyze the impact of telehealth on neurosurgical healthcare delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic at our institution and highlight differences in telehealth utilization across different neurosurgical subspecialties. METHODS: To quantify differences in telehealth utilization, we analyzed all outpatient neurosurgery visits at a single academic institution. Internal surveys were administered to neurosurgeons and to patients to determine both physician and patient satisfaction with telehealth visits. Patient Likelihood-to-Recommend Press-Ganey scores were also evaluated. RESULTS: There was a decrease in outpatient visits during the COVID-19 pandemic in all neurosurgical subspecialties. Telehealth adoption was higher in spine, tumor, and interventional pain than in functional, peripheral nerve, or vascular neurosurgery. Neurosurgeons agreed that telehealth was an efficient (92%) and effective (85%) methodology; however, they noted it was more difficult to evaluate and bond with patients. The majority of patients were satisfied with their video visits and would recommend video visits over in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, neurosurgical subspecialties varied in adoption of telehealth, which may be due to the specific nature of each subspecialty and their necessity to perform in-person evaluations. Telehealth visits will likely continue after the pandemic as they can improve clinical efficiency; overall, both patients and physicians are satisfied with health care delivery over video.","output":"Telehealth Adoption Across Neurosurgical Subspecialties at a Single Academic Institution During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND More and more often, patients use online resources to increase their knowledge/confidence in conventional medicine.

Three events had a significant impact; (1) the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, (2) the death of George Floyd, which resulted in the most recent Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests, and (3) the Twitter storm, the resultant societal fallout and freedom of speech campaigns, following comments made by author JK Rowling which many deemed transphobic. These events had a differential impact on biomedical sciences, when compared to other sectors. COVID-19 resulted in a global lockdown, with higher education institutions closing campuses and moving to online-only delivery. This rapid change required radical shifts in the use of technology, with mass delivery of teaching at short notice. The BLM protests further raised awareness of the inequalities within society, particularly those experienced by Black people and other oppressed groups. As a result, there have been calls for the decolonisation of the curriculum. The implications of these three key events have led institutions to rethink their policies, teaching delivery, assessment, curricula, and physical environments. This chapter considers (1) the implications of a swift change in the primary mode of curriculum delivery within Higher Education to online formats and (2) how recent adverse events have resulted in calls for much-needed changes in visual representations within biomedical sciences. Finally, we consider (3) the role of the hidden curriculum and the potential impact of visual representations in curricula on the delivery of healthcare and the fight against health inequalities, which are often as a result of implicit biases.

We obtained from public database three SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated in XFD (XFD genomes) and adopted the leaf-dating method to calculate their expected collection dates using temporal calibrating information from other 241 genomes collected in mainland of China. All three XFD genomes were calculated to have earlier collection dates than the recorded (Bayes factor >1), and hence exhibited a lack of genetic divergence. We additionally combined the XFD genomes with other 225 genomes subsampled from those of the lineage B1.1.29, among which five sequences were also included for control analysis.

However, the role of a novel circRNA, circ_0079593, in melanoma is unclear. The expression levels of circ_0079593 and miR-516b were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation was measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and cell migration and invasion were evaluated using transwell assay. Meanwhile, western blot (WB) analysis was employed to determine the levels of proliferation and metastasis-related proteins, as well as metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3) protein. Furthermore, cell apoptosis was tested by detecting the cell apoptosis rate and Caspase-3 activity. The glucose consumption and lactate production of cells were measured to evaluate cell glucose metabolism. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter assay and biotin-labeled RNA pull-down assay were used to confirm the interaction between miR-516b and circ_0079593 or GRM3. In addition, mice xenograft models were constructed to explore the effect of circ_0079593 on melanoma tumor growth in vivo. Our results discovered that circ_0079593 was highly expressed in melanoma, and its silencing suppressed melanoma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, glucose metabolism and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, we found that circ_0079593 could serve as a sponge of miR-516b, and miR-516b could target GRM3 in melanoma. The rescue experiments revealed that both miR-516b inhibitor and GRM3 overexpression could reverse the inhibition effect of circ_0079593 knockdown on melanoma progression. Additionally, in vivo experiments also revealed that circ_0079593 interference suppressed melanoma tumor growth.

While filoviruses infect diverse mammalian cell lines, we report that cells from African straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) are refractory to EBOV infection.

We found signatures of positive selection in bat NPC1 concentrated at the virus-receptor interface, with the strongest signal at the same residue that controls EBOV infection in Eidolon helvum cells. Our work identifies NPC1 as a genetic determinant of filovirus susceptibility in bats, and suggests that some NPC1 variations reflect host adaptations to reduce filovirus replication and virulence.

RESULTS PSH was present in 27 of 113 patients (24%). Extravasation of contrast agent was observed during intervention in only 6 of 27 cases (22%). There was consecutive haemorrhagic transformation in four patients with PSH (p = 0.209, Fisher's exact test). Preinterventional predictors for the occurrence of PSH in our series were a long interval between clinical onset and recanalization (p = 0.028), a long procedure time (p = 0.010), and a high number of recanalization attempts (p = 0.001).

Four online surveys were conducted using a repeated cross-sectional design. Two surveys were conducted during epidemics/seasons of avian influenza, seasonal influenza, and common cold in 2006 (n = 387) and 2016 (n = 370) and two surveys during nonepidemic/off-season times for the three diseases in 2009 (n = 792) during a swine flu outbreak and in 2018 (n = 422) during no outbreak of zoonotic influenza. While on average participants felt less at risk than others, indicating an optimistic bias, risk perceptions matched the magnitude of risk associated with the three infectious diseases. Importantly, a significant three-way interaction indicated dynamic accuracy in risk perceptions: Participants felt more at risk for seasonal influenza and common cold during influenza and cold seasons, compared with off-season times. However, these dynamic increases were more pronounced in the perceived risk for others than for oneself (optimistic bias).

However, this report did not mention chronic kidney disease (CKD) nor did it provide information on the relevance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or albuminuria. As the disease spread across the globe, information on larger populations with greater granularity on risk factors emerged. The recently published OpenSAFELY project analysed factors associated with COVID-19 death in 17 million patients. The picture that arose differs significantly from initial reports. For example, hypertension is not an independent risk factor for COVID-19 death [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.89], but renal disease very much is. Dialysis (aHR 3.69), organ transplantation (aHR 3.53) and CKD (aHR 2.52 for patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) represent three of the four comorbidities associated with the highest mortality risk from COVID-19. The risk associated with CKD Stages 4 and 5 is higher than the risk associated with diabetes mellitus (aHR range 1.31C1.95, depending upon glycaemic control) or chronic heart disease (aHR 1.17). In another recent publication, the Global Burden of Disease collaboration identified that worldwide, CKD is the most prevalent risk factor for severe COVID-19. Moreover, the distribution of risk factors for COVID-19 mortality appears to be different in patients with CKD when compared with the general population. The high prevalence of CKD in combination with the elevated risk of mortality from COVID-19 in CKD necessitates urgent action for this group of patients.

This uncharted territory has changed the practices in modern healthcare delivery; this is particularly true in the case of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) where various changes are being adopted. This survey was conducted to determine the impact of the pandemic and the changes being adopted in the field of MIS, from a resource-limited developing country, India. Materials and Methods The survey was carried out from 27 July to 22 August 2020, amongst MIS surgeons in India using an online questionnaire generated on Google Forms. Results The survey was completed by 251 MIS surgeons nationwide. There was a proportional reduction of overall elective surgeries and MIS. Approximately 30% of the surgeons continued to use MIS, as during the pre-pandemic era. Pre-operative tests for COVID-19 (96.1%) and personal protective equipment (PPE, 66%-86%), including respirators (95.2%), are used uniformly across the nation. Almost half (43.1%) of the MIS surgeons are using 6 recommended intraoperative modifications in MIS to mitigate the COVID-19 transmission. Conclusion MIS surgeons in India have adapted within a short time to the challenge of the pandemic by embracing pre-operative testing, PPE and new techniques/technologies to continue patient care. Innovations and low-cost indigenous customisations are the need of the hour for a developing country like India.

This ability is generally beneficial to viruses as it allows them to evade host immune responses, evolve new behaviours, and exploit ecological niches. However, natural selection typically generates adaptation in response to the immediate selection pressures that a virus experiences in its current host. Consequently, we argue that some viruses, particularly those characterised by long durations of infection and ongoing replication, may be susceptible to short-sighted evolution, whereby a virus adaptation to its current host will be detrimental to its onward transmission within the host population. Here we outline the concept of short-sighted viral evolution and provide examples of how it may negatively impact viral transmission among hosts. We also propose that viruses that are vulnerable to short-sighted evolution may exhibit strategies that minimise its effects. We speculate on the various mechanisms by which this may be achieved, including viral life history strategies that result in low rates of within-host evolution, or the establishment of a germline lineage of viruses that avoids short-sighted evolution.

To ensure high production through effective decision-making and auditable standards, producers are required to have better traceability and record systems. Therefore, this study aimed at (1) reviewing the current recording/data management and animal traceability systems used by small-scale farmers in developing countries and (2) analyzing how data management systems should be designed to enhance efficient decision-making and animal traceability from farm to fork. This study found that, still, a majority of small-scale farmers do not keep records leading to poor decision-making on the farm and policymaking. We also found that those who keep records do not store their data in electronic format, which again poses another challenge in data analysis. Moreover, this study found that the majority of traceability tools used by farmers in developing countries do not meet international standards based on tools they use for tracing animals; farmers were reported to use tools like branding and ear tagging, which provide very little information about the animal. Such tools lack the capability to keep track of useful information about an animal, e.g., information about feeding and animal health. In conclusion, this study recommended a better electronic system to be used at the farm level to facilitate data analysis, hence promoting informed decision-making and adherence to the international animal traceability standards. Otherwise, there is a need for researchers to conduct more studies in developing different analytical models for exploring on-farm data in order to improve the decision-making process by farmers and other stakeholders.","output":"How Information Communication Technology Can Enhance Evidence-Based Decisions and Farm-to-Fork Animal Traceability for Livestock Farmers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early recognition and referral of patients with worsening respiratory function while on conventional oxygen support therapies such as nasal cannula, simple facemask or mask with reservoir bags is important to ensure timely and safe escalation of respiratory support.

Transmission of Variola is by respiratory droplets, and MVA delivered by skin scarification (s.s.) protected mice far more effectively against lethal respiratory challenge with VACV than any other route of delivery, and at much lower doses. Comparisons of s.s. with intradermal, subcutaneous or intramuscular routes showed that MVAOVA s.s.-generated T cells were both more abundant and transcriptionally distinct. MVAOVA s.s. produced greater numbers of lung Ova-specific CD8+ TRM and was superior in protecting mice against lethal VACVOVA respiratory challenge. Nearly as many lung TRM were generated with MVAOVA s.s. compared to direct pulmonary immunization with MVAOVA, and both routes vaccination protected mice against lethal pulmonary challenge with VACVOVA. Strikingly, MVAOVA s.s.-generated effector T cells exhibited overlapping gene transcriptional profiles to those generated via direct pulmonary immunization. Overall, our data suggest that heterologous MVA vectors delivered via s.s. are uniquely well-suited as vaccine vectors for respiratory pathogens like COVID-19.

Soon, it was realized that this antigen was the envelope protein (HBV surface antigen, HBsAg), and it was purified from HBV-containing human plasma. Later, it was produced in genetically engineered yeast cells. The excellent efficacy of the HBsAg vaccine was confirmed in numerous studies, particularly in newborns from HBV-infected mothers who almost always become chronic HBV carriers without vaccination. But the vaccine is also highly effective in older children and adults and has been applied worldwide since 1984, leading to a circa tenfold decrease of HBV infections in the vaccinated. Still, there are several challenges with hepatitis B vaccination. In newborns from mothers with very high virus load, the vaccine may fail. Recipients who are immunocompromised, older, smokers, or obese may not produce protective antibodies. Early studies suggested that the vaccine with HBsAg subtype adw2 also protected against infections by other subtypes, but recent observations show that the protection is weaker against heterologous subtypes. Occasionally, escape mutations may develop. Most current HB vaccines are based on the knowledge of 40 years ago and could be significantly improved. Inclusion of the currently neglected preS domains in the HBV envelope would add the most important protective T? and B?cell epitopes to the vaccines. Expression of the HBsAg in mammalian cell cultures would enhance the folding of neutralizing HBsAg epitopes. Use of the regionally prevalent HBsAg subtypes would increase the protection.

We assessed the 6-month effect of a nutritional support provided to children living with HIV, followed in a multicentric cohort in West Africa. METHODS In 2014-2016, a nutritional intervention was carried out for children living with HIV, aged under 10 years, receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) or not, in five HIV pediatric cohorts, in Benin, Togo and C?te d'Ivoire. Weight deficiency was assessed using two definitions: wasting (Weight for Height Z-score [WHZ] for children<5 years old or Body-Mass-Index for Age [BAZ] for 5 years) and underweight (Weight for Age Z-score [WAZ]) (WHO child growth standards). Combining these indicators, three categories of nutritional support were defined: 1/ children with severe malnutrition (WAZ and/or WHZ/BAZ <-3 Standard Deviations [SD]) were supported with Ready-To-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF), 2/ those with moderate malnutrition (WAZ and/or WHZ/BAZ = [-3;-2[ SD) were supported with fortified blended flours produced locally in each country, 3/ those non malnourished (WAZ and WHZ/BAZ -2 SD) received nutritional counselling only. Children were followed monthly over 6 months. Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) using a 24h recall was measured at the first and last visit of the intervention. RESULTS Overall, 326 children were included, 48% were girls. At baseline, 66% were aged 5-10 years, 91% were on ART, and 17% were severely immunodeficient (CD4 <250 cells/mL or CD4%<15). Twenty-nine (9%) were severely malnourished, 63 (19%) moderately malnourished and 234 (72%) non-malnourished. After 6 months, 9/29 (31%) and 31/63 (48%) recovered from severe and moderate malnutrition respectively. The median DDS was 8 (IQR 7-9) in C?te d'Ivoire and Togo, 6 (IQR 6-7) in Benin. Mean DDS was 4.3/9 (sd 1.2) at first visit, with a lower score in Benin, but with no difference between first and last visit (p=0.907), nor by intervention groups (p-value=0.767).

We utilize a combination of news articles and press releases, sheriffs department Facebook posts, publicly available jail data, courtroom observations, in-depth interviews with those who have been held in rural jails, and interviews with rural law enforcement staff to explore this theme. As elected officials, rural sheriffs are beholden to populations that include many who are suspicious of science, liberal agendas, and anything that might threaten what they see as individual freedom. At the same time, they expect local law enforcement to employ punitive measures to control perceived criminal activity in their communities. These communities are often tightly knit, cohesive, and isolated, with high levels of social support both for community members and local leaders, including sheriffs and law enforcement. This complex social context often puts rural sheriffs and law enforcement officers in difficult positions. Given the multiple cross-pressures that rural justice systems faced in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we explore the circumstances in which they attempted to protect and advocate for the health and safety of both their incarcerated and their nonincarcerated populations. We find that certain characteristics of rural communities both help and hinder local law enforcement in efforts to combat the virus, but these characteristics typically favor informal norms of social control to govern community health.

Here we studied the effects of the active compound NHC 5'-triphosphate (NHC-TP) against the purified SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex. The efficiency of incorporation of natural nucleotides over the efficiency of incorporation of NHC-TP into model RNA substrates followed the order GTP (12,841) > ATP (424) > UTP (171) > CTP (30), indicating that NHC-TP competes predominantly with CTP for incorporation. No significant inhibition of RNA synthesis was noted as a result of the incorporated monophosphate (NHC-MP) in the RNA primer strand. When embedded in the template strand, NHC-MP supported formation of both NHC:G and NHC:A base pairs with similar efficiencies. The extension of the NHC:G product was modestly inhibited, but higher nucleotide concentrations could overcome this blockage. In contrast, the NHC:A base pair led to the observed G to A (G:NHC:A) or C to U (C:G:NHC:A:U) mutations.

Exposure to respiratory droplets can theoretically be reduced by surgical mask usage. However, there is a lack of experimental evidence supporting surgical mask usage for prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: We used a well-established golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model. We placed SARS-CoV-2-challenged index hamsters and na?ve hamsters into closed system units each comprising two different cages separated by a polyvinyl chloride air porous partition with unidirectional airflow within the isolator. The effect of a surgical mask partition placed in between the cages was investigated. Besides clinical scoring, hamster specimens were tested for viral load, histopathology, and viral nucleocapsid antigen expression. RESULTS: Non-contact transmission was found in 66.7% (10/15) of exposed na?ve hamsters. Surgical mask partition for challenged index or na?ve hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25% (6/24, P=0.018). Surgical mask partition for challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission to only 16.7% (2/12, P=0.019) of exposed na?ve hamsters. Unlike the severe COVID-19 manifestations of challenged hamsters, infected na?ve hamsters had lower clinical scores, milder histopathological changes, and lower viral nucleocapsid antigen expression in respiratory tract tissues.

The academic workload on students can cause exhaustion, similar to that of a worker. The Maslach Burnout Inventory\\\\ Student Survey (MBI\\\\SS) was designed to reflect student burnout by evaluation of emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and academic efficacy. It has been reported that at least half of the students will suffer burnout at some point in their medical studies. Burnout evaluation has been focused on physicians or those working in hospitals attending coronavirus patients. The psychological burden and pressures on students due to the closure of facilities and schools around the world has not been thoroughly evaluated. The objective was to evaluate the prevalence of burnout in medical students during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross\\\\sectional, prospective, and descriptive study was performed. The MBI\\\\SS was applied during the spring semester to all anatomy students of one of the largest medical schools in Mexico. The study was previously reviewed and approved by the Ethics and Research Committees to be answered anonymously and voluntarily. Results were classified as low, moderate, or high in emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and academic effectiveness. RESULTS: A total of 154 students participated in the survey, with a mean age of 18.9 years, 60.4% (n = 93) were women. Based on the MBI\\\\SS definition, 14.9% (n = 23) were identified with symptoms of burnout. There was also a high prevalence of emotional exhaustion (53.9% n = 83), cynicism (16.9% n = 26), and low academic effectiveness (34.4% n = 53). Men were statistically more prevalent towards lower academic effectiveness (p = 0.037) and increased cynicism (p = 0.003), as well as a higher incidence of burnout (26.6% vs 7.5%, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Burnout prevalence among medical students has been reported as high as 46% during the pandemic, however different types of surveys have been used. A previous study using the same survey reported a prevalence of 5.2% for moderate burnout syndrome, in a similar population which could indicate the COVID\\\\19 pandemic as an influencing factor.

However, the hallmarks of the disease are eosinophilia, chronic sinusitis, and asthma. Vasculitic organ involvement might be absent early on, making the diagnosis challenging1. We present the case of a patient with atypical presentation and serology for EGPA. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old male with a history of non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, chronic sinusitis, and peripheral eosinophilia (peak 936 cells/uL;17.6%) was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea and rapidly progressive acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring transfer to the intensive care unit. He was started on high flow nasal cannula (60LPM;FiO2 90%-100%). Bilateral crackles noted with no pitting edema. Chest CT showed bilateral airspace disease and ground glass opacities. He tested negative twice for SARS-CoV-2. White blood cell count, kidney function, and brain natriuretic peptide were normal. Autoimmune workup was ordered. He was started on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic, and gently diuresed. As his presentation was suggestive of eosinophilic lung disease, and in light of significant oxygen requirement, the decision was made to hold on bronchoscopy and start solumedrol at 125mg/day. On ICU Day 3, autoimmune workup showed elevated anti-nuclear antibody titer of 1:160 with a speckled pattern, elevated anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody titer of 49.4 (p-ANCA), and elevated anti-proteinase-3 (anti-PR3) antibody titers of 18.8 (c-ANCA). Infectious workup was negative. The patient was diagnosed with possible EGPA. He was started on cyclophosphamide in addition to steroids. Oxygen requirement continued to improve. He was discharged home on oxygen at 4LPM and oral steroid with a plan for monthly cyclophosphamide infusion. Follow-up in 2 months with repeat chest CT showed marked improvement. DISCUSSION: The manifestations of EGPA are dynamic, with a few manifestations presenting earlier than others2. With the temporal spacing of signs and symptoms, it is often diagnosed late when more clues are evident. In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) established a set of 6 criteria: asthma, peripheral eosinophilia >10%, mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy, migratory pulmonary infiltrates, paranasal sinus abnormality, and biopsy containing blood vessel with extravascular eosinophils2. At least 4 out of six of these criteria must be met to have a diagnosis of EGPA with a specificity of 99.7%. p-ANCA (anti-MPO) is present in around 70% of patients with active EGPA, whereas c-ANCA (anti-PR3) is nearly absent3. Our patient met 3 out of the 6 criteria, and his serology was atypical, showing high titers for both p-ANCA and c-ANCA. CONCLUSIONS: EGPA diagnosis in our patient was not a robust one. However, establishing a presumed diagnosis early and starting immunosuppressive therapy likely saved his life. REFERENCE #1: Guillevin L, Cohen P, Gayraud M, et al. Churg-Strauss syndrome.

Persons can do many of them in bed (Full-Body in-Bed Gym), and hospitalized patients can learn this light training before leaving the hospital. It is, indeed, an extension of well-established cardiovascular-respiratory rehabilitation training performed after heavy surgical interventions.

We review advances and new questions on the use of statins in FH. RECENT FINDINGS: Cumulative evidence from registry data and sub-analyses of clinical trials mandates the value of statin therapy for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in FH. Statins are safe in children and adolescents with FH, with longer term cardiovascular benefits. The potentially toxic effects of statins in pregnancy need to be considered, but no association has been reported in prospective cohort studies with birth defects. There is no rationale for discontinuation of statins in elderly FH unless indicated by adverse events. FH is undertreated, with > 80% of statin-treated FH patients failing to attain LDL cholesterol treatment targets. This may relate to adherence, tolerability, and genetic differences in statin responsiveness. Statin treatment from childhood may reduce the need for stringent cholesterol targets. Combination of statins with ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors significantly improves the efficacy of treatment. Whether statin use could improve the clinical course of FH patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory infections remains an unsolved issue for future research. Statins are the mainstay for primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD in FH. Sustained long-term optimal statin treatment from an early age can effectively prevent ASCVD over decades of life. Despite their widespread use, statins merit further investigation in FH.","output":"The Knowns and Unknowns of Contemporary Statin Therapy for Familial Hypercholesterolemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction & Objectives: Indwelling ureteric stents are valuable devices used in emergency drainage of upper urinary tract obstruction due to ureteric stones. However, stents can cause significant morbidity with infections, encrustations and blockages. In the study we look at the outcomes of pre-operative stent dwell time on infectious complications following ureteroscopy and laser fragmentation (URSL). Materials & Methods: Data was retrospectively collected for outcomes of URSL from 3 European endourology centres for patients with preoperative indwelling ureteric stents. We included data for patient details, stone demographics, operative details, stone free rate (SFR), outcomes and complications between 2011 and 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the stent dwell time: group 1 (<6 months) and group 2 (6 months). Descriptive statistics were used to determine the rate of early post-operative infectious complications (defined as the presence of fever?) and ICU access. Binomial logistic regression analysis were used to explore the relationship between stent dwelling time and post-operative early infectious complications. (SPSS v.24). Results: There were 501 patients undergoing URSL in the study period, with 429 and 72 patients in groups 1 and 2 respectively (Table 1). The mean age and operative time in groups 1 and 2 were 7130 years and 6422 years, and 5128 minutes and 5931 minutes respectively. Infectious complications and ICU admissions were seen in 32 (8%) and 3 (0.7%), and 22 (31%) and 1 (1.4%) in groups 1 and 2 respectively. Stent dwell time of 6 months carried significantly higher risk for febrile UTI post URSL (RR=5.45, 95% CI: 2.94-10.10, p<0.001). (Table Presented) Conclusions: Although the overall risk of infectious complication rates from URSL were low, longer indwelling stent time significantly increases the risk of post-operative infections, of which a small proportion of patients end up in ICU. We would recommend having the stent dwell time as short as possible and not to exceed a 6 months time period, and our findings will help prioritise these patients in the post-COVID era.","output":"Post-ureteroscopy febrile urinary tract infections are linked to pre-operative stent dwell time: Results from three European endourology centres"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been a world concern since December 2019. The knowledge about vertical transmission and fetal morbidity and mortality from maternal COVID-19 infection is limited.We detected an increase in the number of cases of term and near-term neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Methods and results: We collected data on all newborns with PPHN born between 2018 and 2020. We excluded premature infants (<34+0 weeks) and infants with other significant pathology or genetic syndromes. Compared to 5 cases of PPHN of 22930 live births in 2018, and 6 cases of PPHN of 22270 live births in 2019 (2-year average 0.02%, 95% CI 0.013%- 0.043%), there were 16 PPHN cases from 22323 live births in 2020 (0.07%, 95% CI 0.044%-0.12%), a 3 fold increase (p<0.01). We report 5 cases of term and near-term neonates born to mothers who had highly suspected (2) and PCR proven (3) COVID-19 infection during the third trimester of pregnancy, who presented with PPHN during COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. All had otherwise unexplained pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and dilatation. Two patients needed endotracheal intubation, one was supported by nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) without intubation, two needed O2 support by nasal cannula only ant two newborns (one of them was intubated) needed Nitric oxide (NO) as pulmonary vasodilator therapy. No patient required Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or died, and no prolonged residual cardiovascular or pulmonary morbidity was recorded during a median follow up of 4.8 months (range 4-6 months). Conclusions: The increase in the incidence of PPHN during the COVID- 19 pandemic, and the cases presented, suggest an intrauterine effect of maternal COVID-19 infection on the fetal pulmonary circulation. It is possible that the maternal infection affected the fetal pulmonary vascular resistance, or altered the normal decline in the resistance after birth. The right ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation with reduced function may be secondary to this hypothetical increased afterload or a direct effect of the infection. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the pathogenesis and clinical implications of this phenomenon.","output":"Increased incidence of Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn following third trimester maternal COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the fall of Taliban regime in 2001, the government of Afghanistan, in a bid to promote human rights and specifically womens rights, made several legislative and institutional advances.

They represent the economy as a collection of forward-looking actors whose behaviours combine, possibly with stochastic effects, to determine global variables (such as prices) in a dynamic equilibrium. However, standard semi-analytical techniques for solving these models make it difficult to include the important effects of heterogeneous economic actors. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of heterogeneity, for example in age and sector of employment, in macroeconomic outcomes and the need for models that can more easily incorporate it. We use techniques from reinforcement learning to solve such models incorporating heterogeneous agents in a way that is simple, extensible, and computationally efficient. We demonstrate the method's accuracy and stability on a toy problem for which there is a known analytical solution, its versatility by solving a general equilibrium problem that includes global stochasticity, and its flexibility by solving a combined macroeconomic and epidemiological model to explore the economic and health implications of a pandemic.

We compared the period before versus after March 15, 2020, regarding average proportion of days per week at which each end point was reported and average proportion of anal sex acts covered by PrEP and/or condoms. RESULTS: We included data from 136 men who have sex with men. After March 15, 2020, the proportion of days with anal sex increased with SPs [odds ratio (OR) = 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10 to 1.44) and decreased with KCPs (OR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.64 to 0.82) and UCPs (OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.61). Shifts in partner types were most profound immediately after March 15, 2020, whereas returning to prerestriction levels mid-May 2020. The proportion of days with PrEP use decreased from 74% before to 58% after March 15, 2020 (P < 0.001). After March 15, 2020, PrEP use during sex decreased with UCPs ( = ?0.36; 95% CI = ?0.72 to 0.00) but not with SPs and KCPs.

We used R program version 3.6.3 for analysis. In our analysis, 3219 outbreaks with 22 238 individuals were included. About 48% were in household and hobby-related settings. Care homes accounted for 9.5% of outbreaks and 21.6% of cases. The median age across all settings was 43 (interquartile range (IQR) 24C63). The median age of cases in care homes was 81 (IQR 56C88). Of all reported cases in care homes, 72.1% were women. Over 30% (466/1511) of hospitalisations were among cases in care homes compared to 17.7% (268/1511) in households. Overall, 70% (500/715) of all deceased persons in outbreaks in the study period were in care homes compared to 4.2% in household settings (30/715). We observed an exponential increase in the number of notified outbreaks starting around the 41st week with N = 291 outbreaks reported in week 49.

The DNA sequence obtained by sequencing was used for further analysis. In silico analysis identified the fragment identity, subcellular localization, and phylogenetic construction of the R. trisperma FAD2 cDNA fragment and Euphorbiaceae. The results showed that a 923-bp partial sequence of R. trisperma FAD2 was successfully isolated. Based on in silico analysis, FAD2 was predicted to encode 260 amino acids, had a domain similarity with Omega-6 fatty acid desaturase, and was located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

We compared clinical outcomes and biomarkers in a Turkish cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 who were treated with the institution's standard of care (SOC), either alone or in combination with IVIG. Methods: : Data from COVID-19 patients treated in two intensive care units at the University hospital of Istanbul was analyzed retrospectively. Patients received preliminary SOC according to the institution's treatment algorithm, to which Octagam 5% at 30 g/day for 5 days was added in one of the two wards. Both groups were compared regarding baseline characteristics, survival, and changes in inflammation markers (C-reactive protein=CRP, ferritin, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, D?dimer, leukocytes). Imbalance in baseline APACHE II scores was addressed by propensity-score-matching;otherwise Kaplan-Meier and multiple logistic regression models were used. Results: : Data from 93 patients was analyzed, 51 had received IVIG and 42 had not. About 75% of patients were male and both groups had comparable body mass index (BMI) and blood group distribution. IVIG-treated patients were younger (means 65 vs. 71 years) and had slightly lower baseline disease scores (APACHE II: 20.6 vs. 22.4;SOFA: 5.0 vs. 7.0). Overall survival (OS) was 61% in the IVIG and 38% in the control group. After controlling for imbalances at baseline, there was still a trend for better OS (OR: 2.2, 95%CI: 0.9-5.4, p=0.091) and a significantly longer median survival time with IVIG (68 vs. 18 days, p=0.014). IVIG significantly reduced CRP levels, but had no relevant effect on other inflammation markers. Conclusion: Adjunct treatment with IVIG might add to the COVID-19 armamentarium, but results need to be confirmed in a randomized, controlled trial.","output":"Effects of Intravenous Immunoglobulin on the Course of Severe COVID-19: Results From a Retrospective Data Analysis of a Patient Cohort in Turkey Treated With or Without Octagam?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been observed in temporal association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), typically within 2 to 6 weeks of illness or exposure.

Demographics, aneurysm characteristics, treatment modality, intraprocedural hemorrhagic and thromboembolic events, 30-day neurological events, and follow-up angiographic studies were recorded. RESULTS From December 1996 to April 2013, 292 patients underwent endovascular treatment of 346 MCA aneurysms. Of these, 341 (98.6%) were successfully completed. Balloon neck remodeling was used in 230 procedures (66.5%). Ninety-five procedures (27.4%) were for ruptured aneurysms. The rate of intraprocedural hemorrhage was 2.6% (9 of 346). The overall rate of intraprocedural thromboembolic events was 13.6% (47 of 346), significantly more common in patients with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (27.4%; P < .001). The 30-day major (modified Rankin Scale score > 2) neurological event rate was 2.9% (10 of 346), significantly more common in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (8.4%) compared with those without (0.8%; P < .001).

The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at an Iranian referral pediatrics hospital and to compare these parameters between hospitalized patients with and without severe disease, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and children with acute COVID-19, as well as deceased and discharged cases. METHODS: This study included hospitalized children and adolescents ( 18 years) with suspected COVID-19 who had positive results for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Among the 262 patients with suspected COVID-19, 142 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included in the study. A total of 11 children were diagnosed as MIS-C. The majority of the cases with MIS-C were male, (n = 9, 82%) which is significantly higher than children (n = 61, 47%) with acute COVID-19 (P = 0.03). Fifty patients (35%) were shown to have a more severe form of COVID-19. Ninety percent of the cases (n = 45) with severe COVID-19 had comorbidities that was significantly higher than cases with non-severe or mild disease (n = 41, 45%; P < 0.0001). A mortality rate of 10% was reported (n = 14). Ninety-three percent of the deceased cases (n = 13) had comorbidities that were significantly higher than discharged patients (n = 73, 57%; P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: The increasing number of children with severe COVID-19 is cause for great concern. Underlying diseases, mainly cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and malignancies, are associated with greater risk of development of severe COVID-19 and even death in children. On the other hand, pediatric patients with MIS-C usually develop a milder form of the disease.

The search used a combination of subject words and free words. The search terms included Tai Chi, Qigong, Baduanjin, Yoga, Pilates, Cancer, Meta-analysis, and Systematic review. Two researchers independently performed literature screening and data extraction and used AMSTAR scale and PRISMA statement to evaluate the methodology and the quality of the evidence. RESULTS: A total of 26 SR/MAs were included. The AMSTAR scale score was 5C10 points, with an average of 7.461.33 points. Overall, the methodological quality was considered to be moderate.

RESULTS Of 107 sites, 65 (61%) respondents completed the survey. Respondents estimated a 1% positivity rate of 1198 newborns tested for COVID-19. Most sites (86%) performed universal maternal COVID-19 testing, and most (82%) tested newborns of COVID-19-positive mothers at 24 hours of life (75%). Infection prevention and visitation policies varied. Of respondents, in COVID-19-positive mothers, 28% permitted no visitors, 54% recommended rooming-in with the newborn, 55% encouraged breastfeeding at the breast, 38% deferred routine circumcisions of the newborn, 74% initiated immediate bathing of the newborn, 68% continued standard newborn screening, and 55% modified newborn follow-up plans. Medical directors reported adjustments to rounding and teaching workflow. Content analysis of free-text responses revealed themes related to challenges with changing recommendations, discomfort with mother-infant separation recommendations, innovations, and stress management. CONCLUSIONS Well-newborn units quickly adopted universal maternal testing and testing of exposed newborns. Despite guidelines, we identified variation in the care of newborns of COVID-19-positive mothers. Further investigation of these differences and newborn outcomes is warranted to develop best practices.","output":"Well-Newborn Unit Director Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A BORN Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Public health authorities have been recommending interventions such as physical distancing and face masks, to curtail the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the community. Public perceptions toward such interventions should be identified to enable public health authorities to effectively address valid concerns. The Health Belief Model (HBM) has been used to characterize user-generated content from social media during previous outbreaks, with the aim of understanding the health behaviors of the public. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at developing and evaluating deep learning-based text classification models for classifying social media content posted during the COVID-19 outbreak, using the four key constructs of the HBM. We will specifically focus on content related to the physical distancing interventions put forth by public health authorities. We intend to test the model with a real-world case study. METHODS: The data set for this study was prepared by analyzing Facebook comments that were posted by the public in response to the COVID-19-related posts of three public health authorities: the Ministry of Health of Singapore (MOH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Public Health England. The comments made in the context of physical distancing were manually classified with a Yes/No flag for each of the four HBM constructs: perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived barriers, and perceived benefits. Using a curated data set of 16,752 comments, gated recurrent unit-based recurrent neural network models were trained and validated for text classification. Accuracy and binary cross-entropy loss were used to evaluate the model. Specificity, sensitivity, and balanced accuracy were used to evaluate the classification results in the MOH case study. RESULTS: The HBM text classification models achieved mean accuracy rates of 0.92, 0.95, 0.91, and 0.94 for the constructs of perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers, respectively. In the case study with MOH Facebook comments, specificity was above 96% for all HBM constructs. Sensitivity was 94.3% and 90.9% for perceived severity and perceived benefits, respectively. In addition, sensitivity was 79.6% and 81.5% for perceived susceptibility and perceived barriers, respectively. The classification models were able to accurately predict trends in the prevalence of the constructs for the time period examined in the case study. CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning-based text classifiers developed in this study help to determine public perceptions toward physical distancing, using the four key constructs of HBM. Health officials can make use of the classification model to characterize the health behaviors of the public through the lens of social media. In future studies, we intend to extend the model to study public perceptions of other important interventions by public health authorities.","output":"Use of Health Belief Model-Based Deep Learning Classifiers for COVID-19 Social Media Content to Examine Public Perceptions of Physical Distancing: Model Development and Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The analysis of human resources and sustainable innovation through organizational variables is useful, albeit limited, for predicting complex interactions for sustainability development in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) This paper seeks to overcome this limitation, proposing three models with variables at two levels, namely, for the development of creativity (individual level) and sustainable product innovation performance (organizational level) and sustainability development Theoretical models are tested using the Structural Equations Model It is posited that knowledge, motivation, and relationships (individual level) may be predictors of creativity In addition, creativity is analyzed as a mediator between human resources and sustainable product innovation performance In this way, it is easier for SMEs to detect on which aspects of HR they should place greater emphasis for sustainable product innovation performance (PIP), with the purpose of reducing the ones associated with the Covid-19 crisis and obtaining a sustainable world Information was obtained through an online questionnaire involving a sample of 245 certified innovative Spanish SMEs The results support major findings: (a) knowledge, (b) motivation, and (c) relationships have a positive impact on creativity;(d) the three models hold that creativity fully mediates human resources and sustainable product innovation performance The paper contributes to the literature on the human resources and sustainable product innovation performance by adopting a multidisciplinary approach, as well as by analyzing variables on two levels, measuring the most internal aspects of employees (wishes, emotions, ideas, or feelings), and explaining the mediating role of employee creativity","output":"Contributions to Sustainability in SMEs: Human Resources, Sustainable Product Innovation Performance and the Mediating Role of Employee Creativity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unprecedented scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed an intense effort of the global scientific community to unravel different aspects of the disease in a short time.

The best strategy is to provide early intervention to stop the spread of the disease. In general, Computer Tomography (CT) is used to detect tumors in pneumonia, lungs, tuberculosis, emphysema, or other pleura (the membrane covering the lungs) diseases. Disadvantages of CT imaging system are: inferior soft tissue contrast compared to MRI as it is X-ray-based Radiation exposure. Lung CT image segmentation is a necessary initial step for lung image analysis. The main challenges of segmentation algorithms exaggerated due to intensity in-homogeneity, presence of artifacts, and closeness in the gray level of different soft tissue. The goal of this paper is to design and evaluate an automatic tool for automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection segmentation and measurement using chest CT images. The extensive computer simulations show better efficiency and flexibility of this end-to-end learning approach on CT image segmentation with image enhancement comparing to the state of the art segmentation approaches, namely GraphCut, Medical Image Segmentation (MIS), and Watershed.

DESCRIPTION: CRFs for women aged 15C44 years with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were linked to birth and fetal death certificates for pregnancies completed during January 1CDecember 31, 2020 in Illinois and Tennessee. Among linked records, pregnancy was considered confirmed for women with a SARS-CoV-2 specimen collection date on or prior to the delivery date. Sensitivity of the COVID-19 CRF pregnancy field was calculated by dividing the number of confirmed pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection with pregnancy indicated on the CRF by the number of confirmed pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. ASSESSMENT: Among 4276 (Illinois) and 2070 (Tennessee) CRFs that linked with a birth or fetal death certificate, CRF pregnancy field sensitivity was 45.3% and 42.1%, respectively. In both states, sensitivity varied significantly by maternal race/ethnicity, insurance, trimester of prenatal care entry, month of specimen collection, and trimester of specimen collection.

This study aimed to evaluate the waste burden of neurointerventional procedures performed in a radiology department, identify areas for waste reduction, and motivate new greening initiatives. METHODS: We performed a waste audit of 17 neurointerventional procedures at a tertiary-referral center over a 3-month period. Waste was categorized into five streams: general waste, clinical waste, recyclable plastic, recyclable paper, and sharps. Our radiology department started recycling soft plastics from 13 December 2019. Hence, an additional recyclable soft plastic waste stream was added from this time point. The weight of each waste stream was measured using a digital weighing scale. RESULTS: We measured the waste from seven cerebral digital subtraction angiograms (DSA), six mechanical thrombectomies (MT), two aneurysm-coiling procedures, one coiling with tumour embolization, and one dural arteriovenous fistula embolization procedure. In total, the 17 procedures generated 135.3 kg of waste: 85.5 kg (63.2%) clinical waste, 28.0 kg (20.7%) general waste, 14.7 kg (10.9%) recyclable paper, 3.5 kg (2.6%) recyclable plastic, 2.2 kg (1.6%) recyclable soft plastic, and 1.4 kg (1.0%) of sharps. An average of 8 kg of waste was generated per case. Coiling cases produced the greatest waste burden (13.1 kg), followed by embolization (10.3 kg), MT (8.8 kg), and DSA procedures (5.1 kg). CONCLUSION: Neurointerventional procedures generate a substantial amount of waste, an average of 8 kg per case.

However, good uptake is hard to achieve, and our current approaches are failing to engage the most vulnerable.

The present aim was to propose an Integrated Screening Action Model (I-SAM) to improve screening access. The I-SAM synthesises existing models of health behaviour and empirical evidence. The I-SAM was developed following: i) an appraisal of the predominant models used within the screening literature; ii) the integration of the latest knowledge on behaviour change; with iii) the empirical literature, to inform the development of a theory-based approach to intervention development. There are three key aspects to the I-SAM: i) a sequence of stages that people pass through in engaging in screening behaviour (based on the Precaution Adoption Process Model); ii) screening behaviour is shaped by the interaction between participant and environmental influences (drawing from the Access Framework); and iii) targets for intervention should focus on the sources of behaviour - capability, opportunity, and motivation (based on the COM-B Model). The I-SAM proposes an integrated model to support our understanding of screening behaviour and to identify targets for intervention.

Brominated indoles derived from the Australian marine mollusk Dicathais orbita (D. orbita) are of interest for their anti-inflammatory properties. This study evaluates the binding mechanism and potentiality of several brominated indoles (tyrindoxyl sulfate, tyrindoleninone, 6-bromoisatin, and 6,6-dibromoindirubin) against inflammatory mediators cyclooxygenases-1/2 (COX-1/2) using molecular docking, followed by molecular dynamics simulation, along with physicochemical, drug-likeness, pharmacokinetic (pk), and toxicokinetic (tk) properties. Molecular docking identified that these indole compounds are anchored, with the main amino acid residues, positioned in the binding pocket of the COX-1/2, required for selective inhibition. Moreover, the molecular dynamics simulation based on root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) analyses showed that these natural brominated molecules transit rapidly to a progressive constant configuration during binding with COX-1/2 and seem to accomplish a consistent dynamic behavior by maintaining conformational stability and compactness. The results were comparable to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved selective COX inhibitor, aspirin. Furthermore, the free energy of binding for the compounds assessed by molecular mechanicsCPoissonCBoltzmann surface area (MMCPBSA) confirmed the binding capacity of indoles towards COX-1/2, with suitable binding energy values except for the polar precursor tyrindoxyl sulfate (with COX-1). The physicochemical and drug-likeness analysis showed zero violations of Lipinskis rule, and the compounds are predicted to have excellent pharmacokinetic profiles. These indoles are projected to be non-mutagenic and free from hepatotoxicity, with no inhibition of human ether-a-goCgo gene (hERG) I inhibitors, and the oral acute toxicity LD(50) in rats is predicted to be similar or lower than aspirin.

Many lives have been saved by administering naloxone to reverse ventilatory depression, the fatal effect of opioids;however, these effects of fentanyl derivatives are reportedly more difficult to reverse with naloxone than those of other opioids like heroin. The current study examined the ability of naloxone to reverse ventilatory depression produced by fentanyl and 2 of its derivatives. Minute volume (VE) was measured using head plethysmography in 4 rhesus monkeys breathing air. On separate occasions, monkeys received saline or naloxone (0.032 mg/kg) 30 min after administration of the smallest dose of fentanyl, 3-methylfentanyl or carfentanil that decreased VE to &lt;70% of control. Fentanyl and its derivatives dose-dependently decreased ventilation, although their potency varied markedly;carfentanil was 10-fold more potent than 3-methylfentanyl and 100-fold more potent than fentanyl. For each opioid, the dose that decreased VE varied slightly across individual monkeys (fentanyl: 17.8-56 g/kg;3-methylfentanyl: 3.2-5.6 g/kg;carfentanil: 0.32-0.56 g/kg), although those doses reliably decreased ventilation within 30 min such that VE ranged from 57-63% of control. Ventilatory depression was evident for at least 90 min. Naloxone reversed the ventilatory-depressant effects of fentanyl and 3-methylfentanyl with the mean VE increasing to 112% and 120% of control, respectively, within 15 min;however, this attenuation by naloxone did not last long, beginning to wane 30 min after its administration. In contrast, naloxone was not as effective in reversing the ventilatory-depressant effects of carfentanil;VE was &lt;70% of control 15 min after naloxone and remained &lt;90% at all time points. Thus, reversal of the ventilatory-depressant effects of fentanyl and 3-methylfentanyl was similar to each other and to that obtained previously with heroin, supporting the effectiveness of naloxone in attenuating ventilatory depression involving these opioids. Differences between carfentanil and pharmacologically equivalent doses of other opioids suggest that naloxone is not equally potent, and might not be equally effective, in reversing all opioids and underscores the importance of developing novel treatment options for opioid overdose.","output":"Differential Reversal of the Ventilatory-Depressant Effects of Fentanyl and its Derivatives by Naloxone in Monkeys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The usual problem for group testing is this: For a given number of individuals and a given prevalence, how many tests T* are required to find every infected individual?

Many countries experienced a decline in traumatological patient volume. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the first lockdown on traumatological patient volume in Switzerland. Methods We retrospectively used a prospective national quality measurement database. We compared the period of the first lockdown in Switzerland from March 17 to April 26, 2020 to the same period in the years 2018 and 2019. Included were all adult patients with any S-code (trauma) according to the International Classification of Diseases. Results In total, we assessed 3874 patients (1779 in the year 2018, 1303 in the year 2019, and 792 in the year 2020) with a mean age of 61  21 years. The patients during the lockdown period had significantly more injuries to the hip and forearm, had more comorbidities, and were more likely to have statutory insurance. During the lockdown period, more thromboembolism prophylaxis or anticoagulation was applied, and more patients needed antibiotic treatment. Conclusions The present study demonstrated a 40C55% reduction in patient volume during the lockdown period in Switzerland compared to the previous years. The in-hospital mortality and complication rate during the lockdown period remained stable.

How disseminated cancer cells cope with hostile microenvironments in secondary site for full-blown metastasis is largely unknown. Here, we show that AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), activated in mouse metastasis models, drives pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) activation to maintain TCA cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) and promotes cancer metastasis by adapting cancer cells to metabolic and oxidative stresses. This AMPK-PDHc axis is activated in advanced breast cancer and predicts poor metastasis-free survival. Mechanistically, AMPK localizes in the mitochondrial matrix and phosphorylates the catalytic alpha subunit of PDHc (PDHA) on two residues S295 and S314, which activates the enzymatic activity of PDHc and alleviates an inhibitory phosphorylation by PDHKs, respectively. Importantly, these phosphorylation events mediate PDHc function in cancer metastasis. Our study reveals that AMPK-mediated PDHA phosphorylation drives PDHc activation and TCA cycle to empower cancer cells adaptation to metastatic microenvironments for metastasis.","output":"Phosphorylation of PDHA by AMPK Drives TCA Cycle to Promote Cancer Metastasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Internet has never been more important to our society, and understanding the behavior of the Internet is essential.

The aim of this study is to reveal the effects of the demographic structure of the countries, their socio-economic development, the precautions, and health practices implemented by the governments against COVID-19 on the rate of transmission until the first peak days (plateaus) are appeared. Due to the socio-economic developments and reaching out the clear and transparent COVID-19 dataset, the sample of the study was formed from G20 and EU countries. The in terpretable factors affecting the transmission rate of COVID-19 were extracted with factor analysis and multidimensional scaling. Multivariate analysis figures out the effects of th e pr ecautions an d health practices implemented by G20 and EU countries with similar/different socio-economic development characteristics on the transmission rate. For instance, a result obtained from the multivariate analyzes is that COVID-19 cases in developed and developing countries differ from each other at their first plateaus. Another noteworthy inference is that COVID-19 cases are trending similarly within some developed countries with the higher ratio of population (65+) and Human Development Index (HDI). Furthermore, the population ratio (15-64) is itself an explanatory factor that can be used to characterize similar transmission patterns between countries.

However, human clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine failed to establish its usefulness as treatment for COVID-19. This compound is known to interfere with endosomal acidification necessary to the proteolytic activity of cathepsins. Following receptor binding and endocytosis, cathepsin L can cleave the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins, thereby activating membrane fusion for cell entry. The plasma membrane-associated protease TMPRSS2 can similarly cleave these S proteins and activate viral entry at the cell surface. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 entry process is more dependent than that of SARS-CoV-1 on TMPRSS2 expression. This difference can be reversed when the furin-cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is ablated or when it is introduced into the SARS-CoV-1 S protein. We also show that hydroxychloroquine efficiently blocks viral entry mediated by cathepsin L, but not by TMPRSS2, and that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and a clinically-tested TMPRSS2 inhibitor prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection more potently than either drug alone. These studies identify functional differences between SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry processes, and provide a mechanistic explanation for the limited in vivo utility of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry is attenuated by TMPRSS2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Early clinical data from studies of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (Novavax), a recombinant nanoparticle vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that contains the full-length spike glycoprotein of the prototype strain plus Matrix-M adjuvant, showed that the vaccine was safe and associated with a robust immune response in healthy adult participants. Additional data were needed regarding the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of this vaccine in a larger population. METHODS: In this phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 33 sites in the United Kingdom, we assigned adults between the ages of 18 and 84 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular 5-g doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo administered 21 days apart. The primary efficacy end point was virologically confirmed mild, moderate, or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection with an onset at least 7 days after the second injection in participants who were serologically negative at baseline. RESULTS: A total of 15,187 participants underwent randomization, and 14,039 were included in the per-protocol efficacy population. Of the participants, 27.9% were 65 years of age or older, and 44.6% had coexisting illnesses. Infections were reported in 10 participants in the vaccine group and in 96 in the placebo group, with a symptom onset of at least 7 days after the second injection, for a vaccine efficacy of 89.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.2 to 94.6). No hospitalizations or deaths were reported among the 10 cases in the vaccine group. Five cases of severe infection were reported, all of which were in the placebo group.

From 24 February until 10 April 2020, all symptomatic HCWs were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on a nasopharyngeal swab. HCWs screened positive were questioned on their profession, symptoms, and occupational and nonoccupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Among 1344 HCWs tested, 373 were positive (28%) and 336 (90%) corresponding questionnaires were completed. Three hospitalizations and no deaths were reported. Most HCWs (70%) had patient-facing occupational activities (22% in COVID-19 dedicated units). The total number of HCW cases peaked on 23 March, then decreased slowly, concomitantly with a continuous increase of compliance to preventive measures (including universal medical masking and personal protective equipment [PPE] for direct care to COVID-19 patients). Attack rates were of 3.2% and 2.3% in the adult and pediatric settings, respectively (P = .0022). In the adult setting, HCWs more frequently reported exposure to COVID-19 patients without PPE (25% vs 15%, P = .046). Report of contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities dramatically decreased over the study period.

Vehicle emissions generally depend on many factors, such as the nature of the vehicle, driving style, traffic conditions, emission control technologies, and operational conditions. Concerns about the certification cycles used by various regulatory authorities are growing due to the difference in emission during certification procedure and Real Driving Emissions (RDE). Under laboratory conditions, certification tests are performed in a chassis dynamometer for light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and an engine dynamometer for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs). As a result, the test drive cycles used to measure the automotive emissions do not correctly reflect the vehicles real-world driving pattern. Consequently, the RDE regulation is being phased in to reduce the disparity between type approval and vehicles real-world emissions. According to this review, different variables such as traffic signals, driving dynamics, congestions, altitude, ambient temperature, and so on have a major influence on actual driving pollution. Aside from that, cold-start and hot-start have been shown to have an effect on on-road pollution. Contrary to common opinion, new technology such as start-stop systems boost automotive emissions rather than decreasing them owing to unfavourable conditions from the point of view of exhaust emissions and exhaust after-treatment systems. In addition, the driving dynamics are not represented in the current laboratory-based test procedures. As a result, it is critical to establish an on-road testing protocol to obtain a true representation of vehicular emissions and reduce emissions to a standard level.

ResultsAcross the 11 studies (n=54,609), mental health had deteriorated from pre-pandemic scores across all three pandemic time periods (TP1 Standardised Mean Difference (SMD): 0.13 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.23); TP2 SMD: 0.18 (0.09, 0.27); TP3 SMD: 0.20 (0.09, 0.31)). Changes in psychological distress across the pandemic were higher in females (TP3 SMD: 0.23 (0.11, 0.35)) than males (TP3 SMD: 0.16 (0.06, 0.26)), and slightly lower in below-degree level educated persons at some time periods (TP3 SMD: 0.18 (0.06, 0.30)) compared to those who held degrees (TP3 SMD: 0.26 (0.14, 0.38)). Increased distress was most prominent amongst adults aged 35-44 years (TP3 SMD: 0.49 (0.15, 0.84)). We did not find evidence of changes in distress differing by ethnicity or UK country. ConclusionsThe substantial deterioration in mental health seen in the UK during the first lockdown did not reverse when lockdown lifted, and a sustained worsening is observed across the pandemic. Mental health declines have not been equal across the population, with females, those with higher degrees, and younger adults more affected.","output":"Psychological Distress Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Sociodemographic Inequalities in 11 UK Longitudinal Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advances in neonatal care have resulted in improved outcomes for high-risk newborns with technologies playing a significant part although many were developed for the neonatal intensive care unit. The care provided in the delivery room (DR) during the first few minutes of life can impact short- and long-term neonatal outcomes. Increasingly, technologies have a critical role to play in the DR particularly with monitoring and information provision. However, the DR is a unique environment and has major challenges around the period of foetal to neonatal transition that need to be overcome when developing new technologies. This review focuses on current DR technologies as well as those just emerging and further over the horizon. We identify what key opinion leaders in DR care think of current technologies, what the important DR measures are to them, and which technologies might be useful in the future. We link these with key technologies including respiratory function monitors, electoral impedance tomography, videolaryngoscopy, augmented reality, video recording, eye tracking, artificial intelligence, and contactless monitoring. Encouraging funders and industry to address the unique technological challenges of newborn care in the DR will allow the continued improvement of outcomes of high-risk infants from the moment of birth. IMPACT: Technological advances for newborn delivery room care require consideration of the unique environment, the variable patient characteristics, and disease states, as well as human factor challenges. Neonatology as a speciality has embraced technology, allowing its rapid progression and improved outcomes for infants, although innovation in the delivery room often lags behind that in the intensive care unit. Investing in new and emerging technologies can support healthcare providers when optimising care and could improve training, safety, and neonatal outcomes.","output":"The newborn delivery room of tomorrow: emerging and future technologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent reports have demonstrated high troponin levels in patients affected with COVID-19. In the present study, we aimed to determine the association between admission and peak troponin levels and COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: This was an observational multi-ethnic multi-centre study in a UK cohort of 434 patients admitted and diagnosed COVID-19 positive, across six hospitals in London, UK during the second half of March 2020. RESULTS: Myocardial injury, defined as positive troponin during admission was observed in 288 (66.4%) patients. Age (OR: 1.68 [1.49-1.88], p < .001), hypertension (OR: 1.81 [1.10-2.99], p = .020) and moderate chronic kidney disease (OR: 9.12 [95% CI: 4.24-19.64], p < .001) independently predicted myocardial injury. After adjustment, patients with positive peak troponin were more likely to need non-invasive and mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.40 [95% CI: 1.27-4.56], p = .007, and OR: 6.81 [95% CI: 3.40-13.62], p < .001, respectively) and urgent renal replacement therapy (OR: 4.14 [95% CI: 1.34-12.78], p = .013). With regards to events, and after adjustment, positive peak troponin levels were independently associated with acute kidney injury (OR: 6.76 [95% CI: 3.40-13.47], p < .001), venous thromboembolism (OR: 11.99 [95% CI: 3.20-44.88], p < .001), development of atrial fibrillation (OR: 10.66 [95% CI: 1.33-85.32], p = .026) and death during admission (OR: 2.40 [95% CI: 1.34-4.29], p = .003). Similar associations were observed for admission troponin. In addition, median length of stay in days was shorter for patients with negative troponin levels: 8 (5-13) negative, 14 (7-23) low-positive levels and 16 (10-23) high-positive (p < .001).

We wanted to develop an algorithm that automatically recognises and characterises ventilator inflations from ventilator pressure and flow data. METHODS: We downloaded airway pressure and flow data with 100 Hz sampling rate from Dr?ger Babylog VN500 ventilators ventilating critically ill infants. We developed an open source Python package, Ventiliser, that includes a rule-based algorithm to automatically discretise ventilator data into a sequence of flow and pressure states and to recognise ventilator inflations and an information gain approach to identify inflation phases (inspiration, expiration) and sub-phases (pressure rise, pressure plateau, inspiratory hold etc.). RESULTS: Ventiliser runs on a personal computer and analyses 24 h of ventilation in 2 min. With longer recordings, the processing time increases linearly. It generates a table reporting indices of each breath and its sub-phases. Ventiliser also allows visualisation of individual inflations as waveforms or loops. Ventiliser identified >97% of ventilator inflations and their sub-phases in an out-of-sample validation of manually annotated data. We also present detailed quantitative analysis and comparison of two 1-hour-long ventilation periods. CONCLUSIONS: Ventiliser can analyse ventilation patterns and ventilatorCpatient interactions over long periods of mechanical ventilation.

Infection-related hospitalizations were assessed during study periods in 2020 vs. 2018/2019, and we computed incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Poisson regression. In the 2020 study period, 3093 children were hospitalized with an infection, while the corresponding figures for 2018 and 2019 study periods were 4824 and 3830, respectively.

This has meant that Spain is one of the countries in the world where the most restrictive measures have been adopted and which have had a strong impact on the economic, social, and mental health of citizens. One of the consequences of this pandemic is a severe increase in the strain on the healthcare system. Many of those infected had to be admitted to hospitals and even to Intensive Care Units (ICU). In this scenario, it is essential to reduce traffic accidents in order to avoid overcrowded hospitals. However, the Spanish General Directorate of Traffic highlights in several traffic reports that despite the decrease in the volume and distance of trips, the number of traffic accidents has not altered significantly and even during some periods has been higher than before the pandemic.

Currently, vaccination against IBV is only partially protective; therefore, better preventions and treatments are needed. Plants produce antimicrobial secondary compounds, which may be a source for novel anti-viral drugs. Non-cytotoxic, crude ethanol extracts of Rhodiola rosea roots, Nigella sativa seeds, and Sambucus nigra fruit were tested for anti-IBV activity, since these safe, widely used plant tissues contain polyphenol derivatives that inhibit other viruses. RESULTS: DoseCresponse cytotoxicity curves on Vero cells using trypan blue staining determined the highest non-cytotoxic concentrations of each plant extract. To screen for IBV inhibition, cells and virus were pretreated with extracts, followed by infection in the presence of extract. Viral cytopathic effect was assessed visually following an additional 24 h incubation with extract. Cells and supernatants were harvested separately and virus titers were quantified by plaque assay. Variations of this screening protocol determined the effects of a number of shortened S. nigra extract treatments. Finally, S. nigra extract-treated virions were visualized by transmission electron microscopy with negative staining. Virus titers from infected cells treated with R. rosea and N. sativa extracts were not substantially different from infected cells treated with solvent alone. However, treatment with S. nigra extracts reduced virus titers by four orders of magnitude at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in a dose-responsive manner. Infection at a low MOI reduced viral titers by six orders of magnitude and pretreatment of virus was necessary, but not sufficient, for full virus inhibition. Electron microscopy of virions treated with S. nigra extract showed compromised envelopes and the presence of membrane vesicles, which suggested a mechanism of action. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that S. nigra extract can inhibit IBV at an early point in infection, probably by rendering the virus non-infectious. They also suggest that future studies using S. nigra extract to treat or prevent IBV or other coronaviruses are warranted.","output":"Sambucus nigra extracts inhibit infectious bronchitis virus at an early point during replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recent, rapid development of digital technologies offers new possibilities for more efficient implementation of electronic health record (EHR) and personal health record (PHR) systems. A growing volume of healthcare data has been the hallmark of this digital transformation. The large healthcare datasets' complexity and their dynamic nature pose various challenges related to processing, analysis, storage, security, privacy, data exchange, and usability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review of systematic reviews to assess technological progress in EHR and PHR systems. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus for systematic literature reviews on technological advancements that support EHR and PHR systems published between January 1, 2010, and October 06, 2020. RESULTS: The searches resulted in a total of 2,448 hits. Of these, we finally selected 23 systematic reviews. Most of the included papers dealt with information extraction tools and natural language processing technology (n = 10), followed by studies that assessed the use of blockchain technology in healthcare (n = 8). Other areas of digital technology research included EHR and PHR systems in austere settings (n = 1), de-identification methods (n = 1), visualization techniques (n = 1), communication tools within EHR and PHR systems (n = 1), and methodologies for defining Clinical Information Models that promoted EHRs and PHRs interoperability (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: Technological advancements can improve the efficiency in the implementation of EHR and PHR systems in numerous ways. Natural language processing techniques, either rule-based, machine-learning, or deep learning-based, can extract information from clinical narratives and other unstructured data locked in EHRs and PHRs, allowing secondary research (i.e., phenotyping). Moreover, EHRs and PHRs are expected to be the primary beneficiaries of the blockchain technology implementation on Health Information Systems.

Use of face masks is therefore recommended for both personal and social protection. We found social distancing effective at reducing transmission potential across all droplet sizes. However, the presence of a human body 1 m away modifies the aerodynamics so that downstream droplet dispersion is enhanced, which has implications on safe distancing in queues. At 1 m distance, we found that an average of 0.55 viral copies is inhaled for a cough at median loading, scalable up to 340 copies at peak loading.

However, health proposal repetition and its perceived efficacy also influence the behavior intention toward the proposal, which has not yet been confirmed in the COVID-19 context. The present study aims to examine whether the extended parallel process model (EPPM) can be generalized to a naturalistic context like the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we will explore how repetition of a health proposal is involved with the EPPM. In this study, two groups of participants are exposed to the same health proposal related to COVID-19, where one group is exposed once and another group twice. They then fill out a questionnaire consisting of items concerning behavior intention and adapted from the Risk Behavior Diagnosis Scale. Structural equation modeling will be used to determine the multivariate associations between the variables.

Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) induces Merkel cell carcinoma. HPyV6, HPyV7, and TSPyV have been associated with rare skin lesions in immunosuppressed patients. HPyV9, HPyV10, and Saint Louis Polyomavirus (STLPyV) have not been convincingly associated with any disease. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the cutaneous prevalence, persistence and viral load of HPyVs in healthy individuals. Eight hundred seventy forehead and hand swabs were collected from 109 volunteers 4C6 weeks apart (collection period-1). Fifty-nine participants were available for follow-up a decade later (collection period-2). HPyV-DNA prevalence and viral loads of MCPyV, HPyV6, HPyV7, TSPyV, HPyV9, HPyV10, and STLPyV were determined by virus-specific real-time PCRs. Risk factors for HPyV prevalence, short- and long-term persistence were explored by logistic regression analyses. Baseline prevalence rates were similar for forehead and hand: MCPyV 67.9/67.0%, HPyV6 31.2/25.7%, HPyV7 13.8/11.0%, HPyV10 11.9/15.6%, STLPyV 7.3/8.3%, TSPyV 0.9/0.9%, and HPyV9 0.9/0.9%. Short-term persistence in period-1 was found in 59.6% (MCPyV), 23.9% (HPyV6), 10.1% (HPyV7), 6.4% (HPyV10), 5.5% (STLPyV), and 0% (TSPyV and HPyV9) on the forehead, with similar values for the hand. Long-term persistence for 9C12 years occurred only for MCPyV (forehead/hand 39.0%/44.1% of volunteers), HPyV6 (16.9%/11.9%), and HPyV7 (3.4%/5.1%). Individuals with short-term persistence had significantly higher viral loads at baseline compared to those with transient DNA-positivity (p < 0.001 for MCPyV, HPyV6, HPyV7, and HPyV10, respectively). This was also true for median viral loads in period-1 of MCPyV, HPyV6, and HPyV7 of volunteers with long-term persistence. Multiplicity (two or more different HPyVs) was a risk factor for prevalence and persistence for most HPyVs. Further risk factors were older age for HPyV6 and male sex for MCPyV on the forehead. Smoking was not a risk factor. In contrast to MCPyV, HPyV6, HPyV7, and rarely STLPyV, polyomaviruses TSPyV, HPyV9, and HPyV10 do not seem to be long-term constituents of the human skin virome of healthy individuals. Furthermore, this study showed that higher viral loads are associated with both short- and long-term persistence of HPyVs on the skin. HPyV multiplicity is a risk factor for prevalence, short-term and/or long-term persistence of MCPyV, HPyV6, HPyV7, and HPyV10.","output":"Natural History of Cutaneous Human Polyomavirus Infection in Healthy Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ride-hailing is rapidly changing urban and personal transportation. Ride sharing or pooling is important to mitigate negative externalities of ride-hailing such as increased congestion and environmental impacts. However, there lacks empirical evidence on what affect trip-level sharing behavior in ride-hailing. Using a novel dataset from all ride-hailing trips in Chicago in 2019, we show that the willingness of riders to request a shared ride has monotonically decreased from 27.0% to 12.8% throughout the year, while the trip volume and mileage have remained statistically unchanged. We find that the decline in sharing preference is due to an increased per-mile costs of shared trips and shifting shorter trips to solo. Using ensemble machine learning models, we find that the travel impedance variables (trip cost, distance, and duration) collectively contribute to 95% and 91% of the predictive power in determining whether a trip is requested to share and whether it is successfully shared, respectively. Spatial and temporal attributes, sociodemographic, built environment, and transit supply variables do not entail predictive power at the trip level in presence of these travel impedance variables. This implies that pricing signals are most effective to encourage riders to share their rides.

Herein, we discovered BA103, a novel specific inhibitor of the helicase binding site of DDX3X, which is characterized by broad-spectrum anticancer activity. BA103 revealed promising tolerability in fibroblasts and good pharmacokinetic properties. Furthermore, BA103 was able to decrease the expression of -catenin and to reduce tumor migration. Its capability to pass the bloodCbrain barrier led us to investigate its potential against glioblastoma, which is a high refractory disease with poor prognosis. High efficacy was proven in both xenograft and orthotopic animal models. ABSTRACT: DDX3X is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that has recently attracted interest for its involvement in viral replication and oncogenic progression. Starting from hit compounds previously identified by our group, we have designed and synthesized a new series of DDX3X inhibitors that effectively blocked its helicase activity. These new compounds were able to inhibit the proliferation of cell lines from different cancer types, also in DDX3X low-expressing cancer cell lines. According to the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination properties, and antitumoral activity, compound BA103 was chosen to be further investigated in glioblastoma models. BA103 determined a significant reduction in the proliferation and migration of U87 and U251 cells, downregulating the oncogenic protein -catenin. An in vivo evaluation demonstrated that BA103 was able to reach the brain and reduce the tumor growth in xenograft and orthotopic models without evident side effects. This study represents the first demonstration that DDX3X-targeted small molecules are feasible and promising drugs also in glioblastoma.","output":"Targeting DDX3X Helicase Activity with BA103 Shows Promising Therapeutic Effects in Preclinical Glioblastoma Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: Three-dimensional (3D) printing allows innovative solutions for personal protective equipment, particularly in times of crisis. Our goal was to generate an N95-alternative 3D-printed respirator that passed Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-certified quantitative fit testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3D printed prototypes for N95 solutions were created based on the design of commercial N95 respirators. Computed tomography imaging was performed on an anthropomorphic head phantom wearing a commercially available N95 respirator and these facial contour data was used in mask prototyping. Prototypes were generated using rigid and flexible polymers. According to OSHA standards, prototypes underwent subsequent quantitative respirator fit testing on volunteers who passed fit tests on commercial N95 respirators. RESULTS: A total of 10 prototypes were 3D printed using both rigid (na?=a?5 designs) and flexible materials (na?=a?5 designs), Prototypes generated with rigid printing materials (na?=a?5 designs) did not pass quantitative respirator fit testing. Three of the five prototypes with flexible materials failed quantitative fit testing. The final two prototypes designs passed OSHA-certified quantitative fit tests with an overall mean fit factor of 138 (passing is over 100). CONCLUSION: Through rapid prototyping, 3D printed N95 alternative masks were designed with topographical facial computed tomography data to create mask facial contour and passed OSHA-certified quantitative respiratory testing when flexible polymer was used. This mask design may provide an alternative to disposable N95 respirators in case of pandemic-related shortages. Furthermore, this approach may allow customization for those that would otherwise fail fit testing on standard commercial respirators.","output":"Quantitative Fit Tested N95 Respirator-Alternatives Generated With CT Imaging and 3D Printing: A Response to Potential Shortages During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza remains a major cause of death and disability with limited treatment options.

Six strains (Bacillus subtilis, B. circulance, B. coagulanse, B. licheniformis, Pseudomonas fluroscence and P. koreensis) were screened for siderophore production, and using dual plate culture method and greenhouse experiment, antagonistic activity against C. maydis was studied. Using two superior strains, single and dual inoculation treatments in maize were applied in field experiment during the 2018 and 2019 seasons. Results indicated that B. subtilis and P. koreensis strains had shown the most qualitative and quantitative assays for siderophore production and antagonistic activities. In greenhouse, the most effective treatments on the pre- and post-emergence damping off as well as growth promotion of maize were T3 treatment (inoculated with B. subtilis), and T8 treatment (inoculated with P. koreensis). In field experiment, T5 treatment (inoculated with a mixture of B. subtilis and P. koreensis) showed significant increases in catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities, as well as total chlorophyll and carotenoids than control treatments during the two growing seasons.

They are credence-based foods, i.e., it is difficult for consumers to evaluate the premium aspects of organic food under normal use. In global supply chains, organic food is purchased on institutional trust (certification, logos, standards) rather than on relational trust. Relying on institutional trust makes consumers vulnerable to criminals who intentionally label conventional product as organic or develop sophisticated organized crime networks to defraud businesses and consumers.

Supply chain guardians need to recognize this vulnerability and implement effective controls to reduce the likelihood of occurrence. However, in some cases considered in the study, the guardians themselves were complicit in the illicit behavior, further increasing consumer vulnerability.

A previous study found an independent and positive association between the Black/African American race and positive COVID-19 testing results in Milwaukee County, WI, while adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities (Munoz-Price. et al, 2020, JAMA Network). Our previous study revealed that patients with COVID-19 who developed hypertriglyceridemia during their hospitalization were associated with a 2.3 times higher mortality rate, after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, history of hypertension and diabetes (Dai. et al, 2021, manuscript accepted by Journal of Clinical Lipidology). Additionally, adverse blood clotting events is one of the major causes of death for patients with COVID-19. In this study, we investigated the correlation between racial/ethnic groups and mortality, along with potential correlations between hypertriglyceridemia and adverse blood clotting events in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (ICD10CM:U07.1). De-identified data from 1,441 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2021 were extracted using the Medical College of Wisconsin Clinical Research Data Warehouse. Vital, demographic, and diagnostic information were used for the statistical analysis, specifically: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), race/ethnicity, thrombosis diagnosis and laboratory test results for triglyceride. The thrombotic events included were presence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and stroke diagnosed during their hospitalization. Hypertriglyceridemia was characterized as triglyceride levels greater than 150 mg/dL, with a baseline variable being the first occurrence of hypertriglyceridemia (baseline), and the peak variable being the highest manifestation of hypertriglyceridemia during hospitalization (peak). A binary logistic regression model showed that non-white Hispanic and Asian patients both had a higher correlation with mortality than white patients, with odds ratios (OR) of 4.1 [95% CI (2.2-7.9), p < 0.001] and 4.2 [95% CI (1.8-9.8), p < 0.001], respectively, after adjusting for age, BMI, and sex (Figure A). Additionally, the regression analysis showed that peak hypertriglyceridemia developed during hospitalization was correlated with a 1.8 times higher mortality in the entire inpatient cohort [95% CI (1.2-2.9), p < 0.01], after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI and independent of obesity. Furthermore, myocardial infarction [OR = 1.5, 95% CI (1.-2.5), p < 0.05] and pulmonary embolism [OR = 2.0, 95% CI (1.1-4.1), p < 0.05] were also correlated with a higher mortality, after adjusting for age, BMI, and sex (Figure B). The peak hypertriglyceridemia developed during hospitalization correlates with the incidence of thrombotic events with a borderline significance [OR= 1.5, 95% CI (0.9-2.1), p = 0.05] after adjusting for BMI, age, and sex. Further analysis revealed that non-white Hispanic patients had the highest frequencies of peak hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride > 150 mg/dL) occurrence during hospitalization than the other race/ethnicity groups (Figure C). On the other hand, 22% of non-white Hispanics had at least one diagnosis of thrombotic event during hospitalization, which was the lowest incidence of thrombosis among all race/ethnicity groups (Figure D). In our current retrospective study of inpatients with COVID-19, race/ethnicity, peak hypertriglyceridemia developed during hospitalization, and thrombosis are independently associated with mortality. The peak hypertriglyceridemia developed during hospitalization is positively correlated with the incidence of thrombosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was prepared to collect responses from FPs between March-April 2020. A descriptive and correlational design was utilized. RESULTS: 240 FPs from eight countries were evaluated. The majority reported that they receive most information from medical journals (77%). The majority of respondents also noted that the most common symptoms are acute respiratory syndrome and fever - with the most effective treatment in most cases consisting of symptomatic treatment (41%). Although FPs generally had a positive attitude, most of them (68%) were concerned about contracting COVID-19 from patients and as a result, they experienced increased stress (64%). CONCLUSION: The research was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak while the FPs were working on the frontline of the pandemic. This research revealed that most of the FPs have good knowledge of, and a positive attitude towards COVID-19 treatment. It was observed that participants who tended towards conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience, and who had higher life satisfaction, and lower levels of death anxiety also reported more positive attitudes towards COVID-19.

METHODS: To address this question and identify gaps in knowledge, we utilized the methodology of a scoping review to interrogate risk of infection and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with iatrogenic and inborn humoral immunodeficiency states based on existing literature. RESULTS: Among patients with iatrogenic B-cell depletion, particularly with agents targeting CD20, our analysis found increased risk of severe COVID-19 and death across a range of underlying disease states. Among patients with humoral inborn errors of immunity with COVID-19, our synthesis found that patients with dysregulated humoral immunity, predominantly common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 than patients with humoral immunodeficiency states due to X-linked agammaglobulinemia and other miscellaneous forms of humoral immunodeficiency.

However, methods for delivering siRNA in vivo to induce this high anticancer activity with low potential side effects are urgently needed. Herein, a folic acid (FA)-modified polydopamine (PDA) nanomedicine used in photothermal therapy was designed for siRNA delivery. The designed nanovector can undergo photothermal conversion with good biocompatibility. Importantly, this genetic nanomedicine was selectively delivered to liver cancer cells by FA through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Subsequently, the siRNA cargo was released from the PDA nanomedicine into the tumor microenvironment by controlled release triggered by pH. More importantly, the genetic nanomedicine not only inhibited liver cancer cell proliferation but also promoted liver cell apoptosis by slowing ROC1 activity, suppressing the Neddylation pathway, enabling the accumulation of apototic factor ATF4 and DNA damage factor P-H2AX. Combined with photothermal therapy, this genetic nanomedicine showed superior inhibition of the growth of liver cancer in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, the results indicate that this biodegradable nanomedicine exhibits good target recognition, an effective pH response, application potential for genetic therapy, photothermal imaging and treatment of liver cancer.

As the healthcare industry adopts artificial intelligence and algorithminformed (AI) tools, it is vital that regulators address healthcare discrimination. AI tools are increasingly used to make both clinical and administrative decisions by hospitals, physicians, and insurers--yet there is no framework that specifically places nondiscrimination obligations on AI users. The Food and Drug Administration has limited authority to regulate AI and has not sought to incorporate anti-discrimination principles in its guidance.

Despite this recommendation, vaccination rates remain suboptimal. Boston Medical Center (BMC) previously achieved high influenza vaccination rates among its pediatric patients with SCD. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this high vaccination rate has been maintained and whether it has influenced outcome measures. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted in the hematology clinic at an urban, academic medical center. Fisher's exact test and the independent samples t test were used to determine if there were any significant differences in characteristics between patients with influenza and patients without influenza, as well as between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Influenza vaccination rate, influenza-related hospitalization rate, and influenza-positive rate were collected and compared with reported rates. RESULTS Data from 124 pediatric patients with SCD were examined. The influenza vaccination rate for pediatric patients with SCD at BMC (90.32%) was higher than previous studies that were not conducted at BMC, while BMC's influenza-related hospitalization rate (0) and influenza-positive rate (4.84%) were lower than other studies.

NF is used in Asia as an i.v. anti-coagulant and has an established safety profile. NF, soluble in aqueous solutions, can be delivered by inhalation to the airways. It is currently being repurposed for treatment of both SARS-CoV-2 (CoV) infection and Cystic Fibrosis. CoV binding and entry into HAEC requires host proteases, particularly TMPRSS2, which cleaves the viral spike protein. NF is a potent inhibitor of TMPRSS2. Excessive airway epithelia sodium channel (ENaC) activity in CF causes failure to clear purulent secretions. Full ENaC activity requires an inhibitory peptide domain to be cleaved from the ENaC gamma subunit by membrane bound SP, particularly prostasin. This study reports safety of NF on HAEC, its efficacy and potency to inhibit CoV infection, and the IC50 of NF and its time course to inhibit ENaC in HAEC. Methods: HAEC cultured in 3D MucilAirTM tissue model were exposed to NF 0.002 to 20M for up to 72h and evaluated for cytotoxicity and inflammatory effects. To study infectivity, CoV viral inoculum was added apically for 1h. Cells were exposed to NF 0.2 to 20M for up to 72h. Apical washes taken at 48 and 72h were measured for viral RNA by qRT-PCR. ENaC activity in HAEC was measured as amiloride-dependent decrease in short-circuit current. Time course and dose dependency of NF induced decrease in ENaC activity was studied. Results: Conclusions: 1. No detrimental effects of NF up to 20 M applied to surface of HAEC. 2. Anti-viral effects of NF on CoV infection of HAEC consistent with inhibition of TMPRSS2 and prevention of viral entry via ACE2 receptor (Yamamoto et al. Antimicrob. Agents & Chemotherapy 2016, 60 p6532). 3. NF induced inhibition of ENaC in HAEC is consistent with data in pig airways (Hall & Cole Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2017, 52S2, p239) where NF caused decreased ENaC activity and increased ciliary transport of secretions with long duration of action. 4. Inhibition of CoV infection and ENaC activity by NF occurs over a similar dose range suggesting the potential for a double benefit of NF inhalation in CoV infection;i.e. prevention of viral entry to airway epithelial cells, and increased removal of mucus and viral particles from the lung/nose by up-regulated ciliary clearance.","output":"Sars-cov-2 infection and enac activity are both inhibited by nafamostat applied apically on human airway epithelial cells in air-liquid interface culture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"\\"Self-transcendence\\" is proposed as a way in which individuals might find relief and support in the context of COVID-19, as well as other times of uncertainty.

Individuals were tested if the participant was exposed to a known SARS-CoV-2-infected person, developed new symptoms, or reported high-risk behavior (such as attending an indoor gathering without masking or social distancing), if a member of a group experiencing an outbreak, or at enrollment. Study participants included students, staff, and faculty at an urban public university during the Autumn quarter of 2020. RESULTS: We enrolled 16 476 individuals, performed 29 783 SARS-CoV-2 tests, and detected 236 infections. Seventy-five percent of positive cases reported at least 1 of the following: symptoms (60.8%), exposure (34.7%), or high-risk behaviors (21.5%).

The former aims to seek the feature representations from abundant CT slices instead of limited CT volumes, and for the overall pneumonia screening, the latter one could recover the temporal information by feature refinement and aggregation between different slices. In addition to distinguish COVID-19 from Healthy, H1N1, and CAP cases, our M 3 Lung-Sys also be able to locate the areas of relevant lesions, without any pixel-level annotation. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on a chest CT imaging dataset with a total of 734 patients (251 healthy people, 245 COVID-19 patients, 105 H1N1 patients, and 133 CAP patients). The quantitative results with plenty of metrics indicate the superiority of our proposed model on both slice- and patient-level classification tasks.

The basic principles of such measures to reduce the risk of exposure and limit the doses of irradiation follow the \\"as low as reasonably achievable \\" or ALARA principle by using the concepts of time, distance and shielding. Potential exposures in radiation oncology are controlled through combination of optimal design and installation of radiation delivery equipment with well-defined standard operating procedures (SOPs). In the modern era of viral pandemics, similar principles can also be applied toward prevention of viral transmission and protection of populations at risk. In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the probability of an individual getting infected is dependent on the viral load that an individual is exposed to in public spaces over a period of time. All prevention and control measures are based on preventing any such exposure to the virus, that can be achieved through limiting space for movement of the virus, using barriers and increasing distance to vulnerable surfaces, and limiting the duration of exposure. Apart from adhering to the laid-down provisions of a lock-down, preventive measures recommended for the general public include maintaining hand-hygiene, social distancing, and using facemasks to break the chain of transmission. Appropriate triage and customization of treatment protocols can help curtail hospital visits and time-spent by cancer patients during pandemic times, thereby reducing their risk of exposure as well as allowing efficient utilization of resources.

Despite intense research, the main bat-maintenance hypothesis has not been confirmed yet. The alternative hypotheses of a non-bat maintenance host or a maintenance community including, or not, several bat and other species, deserves more investigation. However, African forest ecosystems host a large biodiversity and abound in potential maintenance hosts. How does one puzzle out? Since recent studies have revealed that several bat species have been exposed to ebolaviruses, the common denominator to these hypotheses is that within the epidemiological cycle, some bats species must be exposed to the viruses and infected by these potential alternative hosts. Under this constraint, and given the peculiar ecology of bats (roosting behaviour, habitat utilisation, and flight mode), we review the hosts and transmission pathways that can lead to bat exposure and infection to ebolaviruses. In contrast to the capacity of bats to transmit ebolaviruses and other pathogens to many hosts, our results indicate that only a limited number of hosts and pathways can lead to the transmission of ebolaviruses to bats, and that the alternative maintenance host, if it exists, must be amongst them. A list of these pathways is provided, along with protocols to prioritise and investigate these alternative hypotheses. In conclusion, taking into account the ecology of bats and their known involvement in ebolaviruses ecology drastically reduces the list of potential alternative maintenance hosts for ebolaviruses.

Thats why it is necessary to investigate the neurological features of the COVID-19. The aim of the study. To investigate the effect of COVID-19 on the cognitive functions of hospitalized patients. Materials and methods. the PCR-positive patients hospitalized at the University Clinical Hospital No. 3 had been included in the study since March 2020 for May 2021. Thorax CT scan, physical and neurological examination, the biochemical blood test was provided for all patients. The neuropsychological examination was made by: MoCA, TMTA, TMTB, and emotional condition was tested by HADS. Results. 33 patients (21 (64.6%) women) were included;the median age was 73.0 [67.0;76.0]. The average MoCA value was 22.64 points, median: 24.00 points [20.00;25.00], median TMTA execution speed: 68 seconds [49.00;84.00], TMTB: 194 seconds [153;245.75]. HADS (depression) median: 7.0 [5.00;9.00], for HADS (anxiety) median: 8.0 [4.00;10.00]. A link between the olfactory disorders and low MoCA results (p = 0.015) was found according to the regression analysis. Moreover, the patients age, lung damage degree had a negative impact on the duration of TMTB (p = 0.001 and p = 0.049). The propensity score matching was made to confirm that the olfactory disturbances, regardless of other factors, are associated with a lower MoCA result (p = 0.012). Conclusion.

The outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus (CoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and the disease as COVID-19. Within one month, cases were reported from 25 countries. In view of the novel viral strain with reported high morbidity, establishing early countrywide diagnosis to detect imported cases became critical. Here we describe the role of a countrywide network of VRDLs in early diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, established screening as well as confirmatory assays for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 13 VRDLs were provided with the E gene screening real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. VRDLs were selected on the basis of their presence near an international airport/seaport and their past performance. The case definition for testing included all individuals with travel history to Wuhan and symptomatic individuals with travel history to other parts of China. This was later expanded to include symptomatic individuals returning from Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and South Korea. Results: Within a week of standardization of the test at NIV, all VRDLs could initiate testing for SARS-CoV-2. Till February 29, 2020, a total of 2,913 samples were tested. This included both 654 individuals quarantined in the two camps and others fitting within the case definition. The quarantined individuals were tested twice - at days 0 and 14.

Screening cultures for C. auris were collected from patients, healthcare workers and inanimate surfaces. Risk factors for C. auris colonisation were evaluated, and the fungemia episodes that occurred after the investigation were also analysed and described. Antifungal susceptibility of the C. auris isolates was determined, and they were genotyped with microsatellite analysis. RESULTS: Among body swabs collected from 47 patients, eight (n = 8/47, 17%) samples from the axillae were positive for C. auris. Among samples collected from inanimate surfaces, digital thermometers had the highest rate of positive cultures (n = 8/47, 17%). Antifungal susceptibility testing showed MICs of 0.5 to 1 mg/L for AMB, 0.03 to 0.06 mg/L for voriconazole, 2 to 4 mg/L for fluconazole and 0.03 to 0.06 mg/L for anidulafungin.

The primary aim of this project was to create an art-eBook that reflects children's experiences of life during the COVID-19 pandemic that could be shared with other children around the world. Secondly, we wanted to reflect on the consultation undertaken within the International Network of Child and Family Centered Care (INCFCC) using Gibbs (1988) reflective cycle framework. Children from around the world were invited to submit a piece of artwork that reflected their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic via a Qualtrics-survey in May 2020. The children's artwork and written pieces were transcribed verbatim into an eBook and the artwork was further placed into groups based on similarity of meaning. Fifty-five children from 17 countries submitted an artwork piece. Four groups were evident within the children's artwork including infection control measures, positive experiences and emotions (connection to family, fun activities), negative experiences and emotions (social impact, emotional impact), and uniting children globally. The eBook illustrates how children of all ages can provide meaningful insightful commentary and valuable information on their experiences during an unprecedented pandemic.","output":"Seeing lockdown through the eyes of children from around the world: Reflecting on a children's artwork project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has shown - once again - the decisive and structural importance of health/disease/care-prevention processes, as it has generated consequences and reactions in all areas of collective and individual life in ways that no other process could. That being said, it was expected that the intelligentsia would focus their attention on these processes; however, figures such as Agamben and ?i?ek leaped at the opportunity to frame the pandemic in terms of their perennially unfulfilled socio-ideological prophecies rather than attempting to understand the reality of the pandemic as a health/disease/care-prevention process. Taking these dominant tendencies among contemporary intellectuals as a starting point, in this article I analyze the self-care processes of micro-groups related to disease, which have informed health policies in all countries. In other words, the core strategy for combatting COVID-19 has been and continues to be self-care, which constitutes one of the basic structures that micro-groups generate in order to live and to survive, but that biomedicine has coopted as a \\"policy\\" of its own making, thereby masking once again the true locus of power in containing the pandemic.","output":"[Consequences, visibility and denial of a pandemic: processes of self-care]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate factors affecting the job search channels (newspapers, agency, informal network, direct contact, internet) of unemployed individuals in Italy using a multivariate probit model. We separately analyse unemployed individuals who lost their job or who are entering the labour market for the first time (i.e., with or without previous job experience, respectively). We use cross-sectional microdata covering the 2014C2018 period. We do not find important differences in the determinants in common between unemployed individuals with and without previous job experience (such as, age, education, and citizenship). The main difference between the two samples is in the composition, with more young people in the latter group (mainly individuals in the school-to-work transition) than in the first one. We find that better-educated unemployed people have more of a multichannel attitude when searching for jobs than their counterparts. Moreover, for unemployed individuals with previous job experience, the characteristics of their last job play a crucial role in influencing the choice of search channel(s). For example, unemployed individuals from high-skilled professions (that typically require the employment of better-educated individuals) choose the internet with a higher probability than other channels, while those from low-skilled professions and with experience in manufacturing have a higher probability of considering employment agencies than those in qualified professions in commercial activities and services. We have assumed that the unobservable factors affecting the decision process of a multichannel job search (estimated through the pairwise correlation coefficients across the residuals of the models) are represented by personality features of an individual, such as motivation, self-control, and preferences.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the vulnerabilities of incarcerated people because of the risks of infectious disease transmission in correctional facilities. Focusing on older adults with mental illness, this paper aims to examine efforts to decarcerate US correctional facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether these approaches may lead to sustainable reforms beyond the pandemic. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A narrative literature review was conducted using numerous online resources, including PubMed, Google Scholar and LexisNexis. Search terms used included \\"decarceration pandemic,\\" \\"COVID-19 decarceration,\\" \\"aging mental illness decarceration,\\" \\"jails prisons decarceration,\\" \\"early release COVID-19\\" and \\"correctional decarceration pandemic,\\" among others. Given the rapidly changing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, this narrative literature review included content from not only scholarly articles and federal and state government publications but also relevant media articles and policy-related reports. The authors reviewed these sources collaboratively to synthesize a review of existing evidence and opinions on these topics and generate conclusions and policy recommendations moving forward. FINDINGS To mitigate the risks of COVID-19, policymakers have pursued various decarceration strategies across the USA. Some efforts have focused on reducing inflow into correctional systems, including advising police to reduce numbers of arrests and limiting use of pretrial detention. Other policies have sought to increase outflow from correctional systems, such as facilitating early release of people convicted of nonviolent offenses or those nearing the end of their sentences. Given the well-known risks of COVID-19 among older individuals, age was commonly cited as a reason for diverting or expediting release of people from incarceration. In contrast, despite their vulnerability to complications from COVID-19, people with serious mental illness (SMI), particularly those with acute treatment needs, may have been less likely in some instances to be diverted or released early from incarceration. ORIGINALITY/VALUE Although much has been written about decarceration during the COVID-19 pandemic, little attention has been paid to the relevance of these efforts for older adults with mental illness. This paper synthesizes existing proposals and evidence while drawing attention to the public health implications of aging and SMI in US correctional settings and explores opportunities for decarceration of older adults with SMI beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Decarceration of older adults with mental illness in the USA - beyond the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures have made in-person mutual help groups inaccessible to many individuals struggling with substance use disorders (SUDs). Prior to the pandemic, stakeholders in our community had sponsored a program to train volunteers to facilitate local Self-Management and Recovery Training (SMART Recovery) groups. As a result, the community established seven weekly SMART Recovery groups, which more than 200 community members attended. In March 2020, the community discontinued these groups due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To provide SMART Recovery during social distancing, we developed a one-on-one phone-in service for people with SUDs and addictions: the SMART Recovery Line (SMARTline). In this paper, we share our experience training volunteers to facilitate SMART Recovery groups and SMARTline. As a result of our experience, we have learned to: (1) establish plans in advance to migrate services from face-to-face settings to remote platforms; (2) consider remote platforms that are easily accessible to the greatest number of individuals; (3) include as many stakeholders in the planning process as possible; (4) consider recruiting volunteers to help in the provision of services, especially since many people want to help fellow community members during crises; and (5) anticipate and prepare for crises well before they occur.","output":"Providing addiction services during a pandemic: Lessons learned from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a severe hemorrhagic disease in humans and nonhuman primates, with a median case fatality rate of 78.4%. Although EBOV is considered a public health concern, there is a relative paucity of information regarding the modulation of the functional host response during infection. We employed temporal kinome analysis to investigate the relative early, intermediate, and late host kinome responses to EBOV infection in human hepatocytes. Pathway overrepresentation analysis and functional network analysis of kinome data revealed that transforming growth factor (TGF-)-mediated signaling responses were temporally modulated in response to EBOV infection. Upregulation of TGF- signaling in the kinome data sets correlated with the upregulation of TGF- secretion from EBOV-infected cells. Kinase inhibitors targeting TGF- signaling, or additional cell receptors and downstream signaling pathway intermediates identified from our kinome analysis, also inhibited EBOV replication. Further, the inhibition of select cell signaling intermediates identified from our kinome analysis provided partial protection in a lethal model of EBOV infection. To gain perspective on the cellular consequence of TGF- signaling modulation during EBOV infection, we assessed cellular markers associated with upregulation of TGF- signaling. We observed upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9, N-cadherin, and fibronectin expression with concomitant reductions in the expression of E-cadherin and claudin-1, responses that are standard characteristics of an epithelium-to-mesenchyme-like transition. Additionally, we identified phosphorylation events downstream of TGF- that may contribute to this process. From these observations, we propose a model for a broader role of TGF--mediated signaling responses in the pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease. IMPORTANCE Ebola virus (EBOV), formerly Zaire ebolavirus, causes a severe hemorrhagic disease in humans and nonhuman primates and is the most lethal Ebola virus species, with case fatality rates of up to 90%. Although EBOV is considered a worldwide concern, many questions remain regarding EBOV molecular pathogenesis. As it is appreciated that many cellular processes are regulated through kinase-mediated phosphorylation events, we employed temporal kinome analysis to investigate the functional responses of human hepatocytes to EBOV infection. Administration of kinase inhibitors targeting signaling pathway intermediates identified in our kinome analysis inhibited viral replication in vitro and reduced EBOV pathogenesis in vivo. Further analysis of our data also demonstrated that EBOV infection modulated TGF--mediated signaling responses and promoted \\"mesenchyme-like\\" phenotypic changes. Taken together, these results demonstrated that EBOV infection specifically modulates TGF--mediated signaling responses in epithelial cells and may have broader implications in EBOV pathogenesis.","output":"Ebola virus modulates transforming growth factor  signaling and cellular markers of mesenchyme-like transition in hepatocytes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Climate change is posing new challenges to crop-related concerns including food insecurity, supply stability and economic planning. As one of the central challenges, crop yield prediction has become a pressing task in the machine learning field. Despite its importance, the prediction task is exceptionally complicated since crop yields depend on various factors such as weather, land surface, soil quality as well as their interactions. In recent years, machine learning models have been successfully applied in this domain. However, these models either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region, or only study over a single or few years, which makes them hard to generalize spatially and temporally. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent neural network for crop yield prediction, to incorporate both geographical and temporal knowledge in the model, and further boost predictive power. Our method is trained, validated, and tested on over 2000 counties from 41 states in the US mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019. As far as we know, this is the first machine learning method that embeds geographical knowledge in crop yield prediction and predicts the crop yields at county level nationwide. We also laid a solid foundation for the comparison with other machine learning baselines by applying well-known linear models, tree-based models, deep learning methods and comparing their performance. Experiments show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on various metrics, validating the effectiveness of geospatial and temporal information.","output":"A GNN-RNN Approach for Harnessing Geospatial and Temporal Information: Application to Crop Yield Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Comments on an article by Phuoc-Tan Diep et al (see record 2020-96407-008) Oxytocin is globally available, inexpensive and, especially when given acutely and in nonpregnant adults is safe with few known side effects Although oxytocin is considered a nontoxic molecule, the route of administration (intravenous or intranasal), dose and duration of treatment matters However, in excessive amounts oxytocin may act on receptors for other systems, such as vasopressin, that are actually \\"proinflammatory\\" It is critical that this work be done in the context of data collection and be conducted as controlled clinical trials (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Oxytocin, love and the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused sudden, severe strain to healthcare systems. Better outpatient management is required to save lives, manage resources effectively, and prepare for future pandemics. METHODS: The Coronataxi digital early warning (CDEW) system deployed in Rhein-Neckar County and Heidelberg, Germany is an outpatient care system consisting of remote digital monitoring via a mobile application, a medical doctor dashboard, and medical care delivery to COVID-19 patients in home quarantine when indicated. Patients reported their symptoms, temperature, breathing rate, oxygen saturation, and pulse via the app. This single-center cohort study compared outcomes of the population with and without using the CDEW system. The primary outcome was mortality; the secondary outcomes were hospitalization, duration of hospitalization, intensive care therapy, and mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Mortality rate was 3- to 4-fold lower and hospitalization rate was higher in the CDEW cohort (459 patients) compared with the cohort without CDEW in the same test area and other regions (Mannheim, Karlsruhe town, Karlsruhe district, and Germany), (mortality rate: 0.65% [95% confidence interval {CI}, .13%C1.90%] versus 2.16%, 2.32%, 2.48%, 2.82% and 2.76%, respectively, P < .05 for all; hospitalization rate: 14.81% [95% CI, 11.69%C18.40%] versus 6.89%, 6.93%, 6.59%, 6.15%, and 7.22%, respectively, P < .001 for all).

Since the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly over the world and its outbreak has affected different people in different ways, it is significant to study or predict the evolution of its epidemic trend. However, most of the studies focused solely on either classical epidemiological models or machine learning models for COVID-19 pandemic forecasting, which either suffer from the limitation of the generalization ability and scalability or the lack of surveillance data. In this work, we propose T-SIRGAN that integrates the strengths of the epidemiological theories and deep learning models to be able to represent complex epidemic processes and model the non-linear relationship for more accurate prediction of the growth of COVID-19. T-SIRGAN first adopts the SusceptibleInfectiousRecovered (SIR) model to generate epidemiological-based simulation data, which are then fed into a generative adversarial network (GAN) as adversarial examples for data augmentation. Then, Transformers are used to predict the future trends of COVID-19 based on the generated synthetic data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Benzodiazepines are commonly used for treatment; physostigmine is also effective but is underutilized due to concerns for safety and short duration of action. The objective of this study was to compare lorazepam to physostigmine for the treatment of antimuscarinic delirium and agitation. METHODS This was a blinded, randomized clinical trial in patients presenting for antimuscarinic toxidrome. Inclusion criteria were: 10-<18 years old, at least one central and two peripheral antimuscarinic symptoms, delirium and moderate agitation. Subjects were randomized to either (1) lorazepam bolus (0.05 mg/kg) followed by a 4-h normal saline infusion, or (2) physostigmine 0.02 mg/kg bolus followed by a 4-h physostigmine infusion (0.02 mg/kg/h). Primary outcomes were the control of delirium and agitation after bolus and during the infusion. RESULTS Ten (53%) subjects were enrolled in the lorazepam arm, 9 (47%) in the physostigmine arm. Diphenhydramine was the most common agent ingested (16, 84%). Fewer patients receiving physostigmine had delirium after the initial bolus (44% vs 100%, p = 0.01) and at the 4th hour of infusion (22% vs 100%, p < 0.001) compared to patients who received lorazepam. There was a significant decrease in agitation scores in the physostigmine arm compared to the lorazepam arm after the initial bolus (89% vs 30%, p = 0.02), but no difference at the 4th hour of infusion (p > 0.99). There were no seizures, bradycardia, bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, intubation, or cardiac dysrhythmias. CONCLUSION Physostigmine was superior to lorazepam in controlling antimuscarinic delirium and agitation after bolus dosing, and control of delirium after a 4-h infusion. There were no serious adverse events in either treatment arm. Physostigmine bolus and infusion should be considered in adolescent patients with significant delirium and agitation from antimuscarinic agents.","output":"A randomized trial comparing physostigmine vs lorazepam for treatment of antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) toxidrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical institutions face a lot of problems with insufficient staffing, infrastructure, special materials and equipment during the crisis The health care system depends on government action at the national and regional levels, especially it is about problem-solving strategies and action plans This article is based on a qualitative analysis of the experience of crisis management in connection with the spread of COVID-19 Germany and the Czech Republic have proven the importance of strategic and integrated approaches to good governance It is determined that the centralized management with a possibility of acceptance of local regional decisions by medical establishments is effective in times of crisis It is proved that the crisis causes reorganization of medical institutions, redistribution of functions and responsibilities of medical staff, transformation of the management system and change of strategies Strategic and integrated approaches provide centralized management and involvement of the private sector, institutions and the public in the process of counteracting the consequences of the crisis Management processes and mechanisms are characterized by speed, flexibility and adaptability to changing crisis situations The government is the main regulator in a crisis Education and training, reorganization of medical services and medical institutions, the formation of a digital market, the development of new types of equipment occur as a result of strategic management Strategic management is based on the flexibility and adaptability of the health care system to possible changes The experience of functioning of management mechanisms of medical organizations in the conditions of crisis depends on an initial condition of human resources, physical infrastructure and institutional capacity of authorities at national and regional levels A strategic and comprehensive approach to crisis management in Germany and the Czech Republic proves the effectiveness of counteracting the consequences of the crisis","output":"Mechanisms for managing medical institutions in times of crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For the last 50 years we have known of a broad-spectrum agent tilorone dihydrochloride (Tilorone).

Methods We analyzed in parallel nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs from 87 consecutive patients admitted to our department with moderate to severe COVID-19 by means of quantitative RT-PCR (Cobas, Roche) and up to four antigen tests from different distributors.

To quantify these attributes, we applied the Test for Excess Success (TES) individually to 37 articles that investigate various properties of object-based attention and comprise four or more experiments. A TES analysis estimates the probability that a direct replication of the experiments in a given article with the same sample sizes would have the same success (or better) as the original article.

Single-stranded RNA of MHV, VSV, or cellular origin, a DNA probe of the MHV leader sequence, and double-stranded bovine rotavirus RNA could all bind to N. Binding of MHV RNA was optimal between pH 7 and 8, and the RNA could be eluted in 0.1 M NaCl. The ROPBA is a useful method for the initial identification of RNA-binding proteins, such as N and the 140K protein of murine coronavirus.","output":"RNA-binding proteins of coronavirus MHV: Detection of monomeric and multimeric N protein with an RNA overlay-protein blot assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Traditional in-person Mock Oral Examinations (IP-MOEs) are utilized by surgery residency programs to prepare trainees for the American Board of Surgery Certifying Exam (ABS-CE). However, the COVID-19 Pandemic has led to a profound disruption of on-campus and in-person educational activities, with subsequent instantaneous revolutionization of educational systems all over the world, including a massive switch to virtual platforms. Many in-person didactics and examinations were canceled or rescheduled, including the ABS-CE. The study aims to evaluate Virtual MOEs' (V-MOEs) feasibility as a potential alternative to in-person MOEs in residency programs. METHODS: Twenty-five participants-16 general surgery residents (7 females, 9 males) and 9 faculty - in the inaugural Department of Surgery Virtual Mock Oral Examination completed an anonymous, voluntary online survey via Microsoft Forms. Faculty was given 24 questions, and residents 28, with 9 questions common between both residents and faculty. Participants were asked about the accessibility to virtual examination rooms, V-MOE effectiveness, resident's preparation for the exam, resident's stress, diversity, and number of clinical scenarios, and possible future implementation of, and barriers to, V-MOEs. RESULTS: All participants have participated in IP-MOEs in the past. All faculties were very satisfied or satisfied with IP-MOE, compared to 93.8% of residents. All participants were very satisfied or satisfied with the orientation and instructions before V-MOE. Only 66.6% of faculty, compared to all residents, was satisfied with time allocation for sessions. While 88.9% of faculty felt the V-MOE was less stressful on residents, only 68.8% of residents felt so. Additionally, 87.5% of residents said they prepared for the V-MOE similarly to the IP-MOE. As a future platform, only 22.2% of faculty compared to 43.8% of residents preferred V-MOE over the IP-MOE. Both faculty (88.9%), and residents (81.3%) preferred immediate feedback at the end of sessions. All faculty recommend collaboration with other programs to enhance the resident's preparation. Time constraints, lack of experience with the format, and availability were the top 3 barriers. CONCLUSION: V-MOE is feasible, accessible, and a potential alternative for IP-MOEs at a program level for ABS-CE preparation. Given the time constraints and costs associated with IP-MOEs, it is an opportunity to collaborate with other residency programs.","output":"Virtual Surgery Oral Board Examinations in the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic.

In the United States, COVID-19 disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, with an observed 2-fold higher rate for hospitalization and greater than 2-fold higher rate for death as compared with White Americans. The disparity seen with COVID-19 is consistent with patterns of disparities observed for cancer; it is well documented that 5-year survival rates for multiple cancers are lower in African Americans compared with White Americans. Root cause contributions for the disparity overlap between COVID-19 and cancer. While cancer is a genetic disease that is influenced by tissue microenvironment, COVID-19 is an infectious disease that is enabled by cellular expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors. However, socioeconomic disadvantages, level of education, lifestyle factors, health comorbidities, and limited access to medical care appear to fuel underlying risk for both cancer and COVID-19 disparities. In addition to African Americans demonstrating higher risk of acquiring and dying from either disease, they are underrepresented in clinical trials involving cancer or COVID-19. Long-term disparities are present with survivorship from cancer and may be likely with survivorship from COVID-19; both have revealed untoward effects on postdiagnosis economic viability for African Americans. Collaborative strategies that include community engagement, diverse participation in cancer and COVID-19 clinical trials, providing insurance for affected persons who lost employment due to either disease, and supporting safety-net and public hospitals for health care access will be critical to stem these disparities.","output":"Similarities in Risk for COVID-19 and Cancer Disparities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: One mainstay of soundscape ecology is to understand acoustic pattern changes, in particular the relative balance between biophony (biotic sounds), geophony (abiotic sounds), and anthropophony (human-related sounds). However, little research has been pursued to automatically track these three components. OBJECTIVES: Here, we introduce a 15-year program that aims at estimating soundscape dynamics in relation to possible land use and climate change. We address the relative prevalence patterns of these components during the first year of recording. METHODS: Using four recorders, we monitored the soundscape of a large coniferous Alpine forest at the France-Switzerland border. We trained an artificial neural network (ANN) with mel frequency cepstral coefficients to systematically detect the occurrence of silence and sounds coming from birds, mammals, insects (biophony), rain (geophony), wind (geophony), and aircraft (anthropophony). RESULTS: The ANN satisfyingly classified each sound type. The soundscape was dominated by anthropophony (75% of all files), followed by geophony (57%), biophony (43%), and silence (14%). The classification revealed expected phenologies for biophony and geophony and a co-occurrence of biophony and anthropophony. Silence was rare and mostly limited to night time. CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to track the main soundscape components in order to empirically estimate their relative prevalence across seasons. This analysis reveals that anthropogenic noise is a major component of the soundscape of protected habitats, which can dramatically impact local animal behavior and ecology.

It is believed that under-reporting is a relevant factor in determining the actual mortality rate and, if not considered, can cause significant misinformation. Therefore, this work aims to estimate the under-reporting of cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Brazilian states using data from the InfoGripe. InfoGripe targets notifications of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The methodology is based on the combination of data analytics (event detection methods) and time series modeling (inertia and novelty concepts) over hospitalized SARI cases. The estimate of real cases of the disease, called novelty, is calculated by comparing the difference in SARI cases in 2020 (after COVID-19) with the total expected cases in recent years (2016-2019). The expected cases are derived from a seasonal exponential moving average. The results show that under-reporting rates vary significantly between states and that there are no general patterns for states in the same region in Brazil. The states of Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso have the highest rates of under-reporting of cases. The rate of under-reporting of deaths is high in the Rio Grande do Sul and the Minas Gerais. This work can be highlighted for the combination of data analytics and time series modeling. Our calculation of under-reporting rates based on SARI is conservative and better characterized by deaths than for cases.","output":"Estimation of COVID-19 Under-Reporting in the Brazilian States Through SARI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been accompanied by rising concern of vaccine breakthrough due to SARS-CoV-2 variants, waning protection over time, differential vaccine effectiveness, and regional resurgence of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Characterizing the frequency and drivers of vaccine breakthrough is necessary to inform COVID-19 control efforts. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of vaccine breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated persons in Veterans Health Administration. We applied Cox proportional hazard models to estimate cumulative incidence, assess differences in outcomes by vaccine, and identify associations with individual characteristics as well as time-dependent geographic variation in COVID-19 incidence, proportion of delta variant, and vaccine coverage. Results Among 3,032,561 fully vaccinated persons, documented SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 11,197 (0.37%) and COVID-19 hospitalization occurred in 2,080 (0.07%). Compared to Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 had lower occurrence of documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.58; aHR 0.36; 95% CI 0.33-0.38; respectively ) and COVID-19 hospitalization (aHR 0.56, 95% CI 0.47-0.66; aHR 0.30; 0.25-0.35; respectively). Documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization were associated with younger age, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, number of comorbidities, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regional proportion of delta variant and county-level COVID-19 incidence were predictors of vaccine breakthrough events; county-level vaccine coverage was inversely associated. Conclusions Vaccine breakthrough was rare among fully vaccinated persons. mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 were more protective against documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization compared to Ad26.COV2.S.

METHODS: A patient developed COVID-19 during chemotherapy for glioma. We retrospectively identified others diagnosed with COVID-19 during temozolomide or lomustine for glioma. RESULTS: (1) A 64 year-old woman (index patient) with anaplastic oligodendroglioma received PCV 22 months previously. Baseline White Blood Cell (WBC) count was 4.2 and Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) was 2.7 K/uL. KPS was 90 without comorbidities. For recurrence she initiated temozolomide but developed fever on cycle 1 day 2. SARS-COV-2 PCR was positive. Further temozolomide was held. She is recovering as an outpatient. (2) A 27 year-old man with anaplastic astrocytoma received concurrent RT/temozolomide then 1 cycle of adjuvant temozolomide. Baseline WBC was 8.3, ANC 5.2, and KPS 90. Obesity, asthma, and pre-diabetes were comorbidities. Hyposmia/hypogeusia and low-grade fever began, in retrospect, during concurrent RT/temozolomide. PCR for SARS-COV-2 was negative 2 months after symptom onset; serology detected both IgG and IgM when WBC was 6.6 and ANC 4.0. Cycle 2 of adjuvant temozolomide was held until fever resolved (spontaneously); hyposmia/hypogeusia persist. (3) A 53 year-old man with glioblastoma previously received RT/temozolomide, then lomustine and bevacizumab for progression. WBC was 5.1, ANC 4.0, and KPS 60. He was obese. Fever, chills, and dyspnea developed on lomustine cycle 2 day 38. SARS-COV-2 PCR was positive. He was hospitalized and chemotherapy held; symptoms resolved 12 days after onset, but PCR continued to show detectable virus 32 days later. PCR became negative after 50 days total, and treatment resumed uneventfully. DISCUSSION: All 3 patients recovered from SARS-COV-2 infection despite active temozolomide or lomustine chemotherapy. Normal ANC, high KPS, and early detection may have contributed to limited symptom severity and duration, despite obesity and other comorbidities in 2 cases. Detection changed management by delaying additional cycles of immunosuppressive chemotherapy until recovery.","output":"COVD-20.

Whether its cardiac involvement is a specific feature consisting of myocarditis, or simply due to microvascular injury and systemic inflammation, is yet unclear and presently debated. Because myocardial injury is also common in other kinds of pneumonias, we investigated and compared such occurrence in severe pneumonias due to COVID-19 and other causes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed data from 156 critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation in four European tertiary hospitals, including all n = 76 COVID-19 patients with severe disease course requiring at least ventilatory support, matched to n = 76 from a retrospective consecutive patient cohort of severe pneumonias of other origin (matched for age, gender, and type of ventilator therapy). When compared to the non-COVID-19, mortality (COVID-19 = 38.2% vs. non-COVID-19 = 51.3%, P = 0.142) and impairment of systolic function were not significantly different. Surprisingly, myocardial injury was even more frequent in non-COVID-19 (96.4% vs. 78.1% P = 0.004).

This approach has been successfully implemented across global centers as part of the Benchmark Program. Considering restricted hospital resources resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, a modified same day discharge (SDD) clinical pathway was implemented for selected TAVR patients at a single Benchmark site. METHODS: All patients accepted for TAVR were assessed for the SDD clinical pathway. Eligibility criteria included adequate social support and accessibility to the TAVR program post-discharge. Patients with preexisting conduction disease were excluded. The clinical pathway comprised of mobilization, bloodwork and electrocardiogram 4 hours post-TAVR and discharge 8 hours following groin hemostasis. RESULTS: From June to December 2020, 142 patients underwent TAVR at a single community Benchmark site. Of those, 29 highly selected patients were successfully discharged the same day using the SDD clinical pathway. There were no vascular access complications, permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, or mortality in the SDD group during index admission or at 30-day follow-up.

Attenuation of the virus, designated GA08/GA08HSp16/08, was verified in 1-day-old specific pathogen free chicks. A 10x dose of the vaccine was found to be safe for 2-week-old broiler chicks of commercial origin. The efficacy of the heat-treated attenuated virus was determined by vaccinating broiler chicks of commercial origin at 1 and 14 days of age intraocularly/intranasally. Vaccinated birds that were challenged with 10(4.5) median embryo infectious doses of pathogenic GA08 virus/bird at 28 days of age were protected from the disease, and challenge virus was only detected in the trachea of one of 21 birds by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction at 5 days post challenge. The attenuation process took 10 weeks to complete, which is a substantially shorter time than required to attenuate infectious bronchitis virus by serial passage in embryonated eggs without heat treatment (38 weeks or more).","output":"Rapid heat-treatment attenuation of infectious bronchitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today, the use of technology is a powerful advantage in every field in the society.

The resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can cause multi-organ system dysfunction in patients requiring hospitalisation and intensive care treatment. Serious infections like COVID-19 often negatively affect nutritional status, and the resulting nutritional deficiencies may increase disease severity and impair recovery. One example is the viral infection measles, where associated vitamin A (VA) deficiency increases disease severity and appropriately timed supplementation during recovery reduces mortality and hastens recovery. VA may play a similar role in COVID-19. First, VA is important in maintaining innate and adaptive immunity to promote clearance of a primary infection as well as minimise risks from secondary infections. Second, VA plays a unique role in the respiratory tract, minimising damaging inflammation, supporting repair of respiratory epithelium and preventing fibrosis. Third, VA deficiency may develop during COVID-19 due to specific effects on lung and liver stores caused by inflammation and impaired kidney function, suggesting that supplements may be needed to restore adequate status. Fourth, VA supplementation may counteract adverse effects of SARS-CoV2 on the angiotensin system as well as minimises adverse effects of some COVID-19 therapies. Evaluating interactions of SARS-CoV2 infection with VA metabolism may thus provide improved COVID-19 therapy.","output":"Vitamin A in resistance to and recovery from infection: relevance to SARS-CoV2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Patients (pts) with blood disorders are at particular risk for severe infection and death from COVID-19. Factors that contribute to this risk, including cancer treatment, have not been clearly delineated. The ASH RC COVID-19 Registry for Hematology is a public-facing, volunteer registry reporting outcomes of COVID-19 infection in pts with underlying blood disorders. We report a multivariable analysis of the impact of cancer treatment and other key variables on COVID-19 mortality and hospitalization among pts with blood cancer. METHODS Data were collected between April 1, 2020, and July 2, 2021. All analyses were performed using R version 4.0.2. Multivariable logistic regression explored associations between mortality and seven patient/disease factors previously reported as important to COVID-19 outcome. Independent variables included: age (>60);sex;presence of a major comorbidity (defined as any of heart disease, hypertension, pulmonary disease and/or diabetes);type of hematologic malignancy;estimated prognosis of < 6 months prior to COVID-19;deferral of ICU care;and administration of cancer treatment in the previous year (excluding single agent hydroxyurea). A secondary multivariable logistic regression explored associations between the same variables and hospitalization with COVID-19. RESULTS We included all pts in the registry with a malignant diagnosis except for 3 patients excluded based on a data sharing agreement (N=1029). Median age category was 50-59y (range <5y to > 90y). The sample was 42% female and 28% had major comorbidities. Types of hematologic malignancies were 354 (34%) acute leukemia/MDS, 255 (25%) lymphoma, 206 (20%) plasma cell dyscrasia (myeloma/amyloid/POEMS), 116 (11%) CLL, 98 (10%) myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Most pts (73%) received cancer treatment during the previous year, 9% had a pre-COVID-19 prognosis of <6months, and 10% deferred ICU care. COVID-19 mortality in the entire cohort was 17%. In multivariable analyses, age > 60 (OR 2.03, 1.31-3.18), male sex (OR 1.69, 1.11 - 2.61), estimated pre-COVID-19 prognosis of less than 6 months (OR 6.16, 3.26 - 11.70) and ICU deferral (OR 10.87, 6.36 - 18.96) were all independently associated with an increased risk of death. Receiving cancer treatment in the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and type of hematologic malignancy were not significantly associated with death. In multivariable analyses, age > 60 (OR 2.46, 1.83 - 3.31), male sex (OR 1.34, 1.02 - 1.76), estimated pre-COVID-19 prognosis of < 6 months (OR 4.81, 2.45 - 10.50), presence of a major comorbidity (OR 1.57, 1.15 - 2.16), and cancer treatment in the previous year (OR 1.50, 1.10 - 2.06) were all independently associated with an increased risk of a severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Pts with a MPN or plasma cell dyscrasia and COVID-19 were less likely to require hospitalization for COVID-19 compared to patients with CLL, leukemia/MDS, or lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS These analyses confirm the negative impact of age > 60, male sex, pre-COVID-19 prognosis of < 6 months, and deferral of ICU care on mortality among patients with hematologic malignancy and COVID-19. We did not observe an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality among pts with COVID-19 who received blood cancer treatment in the previous year, although rate of hospitalization was higher. Pts with some hematologic malignancies (MPN, plasma cell dyscrasias), may experience less severe COVID-19 infections than others.

To understand the specificity of Delta-elicited antibody immunity, we characterize the polyclonal antibody response elicited by primary or mRNA vaccine-breakthrough Delta infections. Both types of infection elicit a neutralizing antibody response focused heavily on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). We use deep mutational scanning to show that mutations to the RBDs class 1 and class 2 epitopes, including sites 417, 478, and 484-486 often reduce binding of these Delta-elicited antibodies. The anti-Delta antibody response is more similar to that elicited by early 2020 viruses than the Beta variant, with mutations to the class 1 and 2, but not class 3 epitopes, having the largest effects on polyclonal antibody binding. In addition, mutations to the class 1 epitope (e.g., K417N) tend to have larger effects on antibody binding and neutralization in the Delta spike than in the D614G spike, both for vaccine- and Delta-infection-elicited antibodies.

Infection by this protozoan parasite results in the clinical syndrome trichomoniasis, which manifests as an inflammatory disease with acute and chronic consequences.

At least four distinct viruses have been identified in T. vaginalis to date, constituting species Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1 through Trichomonas vaginalis virus 4 in genus Trichomonasvirus. Despite the global prevalence of these viruses, few complete coding sequences have been reported. We conducted viral sequence mining in publicly available transcriptomes across 60 RNA-Seq accessions representing at least 13 distinct T. vaginalis isolates. The results led to sequence assemblies for 27 novel trichomonasvirus strains across all four recognized species. Using a strategy of de novo sequence assembly followed by taxonomic classification, we additionally discovered six strains of a newly identified fifth species, for which we propose the name Trichomonas vaginalis virus 5, also in genus Trichomonasvirus. These additional strains exhibit high sequence identity to each other, but low sequence identity to strains of the other four species. Phylogenetic analyses corroborate the species-level designations.

METHODS A total of 149 patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy (Hx) were retrospectively investigated. Patients were divided into two groups: the patients with subcuticular suture combined with subcutaneous drainage (the drainage group; 61 patients) and the patients with nylon suture without subcutaneous drainage (the nylon group; 88 patients). After the operations, the complication rate of postoperative incisional SSI was analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS In the drainage group the rate of incisional SSI was significantly lower compared to the nylon group: 14-3 % (p = 0.033), respectively. Patients with incisional SSI needed significantly longer postoperative hospital care than the patients without incisional SSI: 28 versus 15 days (p < 0.005). Multivariate analysis revealed that subcuticular absorbable suture with subcutaneous drainage significantly reduced the occurrence of incisional SSI (odds ratio; 0.15; p = 0.034).

Yet, important questions such as how deadly it is or its degree of spread within different countries remain unanswered. In this work, we exploit the \`universal' growth of the mortality rate with age observed in different countries since the beginning of their respective outbreaks, combined with the results of the antibody prevalence tests in the population of Spain, to unveil both unknowns. We validate these results with an analogous antibody rate survey in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland. We also argue that the official number of deaths over 70 years old is importantly underestimated in most of the countries, and we use the comparison between the official records with the number of deaths mentioning COVID-19 in the death certificates to quantify by how much. Using this information, we estimate the fatality infection ratio (IFR) for the different age segments and the fraction of the population infected in different countries assuming a uniform exposure to the virus in all age segments. We also give estimations for the non-uniform IFR using the sero-epidemiological results of Spain, showing a very similar growth of the fatality ratio with age. Only for Spain, we estimate the probability (if infected) of being identified as a case, being hospitalized or admitted in the intensive care units as function of age. In general, we observe a nearly exponential growth of the fatality ratio with age, which anticipates large differences in total IFR in countries with different demographic distributions, with numbers that range from 1.82\\\\% in Italy, to 0.62\\\\% in China or even 0.14\\\\% in middle Africa.","output":"A scaling approach to estimate the COVID-19 infection fatality ratio from incomplete data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study question: Does the fear of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reduce the desire of infertile couples to continue treatment? Summary answer: Most of the participants in this study wanted to continue treatment. What is known already: The effect of the prevalence of infectious diseases including the Zika virus on the attitude of infertile couples has been studied in very few studies. However, the effect of the outbreak of COVID-19 on the attitude of infertile couples has not been investigated. Study design, size, duration: We conducted a prospective longitudinal study on forty-six infertile couples (n=92) who referred to our infertility clinic from 4 March 2020 through 20 June 2020. Participants/materials, settings, methods: This study is based on potential infertile couples for treatment with assisted reproductive technology (ART) who referred to our infertility clinic, Sari, Iran (median age of 35.5 years). All individuals with primary infertility, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and candidates for ART, were included in the study. People who did not agree to participate in the study were excluded. Subjects were surveyed using a researcher-made questionnaire. This questionnaire has four sections as follows: The first part included demographic information and clinical characteristics, the second part included medical records, the third part included questions related to assessing the level of awareness regarding coronavirus infection, and the fourth part included questions related to the attitude towards continuing infertility treatment. The validity of this questionnaire was assessed by three infertility specialists and was confirmed with Cronbachs alpha of 0.78. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Main results and the role of chance: There is no significant relationship between COVID-19 symptoms and the level of awareness (P-value <0.05). Thirty-two patients (33.33%) had decreased motivation to continue treatment during COVID-19 pandemic. Fear of transmission to the fetus (28.13%) had the highest frequency among the causes of decreased motivation to continue treatment (P-value = 0.011). Confidence in support of the treatment team (56.67%) was the most common reason for lack of motivation in people without decreased motivation (P-value <0.001). The majority of patients had a very high or high tendency (65.22%) to continue or start treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic (P-value <0.001). Most people had an average fear of getting the disease (39.13%) (value <0.001). Examining the relationship between the presence of COVID-19 symptoms and attitude level variables showed that there is only a significant relationship between the greater desire to have a child and the continuation or initiation of treatment with the presence of COVID-19 symptoms (P-value = 0.032). Limitations, reasons for caution: We were not able to fully assess patients' deep feelings and cultural beliefs, due to the use of questionnaires and the lack of interviews. Wider implications of the findings: Our results showed for the first time that patients' knowledge about COVID-19 and trust in the treatment staff played an effective role in selecting and continuing infertility treatment.

Not only has it cost hundreds of thousands of lives but also severely impacted livelihoods and placed enormous strain on community healthcare and welfare services. In this review, we explore the events associated with SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and host immunopathological reactivity due to the clinical manifestations of this coronavirus infection. We discuss that the metallopeptidase enzyme ADAM17, also known as tumor necrosis factor--converting enzyme, TACE, is responsible for shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-6 receptor. This leads to elevated pro-inflammatory responses that result in cytokine storm syndrome. We argue that cytokine balance may be restored by recovering an IL-6 trans-signaling neutralizing buffer system through the mediation of recombinant soluble glycoprotein 130 and recombinant ADAM17/TACE prodomain inhibitor. This cytokine restoration, possibly combined with inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry as well as replication and coagulopathy, could be introduced as a novel approach to treat patients with severe COVID-19. In cases of co-morbidity, therapies related to the management of associated disease conditions could ameliorate those clinical manifestations.","output":"A combinational approach to restore cytokine balance and to inhibit virus growth may promote patient recovery in severe COVID-19 cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: SARS-CoV-2 infection includes a variety of gastrointestinal manifestations along with the usual viral symptoms of malaise and myalgias. The objective of this study was to determine if intravenous parenteral nutrition (PN) affected the risk of intubation in SARS-CoV-2 patients who were dependent on non-invasive ventilation. METHODS: Retrospective, multicenter case-control study which analyzed oxygen requirements for 1974 adults with SARS-CoV-2, who were admitted to the local public hospital system between March 1 and May 17, 2020. Relevant baseline biomarkers were studied over 5 days. The main outcome was an escalation or de-escalation of oxygen requirements relative to the exposure of PN. RESULTS: 111 patients received PN while on non-invasive ventilation. Patients who received PN had a significantly lower odds (p < 0.001) of oxygen escalation in comparison to their control group counterparts (OR = 0.804, 95% CI 0.720, 0.899) when matched for age, body mass index, Charlson comorbidity index, and gender.

While more educated women have been found to improve children's nutrition overall, it is unclear whether they also buffer sibling inequalities in nutritional status. We study the interplay between parental preferences, maternal education, and sibling inequalities in child nutritional status in Ethiopia, the second most populous country in sub-Saharan Africa, with high rates of malnutrition, rapid socio-economic change, urban fertility decline, and low, but increasing female education. We base our analysis on a pooled sample of the 2011/12, 2013/14, and 2015/16 waves of the Ethiopian Socioeconomic Survey using 8275 observations from 4402 children between the age of six months and 9 years old nested in 1687 households. Results from multilevel and fixed effects models show sizable gender and birth order differences in nutritional status. Boys had a better nutritional status than girls and earlier born children had a better nutritional status than later born children, both in terms of height-for-age and weight-for-age. More educated mothers buffered sibling inequalities in nutritional status according to birth order, but not according to gender. The height penalty of being a higher order child disappeared for children whose mothers had about eight years of education or more (primary school finished/some secondary school).

To date, studies of COVID-19 vaccine immune responses in immunocompromised hosts have largely relied on semi-quantitative antibody titers that only partially characterize vaccine-elicited immune responses and do not measure B or T-cell specific responses that may also play a protective role in vaccinees. Here, we report RBD-specific antibody as well as B-cell and T-cell responses in an observational cohort of sixteen CLL subjects who received mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, finding a strong association between CLL treatment and vaccine immunogenicity, with important implications for vaccination timing in the context of CLL treatment or recovery from prior treatment.","output":"Cellular and humoral Immune response to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Returning universities to full on-campus operations while the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing has been a controversial discussion in many countries. The risk of large outbreaks in dense course settings is contrasted by the benefits of in-person teaching. Transmission risk depends on a range of parameters, such as vaccination coverage and efficacy, number of contacts and adoption of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs). Due to the generalised academic freedom in Europe, many universities are asked to autonomously decide on and implement intervention measures and regulate on-campus operations. In the context of rapidly changing vaccination coverage and parameters of the virus, universities often lack sufficient scientific insight to base these decisions on. To address this problem, we analyse a calibrated, data-driven agent-based simulation of transmission dynamics of 10755 students and 974 faculty members in a medium-sized European university. We use a co-location network reconstructed from student enrollment data and calibrate transmission risk based on outbreak size distributions in education institutions.

We aimed to evaluate epidemiological characteristics, needs of resources, outcomes, and global burden of the disease. Methods: Systematic review was performed searching PubMed from December 1, 2019, to March 25, 2020, for full-text observational studies that described epidemiological characteristics, following MOOSE protocol. Global data were collected from the JHU-Corona Virus Resource Center, WHO-COVID-2019 situation reports, KFF.org, and Worldometers.info until March 31, 2020. The prevalence percentages were calculated. The global data were plotted in excel to calculate case fatality rate (CFR), predicted CFR, COVID-19 specific mortality rate, and doubling time for cases and deaths. CFR was predicted using Pearson correlation, regression models, and coefficient of determination. Results: From 21 studies of 2747 patients, 8.4% of patients died, 20.4% recovered, 15.4% were admitted to ICU and 14.9% required ventilation. COVID-19 was more prevalent in patients with hypertension (19.3%), smoking (11.3%), diabetes mellitus (10%), and cardiovascular diseases (7.4%). Common complications were pneumonia (82%), cardiac complications (26.4%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (15.7%), secondary infection (11.2%), and septic shock (4.3%). Though CFR and COVID-19 specific death rates are dynamic, they were consistently high for Italy, Spain, and Iran. Polynomial growth models were best fit for all countries for predicting CFR. Though many interventions have been implemented, stern measures like nationwide lockdown and school closure occurred after very high infection rates (>10cases per 100 000population) prevailed. Given the trend of government measures and decline of new cases in China and South Korea, most countries will reach the peak between April 1-20, if interventions are followed. Conclusions: A collective approach undertaken by a responsible government, wise strategy implementation and a receptive population may help contain the spread of COVID-19 outbreak. Close monitoring of predictive models of such indicators in the highly affected countries would help to evaluate the potential fatality if the second wave of pandemic occurs. The future studies should be focused on identifying accurate indicators to mitigate the effect of underestimation or overestimation of COVID-19 burden.","output":"Early epidemiological indicators, outcomes, and interventions of COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several genetic factors have been related to HIV-1 resistance, the homozygosity for a mutation in CCR5 gene (CCR5 32 allele) is presently considered the most relevant one. The C-type lectin, DC-SIGN efficiently binds and transmits HIV-1 to susceptible cell in trans thereby augmenting the infection. A potential association of the DC-SIGN neck domain repeats polymorphism and risk of HIV-1 infection is currently under debate. METHODS: Genetic risk association study was conducted in HIV-1 exposed seronegative (HES; n = 50) individuals, HIV-1 seronegative (HSN; n = 314) healthy control and HIV-1 infected seropositive patients (HSP; n = 190) for polymorphism in neck domain of DC-SIGN gene. The DC-SIGN genotypes were identified by PCR from DNA extracted from peripheral blood and confirmed by sequencing. Fisher exact or (2) test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: One HSN and HSP individual who were heterozygous (7/8) with respect to DC-SIGN repeat regions were found. The DC-SIGN neck repeat polymorphism among North Indian individuals was not associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, inheritance study of heterozygous mutation (7/8) in HSN individual's family showed that one parent, two brothers, one sister and one daughter were heterozygous (7/8) for DC-SIGN mutant allele. Sequence analyses of DC-SIGN exon 4 repeat region of randomly selected 25 North Indian individuals from HSP, HSN and HES revealed four conserved intronic mutations. These mutations were at nucleotide position 1283, 1306, 1308 upstream and 1906 downstream of the DC-SIGN exon 4 repeat region when compared with the wild type sequence (NCBI Acc. No. AF209479). CONCLUSION: The polymorphism in DC-SIGN neck repeats region was rare and not associated with HIV-1 susceptibility among North Indians.

There is growing evidence that chronic subclinical inflammation is a triggering factor in the origin of T2DM. Increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels have been linked to excess body weight since adipocytes produce tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which are pivotal factors for CRP stimulation. Furthermore, it is known that hepatocytes produce relatively low rates of CRP in physiological conditions compared to T2DM patients, in which elevated levels of inflammatory markers are reported, including CRP. CRP also participates in endothelial dysfunction, the production of vasodilators, and vascular remodeling, and increased CRP level is closely associated with vascular system pathology and metabolic syndrome. In addition, insulin-based therapies may alter CRP levels in T2DM. Therefore, determining and clarifying the underlying CRP mechanism of T2DM is imperative for novel preventive and diagnostic procedures. Overall, CRP is one of the possible targets for T2DM progression and understanding the connection between insulin and inflammation may be helpful in clinical treatment and prevention approaches.","output":"Role of C-Reactive Protein in Diabetic Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For Americans frightened for their own and their familys safety, the Covid-19 pandemic;lockdown in March 2020;release of convicted offenders;protests against the police morphing into weeks of violence and calls to defund them;and a presidential candidate promising to seize their guns has led to record-setting applications for firearms.

Only a limited number of studies have addressed the potential effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mental health so far. Most studies mainly reported the acute onset of mixed neuropsychiatric conditions in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, characterized by agitated behavior, altered level of consciousness, and disorganized thinking, regardless of psychological or socioeconomic triggering factors. The present narrative review aims to analyze and discuss the mechanisms underlying the neuroinvasive/neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent mental complications. Delirium appeared as a clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 brain infection in some patients, without systemic or multiple organ failure symptoms. A small number of studies demonstrated that neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with COVID-19, initially presenting as a confused state, may subsequently evolve in a way that is consistent with the patients neuropsychiatric history. A literature analysis on this topic prevalently showed case reports and case series of patients presenting delirium or delirium-like symptoms as the main outburst of COVID-19, plus a cognitive impairment, from mild to severe, which pre-existed or was demonstrated during the acute phase or after infection. Dementia appeared as one of the most frequent predisposing factors to SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated with delirium. Instead, contrasting data emerged on the potential link between COVID-19 and delirium in patients with cognitive impairment and without a neuropsychiatric history. Therefore, clinicians should contemplate the possibility that COVID-19 appears as delirium followed by a psychiatric exacerbation, even without other systemic symptoms. In addition, cognitive impairment might act as a predisposing factor for COVID-19 in patients with delirium.","output":"Delirium and Cognitive Impairment as Predisposing Factors of COVID-19 Infection in Neuropsychiatric Patients: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loneliness presents a higher risk for mortality than smoking 15 cigarettes per day.

This report presents an effective method of anal lavage and excision in laparoscopic low anterior resection. METHODS The authors developed clamp forceps for intestinal lavage and a Y-shaped vinyl hood that can be operated under pneumoperitoneum for airproof surgery. These devices enabled secure clamping and cleansing of the area and use of automatic suture instruments for open laparotomy through a minilaparotomy wound. The authors called this technique the Y-Hood method and compared its short-term results from May 2005 to October 2008 (n = 28) with those for double-stapling technique surgical cases between September 2000 and October 2008 in which automatic suture instruments were used more than once (n = 107). A multivariate analysis of risk factors for anastomotic leakage also was performed. RESULTS No difference in background factors such as patient sex, age, and tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging were detected. Anastomotic leakage was found in 12 cases that used multiple stapling for rectal transection (11.2%) and 2 cases that used the Y-Hood (7.1%). The cost for rectectomy was 92,505 yen for multiple stapling and 53,107 yen for the Y-Hood (p < 0.0001). As risk factors for anastomotic leakage, multivariate analysis identified the number of times stapling for rectal transection was performed and the height of the anastomotic region. CONCLUSION The Y-Hood method enables operations to be performed within the interior of the pelvis without reducing the number of ports because the instruments can be accessed using minilaparotomy. Because the use of stapling for rectal transection is minimized, this method is effective in avoiding anastomotic leakage and also cost efficient. The Y-Hood method allows for thorough intestinal lavage and safe laparoscopic low anterior resection.","output":"A Y-shaped vinyl hood that creates pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery (Y-hood method.): a new technique for laparoscopic low anterior resection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent progress in generative language models has enabled machines to generate astonishingly realistic texts.

During Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication, the virus rapidly seizes control of host gene expression machinery by triggering a massive RNA decay event via a virally-encoded endoribonuclease, SOX. This virus takeover strategy decimates close to 80% of cellular transcripts, reallocating host resources toward viral replication. The host cell, however, is not entirely passive in this assault on RNA stability. A small pool of host transcripts that actively evade SOX cleavage has been identified over the years. One such escapee, C19ORF66 (herein referred to as Shiftless - SHFL) encodes a potent anti-viral protein capable of restricting the replication of multiple DNA, RNA, and retroviruses including KSHV. Here, we show that SHFL restricts KSHV replication by targeting the expression of critical viral early genes, including the master transactivator protein, KSHV ORF50, and thus subsequently the entire lytic gene cascade. Consistent with previous reports, we found the SHFL interactome throughout KSHV infection is dominated by RNA-binding proteins that influence both translation and protein stability, including the viral protein ORF57, a crucial regulator of viral RNA fate. We next show that SHFL affects cytoplasmic RNA granule formation, triggering the disassembly of processing bodies. Taken together, our findings provide insights into the complex relationship between RNA stability, RNA granule formation, and the anti-viral response to KSHV infection. Significance In the past five years, SHFL has emerged as a novel and integral piece of the innate immune response to viral infection. SHFL has been reported to restrict the replication of multiple viruses including several flaviviruses and the retrovirus HIV-1. However, to date, the mechanism(s) by which SHFL restricts DNA virus infection remains largely unknown. We have previously shown that following its escape from KSHV-induced RNA decay, SHFL acts as a potent anti-viral factor, restricting nearly every stage of KSHV lytic replication. In this study, we set out to determine the mechanism by which SHFL restricts KSHV infection. We demonstrate that SHFL impacts all classes of KSHV genes and found that SHFL restricts the expression of several key early genes, including KSHV ORF50 and ORF57. We then mapped the interactome of SHFL during KSHV infection and found several host and viral RNA-binding proteins that all play crucial roles in regulating RNA stability and translation. Lastly, we found that SHFL expression influences RNA granule formation both outside of and within the context of KSHV infection, highlighting its broader impact on global gene expression. Collectively, our findings highlight a novel relationship between a critical piece of the anti-viral response to KSHV infection and the regulation of RNA-protein dynamics.","output":"Shiftless Restricts Viral Gene Expression and Influences RNA Granule Formation during KSHV lytic replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Since December 2019, the whole world has been affected by coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)]. However, the effects of COVID-19 infection on pregnancy and fetal transmission are still unclear. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate placenta samples regarding detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in women affected with COVID-19. METHOD: This study was a part of a cohort study carried out on pregnant women with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection who had been admitted to the Imam Reza Hospital in Mashhad, Iran, from March 20 to August 5, 2020. Clinical and laboratory information of all the patients was collected and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed. Totally, 16 placental tissue were prepared for real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. All samples were tested by PowerChek PCR real-time kit (South Korea) with 2 target genes (E gene and Rd Rp gene), and Pishtaz Teb kit, (Iran) with 2 target genes (N gene and RdRp gene). RESULT: In the first RT-PCR kit by PowerChek kit, 6 samples were positive for a single gene (E gene) and 2 samples were positive for both genes (E gene and Rd Rp gene). In the second RT-PCR kit by Pishtaz Teb kit, 3 samples were positive for two genes (N gene and RdRp gene). CONCLUSION: This present study showed that infection of placenta with SARS-CoV-2 may occur in pregnancy. However, whether this infection leads to neonatal infection and serious complication in pregnancy remains unclear.","output":"Placental infection with SARS-CoV-2, analysis of 16 cases and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore if and how women perceived their prenatal care to have changed as a result of COVID-19 and the impact of those changes on pregnant women. DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of open-ended prompts included as part of an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey of pregnant women in the United States. SETTING: Online survey with participants from 47 states within the U.S. PARTICIPANTS: Self-identified pregnant women recruited through Facebook, Twitter, and other online sources. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: An anonymous, online survey of pregnant women (distributed April 3 - 24, 2020) included an open-ended prompt asking women to tell us how COVID-19 had affected their prenatal care. Open-ended narrative responses were downloaded into Excel and coded using the Attride-Sterling Framework. 2519 pregnant women from 47 states responded to the survey, 88.4% of whom had at least one previous birth. Mean age was 32.7 years, mean weeks pregnant was 24.3 weeks, and mean number of prenatal visits at the point of the survey was 6.5. Predominant themes of the open narratives included COVID-19's role in creating structural changes within the healthcare system (reported spontaneously by 2075 respondents), behavioral changes among both pregnant women and their providers (reported by 429 respondents), and emotional consequences for women who were pregnant (reported by 503 respondents) during the pandemic. Changes resulting from COVID-19 varied widely by provider, and women's perceptions of the impact on quality of care ranged from perceiving care as extremely compromised to perceiving it to be improved as a result of the pandemic. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Women who are pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic have faced enormous upheaval as hospitals and healthcare providers have struggled to meet the simultaneous and often competing demands of infection prevention, pandemic preparedness, high patient volumes of extremely sick patients, and the needs of 'non-urgent' pregnant patients. In some settings, women described very few changes, whereas others reported radical changes implemented seemingly overnight. While infection rates may drive variable responses, these inconsistencies raise important questions regarding the need for local, state, national, or even global recommendations for the care of pregnant women during a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on prenatal care in the United States: Qualitative analysis from a survey of 2519 pregnant women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computational and mathematical models rely heavily on estimated parameter values for model development. Identifiability analysis determines how well the parameters of a model can be estimated from experimental data. Identifiability analysis is crucial for interpreting and determining confidence in model parameter values and to provide biologically relevant predictions. Structural identifiability analysis, in which one assumes data to be noiseless and arbitrarily fine-grained, has been extensively studied in the context of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, but has not yet been widely explored for age-structured partial differential equation (PDE) models. These models present additional difficulties due to increased number of variables and partial derivatives as well as the presence of boundary conditions. In this work, we establish a pipeline for structural identifiability analysis of age-structured PDE models using a differential algebra framework and derive identifiability results for specific age-structured models. We use epidemic models to demonstrate this framework because of their wide-spread use in many different diseases and for the corresponding parallel work previously done for ODEs. In our application of the identifiability analysis pipeline, we focus on a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected model for which we compare identifiability results for a PDE and corresponding ODE system and explore effects of age-dependent parameters on identifiability.

Our findings also corroborated previous reports that ORF6 blocks the nuclear import of IRF3 and STAT1 to inhibit IFN induction and signaling. Here we show that ORF6 directly interacts with RIG-I and blocks downstream type-I IFN induction and signaling by inhibiting K-63 linked ubiquitination of RIG-I by the E3 Ligase TRIM25. This involves ORF6-mediated targeting of TRIM25 for degradation, also observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The type-I IFN antagonistic activity of ORF6 was mapped to its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, specifically to amino acid residues 52-61.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was added to the panel of viral testing by polymerase chain reaction for the first 2 patients with ILI seen at one of the sentinel sites. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus co-infection with mild symptoms detected through routine ILI surveillance in Egypt. OBJECTIVE: This report aims to describe how the case was identified and the demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes of the patient. METHODS: The case was identified by Central Public Health Laboratory staff, who contacted the ILI sentinel surveillance officer at the Ministry of Health. The case patient was contacted through a telephone call. Detailed information about the patient's clinical picture, course of disease, and outcome was obtained. The contacts of the patient were investigated for acute respiratory symptoms, disease confirmation, and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 510 specimens collected from patients with ILI symptoms from October 2019 to August 2020, 61 (12.0%) were COVID-19-positive and 29 (5.7%) tested positive for influenza, including 15 (51.7%) A(H1N1), 11 (38.0%) A(H3N2), and 3 (10.3%) influenza B specimens. A 21-year-old woman was confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus coinfection. She had a high fever of 40.2 C and mild respiratory symptoms that resolved within 2 days with symptomatic treatment. All five of her family contacts had mild respiratory symptoms 2-3 days after exposure to the confirmed case, and their symptoms resolved without treatment or investigation. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the possible occurrence of SARS-CoV-2/influenza A(H1N1) coinfection in younger and healthy people, who may resolve the infection rapidly. We emphasize the usefulness of the surveillance system for detection of viral causative agents of ILI and recommend broadening of the testing panel, especially if it can guide case management.","output":"Coinfection With SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A(H1N1) in a Patient Seen at an Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Site in Egypt: Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemics of major infectious diseases often cause public health, economic, and social problems. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), as two novel technologies, have been used in many fields for emergency management of disasters. The objective of this paper was to review VR and AR applications in the emergency management of infectious outbreaks with an emphasis on the COVID-19 outbreak. A search was conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, IEEE, Cochrane Library, Google engine, Google scholar, and related websites for papers published up to May 2, 2020. The VR technology has been used for preventing or responding to infections by simulating human behaviors, infection transmission, and pathogen structure as a means for improving skills management and safety protection. Telehealth, telecommunication, and drug discovery have been among the other applications of VR during this pandemic. Moreover, AR has also been used in various industries, including healthcare, marketing, universities, and schools. Providing high-resolution audio and video communication, facilitating remote collaboration, and allowing the visualization of invisible concepts are some of the advantages of using this technology. However, VR has been used more frequently than AR in the emergency management of previous infectious diseases with a greater focus on education and training. The potential applications of these technologies for COVID-19 can be categorized into four groups, i.e., 1) entertainment, 2) clinical context, 3) business and industry, and 4) education and training. The results of this study indicate that VR and AR have the potential to be used for emergency management of infectious diseases. Further research into employing these technologies will have a substantial impact on mitigating the destructive effects of infectious diseases.

As a smoke-free industry, producer services agglomeration (PSA) may have significant impacts on CO(2) emission reduction. Therefore, based on the nightlight data to calculate the CO(2) emissions of 268 cities in China from 2005 to 2017, this study deeply explores the impact and transmission mechanism of PSA on CO(2) emissions by constructing dynamic spatial Durbin model and intermediary effect model. Furthermore, the dynamic threshold model is used to analyze the nonlinear characteristics between PSA and CO(2) emissions under different degrees of government intervention. The results reveal that: (1) Generally, Chinas CO(2) emissions are path-dependent in the time dimension, showing a snowball effect. PSA significantly inhibits CO(2) emissions, but heterogeneous influences exist in different regions, time nodes, and sub-industries; (2) PSA can indirectly curb CO(2) emissions through economies of scale, technological innovation, and industrial structure upgrading. (3) The impact of PSA on Chinas CO(2) emissions has an obvious double threshold effect under different degree of government intervention. Accordingly, the Chinese government should increase the support for producer services, dynamically adjust industrial policies, take a moderate intervention, and strengthen market-oriented reform to reduce CO(2) emissions. This study opens up a new path for the low-carbon economic development and environmental sustainability, and also fills in the theoretical gaps on these issues.

For example, the \\"CFR\\" has been interchangeably called the case fatality ratio, case fatality rate, and case fatality risk, often without standard mathematical definitions. The most commonly used CFR is thecase fatality ratio, typically constructed using the estimated number of deaths to date divided by the estimated total number of confirmed infected cases to date. How does this CFR relate to an infected individual's probability of death? To explore such issues, we formulate both a survival probability model and an associated infection duration-dependent SIR model to define individual- and population-based estimates of dynamic mortality measures to show that neither of these are directly represented by the case fatality ratio. The key parameters that affect the dynamics of different mortality estimates are the incubation period and the time individuals were infected before confirmation of infection. Using data on the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, we estimate and compare the different dynamic mortality estimates and highlight their differences. Informed by our modeling, we propose more systematic methods to determine mortality during epidemic outbreaks and discuss sensitivity to confounding effects and uncertainties in the data such as undertesting and heterogeneous populations.","output":"Why case fatality ratios can be misleading: individual- and population-based mortality estimates and factors influencing them"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has spread world widely and is currently a major healthcare challenge around the world.

The majority of COVID-19 patients either are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Yet, about 15% of the cases experience severe complications and require intensive care. Factors determining disease severity are not yet fully characterized. Aim: Here, we investigated the within-host virus diversity in COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations. Methods: We compared SARS-COV-2 genetic diversity in 19 mild and 27 severe cases. Viral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal samples and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. This was followed by deep-sequencing analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes at both consensus and sub-consensus sequence levels. Results: Consensus sequences of all viruses were very similar, showing more than 99.8% sequence identity regardless of the disease severity. However, the sub-consensus analysis revealed significant differences in within-host diversity between mild and severe cases. Patients with severe symptoms exhibited a significantly (p-value 0.001) higher number of variants in coding and non-coding regions compared to mild cases. Analysis also revealed higher prevalence of some variants among severe cases. Most importantly, severe cases exhibited significantly higher within-host diversity (mean = 13) compared to mild cases (mean = 6). Further, higher within-host diversity was observed in patients above the age of 60 compared to the younger age group.

In the wake of COVID-19, ethics offers a timely conceptual reframing and methodological approach to navigate these diverse values and identities and to reconcile their ensuing policy trade-offs and conflicts. Values and identities denote complex concepts and realities, characterized by plurality, fluidity and dynamics, ambiguity, and implicitness, which often hamper responsive policy-setting and effective governance. Rather than adopt a static characterization of specific value or identity types, I introduce a novel hierarchical conceptualization of values and identities made salient by scale and context. I illustrate how salient values and identities emerge at multiple scales through three seafood COVID-19 contextual examples in India, Canada, and New Zealand, where diverse seafood actors interact within local, domestic (regional/national), and global seafood value chains, respectively. These examples highlight the differential values and identities, and hence differential vulnerabilities, resilience, and impacts on seafood actors with the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitate differentiated policy interventions if they are to be responsive to those affected. An ethical governance framework that integrates diverse marine values and identities, buttressed by concrete deliberation and decision-support protocols and tools, can transform the modus operandi of global seafood systems toward both sustainable and ethical development.","output":"Ethical reflections on the COVID-19 pandemic in the global seafood industry: navigating diverse scales and contexts of marine values and identities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing as an activity aids problem solving, collaboration, and presentation in design, science, and engineering and artistic creativity as well as expression in the arts. Unfortunately, blind, and partially sighted learners still lack an inclusive and effective drawing tool, even in the digital age. In response, this research aims to explore what an effective drawing tool for blind and partially sighted individuals (BPSI) would be. Raised-line drawing kits aim to provide this, but in prior work, our usability tests of raised line graphics with blind and partially sighted participants rated the raised line graphics that we tested as barely comprehensible relative to 3D models, which they rated as highly comprehensible. Semi-structured interviews with our participants afterward suggest that they found 3D models to be more comprehensible because these are consistent with haptic principles of perception whereas conventions of raised line graphics, such as a line representing a surface edge, replicate visual cues of source images and thereby violate haptic principles of perception. Therefore, we hypothesize that a drawing tool for blind and partially sighted drawers could be effective by recruiting affordances of 3D models. Through co-design sessions conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic with blind and partially sighted drawers (BPSD), we prototyped a tangible 3D model construction kit for non-visual haptic drawing with a digital interface to a 3D virtual environment. Our current investigation of user needs is informing us of our ongoing iterative development of an accessible 3D scanning application that is enabling blind and partially sighted individuals to build and scan in 3D models constructed from a more flexible range of materials beyond what was possible with our previous prototype. ? 2022 Owner/Author.","output":"Tangible Construction Kit for Blind and Partially Sighted Drawers: Co-Designing a cross-sensory 3D interface with blind and partially sighted drawers during Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The aim of this review was to comprehensively summarize and analyze the current guidelines on home-based traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) nursing interventions for discharged patients with COVID-19.

Weighting the 7 Rankin levels by utilities may improve scale interpretability while preserving statistical power. METHODS A utility-weighted mRS (UW-mRS) was derived by averaging values from time-tradeoff (patient centered) and person-tradeoff (clinician centered) studies. The UW-mRS, standard ordinal mRS, and dichotomized mRS were applied to 11 trials or meta-analyses of acute stroke treatments, including lytic, endovascular reperfusion, blood pressure moderation, and hemicraniectomy interventions. RESULTS Utility values were 1.0 for mRS level 0; 0.91 for mRS level 1; 0.76 for mRS level 2; 0.65 for mRS level 3; 0.33 for mRS level 4; 0 for mRS level 5; and 0 for mRS level 6. For trials with unidirectional treatment effects, the UW-mRS paralleled the ordinal mRS and outperformed dichotomous mRS analyses. Both the UW-mRS and the ordinal mRS were statistically significant in 6 of 8 unidirectional effect trials, whereas dichotomous analyses were statistically significant in 2 to 4 of 8. In bidirectional effect trials, both the UW-mRS and ordinal tests captured the divergent treatment effects by showing neutral results, whereas some dichotomized analyses showed positive results. Mean utility differences in trials with statistically significant positive results ranged from 0.026 to 0.249. CONCLUSIONS A UW-mRS performs similar to the standard ordinal mRS in detecting treatment effects in actual stroke trials and ensures the quantitative outcome is a valid reflection of patient-centered benefits.","output":"Adopting a Patient-Centered Approach to Primary Outcome Analysis of Acute Stroke Trials Using a Utility-Weighted Modified Rankin Scale."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Birth doulas provide non-medical intimate support to pregnant people and their families This support starts at the very foundation of life - breath Doulas remind, encourage and accompany people through labour by breathing with them However, the global COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted doulas' intimate work, and they are forced to navigate new restrictions surrounding birth practices Based on data collected from a qualitative survey of over five-hundred doulas as well as subsequent follow-up interviews with select doulas, we find intimacy at births disrupted and reshaped We suggest that an analysis of doulas provides a unique way to think through the complexities surrounding reproduction precisely due to doulas' ability to navigate intimate labour between and across boundaries","output":"Practising Intimate Labour Birth Doulas Respond during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 started spreading widely in China in January 2020. Outpatient fever clinics (FCs), instituted during the SARS epidemic in 2003, were upgraded to serve for COVID-19 screening and prevention of disease transmission in large tertiary hospitals in China. FCs were hoped to relieve some of the healthcare burden from emergency departments (EDs). We aimed to evaluate the effect of upgrading the FC system on rates of nosocomial COVID-19 infection and ED patient attendance at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6365 patients were screened in the FC. METHODS: The FC of PUMCH was upgraded on 20 January 2020. We performed a retrospective study of patients presenting to the FC between 12 December 2019 and 29 February 2020. The date when COVID-19 was declared an outbreak in Beijing was 20 January 2020. Two groups of data were collected and subsequently compared with each other: the first group of data was collected within 40 days before 20 January 2020; the second group of data was collected within 40 days after 20 January 2020. All necessary data, including patient baseline information, diagnosis, follow-up conditions and the transfer records between the FC and ED, were collected and analysed. RESULTS: 6365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2912 patients were screened before 21 January 2020, while 3453 were screened afterward. Screening results showed that upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the number of patients who were transferred from the FC to the ED decreased significantly (39.21% vs 15.75%, p<0.001), and patients generally spent more time in the FC (55 vs 203 min, p<0.001), compared with before the outbreak. For critically ill patients waiting for their screening results, the total length of stay in the FC was 22 min before the outbreak, compared with 442 min after the outbreak (p<0.001). The number of in-hospital deaths of critically ill patients in the FC was 9 out of 29 patients before the outbreak and 21 out of 38 after the outbreak (p<0.05). Nineteen cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the FC during the period of this study. However, no other patients nor any healthcare providers were cross-infected. CONCLUSION: The workload of the FC increased significantly after the COVID-19 outbreak. New protocols regarding the use of FC likely helped prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the hospital. The upgraded FC also reduced the burden on the ED.","output":"Identifying the effects of an upgraded 'fever clinic' on COVID-19 control and the workload of emergency department: retrospective study in a tertiary hospital in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital tools are increasingly being applied to support the response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in India and elsewhere globally.

Following the development of tissue culture adapted strains of PDCoV, it is now possible to begin to address questions regarding virus-host cell interactions for this genera of coronavirus. Here we present a detailed study of PDCoV induced replication organelles. All positive strand RNA viruses induce the rearrangement of cellular membranes during virus replication to support viral RNA synthesis, forming the replication organelle. Replication organelles for the Alpha-, Beta- and Gammacoronavirus genera have been characterized. However the structures induced by deltacoronaviruses, in particular the presence of convoluted membranes or double membrane spherules, are unknown. Initially, the dynamics of PDCoV strain OH-FD22 replication were assessed with the onset of viral RNA synthesis, protein synthesis and progeny particle release determined. Subsequently, virus induced membrane rearrangements were identified in infected cells by electron microscopy. As has been observed for all other coronaviruses studied to date, PDCoV replication was found to induce the formation of double membrane vesicles. Significantly however, PDCoV replication was also found to induce the formation of regions of zippered endoplasmic reticulum and small associated tethered vesicles, double membrane spherules.

This sequestration is caused by enhanced lysosomal biogenesis and increased lysosomal numbers in TNBC cells. We developed new CDK4/6 inhibitor compounds that evade the lysosomal sequestration and are efficacious against resistant TNBC. We also show that coadministration of lysosomotropic or lysosome-destabilizing compounds (an antibiotic azithromycin, an antidepressant siramesine, an antimalaria compound chloroquine) renders resistant tumor cells sensitive to currently used CDK4/6 inhibitors. Lastly, coinhibition of CDK2 arrested proliferation of CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant cells.

The success of the global community in the fight against measles through vaccination at the beginning of the twenty-first century allowed WHO to declare the goal of eliminating this infection by 2010. However, ten years later, the problem of the growing incidence of measles has become relevant again for all countries of the world. The pandemic of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has affected all spheres of human life and has exacerbated the situation in the fight against other infections, including those managed with the help of specific prophylaxis. Since the measles contagiosity index and mortality rate are significantly higher than similar characteristics of COVID-19, the risk of increasing the incidence of this infection in the coming years is difficult to overestimate. Aim of the study: to assess the epidemic situation of measles in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the prospects for its development;to propose preventive measures. Materials and methods. The article analyzes the statistical materials available on the official websites of the WHO (WHO). https://www.who.int/data/), the CDC US (https://www. cdc.gov) and the Federal Service of Rospotrebnadzor (https://www.rospotrebnadzor.ru/) on vaccination coverage and measles incidence in 13 countries in the WHO European Region and the United States. The epidemic situation on measles, as well as the level of population coverage with vaccination against its pathogen in the Russian Federation, were assessed according to the Federal State Statistical Observation forms 2010 C 2020: Form 2 ?Information on infectious and parasitic diseases? and Form 6 ?Information on the populations of children and adults vaccinated against infectious diseases?. Results. It has been established that the increase in the measles incidence occurred in 2017C2019 worldwide, including European countries with a population coverage of two vaccine doses at the 97% level between 2010 and 2019. The prevalence of measles cases in children under the age of 10 is shown, as well as the wide range (from 56.9% to 10.9%) in the proportion of vaccinated persons among them. The results obtained indicate the existence of problems in the organization of modern vaccine prevention. The introduction of widespread restrictive and quarantine measures against the COVID-19 pandemic, on the one hand, has reduced the incidence of measles and, on the other hand, has exacerbated the difficulties in implementing measles prevention. Thus, the results indicate a possible increase in measles incidence in the population after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion. It is necessary to immediately develop an action plan to catch up on the coverage and increase the rate of routine vaccination, to improve the statistical record of persons subject to the introduction of the vaccine and vaccinated, as well as to overcome anti-vaccination attitude among the population. ?

The positive strand of segment 1 contains a single open reading frame that extends 1088 codons and possesses 5- and 3-terminal untranslated regions of 18 and 20 bp, respectively. The first AUG conforms to the Kozak consensus sequence and if utilized, would yield a protein having a calculated molecular weight of 124C847, very close to the apparent molecular weight of VP1 (M.W. 125,000). The deduced amino acid sequence presents significant similarities with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of several RNA viruses. VP1 was also synthesized in baculovirus using two transfer vecors: pAC461 and pVL941. Following infection of Sf9 cells with a recombinant baculovirus, a full-length nonfusion protein was synthesised which shares properties with authentic VP1 made in monkey kidney cells. The level of VP1 synthesis was about 10-fold higher when the baculovirus recombinant was derived from the pVL941 transfer vector. In that case, VP1 was expressed in yields approximately equivalent to 10% of the cellular protein.

The aim was to investigate the incidence and outcome of intensive care unit cardiac arrest (ICU-CA) in critically ill patients with COVID-19. This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively recorded data of all consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 admitted (27 February 2020C14 January 2021) at the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (Germany).

As a complex multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problem, the choice of REP involves many influencing factors such as economy, society, and environment. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a social network MCGDM framework based on social network analysis (SNA) and hesitant probabilistic fuzzy set (HPFS). Firstly, the HPFS is introduced into the social network and constructs the hesitant probabilistic fuzzy trust function to represent the trust relationship between decision-makers. Secondly, the trust propagation operator of the hesitant probabilistic fuzzy trust function is constructed using the idea of conditional probability; then a dual feedback mechanism including opinion modification and weight adjustment is proposed to improve the group consensus level.

The majority of respondents reported some work, either professional or personal associated with the pandemic, and the majority felt prepared to do this work, although it caused additional work responsibilities with no additional pay. Many had to work from home during the pandemic, using technology to accomplish their tasks. Most reported conducting education and prevention and designing and implementing communication strategies regarding the pandemic. Those with MCHES certification were more likely to use the NCHEC competencies in their work and more likely to perform listed COVID-19 activities, with the exception of contact tracing and direct care to COVID-19 patients, which were more likely conducted by CHES certified HES. Results of this study show the significant level of involvement of HES in the COVID-19 pandemic in a variety of roles and capacities, despite a challenging political landscape during the time the survey was administered. Many HES reported volunteer work in addition to their paid work, including donating money, distributing food, or making masks. Finally, HES welcomed more training on COVID-19 and use of technology.

The ideal solution professional translation is high-priced, mainly because of issues associated with ongoing cost burden, administrative/legal implications, and the challenge of finding available translators for every unique language pairs. Citizen translation can potentially help to break down the communication barriers between emergency authorities and people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) background. However, emergency authorities in many countries are still sceptical about relying on non-professional citizen translators to engender emergency messaging in multiple languages. This paper presents new findings from an Australian case study to further establish the evidence base required to support a successful implementation of citizen translation. This qualitative research contributes by investigating how members of CALD communities respond to the messages or warnings issued by emergency authorities, including the implications that the observed responses have for implementing citizen translation of emergency messages. A distinct form of citizen translation, known as the Collaborative Translation of Emergency Messages (Co-TEM), is proposed along with its underlying principles for specifically delivering the translation of official warnings or emergency messages. The study reports on key findings from Co-TEM that could further strengthen or extend existing knowledge in citizen translation. It was observed that while citizen translators could successfully translate emergency messages, a major threat to Co-TEM is that the official messages to be translated are sometimes flawed with jargons, ambiguity and lack of clarity.

Sera obtained 3 months after double BNT162b2 vaccination exhibit approximately 18-fold lower neutralization titers against Omicron than parental virus. Convalescent sera from Alpha and Delta patients allow similar levels of breakthrough by Omicron. Domain-wise analysis using chimeric spike revealed that this efficient evasion was primarily achieved by mutations clustered in the receptor-binding domain, but that multiple mutations in the N-terminal domain contributed as well.

Application of the multi-omics system biology approaches including biological network analysis in elucidating the complex host-viral response, allow for interrogating the viral pathogenesis. The present study aimed to fingerprint the system-level alterations during acute CCHFV-infection and the cellular immune responses during productive CCHFV-replication in vitro. We used system-wide network-based system biology analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a longitudinal cohort of CCHF patients during the acute phase of infection and after one year of recovery (convalescent phase) and untargeted quantitative proteomics analysis of the most permissive CCHFV-infected Huh7 and SW13 cells. In the RNAseq analysis of the PBMCs, comparing the acute and convalescent-phase, we observed system-level hosts metabolic reprogramming towards central carbon and energy metabolism (CCEM) with distinct upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during CCHFV-infection. Upon application of network-based system biology methods, negative coordination of the biological signaling systems like FOXO/Notch axis and Akt/mTOR/HIF-1 signaling with metabolic pathways during CCHFV-infection were observed. The temporal quantitative proteomics in Huh7 showed a dynamic change in the CCEM over time and was in agreement with the cross-sectional proteomics in SW13 cells. By blocking the two key CCEM pathways, glycolysis and glutaminolysis, viral replication was inhibited in vitro. Activation of key interferon stimulating genes during infection suggested the role of type I and II interferon-mediated antiviral mechanisms both at system-level and during progressive replication. Significance Statement A combination of multi-modal systems-wide host-immune response and in vitro temporal analysis identified molecular re-arrangement in CCEM and fingerprinting the interferon-mediated antiviral mechanism during CCHFV-infection. Using the newly gained insights, we then modulated the key pathways of CCEM by drugs and inhibited the productive CCHFV-replication in in vitro infection models. Our study thus provides a comprehensive, system-level picture of the regulation of cellular and metabolic pathways during productive CCHFV-infection for the first time that aids in identifying novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies.","output":"Multi-omics insights into host-viral response and pathogenesis in Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses for novel therapeutic target"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To discuss the Nursing Now Campaign and the role of Nursing in times of pandemic by COVID-19.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors construct three separate indices, namely, supervisory board index, audit index and risk governance index to measure the governance practices of commercial banks. A slacks-based data envelopment analysis technical efficiency (TE) measure, a variable returns to scale cost efficiency model and Malmquist productivity index are employed to determine TE, cost efficiency and productivity change, respectively. A two-step system-generalized method of moments estimation accounts for the dynamic relationship between governance and efficiency. Findings: The authors show that strict audit and risk governance mechanisms are associated with better efficiency and productivity levels. However, consistent with the free-rider hypothesis, large, independent and diverse boards lead to cost inefficiencies. Strict risk governance structures circumvent the negative effects of high regulatory capital and improve efficiency and total factor productivity. However, friendly boards do not perform efficiently in the presence of regulatory capital, implying that incentives arising from maintaining high levels of equity capital make them more susceptible to risk-taking, and board composition is unable to sidestep this behaviour.

Hence, several mouse models with experiments on macrophages were conducted to explore the sources, influences, and impacts of bacteria-free DNA in sepsis. First, bacteria-free DNA and bacteriome in blood were demonstrated in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis mice. Second, administration of bacterial lysate (a source of bacterial DNA) in dextran sulfate solution (DSS)-induced mucositis mice elevated blood bacteria-free DNA without bacteremia supported gut translocation of free DNA. The absence of blood bacteria-free DNA in DSS mice without bacterial lysate implies an impact of the abundance of bacterial DNA in intestinal contents on the translocation of free DNA. Third, higher serum cytokines in mice after injection of combined bacterial DNA with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), when compared to LPS injection alone, supported an influence of blood bacteria-free DNA on systemic inflammation. The synergistic effects of free DNA and LPS on macrophage pro-inflammatory responses, as indicated by supernatant cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, and IL-10), pro-inflammatory genes (NFB, iNOS, and IL-1), and profound energy alteration (enhanced glycolysis with reduced mitochondrial functions), which was neutralized by TLR-9 inhibition (chloroquine), were demonstrated. In conclusion, the presence of bacteria-free DNA in sepsis mice is partly due to gut translocation of bacteria-free DNA into the systemic circulation, which would enhance sepsis severity. Inhibition of the responses against bacterial DNA by TLR-9 inhibition could attenuate LPS-DNA synergy in macrophages and might help improve sepsis hyper-inflammation in some situations.","output":"Blood Bacteria-Free DNA in Septic Mice Enhances LPS-Induced Inflammation in Mice through Macrophage Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging pandemical virus that has caused millions of reported cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths in less than six months. South America has suffered the pandemic because it lacks the hospital and economic capacities needed to contain the pandemic's advance. Public health implications of transmission, while asymptomatic is a critical concern at the current pandemic. Objective: Describe the socio-demographic, clinical, and viral kinetics features of a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals from the Colombian Caribbean. Methods: : Six hundred eighty-six clinical samples from several hospital centers in the province were received between April 9th and May 16th, 2020. RNA was extracted using lysis buffers and spin columns. The samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR (Reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction) using commercially available multiplex real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection of 3 target genes of SARS-CoV-2 (AllplexTM, 2019-nCoV assay, Korea). Viral copies quantification was done using a standard curve constructed from seriated dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 positive control. Results: : Thirty-five nasopharyngeal samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection;the average age was 43 (range, 1-95 years). Seventeen of 35 (49%) of the patients showed symptoms. Most of them had cough, fever, and odynophagia, 3 of the patients reported having arthralgia. Only two patients required hospitalization. None of the patients had known co-morbidities. RT-qPCR results show that two of the symptomatic patients had significantly higher RNA copies than the rest of the patients. Eighteen of 35 (51%) individuals were asymptomatic, the average age was 30 (range, 6-61 years. Four individuals showed a higher copy than some symptomatic patients. Nonetheless, the average of RNA copies 8.26 x10+10 was lower than the symptomatic. Conclusions: : the population studied was young with an average of 43 years in symptomatic and 30 years of asymptomatic;this is important because of the high impact in the economy, and probably it is the cause of the reduced lethality observed in the department. Because a large proportion of infections probably result from transmission from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic persons, the usefulness of public health interventions in Colombian provinces should be based in the molecular screening in a vast conglomerate's population and to quantify the viral load.","output":"High Number of RNA Copies in Asymptomatic Individuals Infected with SARS-CoV-2 in an Area of the Colombian Caribbean"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS?CoV?2-induced severe acute respiratory syndrome is associated with high mortality in the general population; however, the data on chronic haemodialysis (HD) patients are currently scarce. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with SARS?CoV?2-induced interstitial pneumonia diagnosed by PCR test and detected by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). For each patient, we calculated a CT score between 0 and 24, based on the severity of pneumonia. The primary outcome was the onset of ARDS, detected by P/F ratio >200. We included 57/90 HD patients (age: 66.5 13.4 years, 61.4 % males, 42.1% diabetics, 52.6% CV disease) treated at the Cardarelli Hospital in Naples (Italy) from 1st September 2020 to 31st March 2021. All patients were treated with intermittent HD. Results: Patients who experienced ARDS had a more severe pneumonia (CT score: 15 [C.I.95%:10-21] in ARDS patients vs 7 [C.I.95%: 1-16] in no ARDS; P=0.015). Logistic regression showed that the CT score was the main factor associated with the onset of ARDS (1.12; 95% c.i.: 1.00-1.25), independently from age, gender, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and prior CV disease. Thirty-day mortality was much greater in ARDS patients (83,3%) than in no-ARDS (19.3%). Conclusions: This retrospective analysis highlights that HD patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia show an increased risk of developing ARDS, dependent on the severity of CT at presentation. This underlines once again the need for prevention strategies, in primis the vaccination campaign, for these frail patients.","output":"[Acute severe respiratory distress in chronic haemodialytic patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: prevalence and associated factors.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study conducted in the hub COVID-19 center in Milan (Italy), between March and June 2020. All patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care unit on invasive mechanical ventilation and treated with prone positioning were included. Association between prone-related pressure ulcers and selected variables was explored by the means of logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 219 proning cycles were performed on 63 patients, aged 57.6 (10.8) and predominantly obese males (66.7%). The main complications recorded were: prone-related pressure ulcers (30.2%), bleeding (25.4%) and medical device displacement (12.7%), even if none unplanned extubation was recorded. Bleeding of upper airways represented the most common site (17.5%). Only 15 prone positioning cycles (6.8%) were interrupted, requiring staff to roll the patient back in the supine position. The likelihood of pressure ulcers development was independently associated with the duration of prone positioning, once adjusting for age, hypoxemic level, and nutritional status (OR 1.9, 95%CI 1.04 to 3.6).

It presents a novel application of cultural-historical activity theory to reinterpret evidence on widespread learning loss and increasing educational inequities resulting from the pandemic, and to identify scalable transformative learning opportunities through reframing the crisis as a double stimulation. By reviewing evidence of the emerging educational landscape, we first develop a picture of the new problem space upon which schools must act. We develop a problem space map to serve as the first stimulus to articulate local challenges. Integrating this problem space with research on professional change, we identify conceptual tools to capture learning gaps and implement pedagogic interventions at scale, in order to enhance schools agency in directly addressing the crisis. These tools can act as the second stimulus, enabling educators to address local challenges. We conclude by discussing the Covid-19 educational crisis as a unique stimulus for professional learning and outline the potential for durable shifts in educational thinking and practice beyond the pandemic. We argue that this unprecedented historic disruption can be harnessed as a transformative professional learning opportunity. In particular, we consider how research on professional change offers local, scalable interventions and tools that can support educators in preventing the new insights from slipping away post-pandemic. Utilising the notions of boundaries and tool-mediated professional change, we examine the ways in which this disruption generates opportunities to envision alternative futures for equitable learning in school.","output":"The Covid-19 Learning Crisis as a Challenge and an Opportunity for Schools: An Evidence Review and Conceptual Synthesis of Research-Based Tools for Sustainable Change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the virus namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a substantial loss not only to human lives but also to public, healthcare systems and global economy.

Due to the enormous number of people who have been unaware until now, the development of COVID-19s second-wave infection has become a severe threat. The present investigation aimed to characterize the clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was carried out from all the other COVID-19 patients and confirmed by RT-PCR undergoing a specialized COVID-19 hospital. From March 1 to April 15, 2021, a total of 1326 samples were collected. Samples were only obtained from non-critical COVID-19 patients as critically ill patients required emergency intensive care medications. Then, from April 17 to May 03, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical assessment was performed based on interim guidelines from the WHO. The diagnosis was conducted through RT-PCR. Later, identifying the symptomatic and asymptomatic patient based on checking the Clinical Observation Form (COF). The patients filled the COF form. Finally, statistical analyses were done using the SPSS 20 statistical program. RESULTS: In this investigation, a total of 326 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive. Among them, approximately 19.02% (n = 62) were asymptomatic, and 80.98% (n = 264) were symptomatic. Here, the finding shows that the occurrence of this infection was varied depending on age, sex, residence, occupation, smoking habit, comorbidities, etc. However, Males (60.12%) were more affected than females (39.88%), and, surprisingly, this pandemic infected both urban and rural residents almost equally (urban = 50.92%; rural = 49.08%). Approximately 19% of the asymptomatic and 62% of symptomatic cases had at least one comorbid disorder. Interestingly, an unexpected result was exhibited in the case of smokers, where non-smokers were more affected than smokers. The study indicates community transmission of COVID 19, where people were highly infected at their occupations (35.58%), at houses (23.93%) and by traveling (12.88%). Noteworthy, according to this report, a large number (19.33%) of individuals did not know exactly how they were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were most commonly treated by an antibiotic 95.09%, followed in second by corticosteroid 46.01%. Anti-viral drugs, remdesivir, and oxygenation are also needed for other patients. Among those, who were being treated, approximately 69.33% were isolated at home, 27.91% were being treated at dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. Finally, 96.63% were discharged without complications, and 0.03% has died. CONCLUSION: This investigation concludes that males became more infected than females. Interestingly, both urban and rural people became nearly equally infected. It noticed community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, where people were highly infected at their workplaces. A higher rate of silent transmission indicates that more caution is needed to identify asymptomatic patients. Most of the infected people were isolated at home whereas nearly one-fourth were treated at hospitals. Clinically, antibiotics were the most widely used treatment. However, the majority of the patients were discharged without complications.

The content and follow-up indicators of visit protocols (number of visits, of outbreaks, inpatients, etc.) and of their context were provided. The empirical outbreak probabilities were calculated, and hypothesis contrast was performed against no-visits (0%) and no visit-control (7-day cumulative incidence/habitant). RESULTS Two protocols were created. Accompanying was applied to Palliative Care cases (no appointments required, no time limits), and a short visits protocol was applied to the other patients (appointments for 1 weekly visit for 1-2 persons were given and visits last up to 45 minutes). In both protocols, visitors with symptoms or fever or particularly susceptible were forbidden entrance.

When passengers are transported from an airport terminal to an airplane using apron buses, safe social distancing during pandemic times reduces the capacity of the apron buses and has led to the practice of airlines keeping the middle seats of the airplanes unoccupied. This article adapts classical boarding methods so that they may be used with social distancing and apron buses. We conduct stochastic simulation experiments to assess nine adaptations of boarding methods according to four performance metrics. Three of the metrics are related to the risk of the virus spreading to passengers during boarding. The fourth metric is the time to complete boarding of the two-door airplane when apron bus transport passengers to the airplane. Our experiments assume that passengers advancing to their airplane seats are separated by an aisle social distance of 1 m or 2 m. Numerical results indicate that the three variations (adaptations) of the Reverse pyramid method are the best candidates for airlines to consider in this socially distanced context. The particular adaptation to use depends on an airline's relative preference for having short boarding times versus a reduced risk of later boarding passengers passing (and thereby possibly infecting) previously seated window seat passengers. If an airline considers the latter risk to be unimportant, then the Reverse pyramid - Spread method would be the best choice because it provides the fastest time to board the airplane and is tied for the best values for the other two health risk measures.","output":"Evaluation of Boarding Methods Adapted for Social Distancing When Using Apron Buses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assessing the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to inform future preparedness response plans.

COVID-19 patients demonstrated significantly different outcomes in clinic. We aimed to figure out whether obesity is a risk factor influencing the progression and prognosis of COVID-19. METHODS: 95 patients with COVID-19 were divided into obesity group and non-obesity group according to their body mass index (BMI). The demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory examination, and chest computed tomography (CT) were collected, analyzed and compared between two groups. RESULTS: Our data showed that COVID-19 patients with obesity had more underlying diseases and higher mortality rate compared to those without obesity.

Since macrophages act as the important defense line against invading pathogens in host innate immunity, we investigated the function and innate immune responses of chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after ALV-J infection in this study. Our results indicated that ALV-J was stably maintained in MDM cells but that the viral growth rate was significantly lower than that in DF-1 cells. We also found that ALV-J infection significantly increased nitric oxide (NO) production, but had no effect on MDM phagocytic capacity. Interestingly, infection with ALV-J rapidly promoted the expression levels of Myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx) (3 h, 6 h), ISG12 (6 h), and interleukin-1 (IL-1) (3 h, 12 h) at an early infection stage, whereas it sharply decreased the expression of Mx (24 h, 36 h), ISG12 (36 h), and made little change on IL-1 (24 h, 36 h) production at a late infection stage in MDM cells. Moreover, the protein levels of interferon- (IFN-) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) had sharply increased in infected MDM cells from 3 to 36 h post infection (hpi) of ALV-J. And, the protein level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) was dramatically decreased at 36 hpi in MDM cells infected with ALV-J. These results demonstrate that ALV-J can induce host innate immune responses and we hypothesize that macrophages play an important role in host innate immune attack and ALV-J immune escape.","output":"ALV-J strain SCAU-HN06 induces innate immune responses in chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 is a serious respiratory virus pandemic. Patient characteristics, knowledge of the COVID-19 disease, risk behaviour and mental state will differ between individuals. The primary aim of this study was to investigate these variables in patients visiting an emergency department in the Netherlands during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare the \\"COVID-19 suspected\\" (positive and negative tested group) with the \\"COVID-19 not suspected\\" (control group) and to compare in the \\"COVID-19 suspected\\" group, the positive and negative tested patients. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients, visiting the emergency room at the Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were asked to fill out questionnaires on the abovementioned items on an iPad. The patients were either \\"COVID-19 suspected\\" (positive and negative tested group) or \\"COVID-19 not suspected\\" (control group). RESULTS: This study included a total of 159 patients, 33 (21%) tested positive, 85 (53%) negative and 41 (26%) were COVID-19 not suspected (control group). All patients in this study were generally aware of transmission risks and virulence and adhered to the non-pharmaceutical interventions. Working as a health care professional was correlated to a higher risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection (p- value 0.04). COVID-19 suspected patients had a significantly higher level of anxiety compared to COVID-19 not suspected patients (p-value < 0.001). The higher the anxiety, the more seriously hygiene measures were followed. The anxiety scores of the patients with (pulmonary) comorbidities were significantly higher than without comorbidities. CONCLUSION: This is one of the first (large) study that investigates and compares patient characteristics, knowledge, behaviour, illness perception, and mental state with respect to COVID-19 of patients visiting the emergency room, subdivided as being suspected of having COVID-19 (positive or negative tested) and a control group not suspected of having COVID-19. All patients in this study were generally aware of transmission risks and virulence and adhered to the non-pharmaceutical interventions. COVID-19 suspected patients and patients with (pulmonary) comorbidities were significantly more anxious. However, there is no mass hysteria regarding COVID-19. The higher the degree of fear, the more carefully hygiene measures were observed.

Learning to critically reflect on the use of mathematics, including the acquisition of the mathematical knowledge and skills required to that end, has been repeatedly postulated as an indispensable goal of compulsory education in mathematics. However, it remained unclear in how far such reflection is possible, even for the well-educated layperson in mathematics. We use different discussions in German mass media on the pandemic policy in the SARS-CoV-2 crisis in 2020 as examples with far-reaching individual and social consequences. The selected discussions build heavily on mathematical concepts such as mortality rates, casualty numbers, reproduction numbers, and exponential growth. We identify the concepts and discuss how far they can be understood by laypersons. On the one hand, we found that some mathematical models are inappropriate, which can also be determined by laypersons. On the other hand, we found uses of mathematics where ideal concepts are intermingled with complex statistical concepts. While only the ideal concepts can be understood by laypersons, only the statistical concepts lead to actual data. The identification of both types of concepts leads to a situation where the use of mathematics evades social control and opens spaces for misconceptions and manipulation.

The chemokine receptor CCR2 plays an important role in macrophage recruitment and in the development of T1 immunity. In the present study, we addressed the role of CCR2 in influenza A virus infection. CCR2 knockout (-/-) mice are protected against influenza A virus infection, despite delayed recruitment of macrophages. We show that low-dose influenza infection of CCR2-/- mice leads to increased neutrophilia between Days 5 and 10 after infection and decreased monocyte/macrophage and CD4(+) T cell recruitment to the lungs between Days 5 and 7 after infection. These changes in leukocyte recruitment did not result from or cause increased viral titers or delayed viral clearance. Neutrophilia in the lungs correlated with increased keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and/or MIP-2 expression in CCR2-/- mice between Days 5 to 10 after infection, although the kinetics of neutrophil recruitment was not altered. MIP-2 mRNA and protein expression was increased three- to fivefold, and KC protein levels were increased two- to threefold in CCR2-/- compared with CCR2 wild-type mice at Day 5 after infection. This preceded the peak neutrophil influx, which occurred 7 days after infection. In vitro studies confirmed that MIP-2 and KC accounted for neutrophil chemotactic activity in the bronchoalveolar lavage. CCR2 deficiency also resulted in increased MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MCP-1, and IFN-inducible protein 10 and decreased RANTES mRNA expression. Furthermore, IL-6 and TNF-alpha cytokine production were elevated after infection. These studies suggest that CCR2 plays a multifactorial role in the development of the immune response to influenza.","output":"Chemokine regulation of the inflammatory response to a low-dose influenza infection in CCR2-/- mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is currently an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan, China.

In light of public health recommendations and the need to offer safe learning environments, many programs have drawn upon virtual technologies to continue delivery of formal academic curricula. Despite widespread use, however, little is currently known as to how trainees view these changes. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to explore resident perceptions on the COVID-19-influenced shift from in-person to virtual academic half day (AHD) delivery. DESIGN/METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was created and distributed to 51 pediatric residents who participated in virtual AHD at a university-affiliated Canadian program distributed across three sites, from March to June 2020. Survey responses were obtained confidentially through a secure, online platform (REDCap). Descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis were used to analyze responses to close-ended questions and narrative comments, respectively. RESULTS: Response rate was 60.8%. Residents reported statistically significant improvement in their attitudes towards virtual AHD across all metrics collected. Areas most strongly rated included increased trainee engagement and overall satisfaction with virtual delivery, in part due to increased relevance of content. Factors enabling participation included educationally safe interactions and a more comfortable and flexible learning environment. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the transition to virtual AHD was generally well received. During an uncertain time, when trainee vulnerability is heightened, the need to explicitly attend to educational issues of relevance, engagement, safety, and comfort are crucial. Further, given the rapid and reactive pivots to new curricular strategies in the wake of COVID-19, it is incumbent upon programs to incorporate resident feedback to ensure a learner-centred environment is maintained.

Despite this evidence, the immunologic effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy remain understudied. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy on inflammatory and humoral responses in maternal and fetal samples and compare antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among pregnant and nonpregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were analyzed using samples from pregnant (n=33) and nonpregnant (n=17) women who tested either positive (pregnant, 22; nonpregnant, 17) or negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (pregnant, 11) at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We measured proinflammatory and placental cytokine messenger RNAs, neonatal Fc receptor expression, and tetanus antibody transfer in maternal and cord blood samples. In addition, we evaluated antispike immunoglobulin G, antispike receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G, and neutralizing antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in serum or plasma collected from nonpregnant women, pregnant women, and cord blood. RESULTS: Pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection expressed more interleukin-1 beta, but not interleukin 6, in blood samples collected within 14 days vs >14 days after performing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test. Pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection also had reduced antispike receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G titers and were less likely to have detectable neutralizing antibody than nonpregnant women. Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection did not disrupt neonatal Fc receptor expression in the placenta, maternal transfer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 neutralizing antibody was inhibited by infection during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy was characterized by placental inflammation and reduced antiviral antibody responses, which may impact the efficacy of coronavirus disease 2019 treatment in pregnancy.

Negative controls were established while the phacoemulsification machine was not running. METHODS: The DustTrak was used to measure particulate matter (PM) mass fractions for each of three particle sizes, PM1, PM2.5, and PM4 (in microns), every 2 seconds during surgery and for one minute after. The main outcome measure was an increase in the mass fraction of aerosolized particles of various sizes. RESULTS: There was no significant aerosolization of particles during cataract surgery for both the 2.4 and 2.75mm wound sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Phacoemulsification cataract surgery was not found to be an AGMP. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, ophthalmologists can continue to use droplet precautions while performing this surgery.","output":"Quantification of Aerosol Generation During Cataract Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance During the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, telehealth has become a vital component of health care delivery. For otolaryngology evaluations, examination of the ear and oropharynx is important but difficult to achieve remotely. Objective To assess the feasibility of patient use of low-cost digital videoscopes and smartphones for examination of the ear and oropharynx. Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective quality improvement study was conducted in an academic adult otolaryngology clinic including 23 patients who presented for an in-person appointment and owned a smartphone device. The study was conducted from July 1 to 15, 2020. Interventions Participants were asked to capture pictures and videos of their ear canals and oropharynx with digital videoscopes and their smartphones under real-time guidance over a telehealth platform. They were then surveyed about their experience. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were ratings by health care clinicians and a blinded otolaryngologist reviewer of image acceptability. Secondary outcomes included participant time to image acquisition and willingness to purchase digital videoscopes for telehealth use. Results Of the 23 participants included, 14 were women (61%); mean age was 50 years (range, 21 to 80 years). Of the images obtained using the digital otoscope ear examination, 95% were considered acceptable by the health care clinicians and 91% were considered acceptable by the blinded reviewer; 16 participants (70%) reported that the otoscope was easy to use. The mean time to acquire images for both ears was 114 seconds (95% CI, 84-145 seconds). Twenty-one participants (91%) were willing to pay for a digital otoscope for telehealth use. For the oropharyngeal examination, a greater proportion of smartphone video examinations were considered acceptable by clinicians (63% acceptability) and the blinded reviewer (55%) compared with the digital endoscope (clinicians, 40%; blinded reviewer, 14%). The mean time required for the oropharyngeal examination smartphone video capture was shorter at 35 seconds compared with both the digital endoscope (difference, -27 seconds; 95% CI, -7 to -47 seconds) and smartphone photo capture (difference, -53 seconds; 95% CI, -20 to -87 seconds). Conclusions and Relevance Digital otoscopes and smartphones apparently can facilitate remote head and neck physical examination in telehealth. Digital otoscopes were useful for ear examinations, and smartphone videos appeared to be the most useful for oropharyngeal examinations. Further studies are required to determine specific diagnostic capabilities in various telehealth practice settings.","output":"Patient Use of Low-Cost Digital Videoscopes and Smartphones for Remote Ear and Oropharyngeal Examinations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recently emerged novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is phylogenetically related to bat coronaviruses (CoVs), specifically SARS-related CoVs from the Eurasian bat family Rhinolophidae. As this human pandemic virus has spread across the world, the potential impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on native North American bat populations are unknown, as is the ability of North American bats to serve as reservoirs or intermediate hosts able to transmit the virus to humans or to other animal species. To help determine the impacts of the pandemic virus on North American bat populations, we experimentally challenged big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) with SARS-CoV-2 under BSL-3 conditions. We inoculated the bats both oropharyngeally and nasally, and over the ensuing three weeks we measured infectivity, pathology, virus concentrations in tissues, oral and rectal virus excretion, virus transmission, and clinical signs of disease. We found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in any examined bat, including no viral excretion, no transmission, no detectable virus in tissues, and no signs of disease or pathology. Based on our findings it appears that big brown bats are resistant to infection with the SARS-CoV-2.

CF is a genetic disorder caused by more than 1700 different mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene resulting in a wide spectrum of disease phenotypes. As the majority of individuals with CF have chronic lung disease, this population is considered to be high risk for severe disease if infected with any virus, especially that of SARS-CoV 2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). As the number of cases in the US nears 18 million and the number of deaths in the US is currently reported at greater than 318,000, the prevalence of COVID-19 in the CF population remains largely unknown although the clinical course for those infected is becoming more clear. To date, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation reported 344 cases of COVID-19 in the US and 3 people who have died, giving a case fatality rate of 0.9%. METHODS: Early in the course of the pandemic, we began studying the exposures, and symptoms of people with CF to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 IgG antibody in patients who receive care at the MN CF Center. Individuals &gt;/= 12 years of age completed a brief, online survey detailing possible exposures, symptoms of COVID-19, and behavioral data (e.g. social distancing practices). We extracted additional data through the electronic medical record (EMR) to identify risk factors for COVID-19 IgG development including age, BMI, sex, FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), CFTR modulator use, diabetes. Participants were evaluated for COVID-19 IgG at the time of enrollment (0 months) and the natural history of COVID-19 IgG will be further elucidated with additional Ab testing at 6 months and 12 months post-enrollment. RESULTS: Early data includes 75 enrollees with an average age of 35 years. 51% of participants are female. Of those tested, 9.5% had a positive COVID IgG test. 83% of those individuals tested positive for COVID with PCR analysis. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is becoming more prevalent in the state of MN and the prevalence of COVID-19 IgG in individuals with cystic fibrosis suggest similar exposure as the general community. Additional data collection at 6 months and 12 months will identify the natural progression of IgG immunity in in CF patients in response to COVID-19.","output":"Prevalence of sars-cov-2 igg antibodies in patients with cystic fibrosis at the minnesota cystic fibrosis center in the first 6 months of known virus in the state and in follow-up (6 months and 1 year)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypoxic hepatitis is a rare complication of type 1 diabetes with unknown prevalence in Pediatrics.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This paper includes three studies. The observational study reported the trends of blood collection during the epidemic in Guangzhou, China. The cross-sectional survey investigated factors influencing blood donation during the COVID-19 epidemic, and a self-administered questionnaire was given to 1584 street whole blood donors (SWBDs) who donated during the epidemic. The randomized controlled trial involved 19 491 SWBDs who donated in 2019 but did not donate during the epidemic. Trial participants were randomly assigned to two intervention groups: Group 1 completed Questionnaire 1, which contained precautionary measures in response to COVID-19 and other messages about blood donation during the epidemic; Group 2 completed Questionnaire 2, which did not include this information. A control group did not receive any questionnaire. RESULTS: As measures were implemented, the number of blood donors increased accordingly. Both first-time and repeat SWBDs perceived the same level of blood need and donated blood because it would save lives. SWBDs who completed Questionnaire 1 expressed a greater intention to donate during the epidemic. Enabling blood donors to perceive a higher level of blood need and a lower level of COVID-19 infection risk related to blood donation mobilized experienced SWBDs to donate within 3 weeks. Intention-to-treat analyses and average-treatment-effect-on-the-treated estimations confirmed that Questionnaire 1 could motivate SWBDs to actually donate blood. CONCLUSION: Various measures could ease blood shortage during the COVID-19 epidemic.

It has played a key role in the rapid diagnosis of viruses in patient samples and has contributed significantly to the clarification of virus structure and function, helping to guide the public health response to emerging viral infections. In the present study, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to study the infectious cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells and we controlled some key findings by classical transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). The replication cycle of the virus was followed from 1 to 36 h post-infection. Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infected the cells through membrane fusion. Particles are formed in the peri-nuclear region from a budding of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi apparatus complex into morphogenesis matrix vesicae. New SARS-CoV-2 particles were expelled from the cells, through cell lysis or by fusion of virus containing vacuoles with the cell plasma membrane. Overall, this cycle is highly comparable to that of SARS-CoV. By providing a detailed and complete SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle, SEM proves to be a very rapid and efficient tool compared to classical TEM.","output":"The Strengths of Scanning Electron Microscopy in Deciphering SARS-CoV-2 Infectious Cycle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, various rashes associated with COVID-19 infection have been reported, including urticaria.

This study examines income-related health inequalities and their main contributors in China during the pandemic. METHODS: The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey is an anonymous 74-item survey administered via social media in China. A national sample of 10,545 adults in all 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in mainland China provided comprehensive data on sociodemographic characteristics, awareness and attitudes towards COVID-19, lifestyle factors, and health outcomes during the lockdown. Of them, 8448 subjects provided data for this analysis. Concentration Index (CI) and Corrected CI (CCI) were used to measure income-related inequalities in mental health and self-reported health (SRH), respectively. Wagstaff-type decomposition analysis was used to identify contributors to health inequalities. RESULTS: Most participants reported their health status as \\"very good\\" (39.0%) or \\"excellent\\" (42.3%). CCI of SRH and mental health were - 0.09 (p < 0.01) and 0.04 (p < 0.01), respectively, indicating pro-poor inequality in ill SRH and pro-rich inequality in ill mental health. Income was the leading contributor to inequalities in SRH and mental health, accounting for 62.7% (p < 0.01) and 39.0% (p < 0.05) of income-related inequalities, respectively. The COVID-19 related variables, including self-reported family-member COVID-19 infection, job loss, experiences of food and medication shortage, engagement in physical activity, and five different-level pandemic regions of residence, explained substantial inequalities in ill SRH and ill mental health, accounting for 29.7% (p < 0.01) and 20.6% (p < 0.01), respectively. Self-reported family member COVID-19 infection, experiencing food and medication shortage, and engagement in physical activity explain 9.4% (p < 0.01), 2.6% (the summed contributions of experiencing food shortage (0.9%) and medication shortage (1.7%), p < 0.01), and 17.6% (p < 0.01) inequality in SRH, respectively (8.9% (p < 0.01), 24.1% (p < 0.01), and 15.1% (p < 0.01) for mental health).

To identify the local COVID-19 characteristics, this study applied the geographically weighted lasso (GWL). GWL provides local regression coefficients, which were used to account for the spatial heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. In particular, the GWL pinpoints statistically significant regions with specific local characteristics. The applied explanatory variables involving demographic and socio-economic characteristics that were associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Seoul metropolitan area were as follows: young adults (19~34 years), older population, Christian population, foreign-born population, low-income households, and subway commuters.

The global spread occurred as many patients carrying the virus were unaware that asymptomatic patients can still spread the infection. Common manifestations of COVID-19 include: fever, chills, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, radiologic evidence of bilateral infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure leading to death. Treatment options for the coronavirus are rapidly changing, because there is a lack of evidence. There is currently very limited data regarding lab prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus. Lab prognosis is beneficial to physicians making life decisions without guideline recommendations to support their decisions. A decrease in absolute lymphocyte counts, ALC, is a common manifestation in many viral diseases as well as in Covid-19 infection. At later disease stage, more profound hematological changes are evidenced, particularly a significant reduction in the lymphocytes number. This finding was more evident in those who suffered death compared to those who survived as reported in a study in China. Our study investigates the correlation between ALC and clinical outcomes in African American population. Methods In this article, we performed a retrospective cohort study on 92 patients admitted to a community hospital for Covid\\\\19. The patient population was 80% over the age of 61, 88% African Americans, 61% male and 32% obese. We split the 92 patients into four groups based on age in years: Group 1 was 21-40, Group 2 was 41-60, Group 3 was 61-80 and Group 4 was 81-100. The electronic medical record system was used to collect baseline demographics and laboratory data for analysis. Additionally, we evaluated baseline ALC at the time of hospital admission as well as the subsequent ALC to asses the correlation with clinical outcomes. A Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine correlation between improving ALC and better clinical outcomes. Results For group 1, we did not have enough patients to make an assessment for correlation. The two largest groups 41-60 and 61-80 years showed the biggest improvement in average ALC from baseline 1.1, 1.2 respectively to end result 1.64, 1.5 and showed a significant correlation with clinical outcomes as, a majority, 65% of these patients was discharged. A total of 24% of patients in group 4 expired and can be explained by increased d-dimer levels greater than 4 mg/dL and increased PT possibly leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Overall, 64% of our patient population was discharged and 36% expired. Conclusion This study showed correlation between clinical outcomes and ALC. Recording of ALC had clinical values, with decreasing ALC noted in severe /fatal disease and improvements noted in patients with favorable outcomes leading to safe hospital discharge.

Muell.Arg.] as an alternate source for sustainable development and cleaner production. In recent years, rubber tree has extensively been used only for its latex. The most neglected yet abundant by-product of the rubber tree is the seed biomass. The rubber tree seeds can yield a constant source of biomass which would need a little care, financial investment, and time. This biomass efficiently can be used in several small-scale or medium-scale industries, and one of the positive aspects of using this biomass is its zero or neutral CO2 emission. A little effort, if given into its resource utilization, can go a long way in augmenting the income and improving the livelihood of the rubber tree cultivators, as well as help to develop a cleaner and sustainable environment. Instead of using the seeds as mere propagating material, these can otherwise be used in organic farming. Rubber tree seeds being protein-rich, the seed cakes and seed meal after the oil extraction can act as an abundant source of organic manure and a potential natural fertilizer. The seeds have an intrinsic property of acting as herbicides and fungicides. The seed cake, owing to its nutritional value, can be used as cattle and poultry feed. The problem of food scarcity is a major contributing factor to malnutrition in the underprivileged sections of society. The rubber tree seeds can play an influential role by supplementing protein and as an alternate source of food, thereby helping the developing nations combat the food crisis. The few available reports regarding rubber tree seeds consumed by the tribes inhabiting the Amazon basin are worth mentioning. Rubber tree seeds contain cyanogenic compounds, and extensive research is needed to develop a methodology to eliminate such toxic compounds, which can help humanity overcome the challenges of food shortages in underdeveloped and developing nations. In todays COVID-19 pandemic scenario, there is a multiple-fold increase in demand for soaps and handwash for personal hygiene. This demand shall continue to grow in the coming days, and the inclusion of rubber tree seed oil (RSO) in producing soaps may ease the burden on vegetable oil, which can be used for human consumption. Rubber tree seed oil can also be used effectively in the cosmetics industry. Several encouraging reports support the idea of the inclusion of RSO in cosmetics to minimize the detrimental effects of harmful chemicals on the human body. The use of rubber tree seed oil as an alternate energy source cannot be downplayed. Rubber tree seed oil not only has a high ability to become an excellent source of biofuel but also has enormous potential in other industrial sectors. Products derived from RSO are used in several industrial sectors, including the paint industry, soap industry, and engineering sector as core binders. All products obtained from rubber trees can clearly show a path for cleaner green energy production and help to establish a rapport between nature and livelihood generation.

STUDY SELECTION Included studies were original research (randomised controlled trial, quasi-experimental, cohort study, qualitative and case studies), protocol papers and protocol registrations. DATA EXTRACTION Screening and data extraction was completed by one reviewer; 10% of the studies were independently reviewed by a second reviewer. Coding of full-text articles in NVivo was conducted and mapped to five deprescribing principles. RESULTS Fifty studies were included. The most frequently used activities were identification of appropriate patients for deprescribing (76%), patient education (50%), general practitioners (GP) education (48%), and development and use of a tapering schedule (38%). Six activities did not align with the five deprescribing principles. As such, two principles (engage practice staff in education and appropriate identification of patients, and provide feedback to staff about deprescribing occurrences within the practice) were added. CONCLUSION Activities and guiding principles for deprescribing should be paired together to provide an accessible and comprehensive guide to deprescribing by GPs. The addition of two principles suggests that practice staff and practice management teams may play an instrumental role in sustaining deprescribing processes within clinical practice. Future research is required to determine the most of effective activities to use within each principle and by whom.","output":"Deprescribing intervention activities mapped to guiding principles for use in general practice: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The diagnosis, severity and extent of a sterile inflammation or a septic infection could be challenging since there is not one single test able to achieve an accurate diagnosis. The clinical use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging in the assessment of inflammation and infection is increasing worldwide. The purpose of this paper is to achieve an Italian consensus document on [(18)F]FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI in inflammatory and infectious diseases, such as osteomyelitis (OM), prosthetic joint infections (PJI), infective endocarditis (IE), prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), cardiac implantable electronic device infections (CIEDI), systemic and cardiac sarcoidosis (SS/CS), diabetic foot (DF), fungal infections (FI), tuberculosis (TBC), fever and inflammation of unknown origin (FUO/IUO), pediatric infections (PI), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), spine infections (SI), vascular graft infections (VGI), large vessel vasculitis (LVV), retroperitoneal fibrosis (RF) and COVID-19 infections. METHODS: In September 2020, the inflammatory and infectious diseases focus group (IIFG) of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) proposed to realize a procedural paper about the clinical applications of [(18)F]FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI in inflammatory and infectious diseases. The project was carried out thanks to the collaboration of 13 Italian nuclear medicine centers, with a consolidate experience in this field. With the endorsement of AIMN, IIFG contacted each center, and the pediatric diseases focus group (PDFC). IIFG provided for each team involved, a draft with essential information regarding the execution of [(18)F]FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI scan (i.e., indications, patient preparation, standard or specific acquisition modalities, interpretation criteria, reporting methods, pitfalls and artifacts), by limiting the literature research to the last 20 years. Moreover, some clinical cases were required from each center, to underline the teaching points. Time for the collection of each report was from October to December 2020. RESULTS: Overall, we summarized 291 scientific papers and guidelines published between 1998 and 2021. Papers were divided in several sub-topics and summarized in the following paragraphs: clinical indications, image interpretation criteria, future perspectivess and new trends (for each single disease), while patient preparation, image acquisition, possible pitfalls and reporting modalities were described afterwards. Moreover, a specific section was dedicated to pediatric and PET/MRI indications. A collection of images was described for each indication. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, [(18)F]FDG PET/CT in oncology is globally accepted and standardized in main diagnostic algorithms for neoplasms. In recent years, the ever-closer collaboration among different European associations has tried to overcome the absence of a standardization also in the field of inflammation and infections. The collaboration of several nuclear medicine centers with a long experience in this field, as well as among different AIMN focus groups represents a further attempt in this direction. We hope that this document will be the basis for a common nuclear physicians language throughout all the country.

Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) promises better cosmetic results and probably less pain compared with conventional laparoscopy. METHODS In a period of 5 months, data were collected and analyzed from patients, who underwent SILC using the Glove port. Another group of patients who underwent standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the same period has been taken as control group. Demographic data, operative time, successfulness of operation, length of hospital stay, and postoperative findings were collected. RESULTS Twenty-five patients underwent SILC and 30 patients underwent the standard procedure. There were no conversions to open procedure in either group. No major complications occurred. Operative time in SILC cases was significantly more than the standard technique, whereas postoperative pain in the SILC group was considerably less. CONCLUSIONS It seems that in selected patients (with a low risk of adhesions or technical difficulty), SILC can be an acceptable alternative to standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy with acceptable results.","output":"Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy using glove port in comparison with standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy SILC using glove port."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed to examine the feasibility of arterial switch operation and its perioperative management with neonatology-focused intensive care modality in a region of Turkey where the birth rate and the number of asylum seekers who had to leave their country due to regional conflicts are high. METHODS: Between December 2017 and June 2020, a total of 57 patients (48 males, 9 females; median age: 12.2 days; range, 2 to 50 days) who were diagnosed with transposition of the great arteries in our clinic and underwent arterial switch operation were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were followed by the neonatologist in the neonatal intensive care unit during the preoperative and postoperative period. RESULTS: Thirty-eight (66.7%) patients had intact ventricular septum, 16 (28.1%) had ventricular septal defect, two (3.5%) had coarctation of the aorta, and one (1.7%) had Taussig-Bing anomaly. Coronary artery anomaly was present in 14 (24.5%) patients. The most common complications in the intensive care unit were renal failure requiring peritoneal dialysis in seven (12.3%) patients, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia in six (10.5%) patients, and eight (14%) patients left their chests open. The median length of stay in intensive care unit was 13.8 (range, 9 to 25) days and the median length of hospital stay was 24.5 (range, 16 to 47) days. The overall mortality rate for all patients was 12.3% (n=7). The median follow-up was 8.2 months. A pulmonary valve peak Doppler gradient of 36 mmHg was detected in five patients (8.7%) who were followed, and these patients were monitored by providing medical treatment. None of the patients needed reoperation or reintervention. CONCLUSION: We believe that arterial switch operation, one of the complex neonatal cardiac surgery, can be performed with an acceptable mortality and morbidity rate with the use of neonatology-focused intensive care modality, which is supported by pediatric cardiology and pediatric cardiac surgery.","output":"Is arterial switch operation possible with neonatology-focused intensive care unit modality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Real estate price growth affects credit risk for several reasons: it provides input for economic forecasts as its closely tied to economic growth; when used as collateral by banks, rising real estate prices may decrease both expected and actual losses; and banks may become less risk averse in lending practices in the presence of rising property prices.

Within this process, several studies revealed misconceptions and bad practices which lead to suboptimal recruitment experiences. In the same context, grey literature anecdotally coined the term R\\\\'esum\\\\'e-Driven Development (RDD), a phenomenon describing the overemphasis of trending technologies in both job offerings and resumes as an interaction between employers and applicants. While RDD has been sporadically mentioned in books and online discussions, there are so far no scientific studies on the topic, despite its potential negative consequences. We therefore empirically investigated this phenomenon by surveying 591 software professionals in both hiring (130) and technical (558) roles and identified RDD facets in substantial parts of our sample: 60% of our hiring professionals agreed that trends influence their job offerings, while 82% of our software professionals believed that using trending technologies in their daily work makes them more attractive for prospective employers. Grounded in the survey results, we conceptualize a theory to frame and explain R\\\\'esum\\\\'e-Driven Development.

A total of 2,314,621 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 157,847 deaths (6.8%) were reported globally by 20 April 2020. Common symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia include fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Faced with such a sudden outbreak of emerging infectious disease, traditional models for predicting the peak of the epidemic often show inconsistent results. With the aim to timely judge the epidemic peak and provide support for decisions for resuming production and returning to normal life based on publicly reported data, we used a seven-day moving average of log-transformed daily new cases (LMA) to establish a new index named the epidemic evaluation index (EEI). We used SARS epidemic data from Hong Kong to verify the practicability of the new index, and then applied it to the COVID-19 epidemic analysis. The results showed that the epidemic peaked, respectively, on 9 February and 5 February 2020, in Hubei Province and other provinces in China. The proposed index can be applied for judging the epidemic peak. While the global COVID-19 epidemic reached its peak in the middle of April, the epidemic peaks in some countries have not yet appeared.

The pandemic being quite persistent in nature, timely planning for novel and adaptive interventions are required for dealing with it, with a view to detecting the early signs of infection, as well as, controlling the spread of the outbreak towards the uninfected population residing at comparatively safer zones. In general, the coronaviruses belong to a group of RNA viruses that are known to infect a wide range of hosts including humans, other mammals and birds, with the clinical courses in the infected hosts ranging from being asymptomatic to showing acute symptoms in the respiratory, digestive and genital organs. Although the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is reported to spread primarily through inter-personal physical contacts rather than the faecal-oral route, evidence of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections accompanied by the detection of viral RNA in the faeces of infected individuals, with high probability of their presence in wastewater samples, makes an important case for the thorough characterization and quantification of the pathogenic materials present in the municipal sludge generated in urban centres. This becomes even more important in the case of the metro cities and dense urban centres, where the chance of the medical wastes from the COVID hospital facilities coming into the municipal sewage stream is highly likely. However, the pathogens in the municipal sewage stream become concentrated in the sludge, providing an opportunity to treat the separated sludge from the wastewater stream using a technology of irradiation called sludge hygienisation to curb the outbreak of the virus. The present work provides an assessment of the sludge hygienisation technology for its suitability as an option to eradicate the viral particles accumulated in the sludge samples from urban environments that are presumably infected through the faecal deposition, as well as, due to uncurbed release of untreated biomedical wastes. Such an intervention will provide suitable means to control rapid viral outbreak that might be attributed to the high volumetric flow rate of the municipal sewage. Investment in such novel interventions, given the current circumstances, will be important to contain present and future outbreaks, ensuring that the community healthcare systems are saved from being pushed to the limits owing to the increasing pressure on the infrastructure that arises from the rapidly growing number of infected individuals.","output":"Sludge HygienisationA Novel Technology for Urban Areas to Deal with Incursion of COVID-19 Viral Particles in Wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The board game's creator Leacock urged in a March 2020 I New York Times i op-ed for the public to take the cooperative spirit of I Pandemic i to heart for the Covid-19 pandemic: I Pandemic i can provide a model for us in this time of crisis.

Neuroanatomy is a complex subject requiring three-dimensional orientation of the structures. Practical teaching by using the cadaveric specimens is a usual practice, but in the current situation the virtual platform is an indispensable and sustainable option for both teaching and learning activities. In the present study the utility of YouTube and digital content on neuroanatomy was assessed among I MBBS students using selfadministered questionnaire during Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS The questionnaire based cross sectional study of prosected neuroanatomy specimens in the department of Anatomy were utilized to create digital content modules. According to the topics, PDF content was generated, and it was shared before the commencement of virtual class. Later YouTube link was shared with our I MBBS students through social media platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook regularly. At the end of completion of whole teaching schedule, a questionnaire was circulated to obtain the feedback on this teaching method. Finally, the responses were collected and interpreted. RESULTS In the present survey, 257 participants (176 females and 81 males) from 10 medical colleges responded to all 12 items of the questionnaire. We observed that 36 % of them graded excellent for content, 25 % for audio quality, 21 % for video quality, 29 % for specimens used, 25 % for labelling of specimens in YouTube videos. Out of 257 responses 35 % of them were graded excellent for pdf content, 30 % for pictorial representation of brain specimens, 30 % for labelling and 24 % for length.

BV13 is a 54-month prospective longitudinal cohort study of 111 subjects who were present in the Bataclan concert hall during the November 2015 terrorist attack in Paris. OBJECTIVES: Our first objective was to investigate the association between stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic and PTSD symptoms, notably with respect to two positive risk factors: trait mindfulness and social support. The second was to explore how PTSD severity mediated the relationship between trait mindfulness and COVID-19-induced stress. METHOD: The primary endpoint was evaluated using the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). PTSD symptoms were evaluated using the PTSD Check List Scale (PCL-5) during the sanitary crisis and two years before. Social support was assessed with a Likert scale that measured perceived support from family, friends and the workplace. Trait mindfulness was measured with the 14-item Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI). RESULTS: 54 months after the attack, a univariate analysis identified a significant positive correlation between COVID-19 stress (CPDI) and PCL-5 (r=0.77, p<0.01) scores, on the one hand, and significant negative correlations with FMI (r=C0.59, p<0.01), and social support (r=C0.28, p<0.01) scores, on the other hand. In the multivariate model, CPDI scores were closely associated with PCL-5 scores (p<0.01) after adjustment for FMI and social support scores. CPDI and FMI scores were significantly associated (p=0.05), but not CPDI and social support scores (p=0.89). The PTSD score was a strong mediator of the relationship between trait mindfulness (FMI) and COVID-19 stress (CPDI) scores. CONCLUSION: PTSD symptoms diminished the beneficial impact of trait mindfulness on stress related to COVID-19. Our finding highlights that subjects with previous experience of trauma need specific treatment for PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 crisis.","output":"Stress induced by the COVID-19 health situation in a cohort of 111 subjects present in the Bataclan concert hall during the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on musculoskeletal tumor service by conducting an online survey of physicians. METHODS: The survey was conducted among the members of the ISOLS (International Society of Limb Salvage) and the EMSOS (European Musculo-Skeletal Oncology Society). The survey consisted of 20 questions (single, multiple-response, ranked): origin and surgical experience of the participant (four questions), potential disruption of healthcare (12 questions), and influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the particular physician (four questions). A matrix with four different response options was created for the particular surgical procedures). RESULTS: One hundred forty-nine physicians from five continents completed the survey. Of the respondents, 20.1% and 20.7% stated that surgery for life-threatening sarcomas were stopped or delayed, respectively. Even when the malignancy was expected to involve infiltration of a neurovascular bundle or fracture of a bone, still 13.8% and 14.7% of the respondents, respectively, stated that surgery was not performed. In cases of pending fractures of bone tumors, 37.5 to 46.2% of operations were canceled.

There have been efforts to identify digital competencies for different health care worker groups; however, an overview of these efforts has yet to be consolidated and analyzed. OBJECTIVE: The review aims to identify and study existing digital health competency frameworks for health care workers and provide recommendations for future digital health training initiatives and framework development. METHODS: A literature search was performed to collate digital health competency frameworks published from 2000. A total of 6 databases including gray literature sources such as OpenGrey, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, Google, and websites of relevant associations were searched in November 2019. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by the reviewers. The included evidence is narratively described in terms of characteristics, evolution, and structural composition of frameworks. A thematic analysis was also performed to identify common themes across the included frameworks. RESULTS: In total, 30 frameworks were included in this review, a majority of which aimed at nurses, originated from high-income countries, were published since 2016, and were developed via literature reviews, followed by expert consultations. The thematic analysis uncovered 28 digital health competency domains across the included frameworks. The most prevalent domains pertained to basic information technology literacy, health information management, digital communication, ethical, legal, or regulatory requirements, and data privacy and security. The Health Information Technology Competencies framework was found to be the most comprehensive framework, as it presented 21 out of the 28 identified domains, had the highest number of competencies, and targeted a wide variety of health care workers. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health training initiatives should focus on competencies relevant to a particular health care worker group, role, level of seniority, and setting. The findings from this review can inform and guide digital health training initiatives. The most prevalent competency domains identified represent essential interprofessional competencies to be incorporated into health care workers' training.

The impossibility of visiting their loved ones during the hospital stay causes additional distress for families: in addition to the worries about clinical recovery, they may feel exclusion and powerlessness, anxiety, depression, mistrust in the care team and post-traumatic stress disorder. The impossibility of conducting the daily meetings with families poses a challenge for healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to delineate and share consensus statements in order to enable healthcare team to provide by telephone or video calls an optimal level of communication with patient's relatives under circumstances of complete isolation. EVIDENCE REVIEW: PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effectiveness and the AHCPR Clinical Guidelines and Evidence Reports were explored from 1999 to 2019. Exclusion criteria were: poor or absent relevance regarding the aim of the consensus statements, studies prior to 1999, non-English language. Since the present pandemic context is completely new, unexpected and unexplored, there are not randomised controlled trials regarding clinical communication in a setting of complete isolation. Thus, a multiprofessional taskforce of physicians, nurses, psychologists and legal experts, together with some family members and former intensive care unit patients was established by four Italian national scientific societies. Using an e-Delphi methodology, general and specific questions were posed, relevant topics were argumented, until arriving to delineate position statements and practical checklist, which were set and evaluated through an evidence-based consensus procedure. FINDINGS: Ten statements and two practical checklists for phone or video calls were drafted and evaluated; they are related to who, when, why and how family members must be given clinical information under circumstances of complete isolation.

Our previous work suggested that resistin has the potential to be used as a biomarker and therapeutic target for human pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, data are limited on the distribution of resistin in healthy human organs. In this study, we used our newly developed anti-human resistin (hResistin) antibody to immunohistochemically detect the expression, localization, and intracellular/extracellular compartmentalization of hResistin in a full human tissue panel from healthy individuals. The potential cross reactivity of this monoclonal anti-hResistin IgG1 with normal human tissues also was verified. Results showed that hResistin is broadly distributed and principally localized in the cytoplasmic granules of macrophages scattered in the interstitium of most human tissues. Bone marrow hematopoietic precursor cells also exhibited hResistin signals in their cytoplasmic granules. Additionally, hResistin labeling was observed in the cytoplasm of nervous system cells. Notably, the cytokine activity of hResistin was illustrated by positively stained extracellular material in most human tissues. These data indicate that our generated antibody binds to the secreted hResistin and support its potential use for immunotherapy to reduce circulating hResistin levels in human disease. Our findings comprehensively document the basal expression patterns of hResistin protein in normal human tissues, suggest a critical role of this cytokine in normal and pathophysiologic inflammatory processes, and offer key insights for using our antibody in future pharmacokinetic studies and immunotherapeutic strategies.","output":"Systemic evaluation and localization of resistin expression in normal human tissues by a newly developed monoclonal antibody."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAndrographis paniculata (AP) crude extract has been widely used in Thailand to treat mild COVID-19 infection since early 2020; however, supporting evidence was lacking.

Study designSingle-centre retrospective cohort study MethodsWe collected data between March 2020 and August 2021 from COVID-19 patients admitted to one hospital in Thailand. Patients whose infection was confirmed by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and had normal chest radiography were included, whereas those receiving favipiravir or had unclear chest X-rays at admission were excluded. Participants were categorised as either AP or standard of care and followed for pneumonia confirmed by chest radiography. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyse the main results controlling for age, sex, history of having diabetes, hypertension, receiving statins, and antihypertensive drugs. Results605 out of 1,054 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 59 patients (9.8%) developed pneumonia during the median follow-up of 7 days.

The pandemic is currently underway, and to date has caused approximately 2.42 million deaths worldwide. The first vaccines have recently been licensed; however, research continues to identify therapeutic agents to prevent serious complications, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticoagulant or antiviral agents authorized for other therapeutic indications. Epidemiological evidence shows that advanced age and comorbidities, such as diabetes, heart disease, and dyslipidemia may represent COVID-19 risk factors. In particular, in patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with statins, it is recommended that treatment should not be discontinued if COVID-19 infection occurs. The pleiotropic effects of statins are well known. In this brief review, we propose that the use of statins can potentially protect against SARS-CoV-2-induced tissue damage and improve lung function in COVID-19 patients through several pleiotropic effects.

Accumulating evidence indicates that cell membrane immune checkpoint proteins, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), are glycosylated with heavy N-linked glycan moieties in human cancers. N-linked glycosylation of PD-L1 maintains its protein stability and interaction with its cognate receptor, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and this in turn promotes evasion of T-cell immunity. Studies have suggested targeting PD-L1 glycosylation as a therapeutic option by rational combination of cancer immunotherapies. Interestingly, structural hindrance by N-glycan on PD-L1 in fixed samples impedes its recognition by PD-L1 diagnostic antibodies. Notably, the removal of N-linked glycosylation enhances PD-L1 detection in a variety of bioassays and more accurately predicts the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, suggesting an important clinical implication of PD-L1 N-linked glycosylation. A detailed understanding of the regulatory mechanisms, cellular functions, and diagnostic limits underlying PD-L1 N-linked glycosylation could shed new light on the clinical development of immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer treatment and deepen our knowledge of biomarkers to identify patients who would benefit the most from immunotherapy. In this review, we highlight the effects of protein glycosylation on cancer immunotherapy using N-linked glycosylation of PD-L1 as an example. In addition, we consider the potential impacts of PD-L1 N-linked glycosylation on clinical diagnosis. The notion of utilizing the deglycosylated form of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker to guide anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy is also discussed.","output":"The impact of PD-L1 N-linked glycosylation on cancer therapy and clinical diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To perform translation, cross-cultural adaptation, and validation of the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) and Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scoring system in Greek patients with lower extremity sarcoma. METHODS: The Greek version of the MSTS for the lower extremity and TESS questionnaires was developed using previously reported methods. Included were 100 patients with musculoskeletal sarcoma who underwent limb salvage surgery. The testCretest reliability [interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between 2 different time points], internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha), construct validity (Kaisers criteria, Eigenvalue > 1 rule), and external validity (Short form-36, Spearmans Rho) were assessed. RESULTS: The testCretest reliability (ICC was 0.99 for MSTS-LE and 1 for TESS) and internal consistency were high (Cronbachs alpha was 0.763 for MSTS-LE and 0.924 for TESS) for both questionnaires. Based on the Scree plot, the number of factors retained was 1 for MSTS-LE and 2 for TESS. The TESS showed a strong correlation with SF-36 (Spearmans rho = 0.714, p < 0.001), but the correlation between MSTS for lower extremity and SF-36 was weak (Spearmans Rho = 0.313, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The Greek version of both the MSTS for lower extremity and TESS questionnaire showed sufficient reliability, internal consistency and good performance using the loading factor analysis when used postoperatively in Greek patients who underwent surgical resection of lower extremity sarcoma. However, only the TESS showed strong correlation with the SF-36, indicating that MSTS for lower extremity was not as powerful for the evaluation of the global health status of these patients.

Far less research has focussed on protective factors that promote wellbeing for this population. A scoping review was conducted using a six-stage methodological framework, and is reported in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR statement. This explored the extent, range and nature of the peer-reviewed, published, academic literature on what is known about the protective factors that promote LGBTI+ youth wellbeing. Six databases were systematically searched applying Population-Concept-Context key inclusion criteria, complemented by contact with authors to identify additional sources, reference checks and hand searches. Ninety-six individual research records were identified and analysed, drawing from Honneth's Recognition Theory. Interpersonal relations with parents (n = 40), peers (n = 32) and providers (n = 22) were associated with indicators of enhanced wellbeing, as were LGBTI+ community relations (n = 32). Importantly, online (n = 10), faith (n = 10) and cultural (n = 5) communities were potentially protective. Content and thematic analysis highlighted the importance of Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs) (n = 23) offering powerful protective opportunities through intersecting interpersonal, community and legal forms of recognition. GSAs enhance allyship by peers and providers (n = 21), facilitate access to LGBTI+ community networks (n = 11) and co-exist alongside inclusive policies (n = 12), curricular (n = 5) and extracurricular activities (n = 1). This scoping review underscores the need to move beyond the predominant focus on risk factors for LGBTI+ youth, which subsequently inform protectionist approaches. It concludes with an appeal to develop mechanisms to apply recognitive justice to policy, practice and, importantly, future research directions.

Methods: The follow-up observation method was used to continuously track and observe the cases firstly reported as \\"asymptomatic patients with COVID-19\\" in Guangdong province from January 14 to March 31, 2020. The epidemiological data of the cases were collected to analyze their epidemiological characteristics, outcome and influencing factors. Results: From January 14 to March 31, 2020, a total of 325 cases were firstly reported as \\"asymptomatic infections of COVID-19\\" in Guangdong province. The epidemic curve of asymptomatic infection cases was similar to that of confirmed cases, and it had two peaks. The first peak was from January 27 to February 5, and the second peak was from March 17 to March 26. Of the 325 cases, 184 (56.6%) were subsequently converted to confirmed cases. These cases were defined as incubation period asymptomatic infection cases. The age median of the cases was 40 years, and 93.5% (172/184) of the cases showed symptoms within 3 days after the first positive nucleic acid tests were conducted, and 141 (43.4%) of the 325 cases remained asymptomatic status until they were cured and discharged. They were inapparent infection cases, accounting for 8.6% (141/1 642) of those diagnosed with COVID-19 in Guangdong province during the same period. The age median of inapparent infection cases was 27 years. The median of the interval between the first positive nucleic acid test and discharge was 14 days. Up to 90.8% (138/141) of the inapparent infection cases were discharged for centralized medical observation within 28 days. The longest interval between the first positive nucleic acid test and the last positive nucleic acid test was 73 days. The positive rate of nucleic acid test was 0.3% in close contacts of inapparent infection cases and 2.2% in close contacts of incubation period asymptomatic infection cases. There were significant differences in age distribution and source of infection between incubation period asymptomatic infection cases and inapparent infection cases (P<0.05). Old age was the risk factor for the conversion of firstly reported asymptomatic infection cases to confirmed cases. Compared with the 0-19-year-old group, The patients aged 40-59 years and 60 years and above were more likely to become confirmed cases. The OR (95%CI) values were 2.730 (1.380-5.402) and 5.302 (2.199-12.783), and P values were 0.004 and 0.000, respectively.

The infectiousness of incubation period asymptomatic infection cases might be stronger than that of inapparent infection cases. The proportion of younger cases among asymptomatic infection cases was higher than that of the confirmed cases. Old age and domestic infection were the risk factors for the conversion of asymptomatic infection cases to confirmed cases, to which more attention should be paid.

Recurrent aneurysms for which stent-assisted embolization has failed are a therapeutic challenge, given the existing intraluminal construct with continued blood flow into the aneurysm. We report our experience using flow-diverting stents in the repair of 25 aneurysms for which stent-assisted embolization had failed. Nineteen (76%) of these aneurysms at the 12-month follow-up showed improved Raymond class occlusion, with 38% being completely occluded, and all aneurysms demonstrated decreased filling. One patient developed a moderate permanent neurologic deficit. Appropriate stent sizing, proximal and distal construct coverage, and preventing flow diverter deployment between the previously deployed stent struts are important considerations to ensure wall apposition and prevention of endoleak. Flow diverters are shown to be a reasonable option for treating previously stented recurrent cerebral aneurysms.","output":"Use of flow-diverting stents as salvage treatment following failed stent-assisted embolization of intracranial aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bradykinin, a member of the kallikreinCkinin system (KKS), is a potent, short-lived vasoactive peptide that acts as a vasodilator and an inflammatory mediator in a number of signaling mechanisms. Bradykinin induced signaling is mediated through kinin B1 (BDKRB1) and B2 (BDKRB2) transmembrane receptors coupled with different subunits of G proteins (G(i)/G(0), G(q) and G(12)). The bradykinin-mediated signaling mechanism activates excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1, IL-8 and IL-2. Upregulation of these cytokines has implications in a wide range of clinical conditions such as inflammation leading to fibrosis, cardiovascular diseases, and most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In SARS-CoV-2 infection, bradykinin is found to be at raised levels and is reported to trigger a diverse array of symptoms. All of this brings bradykinin to the core point as a molecule of immense therapeutic value. Our understanding of its involvement in various pathways has expanded with time. Therefore, there is a need to look at the overall picture that emerges from the developments made by deciphering the bradykinin mediated signaling mechanisms involved in the pathological conditions. It will help devise strategies for developing better treatment modalities in the implicated diseases. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on bradykinin mediated signaling in the diverse conditions described above, with a marked emphasis on the therapeutic potential of targeting the bradykinin receptor.","output":"A comprehensive review on current understanding of bradykinin in COVID-19 and inflammatory diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: One month after the first COVID-19 infection was recorded, Portugal counted 18,051 cases and 599 deaths from COVID-19. To understand the overall impact on mortality of the pandemic of COVID-19, we estimated the excess mortality registered in Portugal during the first month of the epidemic, from March 16 until April 14 using two different methods. Methods: We compared the observed and expected daily deaths (historical average number from daily death registrations in the past 10 years) and used 2 standard deviations confidence limit for all-cause mortality by age and specific mortality cause, considering the last 6 years. An adapted Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was also tested to validate the estimated number of all-cause deaths during the study period. Results: Between March 16 and April 14, there was an excess of 1255 all-cause deaths, 14% more than expected. The number of daily deaths often surpassed the 2 standard deviations confidence limit. The excess mortality occurred mostly in people aged 75+. Forty-nine percent (49%) of the estimated excess deaths were registered as due to COVID-19, the other 51% registered as other natural causes. Conclusion: Even though Portugal took early containment measures against COVID-19, and the population complied massively with those measures, there was significant excess mortality during the first month of the pandemic, mostly among people aged 75+. Only half of the excess mortality was registered as directly due do COVID-19.","output":"Rapid Estimation of Excess Mortality during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Portugal -Beyond Reported Deaths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: In order to understand the epidemic trend of COVID-19 and evaluate the effect of prevention and control, this study aims to evaluate the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in Chinese mainland from January 16 to February 14, 2020. Methods: The daily number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases detected by nucleic acid was collected from the National Health Commission from January 16, 2020 to February 14, 2020. The analysis included the epidemic curve of the new confirmed cases, multiple of the new confirmed cases for period-over-period, multiple of the new confirmed cases for fixed-base, and the period-over-period growth rate of the new confirmed cases. Results: From January 16 to February 14, 2020, the cumulative number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Chinese mainland was 50 031, including 37 930 in Hubei Province, 22 883 in Wuhan city and 12 101 in other provinces outside Hubei. The peak of new confirmed cases in other provinces outside Hubei was from January 31 to February 4, 2020, and the peak of new confirmed cases in Wuhan city and Hubei Province was from February 5 to February 9, 2020. The number of new confirmed cases in other provinces outside Hubei showed a significant decline (23% compared with the peak) from February 5 to February 9, 2020, while the number of new confirmed cases in Wuhan city (30% compared with the peak) and Hubei Province (37% compared with the peak) decreased significantly from February 10 to February 14, 2020.

Quercetin (Q), a bioflavonoid, at 0.3% concentration has showed some wound healing potential in our preliminary studies. The present study was aimed to explore the wound healing potential of 0.3% quercetin formulated in 3 different vehicles, that is, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 10%), ointment base, and corn oil. Ninety experimentally wounded rats were grouped in 6 groups. The 0.3% quercetin mixed with DMSO, ointment base, and corn oil was topically applied once daily for 21 days on the wounds of groups 2, 4, and 6, respectively. DMSO, ointment base, and corn oil alone was applied similarly in groups 1, 3, and 5, respectively. Gross evaluation and wound contraction results revealed accelerated wound closure in all quercetin-treated groups. The mRNA expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-?1, and interluekin-10 were markedly upregulated in healing tissues of quercetin-treated groups. Tumor necrosis factor-&#945; mRNA expression and protein levels were lowered by quercetin treatment. Quercetin-treated groups also showed increased activities of SOD (superoxide dismutase) and catalase, and levels of total thiols in wound tissues on day 7. Levels of superoxide anion radicals and malondialdehyde were markedly lower in quercetin-treated groups. Histologically, wound sections of quercetin-treated groups showed early dominance of fibroblasts, increased blood vessels, marked collagen deposition, and regenerated epithelial layer. The significant effects were more pronounced in ointment + Q group among all the quercetin-treated groups. In conclusion, 0.3% quercetin mixed in ointment base produced the fastest and better wound healing in rats.","output":"Temporal Effects of Different Vehicles on Wound Healing Potentials of Quercetin: Biochemical, Molecular, and Histopathological Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective: Carry out a reflective analysis on the relationship of obesity as a risk factor for the worsening of COVID-19.
