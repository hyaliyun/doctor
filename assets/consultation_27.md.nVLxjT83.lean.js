However, the process is not without significant challenges. Capital costs to realize a lyophilized drug product facility, for example, are very high. Similarly, heat and mass transfer limitations inherent in lyophilization result in drying cycle on the order of several days while putting practical constraints on available formulation space, such as solute mass percentage or fill volume in a vial. Through collaboration with an external partner, we are exploring microwave vacuum drying (MVD) as a faster drying process to vial lyophilization wherein the heat transfer process occurs by microwave radiation instead of pure conduction from the vial. Drying using this radiative process demonstrates greater than 80% reduction in drying time over traditional freeze-drying times while maintaining product activity and stability. Such reduction in freeze-drying process times from days to several hours is a welcome change as it enables flexible manufacturing by being able to better react to changes either in terms of product volume for on-demand manufacturing scenarios or facilities for production (e.g., scale-out over scale-up). Additionally, by utilizing first-principle modeling coupled with experimental verification, a mechanism for faster drying times associated with MVD is proposed in this article. This research, to the best of our knowledge, forms the very first report of utilizing microwave vacuum drying for vaccines while utilizing the power of simplified models to understand drying principles associated with MVD.","output":"Evaluation of Microwave Vacuum Drying as an Alternative to Freeze-Drying of Biologics and Vaccines: the Power of Simple Modeling to Identify a Mechanism for Faster Drying Times Achieved with Microwave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent researches have showed that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were often accompanied by pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema is a manifestation of acute lung injury (ALI), and may progress to hypoxemia and potentially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which have higher mortality. Precise classification of the degree of pulmonary edema in patients is of great significance for choosing the treatment plan and further improving the survival chance. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning neural network named non-local channel attention ResNet (NCA-ResNet) to analyze the lung ultrasound images and automatically score the degree of pulmonary edema in patients with COVID-19. The proposed method was designed by combining the ResNet with non-local module and the channel attention mechanism. The non-local module was used to extract the information of characteristics of A-lines and B-lines based on which the degree of pulmonary edema could be defined. The channel attention mechanism was used to assign weights to decisive channels. The data set contains 2220 lung ultrasound images provided by Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China, of which 2062 effective images with accurate scores given by two experienced clinicians were used in the experiment. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method achieved a high accuracy of classifying the degree of pulmonary edema in patients with COVID-19 by comparing with the previous deep learning methods, indicating its good potential to monitor the patients with COVID-19.","output":"Evaluation of Pulmonary Edema Using Ultrasound Imaging in COVID-19 Patients Using a Non-Local Channel Attention ResNet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiovascular diseases (CDVs) are still the leading cause of mortality in the developed world, despite the high number of deaths caused by the COVID pandemic of the last two years [...].","output":"The Underlying Pathology of Atherosclerosis: Different Players"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Studies have shown that patients with ischemic stroke (IS) and concurrent COVID-19 have increased stroke severity. These analyses were limited by use of prepandemic era controls or by utilization of a sample from the early pandemic period when stroke care delivery was affected by lockdown. Studies on the severity of hemorrhagic stroke (HS) in patients with concurrent COVID-19 are few and limited by small sample sizes. Methods: Using the National Institute of Health (NIH) National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) database, we identified patients diagnosed with stroke between Mar 1, 2020 - Feb 28, 2021. Hospitalized stroke patients with concurrent COVID-19 (stroke within 3 months after or one week prior to positive SARS-COV-2 PCR or AG lab test) were matched to all other hospitalized stroke patients in a 1:3 ratio. Nearest neighbor matching with a caliper of 0.25 was used for most clinical and demographic factors;exact matching for race/ethnicity and site. Within our matched sample, we used Poisson regression to calculate stroke severity incident rate ratio (IRR). Results: Our query identified 10,394 patients hospitalized with IS with available NIHSS scores upon admission (802 with concurrent COVID-19 and 9,592 without) and 2138 patients hospitalized with HS (181 with concurrent COVID-19 and 1957 without). Average NIHSS was greater in concurrent groups with both IS and HS (11.1 vs 7.68, p < 0.001 and 15.7 vs 11.7, p < 0.001 respectively). Propensity matched analysis also demonstrated that stroke patients with concurrent COVID-19 had increased initial NIHSS (IS: IRR = 1.4, 95% CI:1.3-1.5, p-value < 0.001;HS: IRR = 1.3, 95% CI:1.2- 1.5, p < 0.001). Average NIHSS in both IS and HS patients was greater in the Mar-Apr 2020 epoch than in all other 2 month epochs studied in these respective groups.

As the treatment of clostridial infections often differs from that of non-clostridial infections, which they may closely resemble, the importance of accurate pathogenic organism identification cannot be overemphasized. The 16S rDNA of bacteria is highly conserved within a species and among species of the same genus but demonstrates substantial variation between different species, thus making it a suitable genomic candidate for bacterial detection and identification. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report the case of a 53-year-old patient who was admitted to the hospital for a gas-producing perianal abscess. The patient was managed with ceftizoxime and ornidazole and then received debridement and drainage at the lesion on the second day after admission. The bacterial cultures of the patient isolates from the debridement showed a coinfection of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium. Although perianal redness and swelling subsided obviously after the surgery, the patient was febrile to 38.3 with his left upper thigh red and swollen, aggravated with tenderness and crepitus. Considering insufficient debridement and the risk of incorrect identification of pathogens, a second debridement and drainage were performed 4 days after the primary operation, and 16S rDNA sequencing of the isolates implicated Clostridium perfringens infection. Given the discrepancies in diagnostic results and the treatment outcomes, Enterococcus faecium was identified as sample contamination, and a diagnosis of coinfection of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli in gas-producing perianal abscess was confirmed. The patient was then successfully treated with meropenem and vancomycin and was discharged at 27 days of admission. CONCLUSIONS: This case represents the first report of coinfection of both clostridial and non-clostridial organisms in gas-producing perianal abscess and the first case reporting the use of 16S rDNA sequencing in the diagnosis of perianal abscess. Timely pathogen identification is critical for treating gas-producing perianal abscess and an antibiotic regimen covering both aerobic and anaerobic organisms is recommended before true pathogens are identified.

Two opt-in groups received a questionnaire and an e-mail invitation to order a self-sampler online; one received Qvintip and the other Evalyn? Brush. Participant? background characteristics were obtained from the Population Register. The effect of covariates on participation rate was estimated with multivariate Poisson regression. Acceptance of self-sampling was analysed according to agreement with statements in the questionnaire. RESULTS The overall participation rate was 16% with significant differences between opt-out (26%) and opt-in (11%) groups. Compared to the opt-out Qvintip group, adjusted relative risks for the Qvintip and Evalyn Brush opt-in groups were 0.41 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.45) and 0.44 (95% CI 0.40-0.49), respectively. Participation was associated with living place, citizenship, and education. Self-sampling was well accepted: 98% agreed that it was easy to use, 88% preferred it as a screening method in future. CONCLUSIONS The results show the feasibility and good acceptance of HPV self-sampling among long-term screening non-attenders in Estonia.","output":"Human papillomavirus self-sampling for long-term non-attenders in cervical cancer screening: A randomised feasibility study in Estonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 has been leading the world into a prominent crisis. As of May 19, 2020, the virus had spread to 215 countries with more than 4,622,001 confirmed cases and 311,916 reported deaths worldwide, including Algeria with 7201 cases and 555 deaths. Analyze and forecast COVID-19 cases and deaths growth could be useful in many ways, governments could estimate medical equipment and take appropriate policy responses, and experts could approximate the peak and the end of the disease. In this work, we first train a time series Prophet model to analyze and forecast the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Algeria based on the previously reported numbers. Then, to better understand the spread and the properties of the COVID-19, we include external factors that may contribute to accelerate/slow the spread of the virus, construct a dataset from reliable sources, and conduct a large-scale data analysis considering 82 countries worldwide. The evaluation results show that the time series Prophet model accurately predicts the number of cases and deaths in Algeria with low RMSE scores of 218.87 and 4.79 respectively, while the forecast suggests that the total number of cases and deaths are expected to increase in the coming weeks. Moreover, the worldwide data-driven analysis reveals several correlations between the increase/decrease in the number of cases and deaths and external factors that may contribute to accelerate/slow the spread of the virus such as geographic, climatic, health, economic, and demographic factors.","output":"COVID-19 Data Analysis and Forecasting: Algeria and the World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Intersection conflict warning systems (ICWSs) have been implemented at high-risk two-way stop-controlled intersections to prevent right-angle crashes and associated injuries. This study involved investigation of the impacts of ICWSs on crash reductions. METHODS: The study used a quasi-experimental design to analyse the potential causal relations between Minnesota's ICWSs and various crash rate outcomes (including total, injury, non-injury, targeted right-angle and non-right-angle crashes) in pre-post analyses. A restricted randomisation method enabled identification of three controls to each ICWS treatment intersection, and included as many comparable intersection characteristics as possible. Annual crash rates (per year per intersection) were analysed over the same periods before and after system activation for treatment and control intersections in each matched group. Pre-crash data for 3 years and post-crash data for up to 5 years were included, ranging from 2010 to 2018. Negative binomial regression models with generalised estimating equations were applied to estimate the average, immediate and continuing treatment effects of ICWSs, through the difference-in-differences and difference-in-difference-in-difference approaches, respectively. RESULTS: The ICWS treatment was significantly associated with a decreasing trend for targeted right-angle crash rates posttreatment. Although not statistically significant, most crash rate outcomes appeared to be elevated immediately after treatment (statistically significant for sideswipe crashes only). Pre-post differences in average crash rates (over entire periods), except for incapacitating injury-related crashes, were not statistically significant between treatment and control intersections. CONCLUSIONS: The study provided important insight into potential causal associations between intersection safety countermeasures and crashes at high-risk rural two-way stop-controlled intersections.","output":"Evaluation of the efficacy of an intersection conflict warning system at two-way stop-controlled rural intersections: difference-in-differences and triple-difference analytical approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine whether COVID-19 is associated with a different presenting clinical picture or a more severe course of illness in people with a past history of chemical war injury.

So, to guarantee the rights of the people in receiving the vaccine, it is necessary to have an in-depth study of the program in terms of human rights and fiqh siyasa in order to prevent abuse of rights for all Indonesian people. This study aims to determine the right to receive and refuse the Sinovac vaccine according to human rights and fiqh siyasah and to determine the implementation of the use of the right to receive and refuse the Sinovac vaccine according to human rights and fiqh siyasah. The method used in this study is qualitative with a literature and empirical approach. The results of the study show that according to human rights, accepting and rejecting the Sinovac vaccine is flexible, people can still consciously choose whether they want to be vaccinated or not, because there are no criminal provisions that regulate sanctions for civil society if they do not get vaccinated. Meanwhile, according to siyasa fiqh, although the legal origin of vaccination is allowed, its legal status can change based on the reasons and conditions.

The Clean Plate Club in the US developed during wartime and relied heavily on political power for compliance, whereas the Clean Plate movement in South Korea was based on religion. China's Clean Your Plate Campaign (CYPC) has gone through two stages: CYPC I and CYPC II. The latter occurred during the unstable period of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was large-scale and more strongly enforced than CYPC I. In China, CYPC has relied more on personal virtue than on politics or religion. Culture, policy, COVID-19, and behavior are all important social factors that influence food waste. Specifically, two cultural values are drivers of food waste in China: hospitality and face-saving (mianzi). In terms of policy, China's food waste law mainly relies on persuasion;it lacks any power of enforcement. Laws in France and Italy, by contrast, focus on re-using food and involve both coercion and incentives.

This epidemiological logistics model involves the uncertainty of untested asymptomatic infections and incorporates short-term human migration. Disease transmission is also forecasted through a new formulation of transmission rates that evolve over space and time with respect to various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and lockdown. The proposed multi-stage stochastic model overviews different scenarios on the number of asymptomatic individuals while optimizing the distribution of resources, such as ventilators, to minimize the total expected number of newly infected and deceased people. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also incorporated into the multi-stage mean-risk model to allow for a trade-off between the weighted expected loss due to the outbreak and the expected risks associated with experiencing disastrous pandemic scenarios. We apply our multi-stage mean-risk epidemics-ventilator-logistics model to the case of controlling COVID-19 in highly-impacted counties of New York and New Jersey. We calibrate, validate, and test our model using actual infection, population, and migration data. We also define a new region-based sub-problem and bounds on the problem and then show their computational benefits in terms of the optimality and relaxation gaps. The computational results indicate that short-term migration influences the transmission of the disease significantly. The optimal number of ventilators allocated to each region depends on various factors, including the number of initial infections, disease transmission rates, initial ICU capacity, the population of a geographical location, and the availability of ventilator supply. Our data-driven modeling framework can be adapted to study the disease transmission dynamics and logistics of other similar epidemics and pandemics.","output":"COVID-19: Data-Driven Optimal Allocation of Ventilator Supply under Uncertainty and Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC), one of the two types of inflammatory bowel disease, is increasing in many countries. Various natural products have been demonstrated with therapeutic potentials for UC. Herein, the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of isobavachalcone (IBC), a natural chalcone, were evaluated in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. The results demonstrated that IBC treatment significantly improved the clinical symptoms, assessed by the disease activity index (DAI) scores and the histological changes of the colon. The levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), TNF-, IL-6, IL-1, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in colon tissues were suppressed by IBC. The upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and NF-B p65 in colon tissues were reversed by IBC as well. Furthermore, IBC significantly inhibited LPS-triggered secretion of TNF-, IL-6, and nitrite, and nuclear translocation of NF-B p65, in RAW264.7 cells. The luciferase reporter assay indicated that IBC significantly inhibited LPS-triggered transcription of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Molecular docking results showed that the binding pocket of IBC was adjacent to Ser276 of p65-p50 heterodimer and IBC could form H-bond with Thr191. Collectively, these results demonstrated that IBC ameliorated colitis in mice possibly through inhibition of NF-B p65.","output":"Therapeutic potential of isobavachalcone, a natural flavonoid, in murine experimental colitis by inhibiting NF-B p65."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic is having an economic impact, previously non-existent, on the world economy.

Since F is absorbed mostly from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), gastrointestinal symptoms are the first signs following acute F exposure. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanistic events that lead to these symptoms. Therefore, the present study evaluated changes in the proteomic profile as well as morphological changes in the jejunum and ileum of rats upon acute exposure to F. Male rats received, by gastric gavage, a single dose of F containing 0 (control) or 25 mg/Kg for 30 days. Upon exposure to F, there was a decrease in the thickness of the tunic muscularis for both segments and a decrease in the thickness of the wall only for the ileum. In addition, a decrease in the density of HuC/D-IR neurons and nNOS-IR neurons was found for the jejunum, but for the ileum only nNOS-IR neurons were decreased upon F exposure. Moreover, SP-IR varicosities were increased in both segments, while VIP-IR varicosities were increased in the jejunum and decreased in the ileum. As for the proteomic analysis, the proteins with altered expression were mostly negatively regulated and associated mainly with protein synthesis and energy metabolism. Proteomics also revealed alterations in proteins involved in oxidative/antioxidant defense, apoptosis and as well as in cytoskeletal proteins. Our results, when analyzed together, suggest that the gastrointestinal symptoms found in cases of acute F exposure might be related to the morphological alterations in the gut (decrease in the thickness of the tunica muscularis) that, at the molecular level, can be explained by alterations in the gut vipergic innervation and in proteins that regulate the cytoskeleton.","output":"Effects of acute fluoride exposure on the jejunum and ileum of rats: Insights from proteomic and enteric innervation analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The economic fallout of Covid-19 is exposing the deepest flaws, fractures, and inequities within our health care and social service systems.

In 2015 the GeSRU (German Society of Residents in Urology) carried out the first nationwide survey among young physicians in urology and described the status quo of their residency. This revised follow-up examination draws an updated picture of the training and working conditions of residents in urology and assesses the development. METHODS: In 2020 the GeSRU conducted an online-based survey of all residents in urology; therefore, the 2015 questionnaire was expanded.

Emergency abdominal ultrasound and CT-scan revealed a ruptured spleen and widespread hemorrhagic fluid in the abdomen. Exploration revealed multiple ruptures in the spleen capsule. The patient underwent splenectomy with good clinical evolution. Despite the rarity of this condition, physicians should consider the diagnosis of spontaneous non traumatic splenic rupture when encountering healthy patients presenting with nonspecific left hypochondrial abdominal pain and hypovolemia.

In order to detect changes in cognitive function, cognitive tests should be performed repeatedly. Currently existing cognitive tests come in only a single version, so the subject is likely to remember the contents with repeated testing. And, under the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in-person assessment should be avoided. This study was performed to develop a new cognitive test (brain assessment, BA) that has 5 versions and can be performed on a personal computer (PC) through the Internet. MATERIALS AND METHODS Five thousand subjects performed the online BA, which consisted of 5 subtests: number memory, word memory, mental rotation test, N-back test, and judgment test. We standardized the raw scores (cognitive scores, CSs) using mean and standard deviation, which were 50 and 10, respectively. Then, we calculated the mean CS for each sex and age, plotted the relationships between ages and mean CSs on figures, and calculated the formula of cognitive changes during normal aging. RESULTS The CSs of all subtests decreased with aging. The regression coefficient was from -0.31 to -0.45. It is noteworthy that in most subtests, the CSs started to increase at 85 years of age. DISCUSSION Our BA has 5 versions and can be done on a PC using the Internet. We tested the BA in a large number of subjects, and the standard values of CSs were measured in individuals up to 89 years of age. By performing this test repeatedly, subjects can evaluate the degree of their cognitive decline. If the rate of cognitive decline is greater than that predicted using the normalized formula, the subjects can undertake strategies to improve their control of lifestyle-related diseases or other habits of daily living. CONCLUSION The BA can be easily taken online using a PC, and its scores linearly declined with normal aging. The BA will be useful for detecting longitudinal cognitive changes and comparing them to the pattern seen in normal aging.","output":"Online Tool (Brain Assessment) for the Detection of Cognitive Function Changes during Aging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has generally increased levels of stress and depression among the public.

Chest radiographic scores and comorbidities were also examined as indicators of a fatal outcome to determine their potential prognostic value. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chest radiographs of 33 patients and 22 HCWs infected with MERS-CoV were examined for radiologic features indicative of disease and for evidence of radiographic deterioration and progression. Chest radiographic scores were estimated after dividing each lung into three zones. The scores (1 [mild] to 4 [severe]) for all six zones per chest radiographic examination were summed to provide a cumulative chest radiographic score (range, 0-24). Serial radiographs were also examined to assess for radiographic deterioration and progression from type 1 (mild) to type 4 (severe) disease. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, and the Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare data of deceased patients with those of individuals who recovered to identify prognostic radiographic features. RESULTS Ground-glass opacity was the most common abnormality (66%) followed by consolidation (18%). Overall mortality was 35% (19/55). Mortality was higher in the patient group (55%, 18/33) than in the HCW group (5%, 1/22). The mean chest radiographic score for deceased patients was significantly higher than that for those who recovered (13  2.6 [SD] vs 5.8  5.6, respectively; p = 0.001); in addition, higher rates of pneumothorax (deceased patients vs patients who recovered, 47% vs 0%; p = 0.001), pleural effusion (63% vs 14%; p = 0.001), and type 4 radiographic progression (63% vs 6%; p = 0.001) were seen in the deceased patients compared with those who recovered. Univariate and logistic regression analyses identified the chest radiographic score as an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% CI, 1.07-1.77; p = 0.01). The number of comorbidities in the patient group (n = 33) was significantly higher than that in the HCW group (n = 22) (mean number of comorbidities, 1.90  1.27 vs 0.17  0.65, respectively; p = 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a median survival time of 15 days (95% CI, 4-26 days). CONCLUSION Ground-glass opacity in a peripheral location was the most common abnormality noted on chest radiographs. A higher chest radiographic score coupled with a high number of medical comorbidities was associated with a poor prognosis and higher mortality in those infected with MERS-CoV.

Non-clinical sociodemographic features are important explanatory variables of COVID-19 outcomes, revealing existing disparities in large health care systems. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We use nation-wide multicenter data of COVID-19 patients in Brazil to predict mortality and ventilator usage. The dataset contains hospitalized patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and had either recovered or were deceased between March 1 and June 30, 2020. A total of 113,214 patients with 50,387 deceased, were included. Both interpretable (sparse versions of Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines) and state-of-the-art non-interpretable (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Random Forest) classification methods are employed. Death from COVID-19 was strongly associated with demographics, socioeconomic factors, and comorbidities. Variables highly predictive of mortality included geographic location of the hospital (OR = 2.2 for Northeast region, OR = 2.1 for North region); renal (OR = 2.0) and liver (OR = 1.7) chronic disease; immunosuppression (OR = 1.7); obesity (OR = 1.7); neurological (OR = 1.6), cardiovascular (OR = 1.5), and hematologic (OR = 1.2) disease; diabetes (OR = 1.4); chronic pneumopathy (OR = 1.4); immunosuppression (OR = 1.3); respiratory symptoms, ranging from respiratory discomfort (OR = 1.4) and dyspnea (OR = 1.3) to oxygen saturation less than 95% (OR = 1.7); hospitalization in a public hospital (OR = 1.2); and self-reported patient illiteracy (OR = 1.1). Validation accuracies (AUC) for predicting mortality and ventilation need reach 79% and 70%, respectively, when using only pre-admission variables. Models that use post-admission disease progression information reach accuracies (AUC) of 86% and 87% for predicting mortality and ventilation use, respectively.

While 9/11 and COVID-19 are categorically different events, their short-term impacts on the stock market, and on New York exchanges in particular, were surprisingly similar. We find firms that financially survived 9/11 also managed to do better C or suffer less C by about 7% in terms of stock returns during COVID, compared to control firms that were not exposed to 9/11. In a sense, we show that companies prior exposure to 9/11 partly immunised them against the consequences of a similarly destabilising event albeit two decades later.

The increased circulation and spread in the Americas of VEEV and other encephalitic arboviruses, such as eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus, underscore the need for research aimed at characterizing the pathogenesis of viral encephalomyelitis for the development of novel medical countermeasures. The host-pathogen dynamics of VEEV Trinidad donkey-infected human astrocytoma U87MG cells were determined by carrying out RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of poly(A) and mRNAs. To identify the critical alterations that take place in the host transcriptome following VEEV infection, samples were collected at 4, 8, and 16 h postinfection and RNA-Seq data were acquired using an Ion Torrent PGM platform. Differential expression of interferon response, stress response factors, and components of the unfolded protein response (UPR) was observed. The protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) arm of the UPR was activated, as the expression of both activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and CHOP (DDIT3), critical regulators of the pathway, was altered after infection. Expression of the transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR1) was induced in a PERK-dependent manner. EGR1(?/?) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) demonstrated lower susceptibility to VEEV-induced cell death than isogenic wild-type MEFs, indicating that EGR1 modulates proapoptotic pathways following VEEV infection. The influence of EGR1 is of great importance, as neuronal damage can lead to long-term sequelae in individuals who have survived VEEV infection. IMPORTANCE Alphaviruses represent a group of clinically relevant viruses transmitted by mosquitoes to humans. In severe cases, viral spread targets neuronal tissue, resulting in significant and life-threatening inflammation dependent on a combination of virus-host interactions. Currently there are no therapeutics for infections cause by encephalitic alphaviruses due to an incomplete understanding of their molecular pathogenesis.

Based on the environmental problems found in the investigation, the fluoride removal research in the water containing algal cells was carried out. In this study, AlCl3 and [AlO4Al12(OH)24(H2O)12]7+ (Al13) were used to remove fluoride. Additionally, the role of aluminum speciation in fluoride removal and the effect of Microcystis aeruginosa on the fluoride removal by different aluminum species coagulants were elucidated. The results showed that AlCl3 mainly removed fluoride by physical interactions, surface adsorption and enmeshment. When algal cells were added to the system, the fluoride removal rate increased from 22.75 % to 72.99 % at a dosage of 40.0 mg/L. This was because algal cells greatly increased the distribution of Al(OH)3 in the flocs. In particular, the specific surface area of the flocs containing algal cells reached 160.77 m2/g, which allowed more fluoride to be adsorbed. However, excessive Al3+ led to serious damage to algal cells and release of intracellular organic matter (IOM), worsening the effect of defluoridation. F- and Al3+ formed AlF2+ and AlF2+ via complexation in water. These compounds were not conducive to defluoridation. Al13 removed fluorine mainly through ion exchange, substitution and hydrogen bonding. Algal cells had an inhibitory effect on defluorination, which was observed in the process of coagulation by different Al dosages. Al13 achieved agglomeration of algal cells and generated small and dense flocs through charge neutralization and electrostatic patch mechanism. Once Al13 combined with algal cells and algae organic matter (AOM), the reaction between Al13 and fluoride would be weakened. Al13 not only maintained the defluoridation performance, but also did not damage the integrity of algal cells, even at high dosages.","output":"Effects and behaviors of Microcystis aeruginosa in defluorination by two Al-based coagulants, AlCl3 and Al13."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on the patent information related to coronavirus vaccine, the present situation and development trend of coronavirus vaccine have been analyzed.

This could potentially serve as a biomarker for remission that can guide clinical decision-making. To enhance repeatability and reproducibility, we replicated our study in a larger, more representative multi-site sample. METHODS 64 direction DTI was collected in 144 medication-free patients with MDD from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study. We performed probabilistic tractography between the RN and bilateral amygdala and hippocampus and calculated weighted FA in these tracts. Patients were treated with either sertraline or placebo, and their change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score reported. Pretreatment weighted FA was compared between remitters and nonremitters, and correlation between FA and percent change in HDRS score was assessed. Exploratory moderator and voxel analyses were also performed. RESULTS Contrary to our hypotheses, FA was greater in nonremitters than in remitters in RN-left and right amygdala tracts (p = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). Pretreatment FA between the raphe and left amygdala correlated with greater, not reduced, HDRS (r = 0.18, p = 0.04). This finding was found to be greater in the placebo group. Moderator and voxel analyses yielded no significant findings.

Whether the alveolar compartmentalization of biomarkers has a clinical significance in patients with pneumonia-related ARDS is unknown. This study aimed at assessing the interrelation of ARDS/sepsis biomarkers in the alveolar and blood compartments and explored their association with clinical outcomes. METHODS: Immunocompetent patients with pneumonia-related ARDS admitted between 2014 and 2018 were included in a prospective monocentric study. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and blood samples were obtained within 48 h of admission. Twenty-two biomarkers were quantified in BAL fluid and serum. HLA-DR+ monocytes and CD8+ PD-1+ lymphocytes were quantified using flow cytometry. The primary clinical endpoint of the study was hospital mortality. Patients undergoing a bronchoscopy as part of routine care were included as controls. RESULTS: Seventy ARDS patients were included. Hospital mortality was 21.4%. The BAL fluid-to-serum ratio of IL-8 was 20 times higher in ARDS patients than in controls (p < 0.0001). ARDS patients with shock had lower BAL fluid-to-serum ratio of IL-1Ra (p = 0.026), IL-6 (p = 0.002), IP-10/CXCL10 (p = 0.024) and IL-10 (p = 0.023) than others. The BAL fluid-to-serum ratio of IL-1Ra was more elevated in hospital survivors than decedents (p = 0.006), even after adjusting for SOFA and driving pressure (p = 0.036). There was no significant association between alveolar or alveolar/blood monocytic HLA-DR or CD8+ lymphocytes PD-1 expression and hospital mortality.

Confirmed COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population was our outcome measure. We performed mixed-effect negative binomial regression to examine the association of county population's percentage residing in concentrated disadvantage and Black-concentrated tracts with COVID-19 deaths while controlling for several other characteristics. RESULTS: For every 10% increase in the percentage of county population residing in concentrated disadvantage and Black-concentrated tracts, the rate for confirmed COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population increases by a factor of 1.14 (mortality rate ratio [MMR] = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.11, 1.18) and 1.11 (MMR = 1.11; 95% CI:1.08, 1.14), respectively.

Surprisingly, the results revealed no differences in reading comprehension and reading motivation between the groups, contradicting the assumption that the pandemic-driven shift to distance learning would inevitably impair young students' achievements and self-determined motivation.","output":"First and Second Graders' Reading Motivation and Reading Comprehension Were Not Adversely Affected by Distance Learning During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of a standard total mixed ration (TMR) with containing anthocyanin-rich plants on animal performance, blood biochemical indices, rumen fermentation, microbial composition, and carcass characteristics in meat goats. Thirty-six healthy crossbred Thai-native Anglo-Nubian male goats (14.42  0.6 kg) were used to compare the possibility of using anthocyanin-rich black cane silage (AS) in place of Napier grass silage (NS) as a functional feed resource. All goats received a 90-d routine feeding consisting of two experimental diets that were isocaloric and isonitrogenous: the control group received TMR containing 50% NS (NS; n = 18), and one group received TMR containing 50% AS (AS; n = 18). Average daily weight gain (ADG) and dry matter intake (DMI) were measured as indicators of performance. At the end of the experiment, meat, blood, and rumen samples were collected. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of final body weight, ADG, DMI, or ADG/DMI. There were no differences in rumen pH or total volatile fatty acids (VFAs); however, rumen ammonia N concentrations were lower in the AS group than in the NS group. Individual VFA concentrations varied, with AS group containing more Ruminococcus albus and NS group containing more methanogenic bacteria. Blood biochemical indices varied, with NS group having higher TBARS concentration and AS group having higher concentrations of TAC, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, and GSH-Rx. Goat meat from the AS group had higher levels of intramuscular fat and was more tender compared to goat meat from the NS group. The feeding of anthocyanin-rich black cane appears to be an attractive alternative for Napier grass in the nutrition of meat goats. The current results indicate that the feeding of a TMR containing 50% anthocyanin-rich black cane alleviates oxidative stress and promotes the production of tender meat.","output":"Growth Performance, Blood Biochemical Indices, Rumen Bacterial Community, and Carcass Characteristics in Goats Fed Anthocyanin-Rich Black Cane Silage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data quality is essential to the success of the most simple and the most complex analysis. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, large-scale data sharing across the US and around the world has played an important role in public health responses to the pandemic and has been crucial to understanding and predicting its likely course. In California, hospitals have been required to report a large volume of daily data related to COVID-19. In order to meet this need, electronic health records (EHRs) have played an important role, but the challenges of reporting high-quality data in real-time from EHR data sources have not been explored. We describe some of the challenges of utilizing EHR data for this purpose from the perspective of a large, integrated, mixed-payer health system in northern California, US. We emphasize some of the inadequacies inherent in EHR data using several specific examples, and explore the clinical-analytic gap that forms the basis for some of these inadequacies. We highlight the need for data and analytics to be incorporated into the early stages of clinical crisis planning in order to utilize EHR data to full advantage. We further propose that lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic can result in the formation of collaborative teams joining clinical operations, informatics, data analytics, and research, ultimately resulting in improved data quality to support effective crisis response.","output":"Mind the Clinical-Analytic Gap: Electronic Health Records and COVID-19 Pandemic Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The rapid surge of cases and insufficient numbers of intensive care unit (ICU) beds have forced hospitals to utilise their general wards for administration of non-invasive respiratory support including HFNC(High Flow Nasal Cannula) in severe COVID-19. However, there is a dearth of data on the success of such advanced levels of care outside the ICU setting. Therefore, we conducted an observational study at our centre, and systematically reviewed the literature, to assess the success of HFNC in managing severe COVID-19 cases outside the ICU. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary referral centre where records of all adult COVID-19 patients (over 18 years) requiring HFNC support were between September and December 2020 were analysed. HFNC support was adjusted to target SpO2 over 90% and respiratory rate less than 30 per min. The clinical, demographic, laboratory, and treatment details of these patients were retrieved from the medical records and entered in predesigned proforma. Outcome parameters included duration of oxygen during hospital stay, duration of HFNC therapy, length of hospital stay and death or discharge. HFNC success was denoted when a patient did not require escalation of therapy to NIV or invasive mechanical ventilation, or shifting to the ICU, and was eventually discharged from the hospital without oxygen therapy; otherwise, the outcome was denoted as HFNC failure. Systematic review was also performed on the available literature on the experience with HFNC in COVID-19 patients outside of ICU settings using the MEDLINE, Web of Science and Embase databases. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of STATA software, version 12, OpenMeta[Analyst], and visualization of the risk of bias plot using robvis. Results Thirty-one patients receiving HFNC in the ward setting, had a median age of 62 (50 - 69) years including 24 (77%) males. Twenty-one (68%) patients successfully tolerated HFNC and were subsequently discharged from the wards, while 10 (32%) patients had to be shifted to ICU for non-invasive or invasive ventilation, implying HFNC failure. Patients with HFNC failure had higher median D-dimer values at baseline (2.2 mcg/ml vs 0.6 mcg/ml, p=0.001) and lower initial SpO2 on room air at admission (70% vs 80%, p=0.026) as compared to those in whom HFNC was successful .A cut-off value of 1.7 mg/L carried a high specificity (90.5%) and moderate sensitivity (80%) for the occurrence of HFNC failure. Radiographic severity scoring as per the BRIXIA score was comparable in both the groups(11 vs 10.5 out of 18, p=0.78 ). After screening 98 articles, total of seven studies were included for synthesis in the systematic review with a total of 820 patients, with mean age of the studies ranging from 44 to 83 years and including 62% males. After excluding 2 studies from the analysis, the pooled rates of HFNC failure were 36.3% (95% CI 31.1% - 41.5%) with no significant heterogeneity (I2 =0%, p=0.55). Conclusions Our study demonstrated successful outcomes with use of HFNC in an outside of ICU setting among two-thirds of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Lower room air SpO2 and higher D-dimer levels at presentation were associated with failure of HFNC therapy leading to ICU transfer for endotracheal intubation or death. Also, the results from the systematic review demonstrated similar rates of successful outcomes concluding that HFNC is a viable option with failure rates similar to those of ICU settings in such patients.","output":"Use of HFNC in COVID-19 patients in non-ICU setting: Experience from a tertiary referral centre of north India and a systematic review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Around the world, more than 250 countries are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

This paper proposes an ensemble model which detects the COVID-19 infection in the early stage with the use of chest X-ray images. The transfer learning enables to reuse the pretrained models. The ensemble learning integrates various transfer learning models, i.e., EfficientNet, GoogLeNet, and XceptionNet, to design the proposed model. These models can categorize patients as COVID-19 (+), pneumonia (+), tuberculosis (+), or healthy. The proposed model enhances the classifier's generalization ability for both binary and multiclass COVID-19 datasets. Two popular datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed ensemble model.

METHODS: The demographic data, clinical features, laboratory examinations, and epidemiological characteristics of enrolled cases were collected and analyzed. Two family members (Cases 1 and 2) had Hubei exposure history and were admitted to the hospital with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19; eight familial members who had contact with them during the incubation period underwent quarantine in a hospital. We closely followed up all the family members and analyzed their clinical outcome. RESULTS: Case 3 had negative SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results but was suspected to have COVID-19 because of radiographic abnormalities. Cases 4 and 5 developed symptomatic COVID-19. Case 6 was considered an asymptomatic carrier as his SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was positive.

Data including demographics, COVID-19 severity, patient outcome, and the incidence and degree of olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction were collected and analyzed. The Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (QOD) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were used to quantify olfactory and gustatory dysfunction respectively. All subjects at one hospital (Shanghai) without subjective olfactory complaints underwent objective testing. Results: Of 394 screened subjects, 161 (41%) reported olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction and were included. Incidence of olfactory and/or gustatory disorders in Chinese (n=239), German (n=39) and French (n=116) cohorts were 32%, 69%, and 49% 138 respectively. The median age of included subjects was 39 years old, 92/161 (57%) were male, and 10/161 (6%) were children. Of included subjects, 10% had only olfactory or gustatory symptoms, and 19% had olfactory and/or gustatory complaints prior to any other COVID-19 symptom. Of subjects with objective olfactory testing, 10/90 demonstrated abnormal chemosensory function despite reporting normal subjective olfaction. 43% (44/102) of subjects with follow-up showed symptomatic improvement in olfaction or gustation.

Coping skills are an essential part of the Psychological immune system, which leads to successful adaptation. Due to COVID-19 most universities have changed their face-to-face teaching for online education. Nevertheless, there is little concrete empirical evidence on how this generation of students with the ongoing impacts of disruptive changes can cope with it. Colleges and universities need to make changes in order to retain this new generation of students. Our aim was to explore the characteristics and changes in coping skills of university students from three different age groups. Method: Psychological coping skills were measured by the Psychological Immune Competence Inventory (PICI). Differences were detected between generations. Group comparisons (pre-2004, pre-Covid, and post-Covid) groups were compared) using PICI subscales using independent sample analysis of variance. The sample consisted of 4,731 university students, 2,768 (58.5%) were men and 1,730 (36.56%) were women. Results: Students from 2004 showed significantly higher scores in the Self-regulation subsystem scale compared to students in the pre-Covid and post-Covid groups. Self-regulation subsystem: F(2, 2,569.607) = 444.375, p < 0.001, (2) = 0.27: small effect, (2) = 0.27; Resilience: F(2, 2,372.117) = 1171.855, p < 0.001, (2) = 0.14: small effect, (2) = 0.14. Based on the results, the explained variance ratio was at least 10% based on self-regulation and resilience.

Apart from the clinically and electrocardiographically discernible causes of ACI, such as acute myocardial infarction (MI), other cardiac causes need to be considered such as myocarditis, Takotsubo syndrome, and direct injury from COVID-19, together with noncardiac conditions, such as pulmonary embolism, critical illness, and sepsis. Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with normal or near-normal coronary arteries (ACS-NNOCA) appear to have a higher prevalence in both COVID-19 positive and negative patients in the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic era. Echocardiography, coronary angiography, chest computed tomography and/or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may render a correct diagnosis, obviating the need for endomyocardial biopsy. Importantly, a significant delay has been recorded in patients with ACS seeking advice for their symptoms, while their routine care has been sharply disrupted with fewer urgent coronary angiographies and/or primary percutaneous coronary interventions performed in the case of ST-elevation MI (STEMI) with an inappropriate shift toward thrombolysis, all contributing to a higher complication rate in these patients.

Importantly, the roles of VK2 on aging and stress resistance were shown to be dependent on enhanced fat metabolism and not due to its antioxidant effects. Moreover, the genes related to fat metabolism that were up-regulated following VK2 treatment play key roles in improving survival. Obesity is a leading risk factor for developing T2DM, and taking VKs has been previously considered to improve the insulin sensitivity associated with obesity and T2DM risk. However, our results showed that VK2 can significantly influence the expression of genes related to fat metabolism, including those that regulate fatty acid elongation, desaturation, and synthesis of fatty acid-CoA. VK2 enhanced the fatty acid -oxidation activity in peroxisome to degrade and digest fatty acid-CoA. Our study implies that VK2 can enhance fat degradation and digestion to improve survival, supporting the effectiveness of VK2-based medical treatments.

Here, we study the mechanisms of glucocorticoid response, focusing on lung cancer. We show that GR activation induces reversible cancer cell dormancy characterised by anticancer drug tolerance, and activation of growth factor survival signalling accompanied by vulnerability to inhibitors. GR-induced dormancy is dependent on a single GR-target gene, CDKN1C, regulated through chromatin looping of a GR-occupied upstream distal enhancer in a SWI/SNF-dependent fashion. These insights illustrate the importance of GR signalling in non-lymphoid solid cancer biology, particularly in lung cancer, and warrant caution for use of glucocorticoids in treatment of anticancer therapy related side-effects.","output":"Glucocorticoid receptor triggers a reversible drug-tolerant dormancy state with acquired therapeutic vulnerabilities in lung cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir use in patients with severe COVID-19.

The outcomes of interest were the impact of remdesivir on in-hospital death by day 28 as well as time to recovery, clinical improvement, and discharge. We utilized Cox proportional hazards models and stratified log-rank tests. RESULTS: 224 patients were included in the study. Median age was 59 years; 67.0% were male; 17/125 patients (13.6%) who received supportive care and 7/99 patients (7.1%) who received remdesivir died. The unadjusted risk for 28-day in-hospital death was lower for patients who received remdesivir compared to patients who received supportive care (HR 0.42; 95% CI: 0.16-1.08). Although this trend remained the same after adjusting for age, sex, race and oxygen requirements on admission (aHR 0.49; 95% CI: 0.19-1.28), as well as chronic comorbidities and use of corticosteroids (aHR 0.44; 95% CI: 0.16-1.23), it did not reach statistical significance.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited MS patients, low-risk (university staff from non-clinical departments), and high-risk individuals (healthcare staff from COVID-19 wards) from 11 May to 15 June 2020. We used lateral flow immunoassay to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. We used t-test, Fisher's exact test, chi square test, or McNemar's test, as appropriate, to evaluate between-group differences. RESULTS: We recruited 310 MS patients (42.3  12.4 years; females 67.1%), 862 low-risk individuals (42.9  13.3 years; females 47.8%), and 235 high-risk individuals (39.4  10.9 years; females 54.5%). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM in MS patients (n = 9, 2.9%) was significantly lower than in the high-risk population (n = 25, 10.6%) (p < 0.001), and similar to the low-risk population (n = 11, 1.3%) (p = 0.057); these results were also confirmed after random matching by age and sex (1:1:1). No significant differences were found in demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory features. Among MS patients positive to SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM (n = 9), only two patients retrospectively reported mild and short-lasting COVID-19 symptoms.

Betacoronaviral nucleoprotein (N) is a highly dynamic cofactor of the replication-transcription complex (RTC), whose function depends on an essential interaction with the amino-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of nsp3 (Ubl1). Here, we describe this complex (dissociation constant - 30 to 200 nM) at atomic resolution. The interaction implicates two linear motifs in the intrinsically disordered linker domain (N3), a hydrophobic helix ((219)LALLLLDRLNQL(230)) and a disordered polar strand ((243)GQTVTKKSAAEAS(255)), that mutually engage to form a bipartite interaction, folding N3 around Ubl1. This results in substantial collapse in the dimensions of dimeric N, forming a highly compact molecular chaperone, that regulates binding to RNA, suggesting a key role of nsp3 in the association of N to the RTC. The identification of distinct linear motifs that mediate an important interaction between essential viral factors provides future targets for development of innovative strategies against COVID-19.","output":"The intrinsically disordered SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein in dynamic complex with its viral partner nsp3a"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widespread use of chemical control agents and pesticides for plant-pathogen control has caused many human health and environmental issues. Plant extracts and biocontrol agents have robust antimicrobial activity against different plant pathogens. However, their antiviral activities are still being investigated. In the present study, the methanol extract of Paronychia argentea was characterized and evaluated for its protective activity against the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection in tomato plants under greenhouse conditions at 21 days post-inoculation. The results showed that the foliar application of P. argentea extract (10 g/mL) enhanced tomato plant growth, resulting in significant increases in shoot and root parameters and total chlorophyll contents. Moreover, a significant reduction in TMV accumulation level in P. argentea-treated plants of 77.88% compared to non-treated plants was reported. Furthermore, induction of systemic resistance with significant elevation in production of antioxidant enzymes (PPO, CAT, and SOD) and transcriptional levels of the pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-1 and PR-7) and polyphenolic genes (CHS and HQT) were also observed. Out of 16 detected compounds, HPLC analysis revealed that the most abundant polyphenolic compounds found in P. argentea extract were gallic acid (5.36 g/mL), kaempferol (7.39 g/mL), quercetin (7.44 g/mL), ellagic acid (7.89 g/mL), myricetin (8.36 g/mL), and ferulic acid (8.69 g/mL).

This study aimed to determine the effect of TIVA with different ratios of ketofol on recovery in children. METHODS Seventy-five children aged 3-12 years and undergoing adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy surgery were randomized into three groups. Ratios of 1:5, 1:6.7 and 1:10 ketamine-propofol mixture (ketofol) were prepared in the same syringe for groups I, II and III, respectively. Induction and maintenance of anesthesia were performed with 1:5, 1:6.7 and 1:10 ratios of ketofol in groups I, II and III, respectively. A McFarlan infusion dose regimen was used (15 mg/kg/h for 15 min, 13 mg/kg/h for 15 min, 11 mg/kg/h for 30 min) and infusion rates were decreased for the different ratios. Infusion rates were reduced to 67, 80 and 90% of the McFarlan dose regimen for groups I, II and III, respectively. Extubating time, length of stay in PACU, postoperative PAED and FLACC scores were recorded. RESULTS Extubating time was significantly lower [mean 254.3  92.7 s (95% CI 216.6-292.6, p = 0.001)] in group III than in groups I and II [371.3  153 s (308.1-434.48) and 343.2  123.7 s (292.2-394.3), respectively].

Starting from the 1980s, codon-based indices have been used for answering different questions in all biomedical fields, including systems biology, agriculture, medicine, and biotechnology. In general, codon usage bias indices weigh each codon or a small set of codons to estimate the fitting of a certain coding sequence to a certain phenomenon (e.g., bias in codons, adaptation to the tRNA pool, frequencies of certain codons, transcription elongation speed, etc.) and are usually easy to implement. Today there are dozens of such indices; thus, this paper aims to review and compare the different codon usage bias indices, their applications, and advantages.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Professional societies provided ad-hoc guidance at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic on deferral of surgical and perioperative interventions, but these lack specific parameters to determine the optimal timing of surgery. METHODS: Using the GRADE system, published evidence was analyzed to generate weighted statements for stage, site, acuity of presentation, and hospital setting to specify when surgery should be pursued, the time and duration of oncologically acceptable delays, and when to utilize nonsurgical modalities to bridge the waiting period. RESULTS: Colorectal cancer surgeriesprioritized as emergency, urgent with imminent emergency or oncologically urgent, or electivewere matched against the phases of the pandemic. Surgery in COVID-19-positive patients must be avoided. Emergent and imminent emergent cases should mostly proceed unless resources are exhausted. Standard practices allow for postponement of elective cases and deferral to nonsurgical modalities of stage II/III rectal and metastatic colorectal cancer. Oncologically urgent cases may be delayed for 6(C12) weeks without jeopardizing oncological outcomes. Outside established principles, administration of nonsurgical modalities is not justified and increases the vulnerability of patients.

Thus, mitoNEET is a key regulator of mitochondrial oxidative capacity and iron homeostasis. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play critical roles in inflammatory diseases such as sepsis. Increased iron levels mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction lead to oxidative damage and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increasing evidence suggests that targeting mitoNEET to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction deserves further investigation. However, the role of mitoNEET in inflammatory diseases is unknown. Here, we investigated the mechanism of action and function of mitoNEET during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. Levels of mitoNEET protein increased during microbial or LPS-induced sepsis. Pharmacological inhibition of mitoNEET using mitoNEET ligand-1 (NL-1) decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- in animal models of sepsis, as well as LPS-induced inflammatory responses by macrophages in vitro.

DESIGN: UK population-based survey conducted during August and September 2020. Correlates of help-seeking behaviour were modelled using logistic regression in participants reporting potential cancer symptoms during the previous 6 months. Qualitative telephone interviews with a purposeful subsample of participants, analysed thematically. SETTING: Online UK wide survey. PARTICIPANTS: 7543 adults recruited via Cancer Research UK online panel provider (Dynata) and HealthWise Wales (a national register of research ready participants) supplemented with social media (Facebook and Twitter) recruitment. 30 participants were also interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survey measures included experiences of 15 potential cancer symptoms, help-seeking behaviour, barriers and prompts to help-seeking. RESULTS: Of 3025 (40.1%) participants who experienced a potential cancer symptom, 44.8% (1355/3025) had not contacted their general practitioner (GP). Odds of help-seeking were higher among participants with disability (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.38, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.71) and who experienced more symptoms (aOR=1.68, 95% CI 1.56 to 1.82), and lower among those who perceived COVID-19 as the cause of symptom(s) (aOR=0.36, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.52). Barriers included worries about wasting the doctors time (1158/7543, 15.4%), putting strain on healthcare services (945, 12.6%) and not wanting to make a fuss (907, 12.0%). Interviewees reported reluctance to contact the GP due to concerns about COVID-19 and fear of attending hospitals, and described putting their health concerns on hold. CONCLUSIONS: Many people avoided healthcare services despite experiencing potential cancer symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We report the evaluation of the fast kinetic anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Nanobody 7D12, labelled with (68)Ga via the novel bifunctional chelate (BFC) p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine (Df-Bz-NCS). Df-Bz-NCS has recently been introduced as the chelate of choice for (89)Zr immuno-positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS Nanobody 7D12 was premodified with Df-Bz-NCS at pH 9. Radiolabelling with purified (68)Ga was performed at pH 5.0-6.5 for 5 min at room temperature. For in vitro stability measurements in storage buffer (0.25 M NaOAc with 5 mg ml(-1) gentisic acid, pH 5.5) at 4C or in human serum at 37C, a mixture of (67)Ga and (68)Ga was used. Biodistribution and immuno-PET studies of (68)Ga-Df-Bz-NCS-7D12 were performed in nude mice bearing A431 xenografts using (89)Zr-Df-Bz-NCS-7D12 as the reference conjugate. RESULTS The Df-Bz-NCS chelate was conjugated to Nanobody 7D12 with a chelate to Nanobody molar substitution ratio of 0.2:1. The overall (68)Ga radiochemical yield was 55-70% (not corrected for decay); specific activity was 100-500 MBq/mg. Radiochemical purity of the conjugate was >96%, while the integrity and immunoreactivity were preserved. (68/67)Ga-Df-Bz-NCS-7D12 was stable in storage buffer as well as in human serum during a 5-h incubation period (<2% radioactivity loss). In biodistribution studies the (68)Ga-labelled Nanobody 7D12 showed high uptake in A431 tumours (ranging from 6.1  1.3 to 7.2  1.5%ID/g at 1-3 h after injection) and high tumour to blood ratios, which increased from 8.2 to 14.4 and 25.7 at 1, 2 and 3 h after injection, respectively. High uptake was also observed in the kidneys. Biodistribution was similar to that of the reference conjugate (89)Zr-Df-Bz-NCS-7D12. Tumours were clearly visualized in a PET imaging study. CONCLUSION Via a rapid procedure under mild conditions a (68)Ga-Nanobody was obtained that exhibited high tumour uptake and tumour to normal tissue ratios in nude mice bearing A431 xenografts.

METHODS: An anonymous Web-based survey distributed in April 2020. All healthcare workers employed in a critical care setting were eligible to participate. Invitations to the survey were distributed through Australian and New Zealand critical care societies and social media platforms. The primary outcome was the proportion of healthcare workers who reported moderate to extremely severe scores on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). RESULTS: Of the 3770 complete responses, 3039 (80.6%) were from Australia. A total of 2871 respondents (76.2%) were women; the median age was 41 years. Nurses made up 2269 (60.2%) of respondents, with most (2029 [53.8%]) working in intensive care units. Overall, 813 (21.6%) respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, 1078 (28.6%) reported moderate to extremely severe anxiety, and 1057 (28.0%) reported moderate to extremely severe stress scores. Mean  standard deviation values of DASS-21 depression, anxiety, and stress scores amongst woman vs men was as follows: 8.0  8.2 vs 7.1  8.2 (p = 0.003), 7.2  7.5 vs 5.0  6.7 (p < 0.001), and 14.4  9.6 vs 12.5  9.4 (p < 0.001), respectively. After adjusting for significant confounders, clinical concerns associated with higher DASS-21 scores included not being clinically prepared (? = 4.2, p < 0.001), an inadequate workforce (? = 2.4, p = 0.001), having to triage patients owing to lack of beds and/or equipment (? = 2.6, p = 0.001), virus transmission to friends and family (? = 2.1, p = 0.009), contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (? = 2.8, p = 0.011), being responsible for other staff members (? = 3.1, p < 0.001), and being asked to work in an area that was not in the respondents' expertise (? = 5.7, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this survey of critical care healthcare workers, between 22 and 29% of respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, with women reporting higher scores than men. Although female gender appears to play a role, modifiable factors also contribute to psychological burden and should be studied further.","output":"Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on critical care healthcare workers' depression, anxiety, and stress levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ion-track etching represents a highly versatile way of introducing artificial pores with diameters down into the nm-regime into polymers, which offers considerable synthetic flexibility in template-assisted nanofabrication schemes.

However, scant research has examined the underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon the risk-resilience model, this study proposes that self-control, as a resilient factor, would potentially moderate the association between perceived severity of COVID-19 and mental health problems. Data from a national survey was used to examine this idea.

More importantly, self-control moderated the perceived severity of COVID-19Cmental health problems association, with this link attenuating as the levels of self-control increased. These findings suggest that compared to those with high self-control, individuals with low self-control are more vulnerable and are more in need of psychological aids to maintain mental health in the encounter of the COVID-19 outbreak.

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO(2)) removal (ECCO(2)R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO(2)], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO(2)] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO(2)]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO(2)) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57C69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO(2) and PaCO(2) values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51C54]% vs. 49 [47C50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO(2) (from 62 [56C71] to 82 [76C87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO(2) (from 53 [52C54]% to 60 [59C64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO(2) (from 65 [67C73] to 72 [67C73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO(2) (from 53 [51C56]% to 57 [55C59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO(2)R decreased PaO(2) (from 75 [75C79] to 64 [60C70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO(2) values (59 [56C65]% vs. 56 [53C62]%, p = 0.002).

The promising germicidal effect of the UV-C radiation, also on the Coronavirus, raises the question of the reliable measurement of the UV radiation. However, this complex task needs an expertise and appropriate equipment. The system suitable for UV measurements consists of a high-precision spectroradiometer with stray light correction and irradiance probes or PTFE-coated integrating spheres for total radiant flux measurements. However, the reliable and traceable calibration of the system is the challenging factor. So far, no national metrological institute has been able to offer a reference standard for the total radiant flux in the UV-B and UV-C spectral region. Therefore, we have realized traceable UV LED calibration standards, which complete measurement system for UV radiation presented here. The UV LED calibration standards have been developed for the typical peak wavelengths of 280 nm (UV-C), 305 nm (UV-B) and 365 nm (UV-A). The traceability of the radiant flux is ensured by the precise calibration of the spectroradiometer with the irradiance probe and a subsequent integrative measurement using a goniospectroradiometer. Such UV LED calibration standards can be used for monitoring and for absolute calibration of UV measurement equipment consisting of the stray light corrected spectroradiometer and the integrating sphere.

We used negative (not causally related) and positive control outcomes. The latter were synthetically generated true safety signals with incident rate ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4. Observed vs. expected analysis using within-database historical background rates is a sensitive but unspecific method for the identification of potential vaccine safety signals. Despite good discrimination, most analyses showed a tendency to overestimate risks, with 20%-100% type 1 error, but low (0% to 20%) type 2 error in the large databases included in our study. Efforts to improve the comparability of background and post-vaccine rates, including age-sex adjustment and anchoring background rates around a visit, reduced type 1 error and improved precision but residual systematic error persisted. Additionally, empirical calibration dramatically reduced type 1 to nominal but came at the cost of increasing type 2 error. Our study found that within-database background rate comparison is a sensitive but unspecific method to identify vaccine safety signals. The method is positively biased, with low (<=20%) type 2 error, and 20% to 100% of negative control outcomes were incorrectly identified as safety signals due to type 1 error. Age-sex adjustment and anchoring background rate estimates around a healthcare visit are useful strategies to reduce false positives, with little impact on type 2 error. Sufficient sensitivity was reached for the identification of safety signals by month 1-2 for vaccines with quick uptake (e.g., seasonal influenza), but much later (up to month 9) for vaccines with slower uptake (e.g., varicella-zoster or papillomavirus).

The main reported concerns are centered around privacy and ethical issues. At the same time, people are voluntarily using Social Media apps at a significantly higher rate during the pandemic without similar privacy concerns compared with COVID-19 apps. To better understand these seemingly anomalous behaviours, we analysed the privacy policies, terms & conditions and data use agreements of the most commonly used COVID-19, Social Media & Productivity apps. We also developed a tool to extract and analyse nearly 2 million user reviews for these apps. Our results show that Social Media & Productivity apps actually have substantially higher privacy and ethical issues compared with the majority of COVID-19 apps. Surprisingly, lots of people indicated in their user reviews that they feel more secure as their privacy are better handled in COVID-19 apps than in Social Media apps. On the other hand, most of the COVID-19 apps are less accessible and stable compared to most Social Media apps, which negatively impacted their store ratings and led users to uninstall COVID-19 apps more frequently. Our findings suggest that in order to effectively fight this pandemic, health officials and technologists will need to better raise awareness among people about COVID-19 app behaviour and trustworthiness. This will allow people to better understand COVID-19 apps and encourage them to download and use these apps.

A number of studies suggest that mental health deteriorated in many countries prior to enforced isolation (lockdown), but it remains unknown how mental health has changed during lockdown. Aims: This study explored trajectories of anxiety and depression over the first two months of lockdown using data from the UK, and compared the experiences of individuals with and without diagnosed mental illness. Methods: Data from 53,328 adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study (a well-stratified panel study weighted to population proportions collecting data weekly during the Covid-19 pandemic) were analysed from 21/03/2020-10/05/2020. Growth curve modelling was fitted accounting for socio-demographic and health covariates. Results: 24.4% of the sample had scores indicating moderate-severe anxiety, and 31.4% indicating moderate-severe depressive symptoms. Over the first two months of lockdown, there was only a slight decrease in anxiety levels amongst participants as a whole and a very small decrease in depression levels between weeks 3-6 that then increased again in weeks 7-8. Adults with pre-existing diagnoses of mental health conditions had higher levels of anxiety and depression but there was no evidence of widening inequalities in mental health experiences compared to people without existing mental illness. Conclusions: Results suggest there has been little improvement in depression and only slight improvements in anxiety since lockdown commenced in the UK.

Previous study has reported several COVID-19 cases with conjunctivitis. However, the complete profiling of COVID-19 related ocular symptoms and diseases are still missing. We aim to investigate the ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of five hundred and thirty-four patients were recruited at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital. We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, systemic concomitant symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, radiologic findings, and SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR from questionnaires and electronic medical records. Results: The median age of patients was 40 and 50 years at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital, respectively. Of 534 COVID-19 patients, 25 patients (4.68%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 3 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The average duration of conjunctival congestion was 4.9 {+/-} 2.6 days (mean [SD]), ranging from 2 to 10 days. Dry eye (112, 20.97%), blurred vision (68, 12.73%), and foreign body sensation (63, 11.80%) ranked as the top three COVID-19 related ocular symptoms. Notably, a total of 332 COVID-19 patients (62%) had a hand-eye contact history. We also found that some COVID-19 patients had a history of eye disease, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.18%), dry eye (24, 4.49%), keratitis (14, 2.62%), cataract (9, 1.69%), and diabetic retinopathy (5, 0.94%). In consistent with previous studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough, and fatigue. Patients, 60.5% in Mobile Cabin Hospital and 67.5% in Tongji Hospital, respectively were confirmed with positive SARS-CoV-2 detection. Conclusions: Conjunctival congestion was one of the COVID-19 related ocular symptoms, which may have clinical diagnostic significance.

Among them, 140 patients (mean age, 38.5 years, 89 women) reported sudden olfactory/gustatory disorders during COVID-19. All patients were interviewed by phone based on a questionnaire with 16 questions at time of survey. The primary end point was olfactory recovery rate at time of survey. RESULTS: The frequency of patients with olfactory disorders was higher before March 20, 2020 than since (70.3% vs. 53.9%, respectively) (P = .016). At time of survey (26 days of the mean time from anosmia onset), 95.71% reported to start an olfactory recovery. The mean time from olfactory loss onset to recovery onset was 11.6 days. Recovery started between the fourth and the fifteenth day after olfactory loss onset in 78.4% of patients. Complete olfactory recovery happened for 51.43% of patients. There was a significant relationship between the complete olfactory recovery and a short time from olfactory loss onset to recovery onset (P = .0004), absence of nasal obstruction (P = .023) and absence of sore/dry/tingling feeling in the nose (P = .007) in COVID-19 patients.

RESULTS: Of the patients included in the cohort, 183 (8.85%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 46 were admitted to hospital. More hospitalized patients were female, came from higher socio-economic background and had a higher baseline HbA1c. A prior diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident and chronic lung disease conferred an increased risk of hospitalization but not obesity or smoking status. In a multivariate analysis, controlling for multiple prior clinical conditions, the only parameter associated with a significantly increased risk for hospitalization was HbA1c &#8805; 9%.

In addition, we reviewed the available literature on the impact of the pandemic on the ICU environment caring for COVID-19 patients. Methods. The databases were searched. Single key words or their combinations using AND or OR operators were entered. Eventually, 15 articles were included in our review, which included two identical papers. Results. Conflicts occurred occasionally or rarely; researchers describing ethical conflicts demonstrated a moderate level of exposure to conflicts. The pandemic created many challenges and ethical dilemmas that are a source of ethical conflict. Conclusions. As conflict by nature remains inevitable, adequate procedures in conflict management should be developed and the leadership of managing personnel should be reinforced, because team members frequently expect guidance from their supervisors.

Our objectives were to determine the frequency of ARI due to respiratory viruses and the associated clinical outcomes during pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnant women in their second or third trimester were enrolled if they reported having symptoms of ARI or were healthy within the preceding 2 weeks. Nasopharyngeal secretions were evaluated for respiratory viruses by molecular diagnostic assays. Clinical outcomes were evaluated at enrollment and via a follow-up telephone-based questionnaire 2 weeks later. RESULTS: There were 155 pregnant participants, with 81 ARI cases and 91 healthy controls. Acute lower respiratory tract illness (ALRTI) was identified in 29 cases (36%). Human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza virus accounted for 75% of virus-positive cases of ALRTI. Cases with ALRTI often reported a longer duration of illness, history of allergies, symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, or chest pain, and use of prescription medication. Two cases with ALRTI reported decreased fetal movement; a third case with ALRTI was hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: In over one third of ARI cases, participants had symptoms consistent with ALRTI.

METHODS: Details of the location of AEDs registered with English Ambulance Services were obtained from individual services or internet sources. Neighbourhood characteristics of lower layer super output areas (LSOA) were obtained from the Office for National Statistics. Comparisons were made between LSOAs with and without a registered AED. RESULTS: AEDs were statistically more likely to be in LSOAs with a lower residential but higher workplace population density, with people predominantly from a white ethnic background and working in higher socio-economically classified occupations (p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between AED coverage and the LSOA Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) (r = 0.79, p = 0.007), with only 27.4% in the lowest IMD decile compared to about 45% in highest.

Numerous mutations have been identified in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of different SARS-CoV strains isolated from humans or civets. Why these mutations were naturally selected or how SARS-CoV evolved to adapt to different host receptors has been poorly understood, presenting evolutionary and epidemic conundrums. In this study, we investigated the impact of these mutations on receptor recognition, an important determinant of SARS-CoV infection and pathogenesis. Using a combination of biochemical, functional, and crystallographic approaches, we elucidated the molecular and structural mechanisms of each of these naturally selected RBD mutations. These mutations either strengthen favorable interactions or reduce unfavorable interactions with two virus-binding hot spots on ACE2, and by doing so, they enhance viral interactions with either human (hACE2) or civet (cACE2) ACE2. Therefore, these mutations were viral adaptations to either hACE2 or cACE2. To corroborate the above analysis, we designed and characterized two optimized RBDs. The human-optimized RBD contains all of the hACE2-adapted residues (Phe-442, Phe-472, Asn-479, Asp-480, and Thr-487) and possesses exceptionally high affinity for hACE2 but relative low affinity for cACE2.

Test data showed that the mean PFE values of 444 sterilized FFP2 face masks from the 19 CSSDs were 9011% (meanSD), and those of 474 new, imported KN95/FFP2 face masks were 8316% (meanSD). Differences in PFE of masks received from different sterilization departments were found. CONCLUSION: Face masks can be reprocessed with 121 C steam or H(2)O(2) plasma sterilization with a minimal reduction in PFE. PFE comparison between filter material of sterilized masks and new, imported masks indicates that the filter material of most reprocessed masks of high quality brands can outperform new, imported face masks of unknown brands. Although the PFE of tested face masks from different sterilization departments remained efficient, using different types of sterilization equipment, can result in different PFE outcomes.","output":"Can sterilization of disposable face masks be an alternative for imported face masks?

We also re-tested remnant weakly positive specimens to assess analytical sensitivity. All assays had strong linear correlation and little bias among cycle threshold (Ct) values for PCR targets. In patients with first-test negative results (n=811), most (795, 98.0%) remained negative for all subsequent testing. Re-testing of weakly positive specimens (Ct>30) showed sensitivities as TaqPath (97.8%), CDC (91%), Simplexa (75.3%). Our analysis showed no performance difference among PCR targets within the same assay, suggesting a single target is sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens had higher negative predictive value (NPV) (100%) than upper respiratory tract specimens (98%), highlighting the utility of testing LRT specimens when clinically indicated.

However, variation in practices across units leads to challenges in ensuring accountability. We redesigned the organizations mesosystem to provide oversight and alignment of microsystem efforts and ensure accountability in the context of the macrosystem. We implemented an A3 framework to achieve reductions in CLABSI through adherence to known evidence-based bundles. METHODS: We conducted this CLABSI reduction improvement initiative at a 395-bed freestanding, academic, university-affiliated childrens hospital. A mesosystem-focused A3 emphasized bundle adherence through 3 key drivers (1) practice standardization, (2) data transparency, and (3) accountability. We evaluated the impact of this intervention on CLABSI rates during the pre-intervention (01/15-09/17) and post-intervention (07/18C06/19) periods using a Poisson model controlling for baseline trends. RESULTS: Our quarterly CLABSI rates during the pre-intervention period ranged from 1.0 to 2.3 CLABSIs per 1,000 central line-days. With the mesosystem in place, CLABSI rates ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 per 1,000 central line days during the post-intervention period. Adjusting for secular trends, we observed a statistically significant decrease in the post versus pre-intervention CLABSI rate of 71%. CONCLUSION: Our hospital-wide CLABSI rate declined for the first time in many years after the redesign of the mesosystem and a focus on practice standardization, data transparency, and accountability. Our approach highlights the importance of alignment across unit-level microsystems to ensure high-fidelity implementation of practice standards throughout the healthcare-delivery system.","output":"Reduction of Central Line-associated Bloodstream Infection Through Focus on the Mesosystem: Standardization, Data, and Accountability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Patients undergoing cardiopulmonary stabilization in the intensive care unit for novel coronavirus (COVID-19) are often sedated, placing timely assessment of a neurological decline at risk Case Description Here, we present two cases of COVID-19 infected young patients transferred to our facility in a cardio-pulmonary crisis, with a poor neurological exam While there was significant delay in obtaining brain imaging in the first patient, the second patient had timely recognition of her ischemic infarct, underwent emergent surgery, and is now doing well Conclusions These cases highlight the importance of early head imaging in COVID-19 patients with a poor neurological exam While lungs remain the primary target of COVID-19, these cases alert the medical community to suspect involvement of the central nervous system, since there may be life-saving surgical interventions available","output":"Necessity of brain imaging in COVID-19 infected patients presenting with acute neurological deficits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the study was to describe the medical interns' (MI) perceptions about the internship suspension during the COVID-19 quarantine in Peru.

The study cohort included 43 ICB-treated metastatic lung adenocarcinoma showing long-term response (n = 16), rapid progression (n = 21) or intermediate patterns of response (n = 6). Lung biopsies acquired before initiation of ICB were analyzed by targeted mRNA expression profiling of 770 genes.

Acinar cells, neutrophils, and macrophages were isolated. The pancreas was analyzed by histology, immunochemistry staining, and TUNEL assays, and the expression of certain proteins and RNAs, cytokine levels, trypsin activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were determined. Srxn1 was inhibited by J14 or silenced by siRNA, and overexpression was introduced by a lentiviral vector. Transcriptomic analysis was used to explore the mechanism of Srxn1-mediated effects. We also evaluated the effect of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of Srxn1 by intraductal administration and the protection of AP. We found that Srxn1 expression was upregulated in mild AP but decreased in severe AP. Inhibition of Srxn1 increased ROS, histological score, the release of trypsin, and inflammatory responses in mice. Inhibition of Srxn1 expression promoted the production of ROS and induced apoptosis, while overexpression of Srxn1 led to the opposite results in acinar cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Srxn1 expression promoted the inflammatory response by accumulating and activating M1 phenotype macrophages and neutrophils in AP. Mechanistically, ROS-induced ER stress and activation of Cathepsin B, which converts trypsinogen to trypsin, were responsible for the Srxn1 inhibition-mediated effects on AP. Importantly, we demonstrated that AAV-mediated overexpression of Srxn1 attenuated AP in mice. Taken together, these results showed that Srxn1 is a protective target for AP by attenuating acinar injury and inflammation through the ROS/ER stress/Cathepsin B axis.","output":"Sulfiredoxin-1 attenuates injury and inflammation in acute pancreatitis through the ROS/ER stress/Cathepsin B axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The Shanghai Suburban Adult Cohort and Biobank (SSACB) was established to identify environmental, lifestyle and genetic risk factors for non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) in adults (20-74 years old) living in a suburban area of Shanghai with rapid urbanisation PARTICIPANTS: Two of eight suburban district were purposely selected according to participant willingness, health service facilities, population, geographic region and electronic medical record system From these suburban districts, four communities were selected based on economic level and population size At stage three, one-third of the committees/villages were randomly selected from each community All residents aged 20-74 years old were invited as study participants FINDINGS TO DATE: The baseline data on demographics, lifestyle and physical health-related factors were collected using a face-to-face questionnaire interview All participants completed physical examinations and had blood and urine tests Blood and urine samples from these tests were stored in a biobank From 6 April 2016 through 31 October 2017, we conducted face-to-face interviews and clinical examinations in 44 887 participants: 35 727 from Songjiang District and 9160 from Jiading District The average age of participants was 56 411 2 years in Songjiang and 56 610 5 years in Jiading The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia was 34 0%, 8 2% and 11 1%, respectively FUTURE PLANS: In-person surveys will be conducted every 5 years For annual tracking, baseline data was linked to the local health information system, which was composed of an electronic medical record system, a chronic disease management system, a cancer registry system, an infectious disease report system and a death registry system The data of the SSACB cohort is located in the School of Public Health, Fudan University International and domestic collaborative research projects are encouraged and inherent in the project","output":"Cohort profile: protocol and baseline survey for the Shanghai Suburban Adult Cohort and Biobank (SSACB) study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To examine the relationship between psychosocial strengths (resilience, self-efficacy beliefs and social support) and perceived severity of COVID-19 and also to gauge the mediating role of self-control among frontline health care professionals of Pakistan.

While in the waiting room, HSMs were offered to complete a questionnaire on their potential risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Results Of the 200 HSMs screened, 70 were positive. Ninety-nine HSMs (including 86 HCWs) completed the questionnaire of whom 28 cases positive. In the multivariable analysis among healthcare workers, age44 years-old (aOR=5.2, 95%CI [1.4-22.5]), not using a facemask systematically when caring for a patient (aOR=13.9, 95%CI [1.8-293.0]), were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Hospitals worldwide have decreased face-to-face visits to reduce the exposure to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Prenatal and postpartum care are essential for the health of women and their fetuses. Therefore, many hospitals have incorporated telehealth into their protocols. Objectives: The aim of this review was to determine how health care organizations are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic by incorporating telehealth visits into their protocols for obstetrics care, what services were converted to telehealth, and its benefits and barriers. Method: A computerized literature search was performed using PubMed and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases using terms, including \\"telehealth,\\" \\"virtual visits,\\" \\"obstetric,\\" \\"pregnancy,\\" \\"postpartum,\\" and \\"COVID-19\\" for articles published before October 2020. Peer reviewed articles and guidelines were included in this review. Results: A total of 25 articles were identified. Fifteen articles reported protocols. During this pandemic, protocols developed replaced some in-person visits with telehealth visits, when no testing or vaccinations are required. The main reported benefits were minimizing exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the continuity to provide high-quality and safe care. Lack of access to high-speed internet and hardware and inaccessibility to patients were the most reported barriers. Conclusion: Telehealth provided the opportunity for reducing in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some prenatal services could be completely provided through telehealth and others require medical equipment to be delivered.

Methods and results: We collected colostrum from healthy breast-feeding mothers who had delivered either term or preterm infants. We analyzed the lipid profiles of preterm, as well as term human milk using an LC-MS/MS metabolomics strategy. The orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis score plots revealed remarkable distinction of lipids in preterm and term human milk. In total, 16 subclasses of 235 differential lipids (variable importance in projection > 1, P < 0.05) were identified. Notably, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine were robustly increased in preterm human milk, while diacylglycerol and ceramide were markedly decreased in preterm human milk. Pathway analysis revealed that these dysregulated lipids are closely associated with glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, Reelin signaling in neurons, and LXR/RXR activation.

The objective of this study was to screen natural compounds as potential urease inhibitors by targeting UreG in a predominant ruminal microbial urease. In silico screening and in vitro tests for potential inhibitors were performed using molecular docking and an assay for the GTPase activity of UreG. Chelerythrine chloride was selected as a potential urease inhibitor of UreG with an inhibition concentration IC(50) value of 18.13 M. It exhibited mixed inhibition, with the K(i) value being 26.28 M. We further explored its inhibition mechanism using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and we found that chelerythrine chloride inhibited the binding of nickel to UreG and induced changes in the secondary structure, especially the -helix and -sheet of UreG.

Public health interventions require in-depth epidemiological evidence to determine which knee injuries are problematic in critical age and sex demographics. METHODS: Descriptive epidemiological analysis of longitudinal data on knee injuries (July 1998 C June 2018) from the National Hospital Morbidity Database in Australia were studied. The main outcomes where the population-related knee injury frequency, incidence per 100,000 and annual growth rate (%) over the 20-year observation period. Age-group and sex differences were also studied to determine demographic-specific trends. FINDINGS: 228,344 knee injuries were diagnosed over the 20-year analysis period. Significantly rising annual incidences were observed for total knee injuries, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries and knee contusions in males and females. Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries and knee dislocations were also rising in females, but not males. Greater annual growth rates were observed for females compared to males for total knee injuries, knee contusions, PCL injuries and knee dislocations. Demographic analysis revealed that the highest annual growth rate in injury incidence (10.4%) was observed for ACL injuries in females aged 5C14 years old. INTERPRETATION: Increasing annual incidence of knee injuries was observed over the 20-year period.

Background: The Clinical Investigations Center of Saint-Louis Hospital (CIC-1427) is a structure dedicated to clinical trials and mainly early phase trials (first-in-man administration, phase 1 and 2). These trials are conducted in a French Regional Health Agency (ARS) authorized structure. In March 2020, faced to the global COVID-19 pandemic and the French national lockdown measures, the CIC-1427 had to rapidly adapt its operating procedures to ensure the safety of both patients and staff. Study objective.- Ensuring optimal management of patients included in early phase clinical trials, while respecting the good clinical and professional practices (GCP/GPP) of the CICs protocol sponsors requirements, patients safety and clinical research multidisciplinary staff safety (nurses, caregivers' assistants (AS), clinical research assistants (CRA), clinical trial coordinators (CTC), project leaders, health executive and investigating physicians), in the context of the health crisis related to COVID-19. Methods and results: Due to their activity, requiring on-site presence, each staff member of the CIC-1427 clinical research team had to adapt their daily activity to the constraints of the health crisis. New specific procedures were quickly developed to deal with the pandemic. Most of the on-site medical visits were replaced by virtual consults with biological assessments in the local laboratories. \\"Remote monitoring\\" replaced on-site monitoring visits. Treatments were sent to each patient's home via couriers after agreement of the CPPs of each protocol (Committee for the Protection of Persons). The essential visits were maintained on site thanks to the unfailing involvement of our clinical care team, with implementation of a specific sanitary protocol. Conclusion: The involvement of our entire multidisciplinary research team ensured that each patient was able to benefit from a personalized follow-up and to continue the treatment on-trial. The newly introduced procedures also allowed collection of a maximum of safety and efficacy data for clinical trial sponsors while complying with good regulatory practices. This set of procedures developed during the first epidemic wave, fundamentally helped setting the frame for a better coping during the subsequent pandemic waves.","output":"Un exemple de rorganisation dans le fonctionnement dun Centre dinvestigations cliniques en priode de confinement national suite  la pandmie COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a World Health Organization designated pandemic that can result in severe symptoms and death that disproportionately affects older patients or those with comorbidities.

During 2017 and 2018, syndromic surveillance revealed that 37.2% of overdoses treated in EDs in 18 states involved multiple drugs (2). To describe changes in rates and proportions of suspected nonfatal drug and polydrug overdoses treated in EDs, CDC analyzed syndromic surveillance data from 2018 to 2019 in 29 states. Rates of overdoses involving opioids, cocaine, and amphetamines increased 9.7%, 11.0%, and 18.3%, respectively, and the rate of benzodiazepine-involved overdoses decreased 3.0%. Overdoses co-involving opioids and amphetamines increased from 2018 to 2019, overall, in both sexes, and in most age groups. In 2019, 23.6%, 17.1%, and 18.7% of overdoses involving cocaine, amphetamine, and benzodiazepines, respectively, also involved opioids. Expanding overdose prevention, treatment, and response efforts is needed to reduce the number of drug and polydrug overdoses. This includes linkage into treatment, harm reduction services, and community-based programs for persons who use drugs; expanding overdose prevention efforts, including increased naloxone provision, to persons who use stimulants; addressing the illicit drug supply; and identifying specific risk factors for populations using these drugs.

Exploting the potential of awareness to produce social distancing and self-isolation among susceptibles, we use it as an indirect control on the class of infective individuals and apply the Z-control approach to detect what trend must awareness display over time in order to eradicate the disease. To this aim, we generalize the Z-control procedure to appropriately treat an uncontrolled model with more than two governing equations. Analytical and numerical investigations on the resulting Z-controlled system show its capability in controlling some representative dynamics within both the backward and the forward scenarios. The awareness variable is qualitatively compared to Google Trends data on Covid-19 that are discussed in the perspective of the Z-control approach, inferring qualitative indications in view of the disease control.

In this paper we draw on the I3 Response Framework to understand and predict the willingness of New Zealanders to be vaccinated for Covid-19. The Framework differs from most studies predicting willingness to be vaccinated because it is based on the idea that the willingness to adopt a behaviour depends on both involvement (a measure of motivational strength) with the behaviour and attitudes towards the behaviour. We show that predictions of individuals willingness to be vaccinated are improved using involvement and attitudes together, compared to attitudes alone.

L-Arginine is the substrate used by nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) to generate NO and it has been shown to exert its beneficial effects on endothelium driving vasodilatation, reducing inflammation, and ameliorating physical function. We hypothesized that L-Arginine could enhance physical capacities in patients who underwent CR after AMI. We designed a study aimed to assess the effects of L-arginine administration on the physical capacity of patients who underwent coronary revascularization after AMI. The trial was carried out amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients were assigned, with a 2:1 ratio, to add to their standard therapy 1 bottle containing 1.66 g of L-arginine or 1 bottle of identical aspect apart from not containing L-arginine, twice a day orally for 3 weeks. Patients performed a 6-minute walking test (6MWT) and were assessed their Borg modified 0-10 rating of perceived exertion (BRPE) before starting and at the end of the treatment. Seventy-five patients receiving L-Arginine, and thirty-five receiving placebo successfully completed the study. The 6MWT distance increased significantly in the L-Arginine group compared to both baseline and placebo (p<0.0001). Additionally, we observed a significant improvement in the BRPE in patients treated with L-arginine but not in the placebo group. Taken together, our data indicate that L-arginine potentiates the response to CR, independently of age, sex, baseline functional capacity, and comorbid conditions. Significance Statement This study shows for the first time that oral supplementation of L-arginine potentiates the response to cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction and cardiac revascularization. Indeed, we observed a significant improvement in two fundamental parameters, namely, the 6-minute walking test and the Borg modified 0-10 rating of perceived exertion.

Pandemic-related negative states (\\"negative mood\\") and recovery experiences were investigated in a sample of 264 individuals who completed daily surveys four times per day over 7 consecutive days. MSEMs analyses revealed that negative mood persisted from moment-to-moment through the day, thus showing a response lag effect. Further analyses revealed that when someone experienced pandemic-related psychological detachment, relaxation, mastery, control, pleasure, or relatedness at specific periods of the day, mood had improved at the next measured time period, suggesting a protective effect. However, the pattern displayed by singles with dependents suggests that some recovery experiences at specific periods during the day seem to have a backfiring effect and worsen subsequent mood. These findings bring new insight into the role of recovery experiences during lockdowns and suggest that many could benefit from such experiences throughout the day when self-isolating. However, for individuals with multiple risk factors such as being single with dependents, some recovery experiences, at specific periods during the day, might not bring the desired outcome and future research is needed to examine if guilt or domestic burden may explain this finding.

Once we have all the pieces of the puzzle, we will be able to successfully treat this disease with its multiple challenges. COVID-19 has a high thrombogenic potential. In this study, we aimed to review published data about COVID-19 associated thrombosis from pathophysiology to treatment and the role in patient evolution. We searched for articles and studies published online through MEDLINE/PubMed database, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library, and Nature Public Health Emergency Collection. We found numerous articles regarding COVID-19 infection but selected only those focused on thrombosis. D-dimers have a predictive value in identifying thrombosis and a high level correlates with the severity of the infection and death. Most patients who were on chronic anticoagulant therapy before contracting the virus had a better prognosis. Heparin has other favorable effects such as a direct antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect in addition to its anticoagulant effect. COVID-19 infections are frequently complicated by thrombotic pathology. High plasma level of D-dimers is a predictive factor for severe prognosis, and the recommended anticoagulant, associated with low mortality, is heparin followed by a direct oral anticoagulant. Randomized studies in large groups of patients and therapeutic guidelines are still needed on this subject.","output":"Thrombosis, an important piece in the COVID-19 puzzle: From pathophysiology to therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Hip fractures among elderly patients are surgical emergencies. During COVID-19 pandemic time, many such patients could not be operated at early time because of the limitation of the medical resources, the risk of infection and redirection of medical attention to a severe infective health problem. METHODS: A search of electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) with keywords \\"COVID\\", \\"COVID-19\\", SARS-COV-2, Corona, \\"pandemic\\", \\"hip fracture\\", \\"trochanteric fracture\\" and \\"neck femur fracture\\" revealed 64 studies evaluating treatment of hip fracture in elderly patients during COVID-19 pandemic time. After screening, 7 studies were identified that described the mortality and morbidity in hip fractures in both COVID-19 infected (COVID-19 +) and non-infected (COVID-19 ?) patients. The 30-day mortality rate, inpatient mortality rate, critical care/special care need, readmission rate and complications rate in both groups were evaluated. Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan) V.5.3. RESULTS: There were significantly increased risks of 30-day mortality (32.23% COVID-19 + death vs. 8.85% COVID-19 ? death) and inpatient mortality (29.33% vs. 2.62%) among COVID-19 + patients with odds ratio (OR) of 4.84 (95% CI: 3.13-7.47, p < 0.00001) and 15.12 (95% CI: 6.12-37.37, p < 0.00001), respectively. The COVID-19 + patients needed more critical care admission (OR = 5.34, 95% CI: 3.41-8.38, p < 0.00001) and they remain admitted for a longer time in the hospital (MD = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.74-5.45, p = 0.0001); but there was no difference in readmission rate between these 2 groups. The risks of overall complications (OR = 17.22), development of pneumonia (OR = 21.02), and acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute respiratory failure (OR = 32.96) was significantly high among COVID-19 + patients compared to COVID-19 ? patients. CONCLUSIONS: There are increased risks of the 30-day mortality, inpatient mortality and critical care admission among hip fracture patients who are COVID-19 +. The chances of developing pneumonia and acute respiratory failure are more in these patients than in COVID-19 ? patients.","output":"Perioperative mortality and morbidity of hip fracture among COVID-19 infected and non-infected patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China has low seasonal influenza vaccination rates among children and older adults.

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY This study was conducted at the Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey from August 2019 to March 2020. METHODOLOGY Fifty-two women with unexplained infertility were included. Fifty-two cycles given 50 mg of CC but without follicle development were accepted as Group I. In the next cycle, 48 cycles given 100 mg of CC were accepted as Group II. During every cycle, serum hormone (FSH, LH, E2, P4, A4, DHEA?S, T, 17?OHP) levels were measured on days 2, 3, 4 or 5 of the cycle (basal day), and on the days when the leading follicle was triggered (trigger day). Endogenous hormone changes were compared in both the groups with and without follicle development as well as in those who could conceive and those who could not conceive. RESULTS Basal day FSH and DHEA?S values were found to be statistically significantly higher in women with follicle development than those without follicle development (p = 0.02 and p = 0.039, respectively). The trigger day FSH value was found to be significantly lower in women who conceived compared to the basal day value (p = 0.004). The relatively high P4 value (p = 0.008) on the basal day (contingent upon it was not exceeding the 0.5 ng/mL threshold) and the low FSH value (p = 0.015) on the trigger day were found to be statistically significantly different in women who had conceived compared to those who had not. CONCLUSION Basal serum FSH, P4 and DHEA?S levels can be used as predictors of ovulation in CC cycles in women with unexplained infertility by determining a threshold value with more comprehensive studies to be conducted in the future.

Therefore, several countries worldwide launched Bluetooth-based apps as supplementary tools. The aim of using contact tracing apps is to rapidly notify people about their possible exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and thus make the process of TITQ more efficient, especially upon exposure in public places. We evaluated the Norwegian Google Apple exposure notification (GAEN)-based contact tracing app Smittestopp v2 under relevant real-life test scenarios. We used a total of 40 devices, representing six different brands, and compared two different exposure configurations, experimented with different time thresholds and weights of the Bluetooth attenuation levels (buckets), and calculated the true notification rates among close contacts (2 m and 15 min) and false notification of sporadic contacts. In addition, we assessed the impact of using different operating systems and locations of the phone (hand/pocket). The best configuration tested to trigger exposure notification resulted in the correct notification of 80% of the true close contacts and incorrect notification of 34% of the sporadic contacts. Among those who incorrectly received notifications, most (67%) were within 2 m but the duration of contact was <15 min and thus they were not, per se, considered as close contacts. Lower sensitivity was observed when using the iOS operating systems or carrying the phone in the pocket instead of in the hand. The results of this study were used to improve and evaluate the performance of the Norwegian contact-tracing app Smittestopp.","output":"The First GAEN-Based COVID-19 Contact Tracing App in Norway Identifies 80% of Close Contacts in Real Life Scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lpidmie de COVID-19, sa mortalit, les incertitudes qui persistent sur son origine, son volution, la priode de confinement et ses suites entra?nent des situations d'inquitude voire d'angoisse jusqu'au traumatisme pour certains.

Previous research in the human-human context has shown that stereotypes and prejudice, i.e., negative attitudes, may impair productivity and job satisfaction in teams high in diversity (e.g., regarding age, gender, or ethnicity). Relatedly, in hybrid human-robot teams, robots likely represent an outgroup to their human co-workers. The latter may have stereotypes towards robots and may hold negative attitudes towards them. Both aspects might have detrimental effects on subjective and objective performance in human-robot interactions (HRI). In an experiment, we tested the effect of an economic and easy to apply diversity training intervention for use in the work context: The so-called enlightenment approach. This approach utilizes perspective-taking to reduce prejudice and discrimination in human-human contexts. We adapted this intervention to the HRI context and explored its impact on participants implicit and explicit robot-related attitudes. However, contrary to our predictions, taking the perspective of a robot resulted in more negative robot-related attitudes, whereas actively suppressing stereotypes about social robots and their characteristics produced positive effects on robot attitudes. Therefore, we recommend considering potential pre-existing aversions against taking the perspective of a robot when designing interventions to improve human-robot collaboration at the workplace. Instead, it might be useful to provide information about existing stereotypes and their consequences, thereby making people aware of their potential biases against social robots.","output":"Diversity Training With Robots: Perspective-Taking Backfires, While Sterotype-Suppression Decreases Negative Attitudes Towards Robots"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic with Europe and the USA at its epicenter. Little is known about risk factors for progression to severe disease in Europe. This study aims to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 patients in a Swiss university hospital. Methods This retrospective observational study included all adult patients hospitalized with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to March 25, 2020. We extracted data from electronic health records. The primary outcome was the need to mechanical ventilation at day 14. We used multivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for mechanical ventilation. Follow-up was of at least 14 days. Results 200 patients were included, of whom 37 (18.5%) needed mechanical ventilation at 14 days. The median time from symptoms onset to mechanical ventilation was 9.5 days (IQR 7.00, 12.75). Multivariable regression showed increased odds of mechanical ventilation in males (3.26, 1.21-9.8; p=0.025), in patients who presented with a qSOFA score [a?]2 (6.02, 2.09-18.82; p=0.001), with bilateral infiltrate (5.75, 1.91-21.06; p=0.004) or with a CRP of 40 mg/l or greater (4.73, 1.51-18.58; p=0.013). Conclusions This study gives some insight in the epidemiology and clinical course of patients admitted in a European tertiary hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male sex, high qSOFA score, CRP of 40 mg/l or greater and a bilateral radiological infiltrate could help clinicians identify patients at high risk for mechanical ventilation.","output":"Epidemiology, risk factors and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in a Swiss university hospital: an observational retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A discrete-time deterministic epidemic model is proposed to better understand the contagious dynamics and the behaviour observed in the incidence of real infectious diseases.

Depending on the parameters, the random-mixing model has different types of behaviour of an epidemic: pathogen extinction; endemic infection; sustained oscillations and dynamic extinction. Spatial effects are included in our network-based approach, where each individual of a population is represented by a node of a small-world network. Our network-based approach includes rewiring connections to account for time-varying network structure, a consequence of the natural response to the emergence of an epidemic (e.g. avoiding contacts with infected individuals). Random and adaptive rewiring conditions are analysed and numerical simulation are made. A comparison of model predictions with the actual effects of COVID-19 infection on population that occurred in Italy and France is produced.

METHODS In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 5734 patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes in a 1:1 ratio to receive finerenone or placebo. Eligible patients had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of 30 to less than 300, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25 to less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area, and diabetic retinopathy, or they had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300 to 5000 and an eGFR of 25 to less than 75 ml per minute per 1.73 m2. All the patients were treated with renin-angiotensin system blockade that had been adjusted before randomization to the maximum dose on the manufacturer's label that did not cause unacceptable side effects. The primary composite outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was kidney failure, a sustained decrease of at least 40% in the eGFR from baseline, or death from renal causes. The key secondary composite outcome, also assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure.

Persistent symptoms have been reported in patients with both mild and severe acute COVID-19, including those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Early reports on the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) indicate that fatigue, dyspnoea, cough, headache, loss of taste or smell, and cognitive or mental health impairments are among the most common symptoms. These complex, multifactorial impairments across the domains of physical, cognitive, and mental health require a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to management. Decades of research on the multifaceted needs of and models of care for patients with post-intensive care syndrome provide a framework for the development of PASC clinics to address the immediate needs of both hospitalised and non-hospitalised survivors of COVID-19. Such clinics could also provide a platform for rigorous research into the natural history of PASC and the potential benefits of therapeutic interventions.","output":"Addressing the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a multidisciplinary model of care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus infection results in viral pneumonia, which is often accompanied by the infiltration and recruitment of macrophages, overactivation of inflammatory responses, and obvious cell autophagy and exosome production. However, little is known about the roles of autophagy and exosome production in these inflammatory responses. METHODS: In this study, multiple methods, such as flow cytometry, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immuneCfluorescence technology, and western blot, were applied to explore the possible effects of autophagy and exosome production by H1N1-infected host cells. RESULTS: It was observed that a high number of polarized macrophages (CD11b(+)/F4/80(+)/CD86(+)) were recruited to the lung tissues of infected mice, which could be mimicked by tracking the movement of macrophages to H1N1-infected cells in vitro (transwell assays). Furthermore, there was some coordinated upregulation of M1 polarization signs (iNOS/Arg-1 bias) as well as autophagy (LC3) and exosome (CD63) biomarkers in the infected macrophages and epithelial cells. Moreover, exosomes extracted from the supernatant of virus-infected cells were shown to promote the recruitment and polarization of more peritoneal macrophages than the normal group. The fluorescence colocalization of LC3-CD63 and the inhibition of autophagy and exosome signaling pathway further revealed that H1N1 infection seemed to sequentially activate the M1 polarization and recruitment of macrophages via autophagyCexosome dependent pathway. CONCLUSION: Autophagy and exosome production coordinately enhance the M1 polarization and recruitment of macrophages in influenza virus infection, which also provides potential therapeutic targets.","output":"Autophagy and Exosome Coordinately Enhance Macrophage M1 Polarization and Recruitment in Influenza A Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic does not herald a new social era Rather, the mechanisms of dealing with the pandemic, as far as they can be identified at this point, bear testimony to the structural socio-economic and socio-political crisis that must be regarded as the signature of democratic capitalism Nor should the prevailing crisis management be misunderstood as a \\"politics of life\\" which (at least temporarily) suspends the capitalist logic of accumulation and of profit: as it is only certain lives that the governments of the democratic-capitalist industrialized countries are committed to saving and protecting This means that any adoption of the life-coaching semantics of \\"crisis as an opportunity\\" should be treated with caution However, for sociology itself the current circumstances could indeed offer an opportunity: that is, if it would finally stop denying that its own practice is inextricably enmeshed in (trans-)formative social processes and is never unideological, nor value-free, nor politically neutral","output":"[Sociology - Corona - CritiqueSociologie - coronavirus - critique]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has infected people among all countries and is a pandemic as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Given the authorized use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin (AZIT), and ivermectin (IVM), we aimed to evaluate their effectiveness alone or combined to reduce mortality among COVID-19 hospitalized patients without life-threatening illness. MethodsRetrospective cohort emulating a target trial, using nationwide data of mid- and high-level hospitals from the Peruvian Social Health Insurance 01/April/2020-19/July/2020. Patients 18 yo and above with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, and no life-threatening illness at admission were included. Five treatment groups (HCQ alone, IVM alone, AZIT alone, HCQ+AZIT, and IVM+AZIT within 48 hours of admission) were compared with standard of care alone. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality rate; secondary outcomes were all-cause death and/or ICU transfer, and all-cause death and/or oxygen prescription. Analyses were adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Propensity scores were estimated using machine learning boosting models. Weighted hazard ratios (wHR) were calculated using Cox regression. ResultsAmong 5683 patients, 200 received HCT, 203 IVM, 1600 AZIT, 692 HCQ+AZIT, 358 IVM+AZIT, and 2630 standard of care. HCQ+AZIT was associated with 84% higher all-cause death hazard compared to standard care (wHR=1.84, 95%CI 1.12-3.02). Consistently, HCQ+AZIT was also associated with higher death and/or ICU transfer (wHR=1.49, 95%CI 1.01-2.19), and death and/or oxygen prescription (wHR=1.70, 95%CI 1.07-2.69). HCQ only showed higher death and/or oxygen prescription hazard. No effect was found for AZIT or IVM+AZIT.

The secreted protein from the prototype SARS-CoV-2 virus had no major effect on viability of a variety of cell types, or on IFN or NF-{kappa}B signalling. However, it modulated cytokine expression from primary CSF1-derived human macrophages, most notably by decreasing IL-6 and IL-8 secretion. Furthermore, a sequence polymorphism L84S that appeared early in the pandemic associated with the Clade S lineage of virus, showed a markedly different effect, of increasing IL-6 production.

Here, we performed longitudinal flow cytometry analyses and RNA sequencing of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)-specific B cells isolated from study participants before and shortly after febrile malaria, with simultaneous analysis of influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-specific B cells as a comparator. At the healthy baseline before the malaria season, individuals had similar frequencies of Pf- and HA-specific atBCs that did not differ proportionally from atBCs within the total B cell population.

To date, there are no approved efficacious treatments targeting SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, with current tactics (e.g. modulating the host response & using repurposed medications) having mixed results. Thus, alongside vaccines, additional treatments to target viral infection are critical to fight the pandemic. SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 uses its spike protein to bind to ACE2 on host cells. Therefore, developing a target to bind spike could prevent viral infection. We previously published on the development and testing of recombinant rod domain of vimentin (rhRod) to bind to P\\\\selectin to block leukocyte adhesion to platelets and endothelium. Given that the SARS\\\\CoV spike protein (which shares 76% sequence identity to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 spike) binds to vimentin, we hypothesized that rhRod would bind to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 spike protein to block viral adhesion. We used biolayer interferometry (OctetRed(384)) to measure the K(D) of rhRod (0\\\\1000 nM) to immobilized SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 spike protein (S1S2ECD\\\\His). We found that rhRod had a strong affinity to the spike protein (180  23 nM; R(2) 0.9858; Fig. 1 A\\\\B). Heat inactivation (100C for 10 minutes) of rhRod (rhRod) did not bind to spike protein (indeterminate; R(2) 0; Fig. 1 C\\\\D). We then tested whether rhRod blocked ACE2 from binding to spike protein using 2 methods (Fig. 1 E\\\\F). Immobilized spike protein sensors were first placed in rhRod (0\\\\1000 nM) containing wells then placed into wells with 200 nM ACE2. The IC(50) of rhRod was 139  17 nM (R(2) 0.9959). A separate series of experiments were done using immobilized ACE2 sensors placed in wells containing 125 nM spike protein mixed with increasing concentrations of rhRod (0\\\\500 nM). As the concentration of rhRod increased, binding to ACE2 sensors decreased, with an IC(50) of 34  8 nM (R(2) 0.9845). Based on our findings, we used in silico modeling (SwarmDock) to asses the predicted interactions between rhRod and spike. We found that rhRod was predicted to bind to spike protein in the same region as ACE2, consistent with our empirical data that rhRod blocks spike\\\\ACE2 interactions. Finally, to test whether rhRod decreased SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 replication, we infected Vero E6 cells with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 (USA\\\\WA1/2020; MOI 0.1) in the presence of rhRod (0\\\\4,000 nM).

What is it that makes respiratory viruses such successful parasites of the human airway? What is the role of temperature sensitivity in respiratory zoonoses? A definition of temperature sensitivity is proposed, as the property of a virus to replicate poorly or not at all, at the normal body temperature of the host (restrictive temperature), but to replicate well at the lower temperatures found in the upper airway of the host (permissive temperature). Temperature sensitivity may influence the success of a respiratory virus in several ways. Firstly; by restricting the infection to the upper airways and reducing the chance of systemic infection that may reduce host mobility and increase mortality, and thus limit the spread of the virus.

Our AI prognosis system, trained using data from 3661 patients, achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.786 (95% CI: 0.745C0.830) when predicting deterioration within 96 hours. The deep neural network extracts informative areas of chest X-ray images to assist clinicians in interpreting the predictions and performs comparably to two radiologists in a reader study. In order to verify performance in a real clinical setting, we silently deployed a preliminary version of the deep neural network at New York University Langone Health during the first wave of the pandemic, which produced accurate predictions in real-time.

The existing literature is limited. Objective(s) To develop a robust, reliable and valid methodology to evaluate distribution and persistence of dental aerosol and splatter, including the evaluation of clinical procedures. Methods Fluorescein was introduced into the irrigation reservoirs of a high-speed air-turbine, ultrasonic scaler and 3-in-1 spray and procedures performed on a mannequin in triplicate. Filter papers were placed in the immediate environment. The impact of dental suction and assistant presence were also evaluated. Samples were analysed using photographic image analysis, and spectrofluorometric analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated and Pearsons correlation for comparison of analytic methods. Results All procedures were aerosol and splatter generating. Contamination was highest closest to the source, remaining high to 1-1.5 m. Contamination was detectable at the maximum distance measured (4 m) for high-speed air-turbine with maximum relative fluorescence units (RFU) being: 46,091 at 0.5 m, 3,541 at 1.0 m, and 1,695 at 4 m. There was uneven spatial distribution with highest levels of contamination opposite the operator. Very low levels of contamination (0.1% of original) were detected at 30 and 60 minutes post procedure. Suction reduced contamination by 67-75% at 0.5-1.5 m. Mannequin and operator were heavily contaminated. The two analytic methods showed good correlation (r=0.930, n=244, p<0.001).

With tattoos growing in popularity, also patients suffering from chronic dermatoses may more often be willing to get tattooed. Psoriasis is not considered as a strict contraindication for tattooing; however, it is not advised to get a tattoo while undergoing immunosuppressive treatment and during an active stage of the disease. We attempted to assess the knowledge level of tattooed psoriatic patients about the potential risks connected with tattooing, as well as to explore their attitudes and tendencies towards this procedure. Moreover, we analyzed the frequency and type of tattoo complications in this study group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An anonymous, online questionnaire was performed among online communities dedicated to psoriasis. Data from 150 tattooed psoriatic patients have been scrutinized. RESULTS: Eight percent of the surveyed psoriatic patients sought medical advice before getting a tattoo. While undergoing the tattooing procedure, 23 (15.3%) of the respondents received systemic psoriasis treatment: 8 (5.3%) being treated with methotrexate, 5 (3.3%) with cyclosporine A, one (0.7%) acitretin, and 9 (6%) patients were under biological treatment. Thirteen (8.7%) of the participants experienced complications associated with their tattoos, among which, the insurgence of the Koebner phenomenon on the tattoo, was the most frequent one (8 cases- 5.3%). Getting tattooed improved patients self-esteem in 76 (50.7%) of the cases.

To date, few data on immunologic features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. Methods In this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Tongji hospital were included from Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020. The immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases. Results Of the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million/L) than moderate cases (11000 million/L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U/L, 567.2 U/L, 135.2 mg/L and 1734.4 ug/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U/L, 234.4 U/L, 51.4 mg/L and 880.2 ug /L). IL-2R, TNF- and IL-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg/mL, 10.9 pg/mL and 10.9 pg/mL) than moderate cases (441.7 pg/mL, 7.5 pg/mL and 6.6 pg/mL). Absolute number of total T lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million/L) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million/L). The expressions of IFN- by CD4+T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%). Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+T cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN- production, which may be associated with disease severity. Together with clinical characteristics, early immunologic indicators including diminished T lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may serve as potential markers for prognosis in COVID-19.","output":"Clinical and immunologic features in severe and moderate forms of Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diarrhoea is a common problem in the neonatal and suckling foal.

Provision of PMDs is complex, with cognitive functioning expressed by clinicians as a major concern. Even if PMD use can be predicted by the level of cognitive functioning, outcome tools used to assess readiness do not consider how cognitive functioning may affect PMD use. OBJECTIVE The specific aims of this review are to identify existing assessments used to assess cognitive functioning and PMD use, classify cognitive functions that are identified within existing assessments related to PMD use, and explore the relationships between cognitive functioning (ie, executive functions and attention) and PMD use. METHODS A systematic review will be conducted using the electronic databases MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO (Ovid), and Web of Science based on the concepts of PMD performance and capacity, and cognitive functioning. To be included, studies must have: a sample of PMD users (inclusive of age and diagnoses), an assessment of cognitive functioning, and an assessment of PMD capacity or performance. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health will be used to classify cognitive functions. Study quality will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Qualitative and quantitative studies will be analyzed in a complementary manner depending on their designs; a result-based convergent synthesis design will be applied. RESULTS This proposed systematic review protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019118957). It was funded by the Quebec Rehabilitation Research Network and approved on February 2019.

We studied changes in foliage isoprene emission rate (I), foliage photosynthetic characteristics and antioxidant enzyme activities in two hybrid Populus clones, Nanlin 1388 (higher drought tolerance) and Nanlin 895 (higher thermotolerance), subject to a long-term (30 d) soil water stress (25% vs. 90% field capacity) combined with a natural heat spell (daytime temperature of 35-40 C). Unexpectedly, isoprene emission of both clones performed similarly and the overall effects of drought on isoprene emission characteristics were initially minor, but the treatment effects and clonal differences increased in time. In particular, I only slightly increased in control plants of Nanlin 895 after 15 d of treatment, and it decreased more than 5-fold in all treatment and clone combinations after 30 d. The reduction in I was associated with decreased isoprene precursor dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size in all cases in 30 d after the start of treatment. Net assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, PSII center openness and effective quantum yield decreased, while non-photochemical quenching and catalase activity increased in both control and water-stressed plants. Contrary to expectations, the data collectively indicated that isoprene emission responded more sensitively to sustained stress than foliage photosynthetic characteristics.

However, there is still a demand for alternative effective vaccines that rapidly confer long-term protection and rely upon cost-effective, easily scaled-up manufacturing. Here, we present a Sindbis alphavirus vector (SV), transiently expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SV.Spike), combined with the OX40 immunostimulatory antibody (&#945;OX40) as a novel, highly effective vaccine approach. We show that SV.Spike plus &#945;OX40 elicits long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and a vigorous T-cell response in mice. Protein binding, immunohistochemical, and cellular infection assays all show that vaccinated mice sera inhibits spike functions. Immunophenotyping, RNA Seq transcriptome profiles, and metabolic analysis indicate a reprogramming of T cells in vaccinated mice. Activated T cells were found to mobilize to lung tissue. Most importantly, SV.Spike plus &#945;OX40 provided robust immune protection against infection with authentic coronavirus in transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2-Tg). Finally, our immunization strategy induced strong effector memory response, potentiating protective immunity against re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our results show the potential of a new Sindbis virus-based vaccine platform to counteract waning immune response, which can be used as a new candidate to combat SARS-CoV-2. Given the T-cell responses elicited, our vaccine is likely to be effective against variants that are proving challenging, as well as serve as a platform to develop a broader spectrum pancoronavirus vaccine. Similarly, the vaccine approach is likely to be applicable to other pathogens.","output":"Combination of a Sindbis-SARS-CoV-2 Spike Vaccine and OX40 Antibody Elicits Protective Immunity Against SARS-CoV-2 Induced Disease and Potentiates Long-Term SARS-CoV-2-Specific Humoral and T-Cell Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While proteinCprotein interaction is the first step of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, recent comparative proteomic profiling enabled the identification of over 11,000 protein dynamics, thus providing a comprehensive reflection of the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular system in response to viral infection.

The mental health of readers and viewers can also be affected by the media after tragic events. Potentially, the media have a proactive role in shaping the actions of the mass population and thereby influencing policy actions. The print media especially are considered a key avenue for taking information to the masses. However, in this information and communications technology (ICT) era, people are increasingly reluctant to carry hard-copy newspapers, instead preferring e-newspapers. At the present time, entire newspapers, and especially their opinion sections, are deluged by concerns about the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. After China and Japan first encountered COVID-19, other Asian countries began their COVID-19 fight at different times between January and March 2020. All affected countries sought to manage the pandemic in their own way, following lessons learned from China and Japan. Every form of media in affected countries highlighted concerns by presenting news, perceptions, and opinions related to the pandemic. With opinion sections and editorials, the key sections of e-newspapers to reflect experts' perceptions and thoughts, this study aims to examine experts' views in the e-newspapers of five different countries in Asia, in relation to China and Japan. Considering the diversity of socioeconomic and geopolitical settings, five countries-South Korea, Singapore, Iran, India, and Bangladesh-are selected, each represented by one leading English-language e-newspaper. This study explores how experts' perceptions in the studied countries present different aspects of life. It also examines which e-newspaper emphasized which aspect of life and in which period of the outbreak. By intensive text mining in each selected e-newspaper, the study found that experts' opinions addressed diverse issues with regard to COVID-19. These issues are grouped under the following eight categories: health and drugs, preparedness and awareness, social welfare and humanity, the economy, governance and institutions, politics, the environment and wildlife, and innovation and technology. This pioneering study of five different e-newspapers in Asian countries from January to March 2020 presents a similar picture of experts' concerns and their roles in shaping responses to health crises;thus, it plays a role in contributing to policy actions.","output":"Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic: The Role of Printing Media in Asian Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global system. It has especially increased uncertainty in overseas investment and foreign trade activity of enterprises. The pandemic continues to cause economic, political and legal risks (especially compliance risk and default risk) faced by enterprises entering foreign markets and carrying out investment activities. Therefore, enterprises need to enhance their legal awareness, strengthen compliance management of overseas investment by enterprises and create a risk management system, and carry out investment activities on the premise that they comply with international rules, the legal norms of the host country and the relevant domestic laws and regulations. On this basis, governments should strengthen the rule of law concerning foreign affairs, improve related government regulations for overseas investments.

Although CD8+ T cells play important role in this response, there is still a lack of studies showing the gene expression profiles in those cells at the beginning of the disease as potential predictors of more severe forms after the first week. We investigated a proportion of different subpopulations of CD8+ T cells and their gene expression patterns for cytotoxic proteins (perforin-1 (PRF1), granulysin (GNLY), granzyme B (GZMB), granzyme A (GZMA), granzyme K (GZMK)), cytokine interferon- (IFN-), and apoptotic protein Fas ligand (FASL) in CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood in first weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sixteen COVID-19 patients and nine healthy controls were included. The absolute counts of total lymphocytes (p = 0.007), CD3+ (p = 0.05), and CD8+ T cells (p = 0.01) in COVID-19 patients were significantly decreased compared to healthy controls. In COVID-19 patients in CD8+ T cell compartment, we observed lower frequency effector memory 1 (EM1) (p = 0.06) and effector memory 4 (EM4) (p < 0.001) CD8+ T cells. Higher mRNA expression of PRF1 (p = 0.05) and lower mRNA expression of FASL (p = 0.05) at the fifth day of the disease were found in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. mRNA expression of PRF1 (p < 0.001) and IFN- (p < 0.001) was significantly downregulated in the first week of disease in COVID-19 patients who progressed to moderate and severe forms after the first week, compared to patients with mild symptoms during the entire disease course.

Healthcare professionals are an important risk group given their exposure. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of symptoms, main concerns as patients, preventive behaviours of healthcare professionals, and the different temporal outcomes associated with the negativization of PCR results. A total of 238 professionals were analysed and follow-up was conducted from 11 March to 21 April 2020 through clinical records, in-depth surveys, and telephone interviews. Symptoms, concerns, and preventive measures were documented, and temporal outcomes (start and end of symptoms, first positive PCR, and negativization of PCR) were analysed through survival analyses. A high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms (especially in women and older professionals), fever, cough, and fatigue were reported. The main concern was contagion in the work and home environment. Professionals (especially men) reported low use of face masks before the pandemic. Our analysis indicates that the median times for the negativization of PCR testing to confirm the resolution of infection is 15 days after the end of symptoms, or 25 days after the first positive PCR test. Our results suggest that these times are longer for women and for professionals aged &#8805;55 years, therefore follow-up strategies should be optimized in light of both variables. This is the first study we are aware of to report factors associated with the time to negativization of PCR results. We present the first rigorous estimates of time outcomes and hope that these data can be valuable to continue feeding the prediction models that are currently being developed.

Unfortunately, many hermatypic corals in aquaria are not identified to species level, which hinders assessment of their conservation significance. Traditional methods of species identification using morphology can be challenging, especially to non-taxonomists. DNA barcoding is an option for species identification of Scleractinian corals, especially when used in concert with morphology-based assessment. This study uses DNA barcodes to try to identify aquarium specimens of the diverse reef-forming genus Acropora from 127 samples. We identified to our best current knowledge, to species name 44% of the analysed samples and provided provisional identification for 80% of them (101/127, in the form of a list of species names with associate confidence values). We highlighted a sampling bias in public nucleotide sequences repertories (e.g.: GenBank) towards more charismatic and more studied species, even inside a well-studied genus like Acropora. In addition, we showed a potential single observer effect with over a quarter of the reference sequences used for these identifications coming from the same study. We propose the use of barcoding and query matching as an additional tool for taxonomic experts and general aquarists, as an additional tool to increase their chances of making high confidence species-level identifications. We produce a standardised and easily repeatable methodology to increase the capacity of aquariums and other facilities to assess non-ascribed species, emphasising the value of integrating this approach with morphological identification optimising usage of authoritative identification guides and expert opinion.","output":"Whats left in the tank?

A heat procedure has been suggested for specimen inactivation. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of serum heating on biochemical indexes, and providing a basis for accurate detection results of the COVID-19 patients. METHODS We collected 29 normal cases of two tubes of 5 mL whole blood. One tube was analyzed directly, and the other was analyzed after heating at 56C 30 minutes. RESULTS A total of 34 serum biochemical index quantitative results were obtained, 28/34 indexes were not significantly affected by the heat inactivation and remained clinically interpretable. As the thermal inactivation for these indexes showed good correlation, ALB (p = 0.04, Pearson R = 0.91, 2.6% mean increase), CysC (p = 0.03, Pearson R = 0.98, 9.9% mean increase), CO2CP (p < 0.001, Pearson R = 0.96, 13% mean decrease), they were still inter-pretable. Four biochemical indexes ALP, CK, CK-MB, and insulin were inactivated and showed significant statistical differences (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Our study showed CK, CK-MB, ALP, and insulin were sensitive to heat and will be inhibited or degrade after heating, indicating that the rapid decrease of this indexes in the COVID-19 patients may be caused by sample heat inactivation.

Our aim was to compare the currently available methods to calculate MP during volume- and pressure-controlled ventilation, comparing different equations with the geometric reference method, to understand whether the easier to use surrogate formulas were suitable for the everyday clinical practice. This would warrant a more widespread use of mechanical power to promote lung protection. METHODS: Forty respiratory failure patients, sedated and paralyzed for clinical reasons, were ventilated in volume-controlled ventilation, at two inspiratory flows (30 and 60 L/min), and pressure-controlled ventilation with a similar tidal volume. Mechanical power was computed both with the geometric method, as the area between the inspiratory limb of the airway pressure and the volume, and with two algebraic methods, a comprehensive and a surrogate formula. RESULTS: The bias between the MP computed by the geometric method and by the comprehensive algebraic method during volume-controlled ventilation was respectively 0.053 (0.77, ? 0.81) J/min and ? 0.4 (0.70, ? 1.50) J/min at low and high flows (r(2) = 0.96 and 0.97, p < 0.01). The MP measured and computed by the two methods were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.95 and 0.94, p < 0.01) with a bias of ? 0.0074 (0.91, ? 0.93) and ? 1.0 (0.45, ? 2.52) J/min at high-low flows. During pressure-controlled ventilation, the bias between the MP measured and the one calculated with the comprehensive and simplified methods was correlated (r(2) = 0.81, 0.94, p < 0.01) with mean differences of ? 0.001 (2.05, ? 2.05) and ? 0.81 (2.11, ? 0.48) J/min. CONCLUSIONS: Both for volume-controlled and pressure-controlled ventilation, the surrogate formulas approximate the reference method well enough to warrant their use in the everyday clinical practice. Given that these formulas require nothing more than the variables already displayed by the intensive care ventilator, a more widespread use of mechanical power should be encouraged to promote lung protection against ventilator-induced lung injury.","output":"Bedside calculation of mechanical power during volume- and pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the recent approval of vaccines against COVID-19, efficacy concerns emerged for MS patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs.

Conversely, thrombospondin-1 decreases the rate of VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13 by competing with ADAMTS13 for the A3 domain of VWF. To investigate whether murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human VWF affect the susceptibility of VWF to proteolysis by ADAMTS13 in vitro, eight mAbs to different domains of human VWF were used to evaluate the effects on VWF cleavage by ADAMTS13 under fluid shear stress and static/denaturing conditions.

We sought to examine ICU census trends in relation to ICU bed capacity during the rapid increase in severe coronavirus disease 2019 cases early during the pandemic. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: Thirteen geographically dispersed academic medical centers in the United States. Patients/Subjects: We obtained daily ICU censuses from March 26 to June 30, 2020, as well as prepandemic ICU bed capacities. The primary outcome was daily census of ICU patients stratified by coronavirus disease 2019 and mechanical ventilation status in relation to ICU capacity. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Prepandemic overall ICU capacity ranged from 62 to 225 beds (median 109). During the study period, the median daily coronavirus disease 2019 ICU census per hospital ranged from 1 to 84 patients, and the daily ICU census exceeded overall ICU capacity for at least 1 day at five institutions. The number of critically ill patients exceeded ICU capacity for a median (interquartile range) of 17 (12-50) of 97 days at these five sites. All 13 institutions experienced decreases in their noncoronavirus disease ICU population, whereas local coronavirus disease 2019 cases increased. Coronavirus disease 2019 patients reached their greatest proportion of ICU capacity on April 12, 2020, when they accounted for 44% of ICU patients across all participating hospitals.

While previous studies show infants discriminate different auditory meters, it remains unknown whether they can maintain (imagine) a metrical interpretation of an ambiguous rhythm through top-down processes. We investigated this via electroencephalographic mismatch responses. We primed 6-month-old infants (N = 24) to hear a 6-beat ambiguous rhythm either in duple meter (n = 13), or in triple meter (n = 11) through loudness accents either on every second or every third beat. Periods of priming were inserted before sequences of the ambiguous unaccented rhythm. To elicit mismatch responses, occasional pitch deviants occurred on either beat 4 (strong beat in triple meter; weak in duple) or beat 5 (strong in duple; weak in triple) of the unaccented trials. At frontal left sites, we found a significant interaction between beat and priming group in the predicted direction. Post-hoc analyses showed mismatch response amplitudes were significantly larger for beat 5 in the duple- than triple-primed group (p = .047) and were non-significantly larger for beat 4 in the triple- than duple-primed group. Further, amplitudes were generally larger in infants with musically experienced parents. At frontal right sites, mismatch responses were generally larger for those in the duple compared to triple group, which may reflect a processing advantage for duple meter. These results indicate infants can impose a top-down, internally generated meter on ambiguous auditory rhythms, an ability that would aid early language and music learning.","output":"Evidence for Top-down Meter Perception in Infancy as Shown by Primed Neural Responses to an Ambiguous Rhythm."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence rate of Cigar, Little Cigar, and Cigarillo (CLCC) use among youth rose above the rate of cigarettes for the first time in 2019, and Black and Hispanic youth remain disproportionately more susceptible and likely to use these products compared to White youth.

However, in Africa there has been a poor uptake of COVID-19 vaccines with only 15% vaccine coverage compared to the WHO global target of 70%. One of the important drivers has been vaccine hesitancy, understanding late adopters of vaccination can provide insights into the attitudes, motivations and influences that can enhance vaccine uptake. MethodsBetween January 4 - February 11, 2022, we conducted a survey among adults presenting for their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine almost 12-months after the vaccination program began. Vaccines were free and provided at clinics and outreach centers in Harare, Zimbabwe. The questionnaire assessed environmental and individual factors (attitudes, barriers, motivations, key influencers, and information sources) that influenced the decision to present for vaccination. Baseline socio-demographic data and responses to survey questions were summarized using descriptive statistics. Binary logistic regression models were developed to understand factors associated with vaccine confidence. Results1016 adults were enrolled into the study, 508 (50%) were female, 126 (12.4%) had HIV co-infection. The median age was 30 years (IQR 22 - 39). Women were more likely to have negative views about the COVID-19 vaccine compared to men (OR 1.51 (95%CI 1.16, 1.97, p=0.002). Women compared to men and older adults ([] 40 years) compared with youth (18-25 years) were more likely to have major concerns about vaccines. Most concerns were about safety with 602 (59.3%) concerned about immediate and 520 (51.2%) about long-term health effects of vaccines. People living with HIV (PLWH) were more likely to perceive vaccines as safe (OR 1.71 (95%CI: 1.07, 2.74, p=0.025), effective (1.68 (95%CI: 1.07, 2.64, p=0.026) and to trust regulatory systems for approving vaccines (OR 1.79 (95% CI: 1.11, 2.89, p=0.017) compared to those without HIV. Internet users were less likely to perceive vaccines as safe (OR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.95, p=0.021), effective (OR 0.61 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.80, p<0.001) or trust regulatory processes for approving vaccines (OR 0.64 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.85, p=0.002) compared to non-internet users. Social influence was a key factor in the decision to be vaccinated with family members being the primary key influencers for 560 (55.2%) participants. The most important reason for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine today for 715 (70.4%) participants was the protection of individual health. The most trusted source of information regarding the vaccine was the Ministry of Health (79.7%) and the radio, television and social media were the preferred sources for obtaining this information. Social media was a more likely source for youth and those with higher levels of education. ConclusionImproving vaccine coverage will need targeted communication strategies that address negative perceptions of vaccines and associated safety and effectiveness concerns. Leveraging normative behavior as a social motivator for vaccination will be important as close social networks are key influences of vaccination. Traditional media remains important for health communication in Africa and should be strengthened to counter social media-based misinformation that drives concerns about safety and effectiveness particularly among internet users.","output":"Investigating Attitudes, Motivations and Key Influencers for vaccine uptake among late adopters of COVID-19 vaccination in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article introduces a themed issue focused on COVID-19 as it relates to community health.

This causes public panic and misperceptions about COVID-19. Under circumstances like this, risk communication is needed to control and mitigate information about this plague to reduce the spread of this disease and manage public fear. The main objective of this study is to assess COVID-19 information searching behaviour and explore how risk communication is associated with personal hygiene habits in preventing transmission of COVID-19 in dangerous zones. This study was conducted among a community of educators in Jakarta, Bogor, and Tangerang, Indonesia. Questionnaires were distributed to 132 respondents, consisting of lecturers and teachers who are living in the red zone area. The results showed that there was no relationship between the perception of risk communication, both on personal hygiene habits and prevention of COVID-19 transmission. This can be attributed to two possibilities. Firstly, the risk communication message strategy is seen as irrelevant to peoples personal hygiene habits and prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Secondly, personal hygiene habits and prevention of COVID-19 transmission are not influenced by risk communication from the government and at media level. ? 2021, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

This situation has forced both teachers and students into an atypical, very specific situation, in which they need to cope with a number of psychological factors. Meanwhile, there is a research gap in academic knowledge of the social and psychological factors that determine attitudes toward forced remote learning. Objective: To analyze the psychological traits of students in relation to their attitudes toward forced remote learning. Methods: The study assessed self-regulation and communication skills, as well thinking and learning styles of 280 students in the situation of forced remote learning. We used the methods of surveying and psychological testing for data collection. The data were analyzed in R statistical software using the regression modeling methods. Results: We found that the number of students with positive (46%) and negative (54%) attitudes toward forced remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic was approximately equal. Using regression analysis, we identified several statistically significant associations between the interpersonal communicative skills of students (self-regulation, shyness, alienation, manipulative and cooperative communication styles) and their thinking styles (right-hemispheric and integrated), on the one hand, and their attitude to remote learning, on the other. It was also illustrated that depending on the attitude to the forced remote learning, students differ by the percentage of assimilated learning materials while studying under the lockdown. Conclusion: The results identify that success of remote learning in many ways depends on the extent to which it accommodates psychological traits of students who are forced to acquire new knowledge without traditional classroom instruction. ?

However, whilst chickens may be acutely susceptible, ducks appear to be asymptomatic to H5N1. The mechanisms of disease pathogenesis are not well understood and the variation between different species requires investigation to help explain these species differences. Here we investigated the expression of several key proinflammatory cytokines of chickens and ducks following infection with 2 highly pathogenic H5N1 (A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/453/2004 (Vt453) and A/Duck/Indramayu/BBVW/109/2006 (Ind109)) and a low-pathogenic H5N3 influenza virus (A/Duck/Victoria/1462/2008 (Vc1462)). H5N1 viruses caused fatal infections in chickens as well as high viral loads and increased production of proinflammatory molecules when compared to ducks. Cytokines, including Interleukin 6 (IL6) and the acute phase protein Serum Amyloid A (SAA), were rapidly induced at 24 h post infection with H5N1. In contrast, low induction of these cytokines appeared in ducks and only at later times during the infection period. These observations support that hypercytokinemia may contribute to pathogenesis in chickens, whilst the lower cytokine response in ducks may be a factor in their apparent resistance to disease and decreased mortality.","output":"H5N1 infection causes rapid mortality and high cytokine levels in chickens compared to ducks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that is the causative agent of COVID-19, a sometimes-lethal respiratory infection responsible for a world-wide pandemic. The envelope (E) protein, one of four structural proteins encoded in the viral genome, is a 75-residue integral membrane protein whose transmembrane domain exhibits ion channel activity and whose cytoplasmic domain participates in protein-protein interactions. These activities contribute to several aspects of the viral replication-cycle, including virion assembly, budding, release, and pathogenesis. Here, we describe the structure and dynamics of full-length SARS-CoV-2 E protein in hexadecylphosphocholine micelles by NMR spectroscopy. We also characterized its interactions with four putative ion channel inhibitors. The chemical shift index and dipolar wave plots establish that E protein consists of a long transmembrane helix (residues 8C43) and a short cytoplasmic helix (residues 53C60) connected by a complex linker that exhibits some internal mobility. The conformations of the N-terminal transmembrane domain and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain are unaffected by truncation from the intact protein. The chemical shift perturbations of E protein spectra induced by the addition of the inhibitors demonstrate that the N-terminal region (residues 6C18) is the principal binding site. The binding affinity of the inhibitors to E protein in micelles correlates with their antiviral potency in Vero E6 cells: HMA  EIPA > DMA >> Amiloride, suggesting that bulky hydrophobic groups in the 5 position of the amiloride pyrazine ring play essential roles in binding to E protein and in antiviral activity. An N15A mutation increased the production of virus-like particles, induced significant chemical shift changes from residues in the inhibitor binding site, and abolished HMA binding, suggesting that Asn15 plays a key role in maintaining the protein conformation near the binding site. These studies provide the foundation for complete structure determination of E protein and for structure-based drug discovery targeting this protein.","output":"Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein with amilorides correlate with antiviral activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: There has been an enormous increase in the use of gadgets for online classes and entertainment during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Evidence on the isolation experience, facilitating and complicating factors is needed to mitigate negative effects. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This observational, population-based cohort study enrolled 1547 adults from the general population with SARS-CoV-2 infection reported to authorities between 27 February 2020 and 19 January 2021 in Zurich, Switzerland. We assessed the proportion of individuals reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety before, during and after isolation (by DASS-21), and queried worries, positive experiences, and difficulties. We analyzed the association of these outcomes with socio-demographics using ordinal regression. Additionally, we report free-text statements by participants to capture most important aspects of isolation. The proportion of participants affected by depression or anxiety increased during isolation from 100% to 171% and 91% to 176%, respectively. Ordinal regression showed that taking care of children increased the difficulty of isolation (OR 210, CI 143C308) and risk of non-compliance (OR 163, CI 105C253), especially in younger participants.

A BPR model is used to relate average travel times to the estimated number of commuters traveling by car. We then evaluate increased vehicle volumes on the road if different portions of transit and car pool users switch to single-occupancy vehicles, and report the resulting travel time from the BPR model. The scenarios predict that cities with large transit ridership are at risk for extreme traffic unless transit systems can resume safe, high throughput operations quickly.","output":"Impacts of Covid-19 mode shift on road traffic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While effective preventive measures against COVID-19 are now widely known, many individuals fail to adopt them.

METHODS: We performed a multiplex immune assay analysis and compared the plasma biomarkers of Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS), acute COVID-19 infection (COVID-19), SARS-CoV-2 seropositive and control children admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital in Chennai, India. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors were correlated with SARS-CoV-2 clinical phenotypes. FINDINGS: PIMS-TS children had significantly elevated levels of cytokines, IFN?3, IL-2, TNF&#945;, IL-1&#945;, IFN&#945;, IFN?, IL-6, IL-15, IL-17A, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-33 and IL-Ra; elevated chemokines, CCL2, CCL19, CCL20 and CXCL10 and elevated VEGF, Granzyme B and PDL-1 in comparison to COVID-19, seropositive and controls. COVID-19 children had elevated levels of IFN?3, IL-2, TNF&#945;, IL-1&#945;, IFN&#945;, IFN?, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-10, CCL2, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL10 and VEGF in comparison to seropositive and/or controls.

Everyday face masks can only partially block aerosols, and their effectiveness also depend on how well the person is wearing it. They are recommended for classroom situations during high pandemic activity. However, unprotected communication with and among children is fundamental from the pedagogical and psychological point of view for normal psychosocial development and teaching. Partition walls around the persons can theoretically provide substantial standardized mechanical protection against the spread of droplets and aerosols, either as additional protection to face masks or as an alternative. Methods: In the present research, the protection effectiveness of partition walls was investigated. With mannequin heads, fog generators, line lasers and a classroom-like setup with protective walls, flow visualization and aerosol concentration measurements were performed. Additionally, an active fan-suction system was tested to remove the channelled aerosols on top of the partition walls before they reach other persons in the room. Results: It was found that partition walls protect neighbours from bio-aerosol contact regardless of whether they wear masks or not. The combination with standardized room ventilation enforces this effect. Moreover, the experiments performed here clearly showed that partition walls may protect neighbours from bio-aerosols better than suboptimally fitting everyday face masks only. Conclusion: Partition walls are the most effective protection against infectious bio-aerosols in classroom settings and should be combined with standardized ventilation as the preferred method for classrooms during the current COVID 19 pandemic.","output":"Partition walls as effective protection from bio-aerosols in classrooms C an experimental investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapidly changing health care climate related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in numerous changes to health care systems and in practices that protect both the public and the workers who serve in hospitals around the country.

To tackle these issues, we propose a Graph-based Pyramid Global Context Reasoning (Graph-PGCR) module, which is capable of modeling long-range dependencies among disjoint infections as well as adapt size variation. We first incorporate graph convolution to exploit long-term contextual information from multiple lobe zones. Different from previous average pooling or maximum object probability, we propose a saliency-aware projection mechanism to pick up infection-related pixels as a set of graph nodes. After graph reasoning, the relation-aware features are reversed back to the original coordinate space for the down-stream tasks. We further construct multiple graphs with different sampling rates to handle the size variation problem. To this end, distinct multi-scale long-range contextual patterns can be captured. Our Graph-PGCR module is plug-and-play, which can be integrated into any architecture to improve its performance.

HCV screening and treatment of pregnant HCV carriers could reduce the burden of disease and limit vertical transmission from mother to child. We assessed the impact of HCV screening and subsequent treatment with new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) among pregnant women in the Netherlands. METHODS: An HCV natural history Markov transition state model was developed, to evaluate the public-health and economic impact of HCV screening and treatment. Besides all 179,000 pregnant women in the Netherlands (cohort 1), we modelled 3 further cohorts: all 79,000 first-time pregnant women (cohort 2), 33,000 pregnant migrant women (cohort 3) and 16,000 first-time pregnant migrant women (cohort 4). Each cohort was analyzed in various scenarios: i no intervention, i.e., the current practice, ii screen-and-treat, i.e., the most extensive approach involving treatment of all individuals found HCV-positive, and iii screen-and-treat/monitor, i.e., a strategy involving treatment of symptomatic (F1CF4) patients and follow-up of asymptomatic (F0) HCV carriers with subsequent treatment only at progression. RESULTS: For all cohorts, comparison between scenarios (ii) and (i) resulted in ICERs between 9,306 and 10,173 per QALY gained and 5 year budget impacts varying between 6,283,830 and 19,220,405. For all cohorts, comparison between scenarios (iii) and (i) resulted in ICERs between 1,739 and 2,749 per QALY gained and budget impacts varying between 1,468,670 and 5,607,556. For all cohorts, the ICERs (scenario iii versus ii) involved in delayed treatment of asymptomatic (F0) HCV carriers varied between 56,607 and 56,892, well above the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 20,000 per QALY gained and even above a threshold of 50,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Universal screening for HCV among all pregnant women in the Netherlands is cost-effective.

METHODS: Demographic and clinical data regarding infected cases among HCWs of Fars, Iran with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were obtained from 10th March to 17th May 2020. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated a rate of 5.62% (273 out of 4854 cases) infection among HCW, with a mean age of 35 years and a dominance of female cases (146 cases: 53.5%). The majority of infected cases were among nurses (51.3%), while the most case infection rate (CIR) was among physicians (27 positive cases out of 842 performed test (3.2%)). Also, the highest rate of infection was in the emergency rooms (30.6%). Also, 35.5% of the patients were asymptomatic and the most frequent clinical features among symptomatic patients were myalgia (46%) and cough (45.5%). Although 5.5% were admitted to hospitals, there were no reports of ICU admission. Furthermore, 10.3% of the cases reported transmitting the infection to family and friends.

We study three specific COVID-19 epidemic control models: the susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model with vaccination control; the SEIR model with shield immunity control; and the susceptible, un-quarantined infected, quarantined infected, confirmed infected (SUQC) model with quarantine control. We express the control requirement in metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas (a type of formal specification languages) which can specify the expected control outcomes such as the deaths from the infection should never exceed one thousand per day within the next three months or the population immune from the disease should eventually exceed 200 thousand within the next 100 to 120 days. We then develop methods for synthesizing control strategies with MTL specifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to systematically synthesize control strategies based on the COVID-19 epidemic models with formal specifications. We provide simulation results in three different case studies: vaccination control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; shield immunity control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; and quarantine control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Wuhan, China. The results show that the proposed synthesis approach can generate control inputs such that the time-varying numbers of individuals in each category (e.g., infectious, immune) satisfy the MTL specifications.

VA scores varied considerably, despite high correlations between VA scores based on the different sets of covariates (.66 < r < 1.00). The explained variance and consistency of school VA scores substantially improved when including prior math and prior language achievement in VA models for math and prior language achievement with sociodemographic and sociocultural background characteristics in VA models for language. These findings suggest that prior achievement in the same subject, the most commonly used covariate to date, may be insufficient to control for between-school differences in student intake when estimating school VA scores. We thus recommend using VA models with caution and applying VA scores for informative purposes rather than as a mean to base accountability decisions upon.

The aim of the study was to identify metabolic biomarkers for multisite musculoskeletal pain (MSMP) by metabolomics with an extreme phenotype sampling strategy. The study participants (n = 610) were derived from the Newfoundland Osteoarthritis Study. Musculoskeletal pain was assessed using a self-reported pain questionnaire where painful sites were circled on a manikin by participants and the total number of painful sites were calculated. Targeted metabolomic profiling on fasting plasma samples was performed using the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit. Plasma cytokine concentrations including tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-6, interleukin-1, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data on blood cholesterol profiles were retrieved from participants' medical records. Demographic, anthropological, and clinical information was self-reported. The number of reported painful sites ranged between 0 and 21. Two hundred and five participants were included in the analysis comprising 83 who had 7 painful sites and 122 who had 1 painful site. Women and younger people were more likely to have MSMP (P  0.02). Multisite musculoskeletal pain was associated with a higher risk of having incontinence, worse functional status and longer period of pain, and higher levels of low-density lipoprotein and nonChigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all P  0.03). Among the 186 metabolites measured, 2 lysophosphatidylcholines, 1 with 26 carbons with no double bond and 1 with 28 carbons with 1 double bond, were significantly and positively associated with MSMP after adjusting for multiple testing with the Bonferroni method (P  0.0001) and could be considered as novel metabolic markers for MSMP.","output":"Metabolomic analysis coupled with extreme phenotype sampling identified that lysophosphatidylcholines are associated with multisite musculoskeletal pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intracellular organelles enwrapped in membranes along with a complex network of vesicles trafficking in, out and inside the cellular environment are one of the main features of eukaryotic cells. Given their central role in cell life, compartmentalization and mechanisms allowing their maintenance despite continuous crosstalk among different organelles have been deeply investigated over the past years. Here, we review the multiple functions exerted by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery in driving membrane remodeling and fission, as well as in repairing physiological and pathological membrane damages. In this way, ESCRT machinery enables different fundamental cellular processes, such as cell cytokinesis, biogenesis of organelles and vesicles, maintenance of nuclear-cytoplasmic compartmentalization, endolysosomal activity. Furthermore, we discuss some examples of how viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, have evolved to hijack the ESCRT machinery or part of it to execute/optimize their replication cycle/infection. A special emphasis is given to the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) interaction with the ESCRT proteins, considering the peculiarities of this interplay and the need for HSV-1 to cross both the nuclear-cytoplasmic and the cytoplasmic-extracellular environment compartmentalization to egress from infected cells.","output":"Why Cells and Viruses Cannot Survive without an ESCRT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats maintain and transmit many viruses (Filoviruses, Rubulaviruses, Henipaviruses, Lyssaviruses, and Coronaviruses etc.);most of them are pathogenic to human but bats act as reservoir host without causing any pathogenesis.

This study examined outcomes after colorectal resection in emergency general surgery patients. METHODS This was an EAST-sponsored prospective observational multicenter study of patients undergoing urgent/emergent colorectal resection. Twenty-one centers enrolled patients over 11-months. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were recorded. Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U-test, and multivariable logistic regression models were used to describe outcomes and risk factors for surgical complication/mortality. RESULTS 439 patients were enrolled (184 ANST, 255 STM). Median (IQR) age was 62 (53-71) years and median Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 4 (1-6). The most common indication for surgery was diverticulitis (28%). STM group was older (64 vs. 58 years, p<0.001), had a higher CCI, and were more likely to be immunosuppressed. Preoperatively STM patients were more likely to be intubated (57 vs. 15, p<0.001), on vasopressors (61 vs. 13, p<0.001), have pneumoperitoneum (131 vs. 41, p<0.001) or fecal contamination (114 vs. 33, p<0.001), and had a higher incidence of elevated lactate (149 vs. 67, p<0.001). Overall mortality was 13%, which was higher in STM patients (18 vs. 8%, p=0.02). Surgical complications were more common in STM patients (35 vs. 25%, p=0.02). On multivariable analysis, management with an open abdomen, intraoperative blood transfusion and larger hospital size were associated with development of a surgical complication while CCI, preoperative vasopressor use, steroid use, open abdomen and intraoperative blood transfusion were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights a tendency to perform fecal diversion in patients that are acutely ill at presentation. There is a higher morbidity and mortality rate in STM patients. Independent predictors of mortality include CCI, preoperative vasopressor use, steroid use, open abdomen, and intraoperative blood transfusion.

Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of augmented bilateral lateral rectus muscle recession (ABLRR) in treatment of PIE with large deviation angles. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for 25 patients with PIE who underwent ABLRR. ABLRR was performed using a hemi-hang-back technique. Ocular alignment, ocular motility and binocular vision were evaluated pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS: Fourteen males and 11 females with PIE were included in this study, with a mean age of (3.92  2.02) years (range, 1-7 years). The average exodeviation angle was (-66.32  7.84) PD (range, -60--80 PD) preoperatively. All patients underwent ABLRR using the hemi-hang-back technique. Three of them underwent bilateral inferior oblique muscle anterior transposition in the same operation. The mean surgical dosage was (11.08  1.19) mm for each lateral rectus muscle. The mean of deviation angel was -2.28  5.08 PD postoperatively (P < 0.05). All patients did not have abduction deficiency after a large amount of lateral rectus recession.

Fears of disruptions in the food supply chain have caused an increase in the quantity and type of food bought by households. However, increases in food purchases could give rise to food waste with negative ramifications for the environment in terms of greenhouse emissions and groundwater pollution. To assess whether household food waste has changed during Covid-19 lockdown, we conducted a nationwide survey of household food purchasers in Italy. Although the amount of food purchases increased during the lockdown, our results show that food waste actually decreased as people mainly bought more non-perishable food. Interestingly, concerns about the impact that the pandemic could have on the waste management system and the desire not to add pressure to the waste management system are key drivers of decreased food waste in Italy during the pandemic.

No previous studies examine whether patients undergoing spinal region CSI are at increased risk for viral infections, particularly influenza-a common viral illness with potentially serious consequences, especially for patients with multimorbidity. PURPOSE: To examine odds of influenza in patients who received spinal region CSI compared to matched controls. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study PATIENT SAMPLE: Adults (na?=a?9196) who received a spinal CSI (epidural, facet, sacroiliac, paravertebral block) during influenza seasons occurring from 2000 to 2020 were 1:1 matched to controls without spinal CSI. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was odds of influenza diagnosis in spinal CSI patients compared to matched controls. Predetermined subgroup analyses examined odds of influenza diagnosis based on vaccination status and injection location. METHODS: An institutional database was queried to identify patients that received spinal CSI during influenza season (September 1 to April 30) from 2000 to 2020. Patients were matched by age, sex, and influenza vaccination status to controls without spinal CSI within the specified influenza season. Influenza diagnosis was ascertained using International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes and data was analyzed using multiple logistic regression adjusted for comorbidities associated with increased risk for influenza. RESULTS: 9196 adults (mean age 60.8 years, 60.4% female) received a spinal CSI and were matched to a control. There were no increased odds of influenza for spinal CSI patients as compared to matched controls (OR 1.13, [95% CI, 0.86-1.48]). When subgroups were examined, there was also no increased odds of influenza for spinal CSI patients based on immunization status (unvaccinated or vaccinated) or spinal injection location (epidural or non-epidural). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal region CSI was not associated with increased odds of influenza or reduced vaccine efficacy. This is reassuring given the analgesic and functional restoration benefits of these injections. Assessing risk of viral infection associated with spinal CSI is particularly relevant in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, and further work is needed to address this issue.

There were 5,175 respondents; 53.9% had a change in sleep duration.17.1% slept less and 36.7% slept more. Sleeping more was related to greater education, being single/divorced/separated, unemployed or a student. Being retired, divorced/separated or a homemaker, and living in the Mountain or Central time zones were associated with less sleep. Beliefs that COVID-19 would result in personal adverse consequences was associated with both more and less sleep.

A number of Deep Learning techniques has been established by researchers to detect the presence of COVID-19 using CT scan images and X-rays. However, these methods suffer from biased results and inaccurate detection of the disease. So, the current research article developed Oppositional-based Chimp Optimization Algorithm and Deep Dense Convolutional Neural Network (OCOA-DDCNN) for COVID-19 prediction using CT images in IoT environment. The proposed methodology works on the basis of two stages such as pre-processing and prediction. Initially, CT scan images generated from prospective COVID-19 are collected from open-source system using IoT devices. The collected images are then preprocessed using Gaussian filter. Gaussian filter can be utilized in the removal of unwanted noise from the collected CT scan images. Afterwards, the preprocessed images are sent to prediction phase. In this phase, Deep Dense Convolutional Neural Network (DDCNN) is applied upon the pre-processed images. The proposed classifier is optimally designed with the consideration of Oppositional-based Chimp Optimization Algorithm (OCOA). This algorithm is utilized in the selection of optimal parameters for the proposed classifier. Finally, the proposed technique is used in the prediction of COVID-19 and classify the results as either COVID-19 or non-COVID-19. The projected method was implemented in MATLAB and the performances were evaluated through statistical measurements.

Giving affective touch to others is fundamental for human bonding. This brief report presents preliminary results from a pilot study. It explores if exposure to bonding scenes impacts the activity of specific muscles related to physical interaction. Fingers flexion is a very important component when performing most actions of affectionate contact. We explored the visuo-motor affective interplay by priming participants with bonding scenes and assessing the electromyographic activity of the fingers flexor muscle, in the absence of any overt movements. Photographs of dyads in social interaction and of the same dyads not interacting were employed. We examined the effects upon the electromyographical activity: (i) during the passive exposure to pictures, and (ii) during picture offset and when expecting the signal to perform a fingers flexion task. Interacting dyads compared to matched non-interacting dyads increased electromyographic activity of the fingers flexor muscle in both contexts. Specific capture of visual bonding cues at the level of visual cortex had been described in the literature. Here we showed that the neural processing of visual bonding cues reaches the fingers flexor muscle. Besides, previous visualization of bonding cues enhanced background electromyographic activity during motor preparation to perform the fingers flexion task, which might reflect a sustained leakage of central motor activity downstream leading to increase in firing of the respective motor neurons. These data suggest, at the effector level, an implicit visuo-motor connection in which social interaction cues evoke intrinsic dispositions toward affectionate social behavior.","output":"Visuo-Motor Affective Interplay: Bonding Scenes Promote Implicit Motor Pre-dispositions Associated With Social GroomingCA Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The success of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) mostly depends on regular injections. Our aim was to investigate adherence to SCIT with aeroallergens during the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrate clinical consequences of treatment disruptions in real life. METHODS: Visual analogue scale for quality of life (VAS-QoL), VAS for symptom scores (VAS-symptom), medication scores (MSs), and total symptom scores (TSS-6) were recorded during the pandemic in 327 adult allergic rhinitis and/or asthmatic patients receiving maintenance SCIT, and these scores were compared with the pre-pandemic data. Patients were grouped according to SCIT administration intervals; no delay (Group 1), <2 months (Group 2), and &#8805;2-month intervals (Group 3). RESULTS: A total of 104 (31.8%) patients (Group 3) were considered as nonadherent which was mostly related to receiving SCIT with HDMs and using public transportation for reaching the hospital. Median MS, VAS-symptom, and TSS-6 scores of Group 3 patients during the pandemic were higher than the pre-pandemic scores (p = 0.005, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively), whereas median VAS-QoL scores of Group 3 during the pandemic were lower than the pre-pandemic scores (p < 0.001). Median TSS-6 and VAS-symptom scores were the highest in Group 3 compared with other groups (p < 0.001 for each comparison). Median VAS-QoL scores were the lowest in Group 3 compared with Group 1 and Group 2 (p < 0.001, p = 0.043, respectively). CONCLUSION: When precautions in allergy clinics are carefully applied, adherence to SCIT can be high during a pandemic. Patients must be encouraged to regularly adhere to SCIT injections since delays in SCIT administration can deteriorate clinical symptoms.","output":"Adherence to subcutaneous immunotherapy with aeroallergens in real-life practice during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work demonstrates the safety and feasibility of Lattice Radiotherapy (LRT) for large soft tissue sarcoma in neoadjuvant radiotherapy.

The patient's COVID-19 test was negative; therefore, she was monitored in the COVID-19 general clinic with normal levels of oxygen saturation (SpO2 ). The patient had been taking Plaquenil for rheumatoid arthritis for a long time. Azithromycin was administered first, and then, the treatment continued with favipiravir according to the national treatment protocol in Turkey.

We believe that the treatment and care activities under qualified and effective nursing care, such as providing appropriate respiratory support at the right time, early initiation and maintenance of anticoagulant therapy, long-term prone positioning, maintaining sufficient fluid resuscitation, and early commencement of balanced enteral nutrition, contributed to the successful discharge of the patient from the ICU. The patient was finally extubated on the 23rd day. Respiratory support was continued with oxygen administered at 2 lt/min through a nasal canula with SpO2 at 94%.

This contrasts with many other high-income countries that closed schools for long periods of time. Here we describe cases and outbreaks of COVID-19 in schools and preschools during the academic year 2020/2021, to evaluate the strategy of keeping these open with infection prevention control measures in place. Methods: In this descriptive study, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health initiated systematic surveillance for COVID-19 cases and outbreaks in schools and preschools in October 2020. Data was compiled from the national outbreak alert system VESUV, municipality websites, and media scanning combined with the national emergency preparedness register Beredt C-19. An outbreak was defined as []2 cases among pupils or staff within 14 days at the same educational setting. Settings were categorized as preschool (1-5-years), primary school (6-12-years), lower secondary school (13-15-years) and upper secondary school (16-18- years). We reported the incidence rate among preschool and school-aged pupils and gave a descriptive overview of outbreaks and included cases per educational setting. Results: During the whole academic year, a total of 1203 outbreaks in preschools and school settings were identified, out of a total of 8311 preschools and schools nationwide. The incidence of COVID-19 in preschool- and school-aged children and the rates of outbreaks in these settings largely followed the community trend. Most of the outbreaks occurred in primary schools (40%) and preschools (25%). Outbreaks across all settings were mostly small (median 3 cases, range 2 to 72), however, 40 outbreaks (3% of total) included 20 or more cases. The larger outbreaks were predominantly seen in primary schools (43%). Conclusions: We observed few large outbreaks in open schools and preschools in Norway during the academic year of 2020/2021, also when the Alpha variant was predominant. This illustrates that it is possible to keep schools and preschools open even during periods of high community transmission of COVID-19. Adherence to targeted IPC measures adaptable to the local situation has been essential to keep educational settings open, and thus reduce the total burden on children and adolescents.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of an internet-based treatment for knee osteoarthritis vs routine self-management (ie, usual care). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted from October 2018 to March 2020. Participants included individuals aged 45 years or older with a diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis recruited from an existing primary care database or from social media advertisements were invited. Data were analyzed April to July 2020. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention and control group conformed to first-line knee osteoarthritis treatment. For the intervention group, treatment was delivered via a smartphone application. The control group received routine self-management care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change from baseline to 6 weeks in self-reported pain during the last 7 days, reported on a numerical rating scale (NRS; range, 0-10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10, worst pain imaginable), compared between groups. Secondary outcomes included 2 physical functioning scores, hamstring and quadriceps muscle strength, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and quantitative sensory testing. RESULTS: Among a total of 551 participants screened for eligibility, 146 were randomized and 105 were analyzed (mean [SD] age, 66.7 [9.2] years, 71 [67.1%] women), including 48 participants in the intervention group and 57 participants in the control group. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. At the 6-week follow-up, the intervention group showed a greater NRS pain score reduction than the control group (between-group difference, ?1.5 [95% CI, ?2.2 to ?0.8]; P < .001). Similarly, the intervention group had better improvements in the 30-second sit-to-stand test (between-group difference, 3.4 [95% CI, 2.2 to 4.5]; P < .001) and Timed Up-and-Go test (between-group difference, ?1.8 [95% CI, ?3.0 to ?0.5] seconds; P = .007), as well as the WOMAC subscales for pain (between-group difference, ?1.1 [95% CI, ?2.0 to ?0.2]; P = .02), stiffness (between-group difference, ?1.0 [95% CI, ?1.5 to ?0.5]; P < .001), and physical function (between-group difference, ?3.4 [95% CI, ?6.2 to ?0.7]; P = .02). The magnitude of within-group changes in pain (d = 0.83) and function outcomes (30 second sit-to-stand test d = 1.24; Timed Up-and-Go test d = 0.76) in the intervention group corresponded to medium to very strong effects. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that this internet-delivered, evidence-based, first-line osteoarthritis treatment was superior to routine self-managed usual care and could be provided without harm to people with osteoarthritis. Effect sizes observed in the intervention group corresponded to clinically important improvements.

The antiviral efficacy of PPE against HuNoV was evaluated by quantifying the number of residual virus genomes using a quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. Pomegranate peel, considered as a waste product of industrial processing, is known for beneficial health effects and broad antimicrobial activity due to the high content of phenolic compounds and tannins. PPE showed significant antiviral properties against HuNoV both in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and simulated gastric fluid. The reduction of HuNoV by pomegranate juice was lower than with PPE, which could be attributed to the lower content of antimicrobial compounds. A pretreatment of cherry tomato and green onion surfaces with PPE significantly reduced the amount of HuNoV particles that adhered to those surfaces during subsequent virus suspension treatment.

Products shipped during the disruption period come with an uncontrollable delivery lead time, resulting in product quality degradation. To balance the compensation price provided to customers because of quality losses, the retailer might employ freshness-keeping efforts to reduce the quality loss during transportation. Therefore, it raises several fundamental questions for the retailer in mitigating the disruption. Is it always optimal to satisfy those customers who are willing to purchase during disruption? If it is profitable to fulfill orders along with an extra delivery lead time, and with a quality loss compensation, what is the optimal freshness-keeping effort? If it is preferable to deliberately create unsatisfied demand by announcing shortages (rationing) to customers, when is the optimal time to do so? To answer these questions, we first present the dynamics of post-disruption inventory and demand, taking into account the demand learning effect facilitated from negative word-of-mouth during disruption and the demand recovery after disruption ends. Afterward, we develop a model to achieve the optimal selling strategy for maximizing post-disruption profit, identifying the joint decision of the rationing period and freshness-keeping effort.

We analyzed the incidence, mechanisms, and physiologic implications of double cycling during volume- and pressure-targeted mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. DESIGN Prospective, observational study. SETTING Three general ICUs in Spain. PATIENTS Sixty-seven continuously monitored adult patients undergoing volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with constant flow, volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with decelerated flow, or pressure control-continuous mandatory mechanical ventilation for longer than 24 hours. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We analyzed 9,251 hours of mechanical ventilation corresponding to 9,694,573 breaths. Double cycling occurred in 0.6%. All patients had double cycling; however, the distribution of double cycling varied over time. The mean percentage (95% CI) of double cycling was higher in pressure control-continuous mandatory ventilation 0.54 (0.34-0.87) than in volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with constant flow 0.27 (0.19-0.38) or volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with decelerated flow 0.11 (0.06-0.20). Tidal volume in double-cycled breaths was higher in volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with constant flow and volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with decelerated flow than in pressure control-continuous mandatory ventilation. Double-cycled breaths were patient triggered in 65.4% and reverse triggered (diaphragmatic contraction stimulated by a previous passive ventilator breath) in 34.6% of cases; the difference was largest in volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with decelerated flow (80.7% patient triggered and 19.3% reverse triggered). Peak pressure of the second stacked breath was highest in volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with constant flow regardless of trigger type. Various physiologic factors, none mutually exclusive, were associated with double cycling. CONCLUSIONS Double cycling is uncommon but occurs in all patients. Periods without double cycling alternate with periods with clusters of double cycling. The volume of the stacked breaths can double the set tidal volume in volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with constant flow. Gas delivery must be tailored to neuroventilatory demand because interdependent ventilator setting-related physiologic factors can contribute to double cycling. One third of double-cycled breaths were reverse triggered, suggesting that repeated respiratory muscle activation after time-initiated ventilator breaths occurs more often than expected.","output":"Double Cycling During Mechanical Ventilation: Frequency, Mechanisms, and Physiologic Implications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of cardiac troponin measurement in patients hospitalised for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is uncertain. We investigated the prevalence of elevated troponins in these patients and its prognostic value for predicting mortality. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching electronic databases and preprint servers. We included studies of hospitalised covid-19 patients that reported the frequency of troponin elevations above the upper reference limit and/or the association between troponins and mortality. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models. RESULTS: Fifty-one studies were included. Elevated troponins were found in 20.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16.8-25.0 %) of patients who received troponin test on hospital admission. Elevated troponins on admission were associated with a higher risk of subsequent death (risk ratio 2.68, 95% CI 2.08-3.46) after adjusting for confounders in multivariable analysis. The pooled sensitivity of elevated admission troponins for predicting death was 0.60 (95% CI 0.54-0.65), and the specificity was 0.83 (0.77-0.88). The post-test probability of death was about 42% for patients with elevated admission troponins and was about 9% for those with non-elevated troponins on admission. There was significant heterogeneity in the analyses, and many included studies were at risk of bias due to the lack of systematic troponin measurement and inadequate follow-up. CONCLUSION: Elevated troponins were relatively common in patients hospitalised for covid-19. Troponin measurement on admission might help in risk stratification, especially in identifying patients at high risk of death when troponin levels are elevated. High-quality prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.

Specifically, we explore four different approaches to managing the 'bulge' as classes overlap in clerkships Curriculum leaders at four medical schools report on managing the bulge of core clinical placements resulting from reducing the duration of the foundational sciences curriculum and calendar shifts for the respective clerkship curriculum. These changes, which occurred between 2014 and 2018, led to more students being enrolled in core clinical rotations at the same time than occurred previously. Schools provided respective metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of their bulge management technique. These data typically included number of students affected in each phase of their curricular transformation, performance on standardized examinations, and student and faculty feedback. Not all data were available from all schools, as some schools are still working through their 'bulge' or are affected by COVID-19.

The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) and Plastic Surgery Foundation (PSF) published photography guidelines in 2006 to optimize its clinical use. However, photographic documentation of outcomes in facial transplantation (FT) continues to lack standardization. We therefore appraised the current state of FT photography in the peer-reviewed literature. Methods A PubMed search was conducted from July 2005 to July 2019. Studies containing photographs of partial or full FT recipients were included. Non-English language articles, cadaveric and animal studies, technique papers, and case reports were excluded. Data were extracted from 91 articles. Adherence rates were calculated to determine whether published FT photographs followed ASPS/PSF guidelines. Proposed photographic standards particular to FT were then formulated to guide standardization of practice. Results Only 28.6% (26/91) of articles adhered to the photographic conventions of preparation, positioning, and views. Of 162 patient appearances in the 91 articles, 95% (154/162) met the criteria for preparation, 98.8% (160/162) met the criteria for positioning, but only 24.7% (40/162) met the criteria for views. Conclusions Photographic documentation of FT outcomes in the peer-reviewed literature is limited, with inconsistent adherence to ASPS/PSF guidelines. There is substantial deficiency in provision of alternative views, with the majority of publications only depicting the frontal view. FT photography standards should specifically incorporate alternative views, proper lighting and framing, and elimination of distractions, and accommodate for remote patient self-photography.

Drawing upon original empirical research, it makes the case that the prospects for revitalizing smallholder production remain structurally constrained by a legacy of land inequality and failed agrarian reform. According to our findings, the only sectors that thrived during the lockdown were ones that served local markets. For those requiring significant shipping and storage, merchants and traders were able to drive down farmgate prices, squeezing local producers. At the same time, new government legislation made it easier for employers to terminate wage labourers, undermining a vital source of income and employment for low\\\\income households.

Using natural glycan microarray technology, we identified N-glycans in the human lung that are recognized by various human and animal coronaviruses. All viruses tested, including SARS-CoV-2, bound strongly to a range of phosphorylated, high mannose N-glycans and to a very specific set of sialylated structures. Examination of two linked strains, human CoV OC43 and bovine CoV Mebus, reveals shared binding to the sialic acid form Neu5Gc (not found in humans), supporting the evidence for cross-species transmission of the bovine strain.

Analysis of the work flow will identify factors contributing to the in-hospital delays. METHODS AND RESULTS In the endovascular arm of the IMS III trial, the following time intervals were calculated: stroke onset to emergency department arrival; emergency department to computed tomography (CT); CT to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator start; intravenous tissue plasminogen activator start to randomization; randomization to groin puncture; groin puncture to thrombus identification; thrombus identification to start of endovascular therapy; and start of endovascular therapy to reperfusion. The effects of enrollment time, CT angiography use, interhospital transfers, and intubation on work flow were evaluated. Delays occurred notably in the time intervals from intravenous tissue plasminogen activator initiation to groin puncture (median 84 minutes) and start of endovascular therapy to reperfusion (median 85 minutes). The CT to groin puncture time was significantly shorter during working hours than after. Times from emergency department to reperfusion and groin puncture to reperfusion decreased over the trial period. Patients with CT angiography had shorter emergency department to reperfusion and onset to reperfusion times. Transfer of patients resulted in a longer onset to reperfusion time compared with those treated in the same center. Age, sex, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and intubation did not affect delays. CONCLUSIONS Important delays were identified before reperfusion in the IMS III trial. Delays decreased as the trial progressed. Use of CT angiography and endovascular treatment in the same center were associated with time savings.

Here we report early accumulation of fibrillar collagen in the glomerular mesangium of male ACE2 mutant (ACE2(?/y)) mice followed by development of glomerulosclerosis by 12 months of age whereas female ACE2 mutant (ACE2(?/?)) mice were relatively protected. Progressive kidney injury was associated with increased deposition of collagen I, collagen III and fibronectin in the glomeruli and increased urinary albumin excretion compared to age-matched control mice. These structural and functional changes in the glomeruli of male ACE2 mutant mice were prevented by treatment with the angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist irbesartan. Loss of ACE2 was associated with a marked increase in renal lipid peroxidation product formation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 in glomeruli, events that are also prevented by angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockade. We conclude that deletion of the ACE2 gene leads to the development of angiotensin II-dependent glomerular injury in male mice. These findings have important implications for our understanding of ACE2, the renin-angiotensin system, and gender in renal injury, with ACE2 likely to be an important therapeutic target in kidney disease.","output":"Loss of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 Leads to the Late Development of Angiotensin II-Dependent Glomerulosclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ivermectin is a widely used antiparasitic drug with known efficacy against several single-strain RNA viruses.

However, in the western USA, WNS-susceptible bat species rarely assemble in large numbers and known winter roosts are uncommon features. WNS increases arousal frequency and activity of infected bats during hibernation. Our objective was to explore the effectiveness of acoustic monitoring as a surveillance tool for WNS. We propose a non-invasive approach to model pre-WNS baseline activity rates for comparison with future acoustic data after WNS is suspected to occur. We investigated relationships among bat activity, ambient temperatures, and season prior to presence of WNS across forested sites of Montana, USA where WNS was not known to occur. We used acoustic monitors to collect bat activity and ambient temperature data year-round on 41 sites, 2011C2019. We detected a diverse bat community across managed (n = 4) and unmanaged (n = 37) forest sites and recorded over 5.37 million passes from bats, including 13 identified species. Bats were active year-round, but positive associations between average of the nightly temperatures by month and bat activity were strongest in spring and fall. From these data, we developed site-specific prediction models for bat activity to account for seasonal and annual temperature variation prior to known occurrence of WNS. These prediction models can be used to monitor changes in bat activity that may signal potential presence of WNS, such as greater than expected activity in winter, or less than expected activity during summer.

Collectively, it was found that glaucoma patients have lower levels of vitamin D compared to controls (SMD=-1.16, 95% CI=-1.56--0.76, P<0.00001). In parallel, the pooled results showed a significant association between glaucoma and allelic (b vs. B, OR=1.84, 95% CI=1.37-2.46, P=0.00001) and recessive (bb vs. Bb+BB, OR=3.16, 95% CI=1.30-7.66, P=0.001) models of VDR BsmI (rs1544410) polymorphism, but not with VDR TaqI (rs731236) or FokI (rs2228570) polymorphisms.

In March 2020, a large proportion of the German population supported such interventions. In this article, we analyse whether the support for NPI dwindle with economic worries superimposing virus-related worries in the months to follow. We test seven pre-registered1 hypotheses using data from the German COSMO survey (Betsch, Wieler, Habersaat, et al. 2020), which regularly monitors behavioural and psychological factors related to the pandemic. The present article covers the period from March 24, 2020 to July 7, 2020 (Ntotal = 13,094), and, in addition, includes a validation study providing evidence for the reliability and validity of the corresponding COSMO measures (N = 612). Results revealed that virus-related worries decreased over time, whereas economic worries remained largely constant. Moreover, the acceptance of NPIs considerably decreased over time. Virus-related worries were positively associated with acceptance of NPIs, whereas this relationship was negative regarding economic worries (albeit smaller and less consistent). Unexpectedly, no interactions between virus-related worries and economic worries were found. We conclude that individual differences in virus-related and economic threat perceptions related to COVID-19 play an important role in the acceptance of NPIs.","output":"Will COVID-19-related economic worries superimpose health worries, reducing nonpharmaceutical intervention acceptance in Germany?

Furthermore, the last quarter century has seen an explosion of new questions and ideas, stimulated by developments in the computer and cognitive sciences. Competing ideas about probability are often driven by different intuitions about the nature of belief that arise from the needs of different domains (e.g., economics, management theory, engineering, medicine, the life sciences etc). Taking medicine as our focus we develop three lines of argument (historical, practical and cognitive) that suggest that traditional views of probability cannot accommodate all the competing demands and diverse constraints that arise in complex real-world domains. A model of uncertain reasoning based on a form of logical argumentation appears to unify many diverse ideas. The model has precursors in informal discussions of argumentation due to Toulmin, and the notion of logical probability advocated by Keynes, but recent developments in artificial intelligence and cognitive science suggest ways of resolving epistemological and technical issues that they could not address.","output":"Probability, logic and the cognitive foundations of rational belief"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the unprecedented coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis, virtual education activities have become more prevalent than ever One activity that many families have incorporated into their routines while at home is virtual storytime, with teachers, grandparents, and other remote adults reading books to children over video chat The current study asks how dialogic reading over video chat compares to more traditional forms of book reading in promoting story comprehension and vocabulary learning Fifty-eight 4-year-olds (M-age= 52 7,SD= 4 04, 31 girls) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (Video chat, Live, and Prerecorded) Across conditions, children were read the same narrative storybook by a female experimenter who used the same 10 scripted dialogic reading prompts during book reading In theVideo chat(n= 21) andLive conditions(n= 18), the experimenter gave the scripted prompts and interacted naturally andcontingently, responding in a timely, relevant manner to children's behaviors In thePrerecorded condition(n= 19), children viewed a video of an experimenter reading the book The Prerecorded condition waspseudo-contingent;the reader posed questions and paused for a set period of time as if to wait for a child's response After reading, children completed measures of vocabulary and comprehension Results revealed no differences between conditions across six different outcome measures, suggesting that children comprehended and learned from the story similarly across book formats Further, children in the three experimental conditions scored significantly higher on measures than children in a fourth condition (control) who had never read the book, confirming that children learned from the three different book formats However, children were more responsive to the prompts in theLiveandVideo chatconditions than thePrerecordedcondition, suggesting that children recognized that these interactions were contingent with their responses, a feature that was lacking in thePrerecordedcondition Results indicate that children can comprehend books over video chat, suggesting that this technology is a viable option for reading to children, especially during the current pandemic","output":"Preschoolers Benefit Equally From Video Chat, Pseudo-Contingent Video, and Live Book Reading: Implications for Storytime During the Coronavirus Pandemic and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute inflammation is a critical host defense response during viral infection. When dysregulated, inflammation drives immunopathology and tissue damage. Excessive, damaging inflammation is a hallmark of both pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) infections and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Chronic, low-grade inflammation is also a feature of obesity. In recent years, obesity has been recognized as a growing pandemic with significant mortality and associated costs. Obesity is also an independent risk factor for increased disease severity and death during both IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review focuses on the effect of obesity on the inflammatory response in the context of viral respiratory infections and how this leads to increased viral pathology. Here, we will review the fundamentals of inflammation, how it is initiated in IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection and its link to disease severity. We will examine how obesity drives chronic inflammation and trained immunity and how these impact the immune response to IAV and SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we review both medical and non-medical interventions for obesity, how they impact on the inflammatory response and how they could be used to prevent disease severity in obese patients. As projections of global obesity numbers show no sign of slowing down, future pandemic preparedness will require us to consider the metabolic health of the population. Furthermore, if weight-loss alone is insufficient to reduce the risk of increased respiratory virus-related mortality, closer attention must be paid to a patients history of health, and new therapeutic options identified.","output":"Dysregulated Inflammation During Obesity: Driving Disease Severity in Influenza Virus and SARS-CoV-2 Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The implementation of an integrated medical neuroscience course by technologically pivoting an in\\\\person neuroscience course to online using an adaptive blended method may provide a unique approach for teaching a medical neuroscience course during the Covid\\\\19 pandemic.

We rely on a global extended Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) mechanistic model of the infection including a dynamics over time for the transmission rate containing a Wiener process accounting for modeling error. Random effects are integrated by following an innovative population approach based on Kalman-type filter where the log-likelihood functional couples data across French regions. We then fit the estimated time-varying transmission rate using a regression model depending on NPI while accounting for the vaccination coverage, the apparition of variants of concern (VOC) and the seasonal weather conditions. We show that all NPI considered have an independent significant effect on the transmission rate. We additionally demonstrate a strong effect of weather condition, decreasing the transmission during the summer period, and also estimated an increased transmissibility of VOC.","output":"Using population based Kalman estimator to model COVID-19 epidemics in France: estimating the burden of SARS-CoV-2 and the effects of NPI."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: After the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, we conducted hospital-based severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance in one central Chinese city to assess disease burden attributable to influenza among adults and adolescents. METHODS: We defined an adult SARI case as a hospitalized patient aged  15 years with temperature 38.0C and at least one of the following: cough, sore throat, tachypnea, difficulty breathing, abnormal breath sounds on auscultation, sputum production, hemoptysis, chest pain, or chest radiograph consistent with pneumonia. For each enrolled SARI case-patient, we completed a standardized case report form, and collected a nasopharyngeal swab within 24 hours of admission. Specimens were tested for influenza viruses by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). We analyzed data from adult SARI cases in four hospitals in Jingzhou, China from April 2010 to April 2012. RESULTS: Of 1,790 adult SARI patients enrolled, 40% were aged  65 years old. The median duration of hospitalization was 9 days. Nearly all were prescribed antibiotics during their hospitalization, less than 1% were prescribed oseltamivir, and 28% were prescribed corticosteroids. Only 0.1% reported receiving influenza vaccination in the past year. Of 1,704 samples tested, 16% were positive for influenza.

To date, the reports on the PCV3 present in diarrhea pigs are limited and the genetic characteristics of PCV3 from diarrheal pigs and pathogenicity on pigs were inconsistent. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of PCV3 in pigs with/without diarrhea, to analyze the genome sequence of PCV3 from diarrheal pigs, and to inquire into the associated pathogenicity of PCV3 to piglets experimentally infected with PCV3-positive intestinal contents. The results demonstrated that PCV3 was widely circulating in diarrheal suckling and weaned piglets. Clinical signs, gross lesions, and histological changes were observed in suckling piglets inoculated with PCV3. The complete genome of a PCV3a strain was determined and two mutations (V24A and K27R) were present when compared with PCV3b strains. The findings of this study increase the knowledge of the epidemiology, viral genetics, pathogenicity, and pathogenesis of PCV3. ABSTRACT: Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) infections have been reported in different clinical presentations. However, the prevalence and pathogenicity of PCV3 associated with diarrhea in piglets have been limited. Herein, we present an investigation and genome analyses of PCV3 in piglets experiencing diarrhea, and observed clinical signs, gross lesions, and histological changes in pigs negative for all known pathogens associated with diarrhea but positive for PCV3 alone. Among the feces (n = 141) tested, 16.31% (23/141) were positive for PCV3. Of which, 27.28% (15/55) and 14.29% (5/35) were present in diarrheal samples from suckling and weaned piglets, respectively. Moderate to severe atrophic villi was confined in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, and significantly decreased average heights of villi, and the depths of crypt were observed in PCV3-infected piglets. The complete genome of a representative strain of PCV3, designated as JX/CH/2018, was determined. Multialignment analysis indicated that JX/CH/2018 had 97.7C99.7% nucleotide identity at the complete genome level, and 97.2C100% at the amino acid level of the capsid protein when compared with reference PCV3 strains.

It is essential to identify and classify the disease through the use of image processing techniques. So, a new intelligent disease diagnosis model is in need to identify the COVID-19. In this view, this paper presents a novel IoT enabled Depthwise separable convolution neural network (DWS-CNN) with Deep support vector machine (DSVM) for COVID-19 diagnosis and classification. The proposed DWS-CNN model aims to detect both binary and multiple classes of COVID-19 by incorporating a set of processes namely data acquisition, Gaussian filtering (GF) based preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Initially, patient data will be collected in the data acquisition stage using IoT devices and sent to the cloud server. Besides, the GF technique is applied to remove the existence of noise that exists in the image. Then, the DWS-CNN model is employed for replacing default convolution for automatic feature extraction. Finally, the DSVM model is applied to determine the binary and multiple class labels of COVID-19. The diagnostic outcome of the DWS-CNN model is tested against Chest X-ray (CXR) image dataset and the results are investigated interms of distinct performance measures.

To achieve this, atypical genomic sequences which may be unique to SARS-CoV-2 or Coronaviridae family in general may be investigated. Such sequences in virus genomes may be responsible for target prediction, replication, defence mechanisms and viral packaging. This fact has motivated us to explore the different types of repeats such as palindromes, mirror repeats and inverted repeats in SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1. For this purpose, the respective reference sequence of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 is divided into descriptors of sequences of length k using k-mer technique. Thereafter, these descriptors are represented as a collection of tokens which are subsequently used for the identification of palindrome, mirror repeat and inverted repeat in the respective reference sequence. The highest number of palindromes, mirror repeats and inverted repeats are identified for descriptor length 10. As a result, for palindromes such values are 38, 42 and 33 and for mirror repeats they are 52, 38 and 33 for SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 respectively. For inverted repeats, with a descriptor length 10 and intervening length 5, the values are 59, 56 and 70 respectively. Moreover, the identified repeats are then searched for in 108246, 291 and 340 SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 virus sequences respectively to find the population coverage of such repeats. It surpasses 99% in most cases and even 100% for some. Furthermore, GC contents which mostly lie between 20%-50% are evaluated for these repeats as well in order to understand their binding efficacy.

For the first time in history, the crisis was caused by factors of a non-economic nature. They manifested themselves in all economies of the world, including Europe. Since March 2020, the federal and state executive authorities of Germany, along with the introduction of restrictive measures for the population and business, have adopted several large-scale economic and political programmes aimed at preventing bankruptcies of economic entities, preserving jobs and social stability in the country. Along with short-term instruments designed to stop the decline in GDP and give impetus to its growth, the German state pursued an active and coordinated with Brussels structural policy aimed at ensuring an energy and digital transition to a climate-neutral economy, including the overcoming the deficits and problems revealed by the pandemic in the country's economy. To this end, Berlin abandoned the budget surplus policy and switched to large-scale external borrowing to finance programmes to bring economy out of the crisis. The author analyzes the results of the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the economic space of Germany, including aspects of its stress resistance and competitiveness, explores the effectiveness of state policy to counter crisis and assesses the prospects for the development of Russia's leading foreign economic partner in the west of the Eurasian continent. ? 2021 Institute of Europe Russian Academy of Sciences.

We found three open reading frames (ORFs). The largest ORF encoded a 668-amino acid protein of 73,588 Da, which was presumably the capsid precursor protein of FCV and had significant amino acid sequence homology with the VP3 of picornaviruses. A small ORF at the extreme 3-end was compared with that of the F9 strain of FCV, a vaccine strain originally from the U.S. Highly conserved amino acid sequences were shown, suggesting that this ORF might be functional and encode a putative 106-amino acid protein of 12,153 Da.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 has caused over 62 million infections and more than 1.4 million deaths worldwide in the first year of the pandemic. This case report depicts the clinical course of a patient with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, requiring VV-ECMO and bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation (BOLT). Case Description R.R. was a 57-year-old triathlete with history of smoking 20 years ago, anxiety, and depression. He initially presented to an outside hospital (OSH) with symptoms of fever and dyspnea and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to increasing oxygen requirements on BiPAP seven days later. Notably, two subsequent COVID tests resulted negative. On hospital day (HOD) 28, he necessitated urgent cannulation for VV-ECMO and was transferred to our institution for further management. R.R.'s ICU course was characterized by a progressive decline of respiratory function. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed severe bullous emphysema and interstitial fibrosis. The patient developed right ventricular (RV) failure warranting treatment with inhaled nitric oxide and diuresis. Given the overall clinical status, he underwent expedited work-up and listing for lung transplantation. On HOD 32 he required intubation for worsening hypoxemia despite ECMO support with flows of 4.5 L/min, sweep of 4 L/min and circuit FiO2 of 100% with maximum lung protective ventilator support. Notably, a repeat COVID test was positive. Several days later, he underwent a tracheostomy. He continued to experience refractory hypoxia and hypercarbia, necessitating deep sedation, paralysis, and ECMO sweep of 14 L/min on the night preceding his BOLT. Post-operative course was largely unremarkable. His tracheostomy was decannulated on HOD 52 and he was discharged to rehab on HOD 59. The patient spent 17 days in rehab and was discharged home. Discussion In this case, an active triathlete without significant comorbidities developed severe pulmonary fibrosis leading to end stage lung disease from COVID-19. The vast majority of patients infected with COVID-19 have mild to moderate disease. However, patients with severe disease requiring mechanical ventilation have a mortality rate of up to 20-25%. The proportion of patients who require ECMO and lung transplantation is small. This case illustrates the merit of urgent evaluation for ECMO candidacy and consideration of lung transplantation for selected individuals in this small cohort of patients.","output":"Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (v-v ecmo) as a bridge to lung transplantation following severe COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) morbidity is not restricted to the respiratory system, but also affects the nervous system. Non-invasive neuromodulation may be useful in the treatment of the disorders associated with COVID-19. Objective: To describe the rationale and empirical basis of the use of non-invasive neuromodulation in the management of patients with COVID-10 and related disorders. Methods: We summarize COVID-19 pathophysiology with emphasis of direct neuroinvasiveness, neuroimmune response and inflammation, autonomic balance and neurological, musculoskeletal and neuropsychiatric sequela. This supports the development of a framework for advancing applications of non-invasive neuromodulation in the management COVID-19 and related disorders. Results: Non-invasive neuromodulation may manage disorders associated with COVID-19 through four pathways: (1) Direct infection mitigation through the stimulation of regions involved in the regulation of systemic anti-inflammatory responses and/or autonomic responses and prevention of neuroinflammation and recovery of respiration; (2) Amelioration of COVID-19 symptoms of musculoskeletal pain and systemic fatigue; (3) Augmenting cognitive and physical rehabilitation following critical illness; and (4) Treating outbreak-related mental distress including neurological and psychiatric disorders exacerbated by surrounding psychosocial stressors related to COVID-19. The selection of the appropriate techniques will depend on the identified target treatment pathway. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection results in a myriad of acute and chronic symptoms, both directly associated with respiratory distress (e.g., rehabilitation) or of yet-to-be-determined etiology (e.g., fatigue).

METHODS: With public health, social service, and community partners connected through an ongoing academic-community collaborative, we developed and fielded a weekly repeated cross-sectional electronic survey assessing usage of and unmet need for health and social service resources. Using ten weeks of surveys (April 3-June 11, 2020) by Allegheny County residents, we examined variation in responses by week and by sociodemographic characteristics using chi-square tests. We shared written reports weekly and discussed emerging trends with community partners. RESULTS: Participants ranged from 229-1,001 per week. Unmet need for at least one health or health-related social need resource varied by week, ranging from 55% (95% confidence interval (CI) 50-59%) of participants in week 2 to 43% (95% CI 37-49%) of participants in week 9 (p=0.006). Increased use of at least one resource ranged from 53% (95% CI 47-58%) of participants in week 3 to 36% (95% CI 31-42%) in week 9 (p<0.001).

With the advent of several COVID-19 vaccines, the dissemination and delivery of COVID-19 immunization across the nation is of concern. Previous immunization delivery patterns may reveal important components of a comprehensive and sustainable effort to immunize everyone in the nation. METHODS The delivery of vaccinations were enumerated by provider type using 2017 Medicare Part B Fee-For-Service data and the 2013-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The delivery of these services was examined at the service, physician, and visit level. RESULTS In 2017 Medicare Part B Fee-For-Service, primary care physicians provided the largest share of services for vaccinations (46%), followed closely by mass immunizers (45%), then nurse practitioners/physician assistants (NP/PAs) (5%). The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey showed that primary care physicians provided most clinical visits for vaccination (54% of all visits).

Recently, a sensitive quantitative antigen test (SQT), Lumipulse? SARS-CoV-2 Ag, was developed. It is a fully automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay system for SARS-CoV-2. Methods In this study, the analytical performance of SQT was examined using clinical specimens from nasopharyngeal swabs using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as a control. Results Receiver operating characteristic analysis of 24 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 524 -negative patients showed an area under the curve of 0.9570.063. Using a cut-off value of 1.34 pg/ml, the sensitivity was 91.7%, the specificity was 98.5%, and the overall rate of agreement was 98.2%. In the distribution of negative cases, the 99.5 percentile value was 1.03 pg/ml. There was a high correlation between the viral load calculated using the cycle threshold value of RT-PCR and the concentration of antigen. The tendency for the antigen concentration to decrease with time after disease onset correlated with that of the viral load. Conclusions Presented results indicate that SQT is highly concordant with RT-PCR and should be useful for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in any clinical setting.

In order to lessen the impact of the pandemic on these communities, leaders noted the need for greater accessibility of testing centres in these areas and a greater investment in tailored health promotion approaches. Conclusions Overall, our findings point to the importance of collecting race-based data to ensure an equitable response to the pandemic. The current one size fits all response is not effective for all individuals, especially Black communities. Not all populations have access to the same resources, nor do they live in the same conditions [1]. A deeper consideration of the social determinants of health are needed when implementing COVID-19 policies and responses. Also, a lack of attention to Black communities only continues to perpetuate the underestimated issue of anti-black racism prevalent in Canada.","output":"Racial Equity in the Fight Against COVID-19: A Qualitative Study Examining the Importance of Collecting Race-Based Data in the Canadian Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Knowledge on the epidemiological features and transmission patterns of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is accumulating Detailed line-list data with household settings can advance the understanding of COVID-19 transmission dynamics METHODS: A unique database with detailed demographic characteristics, travel history, social relationships, and epidemiological timelines for 1407 transmission pairs that formed 643 transmission clusters in mainland China was reconstructed from 9120 COVID-19 confirmed cases reported during 15 January-29 February 2020 Statistical model fittings were used to identify the superspreading events and estimate serial interval distributions Age- and sex-stratified hazards of infection were estimated for household vs nonhousehold transmissions RESULTS: There were 34 primary cases identified as superspreaders, with 5 superspreading events occurred within households Mean and standard deviation of serial intervals were estimated as 5 0 (95% credible interval [CrI], 4 4-5 5) days and 5 2 (95% CrI, 4 9-5 7) days for household transmissions and 5 2 (95% CrI, 4 6-5 8) and 5 3 (95% CrI, 4 9-5 7) days for nonhousehold transmissions, respectively The hazard of being infected outside of households is higher for people aged 18-64 years, whereas hazard of being infected within households is higher for young and old people CONCLUSIONS: Nonnegligible frequency of superspreading events, short serial intervals, and a higher risk of being infected outside of households for male people of working age indicate a significant barrier to the identification and management of COVID-19 cases, which requires enhanced nonpharmaceutical interventions to mitigate this pandemic","output":"Reconstruction of Transmission Pairs for Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Mainland China: Estimation of Superspreading Events, Serial Interval, and Hazard of Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cycle use has grown rapidly over the last few years in the UK British Cycling membership has increased threefold since the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and this is likely to rise in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic As urologists, day-to-day encounters with cyclists are commonplace, who may present with acute traumatic injuries or chronic overuse injuries The aim of this literature review was to evaluate the effect of cycling on conditions presenting to the urology clinic, in particular those of raised prostate-specific antigen (PSA), haematuria and soft-tissue lesions (?cyclist nodules?)

Neutralizing antibodies and antibodies against the receptor-binding domain, spike, and nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 were measured. Virus-specific memory T and B cell responses were analyzed. RESULTS: We enrolled 59 COVID-19 patients, including 38 moderate, 16 mild, and five asymptomatic patients; 31 (52.5%) were men, and 28 (47.5%) were women. The median age was 41 (interquartile range [IQR]: 30C55). The median day from symptom onset to enrollment was 317 days (range 257 to 343 days).

However, an understanding on the socio-economic inequalities in overweight and obesity of women received little attention, especially in the context of Bangladesh. Therefore, the objective of this study was to measure the inequality in overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age in Bangladesh as well as to explore the effect of various socio-economic factors on this inequality. METHODS This study used data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2014 which is a nationally representative data. The concentration index of overweight and obesity was applied to measure the extent of socio-economic inequality. Finally, the concertation index was decomposed in order to understand the contribution of different socio-economic variables in inequality in overweight and obesity of women. RESULTS This study included a total of 16,624 women of reproductive age. The study found that the prevalence of overweight was about 29% and the rate of obesity was approximately 11%. The value of concentration index for overweight and obesity was 0.37 (p < 0.001). This study also observed that about 52% inequality was explained by household's wealth status followed by watching television (25%), husband/partner's educational status (around 7%), women's educational status (about 5%), place of residence (approximately 4%). CONCLUSIONS This study found notable level of overweight and obesity among the women of Bangladesh. Various socio-economic factors like wealth status, education levels of women and partners, urban settings, women watching television predominantly contributed to the inequality in overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age. Therefore, the study suggests adopting necessary interventions targeting the women of higher socio-economic status to reduce the risk of life-threatening problems caused by overweight and obesity.","output":"Socio-economic inequalities in overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age in Bangladesh: a decomposition approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the CMOS fabrication course described herein, the lecture component provides the theoretical background for semiconductor materials and integrated circuit fabrication processes.

Moreover, the association between the viral sequence and clinical variables was evaluated on a group of highly characterized patients. After its origin in the 1920s, FPV showed a constant population size until a more recent expansion since 2000. Few long-distance introduction events characterized FPV spreading, however, most of its evolution occurred locally. Although without a strong statistical association, several clinical variables appeared influenced by viral phylogeny, suggesting a differential virulence potentially characterizing FPV strains.

Specifically, caspase-11Cdependent cell death contributes to pathology and decreases in survival time in sepsis models. Priming of the host cell, through TLR4 and interferon receptors, induces caspase-11 expression, and cytosolic LPS directly stimulates caspase-11 activation, promoting the release of proinflammatory cytokines through pyroptosis and caspase-1 activation. Using a CRISPR-Cas9Cmediated genome-wide screen, we identified novel mediators of caspase-11Cdependent cell death. We found a complement-related peptidase, carboxypeptidase B1 (Cpb1), to be required for caspase-11 gene expression and subsequent caspase-11Cdependent cell death. Cpb1 modifies a cleavage product of C3, which binds to and activates C3aR, and then modulates innate immune signaling. We find the Cpb1CC3CC3aR pathway induces caspase-11 expression through amplification of MAPK activity downstream of TLR4 and Ifnar activation, and mediates severity of LPS-induced sepsis (endotoxemia) and disease outcome in mice. We show C3aR is required for up-regulation of caspase-11 orthologues, caspase-4 and -5, in primary human macrophages during inflammation and that c3aR1 and caspase-5 transcripts are highly expressed in patients with severe sepsis; thus, suggesting that these pathways are important in human sepsis.

METHODS 16 patients underwent either a two-step LSG with a distal loop duodeno-ileostomy (DIOS) as revisional bariatric surgery or a combined single step operation with a proximal duodeno-jejunostomy (DJOS). Total small intestinal length was determined to account for inter-individual differences. RESULTS Mean operative time for the second-step of the DIOS operation was 121 min and 147 min for the combined DJOS operation. The overall intestinal length was 750.8 cm (range 600-900 cm) with a bypassed limb length of 235.7 cm in DJOS patients. The mean length of the common channel in DIOS patients measured 245.6 cm. Overall excess weight loss (%EWL) of the two-step DIOS procedure came to 38.31% and 49.60%, DJOS patients experienced an %EWL of 19.75% and 46.53% at 1 and 6 months, resp.

Combination therapy based on drug repurposing is among the most widely pursued of these efforts. Multi-drug regimens are traditionally designed by selecting drugs based on their mechanism of action. This is followed by dose-finding to achieve drug synergy. This approach is widely-used for drug development and repurposing.

Defining peripheral blood biomarkers relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection is fundamental to detecting and monitoring this systemic disease. This safety-focused study aims to monitor and characterize the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection via analysis of peripheral blood and nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from patients hospitalized with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in the presence or absence of bamlanivimab treatment. METHODS: 23 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were randomized to receive a single dose of the neutralizing monoclonal antibody, bamlanivimab (700 mg, 2800 mg or 7000 mg) or placebo, at study initiation (Clinical Trial; NCT04411628). Serum samples and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at multiple time points over 1 month. A Proximity Extension Array was used to detect inflammatory profiles from protein biomarkers in the serum of hospitalized COVID-19 patients relative to age/sex-matched healthy controls. RNA sequencing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs. A Luminex serology assay and Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay were used to detect endogenous antibody formation and to monitor seroconversion in each cohort over time. A mixed model for repeated measures approach was used to analyze changes in serology and serum proteins over time. RESULTS: Levels of IL-6, CXCL10, CXCL11, IFN and MCP-3 were > fourfold higher in the serum of patients with COVID-19 versus healthy controls and linked with observations of inflammatory and viral-induced interferon response genes detected in nasopharyngeal swab samples from the same patients. While IgA and IgM titers peaked around 7 days post-dose, IgG titers remained high, even after 28 days. Changes in biomarkers over time were not significantly different between the bamlanivimab and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: Similarities observed between nasopharyngeal gene expression patterns and peripheral blood biomarker profiles reveal a connection between the circulation and processes in the nasopharyngeal cavity, reinforcing the potential utility of systemic blood biomarker profiling for therapeutic monitoring of patient response. Serological antibody responses in patients correlated closely with reductions in the COVID-19 inflammatory protein biomarker signature.

A lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.033) was significantly associated with post-operative PDM development. No independent predictors for post-operative PDM were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The new development of DM within 30 days post-pancreatectomy occurs in approximately one in seven persons. No patients with pre-existing DM demonstrated a remission of DM post-pancreatectomy. These findings suggest that all patients should be screened for DM pre-operatively and followed up post-operatively, particularly those with pre-existing impaired renal function.","output":"Diabetes-related outcomes after pancreatic surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It is necessary to seek alternative therapies for depression, because side effects of medications lead to poor adherence and some patients do not achieve a clinical treatment effect. Recently the role of exercise as a low-cost and easy-to-use treatment for depression has gained attention with a number of studies showing that exercise is effective at reducing depressive symptoms and improving body functions such as cardiorespiratory system and cognitive function. Because of the heterogeneity of exercise therapy programs, there is no standardized and unified program. Few studies have summarized the specific properties of exercise programs (type, intensity, duration, and frequency) and clinical prescriptions for exercise are not mentioned in most articles. Aims: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of exercise therapy for patients with depression, in order to appraise the evidence and outline accepted guidelines to direct individualized treatment plans for patients with depression based on their individual situations. Methods: A systematic review of English language literature including papers published from 2010 to present in PubMed was performed. Given the feasibility of prescribing exercise therapy for patients with depression, nearly 3 years of clinical studies on the treatments of depressive symptoms with exercise were first reviewed, comparing the exercise programs utilized. Conclusions: Exercise has therapeutic effects on depression in all age groups (mostly 18C65 years old), as a single therapy, an adjuvant therapy, or a combination therapy, and the benefits of exercise therapy are comparable to traditional treatments for depression. Moderate intensity exercise is enough to reduce depressive symptoms, but higher-dose exercise is better for overall functioning. Exercise therapy has become more widely used because of its benefits to the cardiovascular system, emotional state, and systemic functions. Recommendations: Aerobic exercise/mind-body exercise (3C5 sessions per week with moderate intensity lasting for 4C16 weeks) is recommended. Individualized protocols in the form of group exercise with supervision are effective at increasing adherence to treatment.","output":"The Effects and Mechanisms of Exercise on the Treatment of Depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common and serious nosocomial infection in mechanically ventilated patients, increasing mortality, prolonging the patient length of stay, and increasing costs.

Burn patients are physiologically immunocompromised, increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection in them. This study analyzes the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patient trends in a burn and plastic unit and assesses the effect of COVID-19 infection in burns. Methods This single-center, retrospective observational case-control study was conducted in the Department of Burns, Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery of a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India. Patient data was collected from April 1, 2019 to August 10, 2019 and from April 1, 2020 to August 10, 2020. All data of burns and trauma patients collected was analyzed and compared. Results There were total 350 admissions during COVID time period and 562 admissions during non-COVID time period. The admission rate, type of burn injury, and death rate did not vary significantly during the two time periods. Thermal burn was the most common type of burn injury. There were total 18 cases diagnosed to be COVID-19 positive during the pandemic. There were two deaths among COVID-19 positive burn cases. Conclusion This study finds no difference in patient patterns during COVID and non-COVID time period. Amongst burn patients, no increased risk of COVID-19 infection is seen with larger body surface area of burns. No increase in mortality is seen in burn patients infected with COVID-19. ? 2021 Hogrefe Verlag GmbH & Co. KG.

As revealed in crystal structures, most of these residues (e.g., 452 and 484 in RBDs) are not in direct contact with interfacial residues in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This suggests that albeit there are some possibly nonlocal effects, these mutations might not significantly affect RBDs binding with ACE2, which is an important step for viral entry into host cells. Thus, without knowing the molecular mechanism, these successful mutations (from the point of view of SARS-CoV-2) may be hypothesized to evade human antibodies. Using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, here, we show that the E484Q/L452R mutations significantly reduce the binding affinity between the RBD of the Kappa variant and the antibody LY-CoV555 (also named as Bamlanivimab), which was efficacious for neutralizing the wild-type SARS-CoV-2. To verify simulation results, we further carried out experiments with both pseudovirions- and live virus-based neutralization assays and demonstrated that LY-CoV555 completely lost neutralizing activity against the L452R/E484Q mutant. Similarly, we show that mutations in the Delta and Lambda variants can also destabilize the RBDs binding with LY-CoV555. With the revealed molecular mechanism on how these variants evade LY-CoV555, we expect that more specific therapeutic antibodies can be accordingly designed and/or a precise mixing of antibodies can be achieved as a cocktail treatment for patients infected with these variants.","output":"StructureCFunction Analysis of Resistance to Bamlanivimab by SARS-CoV-2 Variants Kappa, Delta, and Lambda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is a common and effective bariatric surgery, with low postoperative complication rates. It is important to define modifiable risk factors for complications. The possible association of Helicobacter pylori (HP) on SG outcomes is still being investigated. We aimed to examine HP prevalence in SG specimens, the association to early (30-day) complications, and impact of preoperative HP eradication on outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients who underwent SG between January 2012 and December 2020 in a single bariatric center. Data were retrieved from our prospectively maintained patient registry database. The 30-day outcomes were compared according to the HP status of the resected specimen: positive and negative, with or without preoperative HP eradication therapy. RESULTS There were 1985 patients; of them, 179 patients were HP positive and 1806 were HP negative in resected specimens. The overall early complication and major (Clavien-Dindo  3) complication rates were 8.6% and 3.2% (p = 0.48 and p = 0.21), respectively. A total of 111 patients were HP positive on preoperative endoscopic biopsy and received eradication therapy. All were HP negative on preoperative urea breath test, and 65.45% had HP negative resected specimens. HP eradication did not affect overall and major complications (p = 0.68 and p = 0.48, respectively). CONCLUSION The presence of HP does not seem to affect the early outcomes of SG. HP eradication does not change the early postoperative course either. Therefore, the role of routine preoperative HP screening may be limited, and eradication can be completed following SG.","output":"The Association of Helicobacter pylori, Eradication, and Early Complications of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Whether the use of dinoprostone pessary increased the vaginal delivery rate of labor induction in Chinese nulliparous women with term premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and unfavorable cervices?

Methods: We examined the impact of COVID-19 on household and child food security in three preexisting, longitudinal, Latinx urban cohorts in the San Francisco Bay Area (N=375 households, 1,875 individuals). Households were initially recruited during pregnancy and postpartum at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) and UCSF Benioff prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. For this COVID sub-study, participants responded to a 15-minute telephonic interview. Participants answered 18 questions from the US Food Security Food Module (US HFSSM), described food consumption, housing and employment status, and history of COVID-19 infection as per community or hospital-based testing. Food security and insecurity levels were compared with prior year metrics. Results: We found low levels of household food security in Latinx families (by cohort: 29.2%; 34.2%; 60.0%) and child food security (56.9%; 54.1%; 78.0%) with differences between cohorts explained by self-reported levels of education and employment status. Food security levels were much lower than those reported previously in two cohorts where data had been recorded from prior years. Reported history of COVID-19 infection in households was 4.8% (95% Confidence Interval (CI); 1.5-14.3%); 7.2% (95%CI; 3.6-13.9%) and 3.5% (95%CI; 1.7-7.2%) by cohort and was associated with food insecurity in the two larger cohorts (p=0.03; p=0.01 respectively). Conclusions: Latinx families in the Bay Area with children are experiencing a sharp rise in food insecurity levels during the COVID-19 epidemic. Food insecurity, similar to other indices of poverty, is associated with increased risk for COVID-19 infection. Comprehensive interventions are needed to address food insecurity in Latinx populations and further studies are needed to better assess independent associations between household food insecurity, poor nutritional health and risk of COVID-19 infection.","output":"High Food Insecurity in Latinx Families and Associated COVID-19 Infection in the Greater Bay Area, California"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer is emerging as a major public health concern for the entire globe According to the World Cancer Report, cancer is the world's second most common cause of death This poses a rapidly increasing threat worldwide to individuals, health systems and economies Cancer patients are more susceptible to critical illness and death as compared to the general infected population Various cohort studies were conducted in China between December 2019 to June 2020;it was inspected that among overall cancer patients admitted in hospital during the pandemic, 79% were Covid-19 Positive among which 39% died in ICU;whereas among all general population admitted to the same hospital 37% were Covid positive out of which 8% died It suggests that the cancer patients are at more risk due to Covid-19 pandemic outbreak In order to prevent 7 million cancer deaths over the next decade, countries must expedite their health care system In low-income and middle-income countries,during the next decade, the incidence of cancer is expected to almost double In 2018 India had about 1 16 million cancer cases, 784800 cancer deaths amongits population of 1 35 billion people Furthermore, the treatment cost for more than 40% of cancer hospitalization is made by selling the assets and borrowing from relatives;they incur out-of-pocket (OOPE) expenditure in the private sector and can cost more than 20 percent of their annual per capita household spending And over 76% of cancer patient families faced financial problems during treatment The main aim objective of the study was to understand the cancer scenario in India, its treatment cost implications and various treatment facilities and different funding assistance cum Health schemes implemented by central and state governments in India The data is collected from secondary sources and descriptive study was performed Therefore in conclusion we find that, we require effective prevention for surviving against cancer along with the proper awareness of the funding schemes by the government for the cancer patients and greater investment in the healthcare infrastructure needs proper attention","output":"Cancer Patient Care and its Medical Management in India: the Impact During Covid-19 and Government Funding Assistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) patients has become more controversial. Since the publication of the systematic review by Auprin et al. in 1999, no randomized controlled trials regarding PCI in LS-SCLC have been completed. The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyze the effect of PCI on overall survival (OS) in patients with LS-SCLC. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in the databases of MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase and the Cochrane library. Only studies that reported an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), indicating the effect of PCI versus no PCI on OS (adjusted for confounders) in patients with LS-SCLC were included for critical appraisal and meta-analysis. A pooled aHR estimate was calculated using a random-effects model. Results: Pooling of 28 retrospective studies including a total of 18,575 patients demonstrated a significant beneficial effect of PCI versus no PCI on OS with a pooled aHR of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.57-0.69). Substantial heterogeneity of reported aHRs among studies was observed (I2 = 65.9%). Subgroup analyses revealed that this heterogeneity could partly be explained by study sample size. The pooled aHR among 7 versus 21 studies with a sample size of > 300 versus  300 patients was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.64-0.97) versus 0.56 (95% CI: 0.46-0.69; p < 0.001), respectively. Conclusions: This meta-analysis demonstrates a significant beneficial effect of PCI on OS in patients with LS-SCLC. Larger studies reported a milder beneficial effect, possibly due to a decreased risk of model overfitting. Serious risk of selection and confounding bias were of concern due to the lack of prospective trials. These results support the role of PCI in standard clinical practice in patients with LS-SCLC while awaiting results of prospective trials on alternative strategies.","output":"The overall survival impact of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I present a behavioral epidemiological model of the evolution of the COVID epidemic in the United States and the United Kingdom over the past 12 months.

Insertion of a ureteric stent prior to staged lithotripsy is commonly performed in the public healthcare system. Foreign bodies in the urinary tract are also known to increase urinary tract infection (UTI) risk. This study aims to evaluate the association between stent dwell time and UTI prior to lithotripsy. METHODS The medical records of all patients who were treated for ureteric stones with initial stent insertion and staged lithotripsy, from 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2019 at a single tertiary centre, by eight urologists were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic features, disease factors and urine culture data were collected and analysed. RESULTS Of the 172 patients (median age 56.7 years) identified, one-third had a positive pre-stent urine culture. Twenty-three percent had a positive pre-lithotripsy urine culture with 38% of females compared with 15% of males having a positive culture (P = 0.001). Only 4.3% of patients had a pre-lithotripsy UTI when the stent dwell time was less than 1 month compared with 26.2% when ureteric stents were in situ for longer than 1 month (P = 0.021). The correlation between ureteric stent dwell time and pre-lithotripsy UTI was not linear. Patient comorbidities, stone size, burden and location were not statistically correlated to pre-lithotripsy UTI.

We therefore explored the perspectives of members of regional and international TB control and research networks to further understand TB service disruptions and compared the experiences of members from West African and European countries. METHODS: This cross-sectional, explorative descriptive study was conducted from May to July 2020 using an open online survey with target respondents from both West African and European countries. The survey comprised discrete questions exploring challenges faced with TB screening, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and changes implemented. Additionally, respondents were asked to provide recommendations for remedial actions. RESULTS: We analysed responses from 124 respondents based in 29 countries located in Europe and West Africa. About half of the respondents reported challenges in delivering routine TB services during the COVID-19 pandemic, with over one third reporting having some form of guidance issued regarding maintaining delivery of routine TB services. Respondents emphasised the need for strengthening TB services especially in light of COVID-19 pandemic. Considerable similarities were found between the challenges experienced by TB professionals in both West African and European settings.

However, their diagnostic efficiency, especially in real-life hospital setting, needs to be evaluated. Thus, the present study was conducted in a dedicated COVID-19 hospital in New Delhi, India, to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of a rapid antibody kit against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods Sixty COVID-19 confirmed cases by reverse transcriptaseCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were recruited and categorized as early, intermediate, and late cases based on the days passed after their first RT-PCRCpositive test report, with 20 subjects in each category. Twenty samples from pre-COVID era and 20 RT-PCRCnegative collected during the study period were taken as controls. immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the RBD of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus were detected by rapid antibody test and compared with the total antibody against the nucleocapsid (N) antigen of SARS-CoV-2 by electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassay (ECLIA). Results The detection of IgM against the RBD of the spike protein by rapid kit was less sensitive and less specific for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

COVID-19 patients showed a unique immune composition and an early, coordinated and elevated immune cell signaling profile, which correlated with early hospital discharge. Intra-patient time course analysis tied to clinically relevant events of recovery revealed a conserved set of immunological processes that accompany, and are unique to, disease resolution and discharge. This immunological process, together with additional changes in CD4 regulatory T cells and basophils, accompanies recovery from respiratory failure and is associated with better clinical outcomes at the time of admission.

Many universities turned to e-learning to provide educational continuity, but they now face the challenge of how to reopen safely and resume in-class learning. This is difficult to achieve without methods for measuring the impact of school policies on student physical interactions. Here, we show that selectively deploying e-learning for larger classes is highly effective at decreasing campus-wide opportunities for student-to-student contact, while allowing most in-class learning to continue uninterrupted. We conducted a natural experiment at a large university that implemented a series of e-learning interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak. The numbers and locations of 24,000 students on campus were measured over a 17-week period by analysing >24 million student connections to the university Wi-Fi network. We show that daily population size can be manipulated by e-learning in a targeted manner according to class size characteristics. Student mixing showed accelerated growth with population size according to a power law distribution. Therefore, a small e-learning dependent decrease in population size resulted in a large reduction in student clustering behaviour. Our results suggest that converting a small number of classes to e-learning can decrease potential for disease transmission while minimising disruption to university operations.

METHODS: We adopted a qualitative design using interviews, focus groups and observation to explore the perspectives of key stakeholders on the content of post-diagnostic dementia support. Purposive sampling was used to identify sites in England and Wales recognised as delivering good practice. Participants included 17 people with dementia, 31 carers, 68 service managers or funders, and 78 frontline staff. Interviews and focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. Forty-eight sessions of observation were completed and recorded in fieldnotes. Components were identified through an inductive, thematic approach and cross-checked against national guidelines and existing frameworks; they were subsequently critically reviewed by a range of experts and our mixed stakeholder panel. RESULTS: Twenty distinct components of post-diagnostic support were identified, related to five themes: timely identification and management of needs; understanding and managing dementia; emotional and psychological wellbeing; practical support; and integrating support. The first and last of these were cross-cutting themes facilitating the delivery of a unique constellation of components of post-diagnostic support to each individual living with dementia or dyad at a particular time.

Four indicators were chosen in describing the development and current situation of the public health system. Three of them were used to evaluate allocation equality. 31 provinces were categorized into western, middle, and eastern groups based on geographical and economic conditions. Total allocation equality, inter- and intra-difference were all measured by the Theil index. RESULTS: All indicators showed a stably upwards trend except for the number of public health institutions.

However, crop residues can also potentially stimulate emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) from soils. A better understanding of how to mitigate N2O emissions due to crop residue management while promoting positive effects on soil carbon is needed to reconcile the opposing effects of crop residues on the greenhouse gas balance of agroecosystems. Here, we combine a literature review and a meta-analysis to identify and assess measures for mitigating N2O emissions due to crop residue application to agricultural fields. Our study shows that crop residue removal, shallow incorporation, incorporation of residues with C:N ratio > 30 and avoiding incorporation of residues from crops terminated at an immature physiological stage, are measures leading to significantly lower N2O emissions. Other practices such as incorporation timing and interactions with fertilisers are less conclusive. Several of the evaluated N2O mitigation measures implied negative side-effects on yield, soil organic carbon storage, nitrate leaching and/or ammonia volatilization. We identified additional strategies with potential to reduce crop residue N2O emissions without strong negative side-effects, which require further research. These are: a) treatment of crop residues before field application, e.g., conversion of residues into biochar or anaerobic digestate, b) co-application with nitrification inhibitors or N-immobilizing materials such as compost with a high C:N ratio, paper waste or sawdust, and c) use of residues obtained from crop mixtures.

Niclosamide, a salicylamide derivative used in the treatment of tapeworm infections, targets the Wnt/-catenin pathway. The objective of this study was to investigate niclosamide as a therapeutic agent against CRC. METHODS The antiproliferative effects of 1, 3, 10, and 50 M concentrations of niclosamide on human (SW480 and SW620) and rodent (CC531) CRC cell lines were determined by MTS assay and direct cell count. The lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1/transcription factor (LEF/TCF) reporter assay monitored the activity of Wnt signaling. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated the expression pattern of active -catenin. Gene expression of canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling components was analyzed using qRT-PCR. Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies detecting nuclear localization of -catenin and c-jun. RESULTS Cell proliferation in CRC cell lines was blocked dose dependently after 12 and 24 h of incubation. The Wnt promoter activity of LEF/TCF significantly decreased with niclosamide concentrations of 10 and 50 M after 12 h of incubation. Active -catenin did not shift from the nuclear to the cytosolic pool. However, canonical target genes (met, MMP7, and cyclin D1) as well as the coactivating factor Bcl9 were downregulated, whereas the noncanonical key player c-jun was clearly activated. CONCLUSIONS Niclosamide treatment is associated with an inhibitory effect on CRC development and reduced Wnt activity. It may exert its effect by interfering with the nuclear -catenin-Bcl9-LEF/TCF triple-complex and by upregulation of c-jun representing noncanonical Wnt/JNK signaling.

METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study performed in the SantAndrea University Hospital of Rome. We included patients older than 65 years of age with a diagnosis of COVID-19, from March 2020 to May 2020, divided in two groups according to their age (Elderly: 65C80 years old; Very Elderly > 80 years old). Data extracted from the each patient record included age, sex, comorbidities, symptoms at onset, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) to the inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) (P/F) on admission, laboratory tests, radiological findings on computer tomography (CT), length of hospital stay (LOS), mortality rate and the viral shedding. The differences between the two groups were analyzed by the Fishers exact test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables.

RESULTS: We found that Very Elderly patients had an increased mortality rate, also due to the frequent occurrence of multiple comorbidities. Moreover, we found that patients coming from LSRCHs appeared to be highly susceptible and vulnerable to develop severe manifestations of the disease. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that there were considerable differences between Elderly and Very Elderly patients in terms of inflammatory activity, severity of disease, adverse clinical outcomes. To establish a correct risk stratification, comorbidities and information about provenience from LSRCHs should be considered.","output":"Age is not the only risk factor in COVID-19: the role of comorbidities and of long staying in residential care homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Hip fracture is a common condition of the older, frailer person. This population is also at risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is important to understand the impact of coexistent hip fracture and SARS-CoV-2 for informed decision-making at patient and service levels. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies of older (> 60 years) people with fragility hip fractures and outcomes with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was early (30-day or in-hospital) mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay and key clinical characteristics known to be associated with outcomes after hip fracture. RESULTS: A total of 14 cohort and five case series studies were included (692 SARS-CoV-2 positive, 2,585 SARS-CoV-2 negative). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an overall risk ratio (RR) for early mortality of 4.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.42 to 5.82). Early mortality was 34% (95% CI 30% to 38%) and 9% (95% CI 8% to 10%) in the infected and noninfected groups respectively. Length of stay was increased in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (mean difference (MD) 5.2 days (3.2 to 7.2)). Age (MD 1.6 years (0.3 to 2.9)); female sex (RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.05)); admission from home (RR 0.51 (95% CI 0.26 to 1.00)); presence of dementia (RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.43)); and intracapsular fracture (RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.11)) were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. There were statistically, but not clinically, significantly greater Nottingham Hip Fracture Scores in infected compared with non-infected patients (MD 0.7 (0.4 to 0.9)). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with worse outcomes after hip fracture. This is not explained by differences in patient characteristics. These data can be used to support informed decision-making and may help track the impact of widespread adoption of system-level and therapeutic changes in management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The use of electronic noses (ENs) for exhaled breath analysis has the potential to provide useful information for phenotyping different respiratory disorders and improving diagnosis, but their application in respiratory failure patients remains a challenge. We developed a novel measurement apparatus for analysing exhaled breath in such patients. Methods: The breath sampling apparatus uses hospital medical air and oxygen pipeline systems to control the fraction of inspired oxygen and prevent contamination of exhaled gas from ambient Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) It is designed to minimise the dead space and respiratory load imposed on patients. Breath odour fingerprints were assessed using a commercial EN with custom MOX sensors. We carried out a feasibility study on 33 SARS-CoV-2 patients (25 with respiratory failure and 8 asymptomatic) and 22 controls to gather data on tolerability and for a preliminary assessment of sensitivity and specificity. The most significant features for the discrimination between breath-odour fingerprints from respiratory failure patients and controls were identified using the Boruta algorithm and then implemented in the development of a support vector machine (SVM) classification model. Results: The novel sampling system was well-tolerated by all patients. The SVM differentiated between respiratory failure patients and controls with an accuracy of 0.81 (area under the ROC curve) and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.920 and 0.682, respectively. The selected features were significantly different in SARS-CoV-2 patients with respiratory failure versus controls and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients (p < 0.001 and 0.046, respectively).

The reduction of risk arising from the spread of pathogenic microorganisms in the hospital environment is a considerable challenge in the context of the proper functioning of the medical services sector. The financial costs of hospitals resulting from HAI are a serious problem for the Polish healthcare system. The spread of strains with a high level of drug resistance in individual hospitals is associated with the local epidemiological situation. In 2015-2017, there was a high increase in the number of infections caused by New Delhi strains. The highest increase due to this strain occurred in Mazowieckie and Podlasie provinces. The dynamics of infection caused by New Delhi strains throughout Poland in 2015-2016 indicated an increase of 278.7%. In 2017, the phenomenon of antibiotic abuse in all regions of Poland was 24% higher than the EU average. One of the reasons is the insufficient number of diagnostic tests ordered by both general practitioners and doctors representing hospital care. In 2016-2017, the average number of microbiological tests in diagnosing hospital infections performed annually within the entire territory of Poland was 50% lower than in European Union countries and the number recommended by WHO.

Early discussions suggested that CT should be the preferred modality for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, the use of CT for COVID-19 discharge is controversial. In the Fangcang hospital, we performed multiple nucleic acid tests and chest CT examinations in all patients. For discharged patients, we performed multiple nucleic acid tests and chest CT scans on the basis of discharge standards to minimize the incidence of false negatives in nucleic acid tests.

Recently, the detection of coronavirus (COVID-19) is a critical task for the medical practitioner. Unfortunately, COVID-19 spreads so quickly between people and approaches millions of people worldwide in few months. It is very much essential to quickly and accurately identify the infected people so that prevention of spread can be taken. Although several medical tests have been used to detect certain injuries, the hopefully detection efficiency has not been accomplished yet. In this paper, a new Hybrid Diagnose Strategy (HDS) has been introduced. HDS relies on a novel technique for ranking selected features by projecting them into a proposed Patient Space (PS). A Feature Connectivity Graph (FCG) is constructed which indicates both the weight of each feature as well as the binding degree to other features. The rank of a feature is determined based on two factors; the first is the feature weight, while the second is its binding degree to its neighbors in PS. Then, the ranked features are used to derive the classification model that can classify new persons to decide whether they are infected or not. The classification model is a hybrid model that consists of two classifiers; fuzzy inference engine and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The proposed HDS has been compared against recent techniques. Experimental results have shown that the proposed HDS outperforms the other competitors in terms of the average value of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure in which it provides about of 97.658%, 96.756%, 96.55%, and 96.615% respectively.

Despite this achievement, detection of new cases occurs every year among all age groups including children. Detection of new cases in children reveals persistent transmission of the infection. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and epidemiological features of leprosy in individuals younger than 15 years (childhood leprosy) reported to the Cuban National Leprosy Control Program (NLCP) between 2012 and 2019. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective descriptive study between 2012 and 2019 to assess the clinical and epidemiologic features of individuals under the age of 15 years with a confirmed diagnosis of leprosy reported to the NLCP. We reviewed the NLCP database and collected data to better define the total number of cases of leprosy in adults, children (younger than 15 years). We assessed socio-demographic variables (age, gender, and province of residence) as well as variables of clinical interest including operational classification and staging at diagnosis, bacillary index, grade of disability by WHO staging. Additionally, we evaluated epidemiological variables including passive versus active surveillance of cases, contact investigation focusing specifically in household transmission, and the degree of kinship as well as standing of the child within the focus of transmission when there were additional cases. RESULTS: We identified fifty children during the study period corresponding to 3% of the overall cases of leprosy comprising all age groups in Cuba. In the age group younger than 15 years, the majorities of cases was from the Granma province and most were between the ages of 10 and 14 years. Clinically, multibacillary/lepromatous forms were the most common type identified with positive bacillary index. The majority of children diagnosed with leprosy during our study period had a history of a relative with a confirmed diagnosis of leprosy. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of cases of leprosy in individuals younger than 15 years of age in Cuba demonstrates ongoing transmission of M. leprae in specific geographic hotspots. Its frequency in the early adolescence, the predominant clinical forms, and the mode of detection associated with sources of suspected familiar infection demonstrated that there is a need for further efforts by the NLCP to conduct active surveillance activities among affected communities to identify cases of leprosy earlier with the goal of preventing further household and community transmission.","output":"Leprosy in children in Cuba: Epidemiological and clinical description of 50 cases from 2012C2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed the delivery of breast cancer care. The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of the pandemic on breast cancer screening, treatment, and reconstruction at a single institution in New York City. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted to determine the number of mammograms, lumpectomies, mastectomies, and breast reconstruction operations performed between January 1, 2019 through June 30, 2021. Outcomes analyzed included changes in mammography, oncologic surgery, and breast reconstruction surgery volume before, during and after the start of the pandemic. RESULTS: Mammography volume declined by 11% in March-May of 2020. Oncologic breast surgeries and reconstructive surgeries similarly declined by 6.8% and 11%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019, reaching their lowest levels in April 2020. The volume of all procedures increased during the summer of 2020. Mammography volume in June and July 2020 were found to be at pre-COVID levels, and in October-December 2020 were 15% higher than in 2019. Oncologic breast surgeries saw a similar rebound in May 2020, with 24.6% more cases performed compared to May 2019. Breast reconstruction volumes increased, though changes in the types of reconstruction were noted. Oncoplastic closures were more common during the pandemic, while two-stage implant reconstruction and immediate autologous reconstruction decreased by 27% and 43% respectively.

This asymptomatic class is categorized into two subclasses: detected and undetected asymptomatic individuals. Furthermore, the model considers the limitations of medical resources to treat an infected individual in a hospital. The model shows two types of equilibrium point: COVID-19 free and COVID-19 endemic. The COVID-19-free equilibrium point is locally and asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is less than unity. In contrast, COVID-19-endemic equilibrium always exists when [Formula: see text].

We examined how attitudes, perceived community behaviors, and prior related behaviors predict intentions to (1) receive COVID-19 vaccination and (2) practice social distancing. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey administered through Amazons Mechanical Turk in September 2020. SUBJECTS: A convenience sample of US adults (N = 1804). MEASURES: COVID-19 vaccination and social distancing intentions were measured on a 7-point Likert scale. Predictor variables included general vaccination and social distancing attitudes, perceived community mask-wearing, prior influenza vaccination, prior social distancing, and socio-demographics. ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics and linear regressions. RESULTS: Thirty percent of respondents reported a strong willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination, while 67% strongly intended to engage in social distancing. In regression analyses, vaccination intention was predicted by positive vaccine attitudes (b = .84; 95%CI: .78, .90; P < .001), prior influenza vaccination (b = ?.47; 95%CI: ?.63, ?.32; P < .001), and perceived community mask-wearing (b = ?.28; 95%CI: ?.56, ?.01; P=.049). Intention to practice social distancing was predicted by positive attitudes (b = .65; 95%CI: .61, .69; P < .001), prior social distancing (b = ?.49; 95%CI: ?.59, ?.39; P < .001), and perceived community mask-wearing (b = ?.28; 95%CI: ?.46, ?.09; P = .003). CONCLUSION: Findings have implications for health promotion efforts. Messages that are targeted and tailored on pre-existing attitudes may be more effective.

First detected in October 2020, it has now spread to more than 100 countries, prompting WHO to declare it as a global variant of concern (VOC). The Delta (B.1.617.2), Delta plus (B.1.617.2.1) and Kappa (B.1.617.1) variants are all sub-lineages of the original B.1.617 variant. Prior to the inception of B.1.617, vaccine rollout, safe-distancing and timely lockdowns greatly reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. However, the Delta variant, allegedly more infectious and for which existing vaccines seemed less effective, has catalyzed the resurgence of cases. Therefore, there is an imperative need for increased surveillance of the B.1.617 variants. While the Beta variant is increasingly outpaced by the Delta variant, the spread of the Beta variant remains of concern due to its vaccine resistance. Efforts have been made to utilize wastewater-based surveillance for community-based tracking of SARS-CoV-2 variants, however wastewater with its low SARS-CoV-2 viral titers and mixtures of viral variants, requires assays to be variant-specific yet accurately quantitative for meaningful interpretation. Following on the design principles of our previous assays for the Alpha variant, here we report allele-specific and multiplex-compatible RT-qPCR assays targeting mutations T19R, D80A, K417N, T478K and E484Q, for quantitative detection and discrimination of the Delta, Delta plus, Kappa and Beta variants in wastewater. This method is open-sourced and can be implemented using commercially available RT-qPCR protocols, and would be an important tool for tracking the spread of B.1.617 and the Beta variants in communities.","output":"Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 tracking of variants Delta, Delta plus, Kappa and Beta in wastewater by allele-specific RT-qPCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU) are a high-risk population for sepsis, recognized as a major cause of admission and death. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and prognostication of monocyte distribution width (MDW) in sepsis for patients admitted to ICU. METHODS Between January and June 2020, we conducted a prospective observational study during the hospitalization of 506 adult patients admitted to the ICU. MDW was evaluated in 2,367 consecutive samples received for routine complete blood counts (CBC) performed once a day and every day during the study. Sepsis was diagnosed according to Sepsis-3 criteria and patients enrolled were classified in the following groups: no sepsis, sepsis and septic shock. RESULTS MDW values were significantly higher in patients with sepsis or septic shock in comparison to those within the no sepsis group [median 26.23 (IQR: 23.48-29.83); 28.97 (IQR: 21.27-37.21); 21.99 (IQR: 19.86-24.36) respectively]. ROC analysis demonstrated that AUC is 0.785 with a sensitivity of 66.88% and specificity of 77.79% at a cut-off point of 24.63. In patients that developed an ICU-acquired sepsis MDW showed an increase from 21.33 [median (IQR: 19.47-21.72)] to 29.19 [median (IQR: 27.46-31.47)]. MDW increase is not affected by the aetiology of sepsis, even in patients with COVID-19. In sepsis survivors a decrease of MDW values were found from the first time to the end of their stay [median from 29.14 (IQR: 26.22-32.52) to 25.67 (IQR: 22.93-30.28)].

This study is based on a telephone survey with a subsample of 168 respondents in Umea municipality who participated in a large base-line social capital survey in 2006. We asked whether neighbors talk to, care for, and help each other, before and during the Covid crisis. Individuals rated their health as poor or good. We compared people's self-rated health and their perceptions about their neighborhoods between those who lived in high or low/medium social capital neighborhoods. Before the pandemic, participants in high social capital neighborhoods reported more active neighborhood interaction and support. During the crisis, social interaction and support increased in all neighborhoods, but more in high social capital neighborhoods. Overall, people seemed to help and care for each other more during than before the crisis. More individuals in the high social capital neighborhoods reported improvement in their health during the pandemic, than those in the low/medium social capital neighborhoods. Our findings indicate that neighborhoods social capital can be strengthened during a crisis, in particular in areas with existing high levels of social capital.

Consequently, it has also become a key testing ground for systems that monitor and identify outbreaks of disease. Here, we describe a new technology that automatically collects body temperatures during triage. The technology was tested in an ED as an approach to monitoring diseases that cause fever, such as seasonal flu and some pandemics. METHODS: Temporal artery thermometers that log temperature measurements were placed in a Boston ED and used for initial triage vital signs. Time-stamped measurements were collected from the thermometers to investigate the performance a real-time system would offer. The data were summarized in terms of rates of fever (temperatures 100.4 F [38.0 C]) and were qualitatively compared with regional disease surveillance programs in Massachusetts. RESULTS: From September 2009 through August 2011, 71,865 body temperatures were collected and included in our analysis, 2073 (2.6 %) of which were fevers. The period of study included the autumnCwinter wave of the 2009C2010 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic, during which the weekly incidence of fever reached a maximum of 5.6 %, as well as the 2010C2011 seasonal flu outbreak, during which the maximum weekly incidence of fever was 6.6 %. The periods of peak fever rates corresponded with the periods of regionally elevated flu activity. CONCLUSIONS: Temperature measurements were monitored at triage in the ED over a period of 2 years. The resulting data showed promise as a potential surveillance tool for febrile disease that could complement current disease surveillance systems. Because temperature can easily be measured by non-experts, it might also be suitable for monitoring febrile disease activity in schools, workplaces, and transportation hubs, where many traditional syndromic indicators are impractical. However, the systems validity and generalizability should be evaluated in additional years and settings.

METHODS: We collected data from 400 toilet facilities that were open to the public: all those in three contiguous city council territories (228) and a further convenience sample of 172 around other parts of New Zealand. Comparisons were made with the data on the same facilities included in a 2012/2013 survey. RESULTS: Of the toilets in this survey, 2.5% had no water for handwashing and 14.8% had no soap. There was COVID-19-related health messaging signage in 19.5% of toilets, with posters of the COVID-19 QR code used for contact tracing in 12.3%, and generic handwashing signage in 1.8%. The handwashing water had 'no-touch' activation at 28.0% of toilets, and 18.5% of toilets had no-touch bowl flushing. Toilet bowl lids were not present at 32.8%, and 2.3% of toilets had damage that would impair their functionality (eg, broken toilet seats).

A pandemic paradox emerged;while clinicians were desperate for information on a new disease, they had less time to find and evaluate the vast volume of publications at times of significant strain on healthcare systems. A multidisciplinary team undertook a weekly literature search capturing all COVID-19 publications. We also monitored free open access medical education (FOAMed) sources for emerging themes. Title and abstract screening pooled the most relevant papers for emergency medicine. Three summary types were created, a a Top 5 Flash Update', a journal club and a rapid response to emerging FOAMed themes. From these summaries, three modes of dissemination were used: short written summaries, blogs and podcasts. These were amplified through social media. Study design: A retrospective review was conducted assessing the impact of this knowledge dissemination strategy for the period of March to September 2020. Results: In total, 64 687 papers were identified and screened. Of the papers included in the a Top 5', 28.3% were on epidemiology, 23.6% treatment, 16.7% diagnostics, 12% prognosis, 8.7% pathophysiology with the remaining 10.7% consisting of PPE, public health, well-being and a other'. We published 37 blogs, 17 podcasts and 18 Top 5 Flash Updates. The blogs were read 138 343 times, the Top 5 Flash Updates 68 610 times and the podcasts had 72 501 listens.

Few randomized trials have compared disease-free survival outcomes for surgical approaches. Objective To investigate whether total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) is equivalent to total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) in women with treatment-naive endometrial cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants The Laparoscopic Approach to Cancer of the Endometrium (LACE) trial was a multinational, randomized equivalence trial conducted between October 7, 2005, and June 30, 2010, in which 27 surgeons from 20 tertiary gynecological cancer centers in Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong randomized 760 women with stage I endometrioid endometrial cancer to either TLH or TAH. Follow-up ended on March 3, 2016. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to undergo TAH (n = 353) or TLH (n = 407). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was disease-free survival, which was measured as the interval between surgery and the date of first recurrence, including disease progression or the development of a new primary cancer or death assessed at 4.5 years after randomization. The prespecified equivalence margin was 7% or less. Secondary outcomes included recurrence of endometrial cancer and overall survival. Results Patients were followed up for a median of 4.5 years. Of 760 patients who were randomized (mean age, 63 years), 679 (89%) completed the trial. At 4.5 years of follow-up, disease-free survival was 81.3% in the TAH group and 81.6% in the TLH group. The disease-free survival rate difference was 0.3% (favoring TLH; 95% CI, -5.5% to 6.1%; P = .007), meeting criteria for equivalence. There was no statistically significant between-group difference in recurrence of endometrial cancer (28/353 in TAH group [7.9%] vs 33/407 in TLH group [8.1%]; risk difference, 0.2% [95% CI, -3.7% to 4.0%]; P = .93) or in overall survival (24/353 in TAH group [6.8%] vs 30/407 in TLH group [7.4%]; risk difference, 0.6% [95% CI, -3.0% to 4.2%]; P = .76). Conclusions and Relevance Among women with stage I endometrial cancer, the use of total abdominal hysterectomy compared with total laparoscopic hysterectomy resulted in equivalent disease-free survival at 4.5 years and no difference in overall survival.

What has largely been neglected so far are the consequences of secret-sharing for the relationship between sharer and receiver. In this project, we aim to fill this gap.

Building on research from the self-disclosure and relationship literature, we experimentally investigate whether secret-sharing might in turn increase perceptions of closeness. In addition, we test the valence of the secrets shared as potential driver of the hypothesized effect, as negative secrets might signal a high level of trust, but might also present a burden to the receiver. To provide a holistic picture, we build on a variety of methods to investigate three perspectives: Study 1 focuses on the receiver and tests whether another person sharing secrets (vs. nonconfidential information) decreases distance in the eyes of the receiver. Study 2 investigates lay theories and tests how an observer perceives the relationship between two people who share secrets (vs. nonconfidential information). Study 3 tests whether these lay theories about sharing secrets are predictive of behavior, and how a sharer might choose secrets of negative or positive valence to decrease perceived distance on the receivers side.

In this context, we propose a network of drones that are able to fly on a map covered by regular polygons, with a well-established mobility schedule, to carry and transfer data. Two means exist to equidistantly cover an area with points, namely, grouping the points into equilateral triangles or squares. In this study, a network of drones that fly in an aerial area divided into squares was proposed and investigated. This network was compared with the case in which the area is divided into equilateral triangles. The cost of the square drone network was lower than that of the triangular network with the same cell length, but the efficiency factors were better for the latter. Two situations related to increasing the drone autonomy using drone charging or battery changing stations were analyzed.

Here, we developed a calibration study to directly examine how researcher trap choice affects observations made in insect biodiversity sampling. Sampling efficiency of four types of traps: pitfalls, yellow ramp traps, a novel jar ramp trap, and yellow sticky cards, were compared with respect to an array of biodiversity metrics associated with the arthropods they captured. We found that trapping efficiency and functional groups of arthropods (flying versus ground-crawling) varied by trap type. Pitfalls and jar ramp traps performed similarly for all biodiversity metrics measured, suggesting that jar ramp traps provide a more comparable measurement of ground-crawling arthropod communities to pitfall sampling than the yellow ramp traps and should be considered when pitfall sampling cannot be used. This study illustrates the implications for biodiversity sampling of arthropods in environments with physical constraints on trapping, and the importance of directly comparing adapted methods to established sampling protocol.

Fortunately, the field is in a healthy transition from excessive reliance on animal models to a broader understanding of the disease in humans, which will likely lead to many improved treatments especially of the neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS).","output":"The Neuroimmunology of Multiple Sclerosis: Fictions and Facts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Increasing resistance to antibiotics of Pseudomonas aeruginosa leads to therapeutic deadlock and alternative therapies are needed. We aimed to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus clinical isolates in vivo, through intranasal administration on a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. RESULTS: We screened in vitro 50 pulmonary clinical isolates of Lactobacillus for their ability to decrease the synthesis of two QS dependent-virulence factors (elastase and pyocyanin) produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1. Two blends of three Lactobacillus isolates were then tested in vivo: one with highly effective anti-PAO1 virulence factors properties (blend named L.rff for L. rhamnosus, two L. fermentum strains), and the second with no properties (blend named L.psb, for L. paracasei, L. salivarius and L. brevis). Each blend was administered intranasally to mice 18 h prior to PAO1 pulmonary infection. Animal survival, bacterial loads, cytological analysis, and cytokines secretion in the lungs were evaluated at 6 or 24 h post infection with PAO1. Intranasal priming with both lactobacilli blends significantly improved 7-day mice survival from 12% for the control PAO1 group to 71 and 100% for the two groups receiving L.rff and L.psb respectively. No mortality was observed for both control groups receiving either L.rff or L.psb. Additionally, the PAO1 lung clearance was significantly enhanced at 24 h. A 2-log and 4-log reduction was observed in the L.rff + PAO1 and L.psb + PAO1 groups respectively, compared to the control PAO1 group. Significant reductions in neutrophil recruitment and proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion were observed after lactobacilli administration compared to saline solution, whereas IL-10 production was increased. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that intranasal priming with lactobacilli acts as a prophylaxis, and avoids fatal complications caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia in mice. These results were independent of in vitro anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa activity on QS-dependent virulence factors. Further experiments are required to identify the immune mechanism before initiating clinical trials.

This study explores coresident networks within an AL community and identifies factors associated with residents social ties. METHODS: Acquaintance and companionship networks within the community are described using cross-sectional survey data (N = 38). We use inferential network statistical methods to estimate parameters for factors associated with residents acquaintance and companionship ties. RESULTS: Residents reported an average of 10 acquaintances and almost 4 companionships with other residents in the sample. The likelihood a resident had an acquaintance was associated with higher levels of cognitive functioning (p < .05), higher levels of physical limitations (p < .01), living in the AL community for a longer time (p < .01), and less frequent contact with outside family and friends (p < .05). Acquaintances were more likely between residents who moved in around the same time as each other (p < .01), lived on the same floor (p < .001), or had similar levels of physical limitations (p < .05). Companionships were more likely to be reported by male residents (p < .05) and residents with higher levels of cognitive functioning (p < .05) or depressive symptoms (p < .05). Longtime residents were more popular as companions (p < .01). Companionships were more likely between residents who lived on the same floor (p < .001) or were similar in age (p < .01).

However, social connection has distinct considerations for people living in long-term care (LTC) homes. The objective of this scoping review was to summarize research literature linking social connection to mental health outcomes, specifically among LTC residents, as well as research to identify strategies to help build and maintain social connection in this population during COVID-19. DESIGN Scoping review. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS Residents of LTC homes, care homes, and nursing homes. METHODS We searched MEDLINE(R) ALL (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus, Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest), Embase and Embase Classic (Ovid), Emcare Nursing (Ovid), and AgeLine (EBSCO) for research that quantified an aspect of social connection among LTC residents; we limited searches to English-language articles published from database inception to search date (July 2019). For the current analysis, we included studies that reported (1) the association between social connection and a mental health outcome, (2) the association between a modifiable risk factor and social connection, or (3) intervention studies with social connection as an outcome. From studies in (2) and (3), we identified strategies that could be implemented and adapted by LTC residents, families and staff during COVID-19 and included the articles that informed these strategies. RESULTS We included 133 studies in our review. We found 61 studies that tested the association between social connection and a mental health outcome. We highlighted 12 strategies, informed by 72 observational and intervention studies, that might help LTC residents, families, and staff build and maintain social connection for LTC residents. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Published research conducted among LTC residents has linked good social connection to better mental health outcomes. Observational and intervention studies provide some evidence on approaches to address social connection in this population. Although further research is needed, it does not obviate the need to act given the sudden and severe impact of COVID-19 on social connection in LTC residents.","output":"Social Connection in Long-Term Care Homes: A Scoping Review of Published Research on the Mental Health Impacts and Potential Strategies During COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent national and international guidance from rheumatology societies have reflected the advances in evidence for both the investigation and management of giant cell arteritis.

However, the precise role of P2X7R and its effect on NLRP3 remains largely underdetermined.

We found that T. spiralis infection upregulated expression of P2X7R and activation of NLRP3 in macrophages in mice. In vivo, P2X7R deficiency resulted in increased intestinal adult and muscle larval burdens, along with decreased expression of NLRP3/interleukin-1 (IL-1) in macrophages from the infected mice with T. spiralis. In In vitro experiments, P2X7R blockade inhibited activation of NLRP3/IL-1 via NF-B and thus reduced the capacity of macrophages to kill newborn larvae of T. spiralis.

METHODS: We develop a simulated decision analytical model based on a hypothetical cohort of RRMS patients to compare a baseline decision-making strategy in which only clinical evolution (relapses and disability progression) factors are used for therapy decisions in MS follow-up, with decision-making strategies involving MRI. In this context, we include comparisons with a visual radiologic assessment of lesion evolution, software-assisted lesion detection, and software-assisted brain volume loss estimation. The model simulates clinical (EDSS transitions, number of relapses) and subclinical (new lesions and brain volume loss) disease progression and activity, modulated by the efficacy profiles of different disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The simulated decision-making process includes the possibility to escalate from a low efficacy DMT to a high efficacy DMT or to switch between high efficacy DMTs when disease activity is detected. We also consider potential error factors that may occur during decision making, such as incomplete detection of new lesions, or inexact computation of brain volume loss. Finally, differences between strategies in terms of the time spent on treatment while having undetected disease progression/activity, the impact on the patient's quality of life, and costs associated with health status from a US perspective, are reported. RESULTS: The average time with undetected disease progression while on low efficacy treatment is shortened significantly when using MRI, from around 3 years based on clinical criteria alone, to 2 when adding visual examination of MRI, and down to only 1 year with assistive software. Hence, faster escalation to a high efficacy DMT can be performed when MRI software is added to the radiological reading, which has positive effects in terms of health outcomes. The incremental utility shows average gains of 0.23 to 0.37 QALYs over 10 and 15 years, respectively, when using software-assisted MRI compared to clinical parameters only. Due to long-term health benefits, the average annual costs associated with health status are lower by $1500-$2200 per patient when employing MRI and assistive software. CONCLUSIONS: The health economic burden of MS is high. Using assistive MRI software to detect and quantify lesions and/or brain atrophy has a significant impact on the detection of disease activity, treatment decisions, health outcomes, utilities, and costs in patients with MS.","output":"Health Economic Impact of Software-Assisted Brain MRI on Therapeutic Decision-Making and Outcomes of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Patients-A Microsimulation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BVA Welsh Branch hosted a suite of important meetings between 22 and 24 June, promoting and protecting the roles of vets in Wales, writes Megan Knowles-Bacon, BVA policy officer and BVA Welsh Branch secretariat","output":"Promoting and protecting Welsh vets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Introduccin: La pandemia por la COVID-19 ha causado ms 350 000 muertes a nivel mundial.

Immunizations are not required, leaving refugees at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. In response, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of State developed and co-funded a global immunization program for US-bound refugees, implemented in 2012 in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration. METHODS We describe the Vaccination Program for US-bound Refugees, including vaccination schedule development, program implementation and procedures, and responses to challenges. We estimate 2019 immunization coverage rates using the number of age-eligible refugees who received 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine during overseas health assessment, and calculated hepatitis B infection prevalence using hepatitis B surface antigen testing results. We report descriptive data on adverse events following immunization. RESULTS By September 2019, the program was active in >80 countries on five continents. Nearly 320,000 examined refugees had 1 documented vaccine doses since program inception. During federal fiscal year 2019, 95% of arriving refugees had 1 documented measles-containing vaccine. The program's immunization schedule included eleven vaccines preventing fourteen diseases. In 2015-2019, only two vaccine preventable disease-associated refugee group travel cancellations occurred, compared to 2-8 cancellations annually prior to program initiation. To maintain uniform standards, dedicated staff and program-specific protocols for vaccination and monitoring were introduced. CONCLUSIONS An overseas immunization program was successfully implemented for US-bound refugees.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: All consecutive patients with covid-19 who were treated during the months of March and April 2020 at our institution were included. All patients were symptomatic and the thrombotic event objectively confirmed. Patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial thrombosis (PAT) were included. Survival curves for all groups were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier with log rank test, and Cox regression. RESULTS: During the pandemic period from March-1 to April-30, 2943 patients were treated with confirmed covid-19 in our center. Of them, 106 patients showed some symptomatic vascular thrombosis: 13 patients had PAT, 15 ischemic stroke, 20 DVT and 58 PE. Another 11 patients presented multiple vascular thrombosis. Although the mean age was 65 years, there were differences between groups being older those patients with arterial thrombosis. A 67.92% were men. In total, 25 patients died during their hospital admission (23.58%), with differences between groups, being more common in patients with PAT (9 patients out of 13) and ischemic stroke (8 patients out of 15), than in those with DVT (1 patient out of 20) or PE (7 patients out of 58). CONCLUSIONS: The venous thromboembolic risk in these patients is greater than the arterial, but arterial thrombosis when it occurs was associated with high mortality rates.

Diagnostic and treatment paradigms have been challenged with an urgent need for patient protection. In the abscence of data to balance clinical decissions we aimed to analyze HUIS experience during the peak of the outbreak. Method(s): Cancer pts atended at HUIS since February 24th to April 24th were collected. Clinical management was adapted according to evolving international consensus. All PCR+ COVID-19 pts have been included in a database. Oncological and COVID-19 diseases characteristics as well as cancer management have been collected. The main objective of this analysis was to know the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization rate and mortality of cancer patientes in our center during the outbreak and to identify potential predictive factors. Result(s): Overall, 853 cancer pts had been attended at our department during this period of time. Twenty-six pts (3.05%) were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Underlying solid tumors were the following: breast (256, 30.01%), GI (312, 36.8%), lung (100, 11.72%) and others (185, 21.47%). 322 pts (37.75%) had metastatic cancer and 531 (62.25%) had early stage diseases. 395 pts (46.31%) were treated with antineoplastic agents: 62,63% received treatment as adjuvant therapy, 18. 92% as first line (or maintenance) treatment in advanced diseases and 12.81% second or following lines of treatment in advaced diseases. 10 pts (32.26%) with COVID-19 died.

This review examines the strategies used to confer abuse-deterrent properties on opioid abuse-deterrent formulations (ADFs), the characteristics and supporting data for each of the available ADFs, and the role of opioid ADFs as part of a comprehensive opioid risk management plan. METHODS A PubMed search was performed for articles published within the last 10 years using the search terms \\"abuse deterrent opioids\\". Articles were limited to clinical studies and reviews focusing on United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved opioid ADFs in the US. RESULTS There are currently nine extended-release and one immediate-release opioid pain medications with US FDA-approved ADF labelling. All use either physical and chemical barriers or agonist/antagonist combinations to deter manipulation and abuse. Evidence is mounting that introduction of opioid ADFs has been associated with decreased rates of abuse and diversion of opioids in the US. CONCLUSIONS Although not sufficient by themselves to prevent prescription opioid abuse and misuse, opioid ADFs are an important component of a healthcare provider's comprehensive opioid risk management plan (along with utilization of prescription drug monitoring programs, clinical assessment tools, urine tests, co-prescribing of naloxone to patients at risk of an overdose, access to non-pharmacological treatments and addiction/mental health resources, among others).

LPN can be particularly challenging for more complex tumors. OBJECTIVE To compare the perioperative outcomes of patients undergoing LPN or RPN for a single renal mass of moderate or high complexity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective analysis was performed for 381 consecutive patients who underwent either LPN (n = 182) or RPN (n = 199) between 2005 and 2011 for a complex renal mass (RENAL score  7). Perioperative outcomes were compared. Predictors of postoperative renal function were assessed using multivariable linear regression analysis. INTERVENTION LPN or RPN. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Perioperative outcomes were compared. Predictors of postoperative renal function were assessed using multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to patient age, gender, side, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), or tumor size. Patients undergoing LPN had a slightly lower body mass index (29.2 kg/m(2) compared with 30.7 kg/m(2), p = 0.02) and preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (81.1 compared with 86.0 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), p = 0.02). LPN was associated with an increased rate of conversion to radical nephrectomy (RN) (11.5% compared with 1%, p<0.001) and a higher decrease in percentage of eGFR (-16.0% compared with -12.6%, p = 0.03). There were no significant differences with respect to warm ischemia time (WIT), estimated blood loss, transfusion rate, or postoperative complications. WIT, preoperative eGFR, and CCI were found to be predictors of postoperative eGFR in multivariable analysis. No difference in perioperative outcomes was found between moderate and high RENAL score subgroups. The retrospective study design was the main limitation of this study. CONCLUSIONS RPN provides functional outcomes comparable to those of LPN for moderate- to high-complexity tumors, but with a significantly lower risk of conversion to RN. This situation is likely because of the technical advantages offered by the articulated robotic instruments. A prospective randomized study is needed to confirm these findings.","output":"Robotic versus laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for complex tumors: comparison of perioperative outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study examined the validity of the coronaphobia phenomenon with healthcare professionals using a psychometric approach.

All communities could detect sick individuals. There were group differences in performance but Western participants, who observed faces from their own community, were not systematically better than all non-Western participants. At odds with the common belief that sickness detection of an out-group member should be biased to err on the side of caution, the majority of non-Western communities were unbiased.

These measures included the closures of schools, hence, putting parents into the position of juggling school and work from home. In the present study, we investigated the well-being of parents with school-aged children and its connection to mitigation measures with particular focus on parental roles caregiver, worker, and assistant teacher as stressors. In addition to direct effects, we expected indirect effects on well-being through changes in household dynamics. Data were collected via an online survey (N = 1313, 85.5% female; 53.2% university degree) conducted during the first wave of school closures in Germany. We observed that during the early COVID-19 pandemic, parental well-being in general was quite positive. Comparing the positive and negative PANAS subscales, parents agreed significantly more with the positive than with the negative items, t(1299) = 28.55, p < 0.001. Parents also reported an increase in positive family activities during the lockdown, t(1272) = 43.96, p < 0.001. Although a significant increase in negative household dynamics, such as disputes, was also observed to a lower extent, t(1295) = 7.78, p < 0.001. Using structural equation modeling, we observed that homeoffice was not significantly related to parents well-being, but positively affected household dynamics. Taking on the role of assistant teacher was negatively related to household dynamics. Additionally, we found a significant direct effect on negative affect for assistant teacher. We conclude that parents of school-aged children have mostly been able to establish positive dynamics in their households during the lockdown given the extra time they got to spend with their children by working from home. However, our results identify the role of assistant teacher as a potential stressor for parents. Bridging the gap between teachers and parents seems warranted especially if (some) distance-learning continues, in order to avoid long-term consequences for the students.","output":"Juggling School and Work From Home: Results From a Survey on German Families With School-Aged Children During the Early COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that predominantly affects impoverished rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether there is a difference in the frequency of coronavirus disease 2019 in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients and to contribute to the process of deciding on the type of dialysis in patients who will start dialysis treatment. Methods: We included patients who had at least 3 months of dialysis treatment between March 11, 2020, and November 30, 2020. Demographic characteristics and comorbidities were recorded. Results: In our study, 130 dialysis patients, 75 of whom were male, were evaluated. The mean age of the patients on dialysis was 54.8 +/- 14.7 years. Twenty-eight (22%) of 130 dialysis patients were peritoneal dialysis patients. The mean age of peritoneal dialysis patients was 54.1 +/- 14 years. A total of 102 (78%) patients were hemodialysis patients. The mean age of hemodialysis patients was 54.9 +/- 14.9 years. The most common accompanying disease in all patients was hypertension (62%). Among the patients who received dialysis treatment in our center, the number of patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 was 16 (12%). Coronavirus disease 2019 was detected in 16% (16/102) of hemodialysis patients, whereas it was not detected in peritoneal dialysis patients (P =.002).

However, it is not clear whether higher temperature may offset the transmission risk posed by this relaxation. This study aims to investigate the associations of the effective reproductive number (Rt) of Covid-19 with ambient temperature and the implementation of physical distancing interventions in the United States (US). This study included 50 states and one territory of the US with 4,532,650 confirmed cases between 29 January and 31 July 2020. We used an interrupted time-series model with a state-level random intercept for data analysis. An interaction term of 'physical distancingtemperature' was included to examine their interactions. Stratified analyses by temperature and physical distancing implementation were also performed to analyse the modifying effects. The overall median (interquartile range) Rt was 1.2 (1.0-2.3). The implementation of physical distancing was associated with a 12% decrease in the risk of Rt (relative risk [RR]: 0.88, 95% confident interval [CI]: 0.86-0.89), and each 5 C increase in temperature was associated with a 2% decrease (RR: 0.98, 95%CI: 0.97-0.98). We observed a statistically significant interaction between temperature and physical distancing implementation, but all the RRs were small (close to one). The containing effects of high temperature were attenuated by 5.1% when physical distancing was implemented. The association of COVID-19 Rt with physical distancing implementation was more stable (0.88 vs. 0.89 in days when temperature was low and high, respectively). Increased temperature did not offset the risk of Covid-19 Rt posed by the relaxation of physical distancing implementation.

We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis, stage and initial treatment of breast cancer. METHODS: Women included in the Netherlands Cancer Registry and diagnosed during four periods in weeks 2C17 of 2020 were compared with reference data from 2018/2019 (averaged). Weekly incidence was calculated by age group and tumor stage. The number of women receiving initial treatment within 3 months of diagnosis was calculated by period, initial treatment, age, and stage. Initial treatment, stratified by tumor behavior (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] or invasive), was analyzed by logistic regression and adjusted for age, socioeconomic status, stage, subtype, and region. Factors influencing time to treatment were analyzed by Cox regression. RESULTS: Incidence declined across all age groups and tumor stages (except stage IV) from 2018/2019 to 2020, particularly for DCIS and stage I disease (p < 0.05). DCIS was less likely to be treated within 3 months (odds ratio [OR](wks2C8): 2.04, OR(wks9C11): 2.18). Invasive tumors were less likely to be treated initially by mastectomy with immediate reconstruction (OR(wks12C13): 0.52) or by breast conserving surgery (OR(wks14C17): 0.75). Chemotherapy was less likely for tumors diagnosed in the beginning of the study period (OR(wks9C11): 0.59, OR(wks12C13): 0.66), but more likely for those diagnosed at the end (OR(wks14C17): 1.31). Primary hormonal treatment was more common (OR(wks2C8): 1.23, OR(wks9C11): 1.92, OR(wks12C13): 3.01). Only women diagnosed in weeks 2C8 of 2020 experienced treatment delays.

World Health Organization declare the disease a pandemic condition. The pathologic source of this disease was a new RNA virus from Coronaviridae family, which was named COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 entry starts with the binding of the spike glycoprotein expressed on the viral envelope to ACE2 on the alveolar surface followed by clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 complex. SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells through endocytosis process, which is possibly facilitated, via a pH dependent endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins. Once inside the cells, SARS-CoV-2 exploits the endogenous transcriptional machinery of alveolar cells to replicate and spread through the entire lung. Endosomal acidic pH for SARS-CoV-2 processing and internalization is critical. After entering the cells, it possibly activates or hijack many intracellular pathways in favor of its replication.

Knowledge of the increased risk of infection in dental settings has been disseminated to the public and guidelines have been formulated to assist dental attendance decision-making. However, dental attendance behaviors incompatible with treatment need is not uncommon in clinical settings. Important gaps remain in the knowledge about how psychological factors are affecting dental attendance behaviors during the COVID-19 epidemic. In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire survey was performed during February and March 2020. A total of 342 and 294 dental patients who attended and avoided dental visits, respectively, were included. The participants were classified into four groups based on dental attendance behavior and emergent/urgent dental treatment need. Bivariate analysis was performed to investigate factors associated with dental attendance. Multivariable logistic regression based on principal component scores was performed to identify major psychological constructs associated with unnecessary dental avoidance and attendance. Among all the factors explored, inability to wear masks during dental treatment (P < 0.001; effect size: 0.32) was most closely associated with the overall pattern of dental attendance among participants. Multivariable regression suggested that unnecessary dental avoidance was associated with perceived risk of infection in general and in dental settings (odds ratio [95% CI]: 0.62 [0.53, 0.72]; p < 0.001), perceived impact of COVID-19 and dental problems on general health (0.79 [0.65, 0.97]; 0.021), and personal traits such as trust and anxiety (0.77 [0.61, 0.98]; 0.038).

Therefore, the objective of this review was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of IgG and IgM based point-of-care (POC) lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLIA), fluorescence enzyme-linked immunoassay (FIA) and ELISA systems that detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens. METHOD: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, Medline complete and MedRxiv. Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 were eligible. Study selection and data-extraction were performed by two authors independently. QUADAS-2 checklist tool was used to assess the quality of the studies. The bivariate model and the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve model were performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the serological tests. Subgroup meta-analysis was performed to explore the heterogeneity. RESULTS: The pooled sensitivity for IgG (n = 17), IgM (n = 16) and IgG-IgM (n = 24) based LFIA tests were 0.5856, 0.4637 and 0.6886, respectively compared to rRT-PCR method. The pooled sensitivity for IgG (n = 9) and IgM (n = 10) based CLIA tests were 0.9311 and 0.8516, respectively compared to rRT-PCR. The pooled sensitivity the IgG (n = 10), IgM (n = 11) and IgG-IgM (n = 5) based ELISA tests were 0.8292, 0.8388 and 0.8531 respectively compared to rRT-PCR. All tests displayed high specificities ranging from 0.9693 to 0.9991. Amongst the evaluated tests, IgG based CLIA expressed the highest sensitivity signifying its accurate detection of the largest proportion of infections identified by rRT-PCR. ELISA and CLIA tests performed better in terms of sensitivity compared to LFIA. IgG based tests performed better compared to IgM except for the ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: We report that IgG-IgM based ELISA tests have the best overall diagnostic test accuracy. Moreover, irrespective of the method, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody type independently. Given the poor performances of the current LFIA devices, there is a need for more research on the development of highly sensitivity and specific POC LFIA that are adequate for most individual patient applications and attractive for large sero-prevalence studies.

The period covered is June 2004 to June 2005. The literature survey used searches of Medline, key psychiatric journals and personal correspondence with leading psychiatric researchers from developing countries. RECENT FINDINGS There is a new interest in epidemiological studies in developing countries. These studies have been driven by three factors, namely international collaboration; specific situations like disasters, terrorism and severe acute respiratory syndrome; and international attention to specific topics like maternal depression. There is limited long-term research on specific conditions. There are a number of leads suggesting local social-cultural factors contribute to the distribution of psychiatric problems. Child psychiatry continues to be low in priority. There is also lack of research in areas such as personality disorders and organic psychiatric disorders. SUMMARY It is possible to carry out high quality epidemiological research in developing countries. Such research has provided new insights into the distribution, causation, course and outcome of mental disorders. There is need for greater attention to the development of epidemiological assessment tools to suit local conditions. Specific centers/institutions developing long-term research interests on specific subjects would be valuable for future efforts.

It can be life-threatening to the very young and elderly. Detection of pneumonitis from X-ray images is a significant challenge. Early detection and assistance with diagnosis can be crucial. Recent developments in the field of deep learning have significantly improved their performance in medical image analysis. The superior predictive performance of the deep learning methods makes them ideal for pneumonitis classification from chest X-ray images. However, training deep learning models can be cumbersome and resource-intensive. Reusing knowledge representations of public models trained on large-scale datasets through transfer learning can help alleviate these challenges. In this paper, we compare various image classification models based on transfer learning with well-known deep learning architectures. The Kaggle chest X-ray dataset was used to evaluate and compare our models. We apply basic data augmentation and fine-tune our feed-forward classification head on the models pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. We observed that the DenseNet201 model outperforms other models with an AUROC score of 0.966 and a recall score of 0.99.

In people younger than 50 years, these effects were more pronounced (aRR = 5.02, 95% CI: 3.19-7.90 and aRR = 13.80, 95% CI: 3.11-61.17, respectively), whereas no significant effects were observed in those aged 65 to 79 years (aRR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.70-2.12 and aRR = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.52-3.88, respectively). Sex and chronic conditions did not modify the effect of class 3 obesity in any of the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Severe obesity is a relevant risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization and severity in young adults, having a magnitude similar to that of aging. Tackling the current obesity pandemic could alleviate the impact of chronic and infectious diseases.","output":"Independent Role of Severe Obesity as a Risk Factor for COVID-19 Hospitalization: A Spanish Population-Based Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For a searchable version of these abstracts, please visit www.acrabstracts.org.","output":"ACR Convergence 2020 Abstract Supplement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Null.","output":"Impact of Urbanisation on COVID-19: Diversity in Virulence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence for the role of probiotics in maintenance of health or prevention of disease is mounting and is supported in some cases by blinded, placebo\\\\controlled human trials.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of awake prone position during helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation on inspiratory effort, gas exchange and comfort of breathing. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients presenting with ARDS due to COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled. Gas exchange, esophageal pressure swing (Pes), dynamic transpulmonary pressure (dTPP), modified pressure time product (mPTP), work of breathing (WOB) and comfort of breathing, were recorded on supine position and after 3 h on prone position. RESULTS: The median applied PEEP with helmet CPAP was 10 [8C10] cmH(2)O. The PaO(2)/FiO(2) was higher in prone compared to supine position (Supine: 166 [136C224] mmHg, Prone: 314 [232C398] mmHg, p < 0.001). Respiratory rate and minute ventilation decreased from supine to prone position from 20 [17C24] to 17 [15C19] b/min (p < 0.001) and from 8.6 [7.3C10.6] to 7.7 [6.6C8.6] L/min (p < 0.001), respectively. Prone position did not reduce Pes (Supine: ? 7 [? 9 to ? 5] cmH(2)O, Prone: ? 6 [? 9 to ? 5] cmH(2)O, p = 0.31) and dTPP (Supine: 17 [14C19] cmH(2)O, Prone: 16 [14C18] cmH(2)O, p = 0.34). Conversely, mPTP and WOB decreased from 152 [104C197] to 118 [90C150] cmH(2)O/min (p < 0.001) and from 146 [120C185] to 114 [95C151] cmH(2)O L/min (p < 0.001), respectively. Twenty-six (65%) patients experienced a reduction in WOB of more than 10%. The overall sensation of dyspnea was lower in prone position (p = 0.005).

BACKGROUND: Country responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated that large scale intersectoral action for health is possible- if the policy issue is of high importance and sufficiently consensual. The problem this workshop addresses is how to keep this invaluable intersectoral work flourishing long after the COVID-19 pandemic has passed. Put differently, how can intersectoral work with the health sector continue to lead to increased health benefits as well as increased benefits for other sectors? One way to do this is the use of co-benefits in intersectoral action. Co-benefits are substantial and specific benefits to the other sectors that can be gained by investing in health-related programs. Co-benefits can be referred to as the intended positive side effects of a policy or intervention. Co-benefits avoid imposing its health objectives on other sectors but rather aims at contributing to the other sectors objectives. The panel will discuss the following cross-cutting issues the economics of co-benefits in intersectoral actions; the governance and politics of co-benefits in intersectoral action. To make the discussion as concrete as possible the panelists will focus on the following SDGS: SDG4 Quality education. SDG9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure. SDG10 Reduced inequalities. SDG13 Climate action. ADDED VALUE: The SDGs progress is uneven and sluggish. They have, however, become a benchmark for solving the most pressing issues humanity, the environment and the planet are confronted with. Discussing co-benefits as a way to advance intersectoral action and the attainment of the SDGs adds therefore great value. Coherence between presentations and the topic of the workshop: four SDGs have been selected to discuss exemplary the economics, governance and politics of intersectoral action based on co-benefits. Each of the panelist will therefore tie their contribution very closely to the topic of the workshop even though they are speaking on different SDGs. INTERACTIVITY: After introducing the topic the panel discussion will go in three rounds addressing different aspects: a) the economics of co-benefits (magnitude, low hanging fruits); b) the intersectoral structures used to advance intersectoral actions c) the political force field and contexts in which to advance intersectoral action. In between these rounds the chair will pick up questions coming through the chat-box and feed them to the panelists. SPEAKERS/PANELISTS: Charley E. Willison. Cornell University, New York, USA.

An epidemiologic analysis of the nationwide COVID register, therefore, is necessary to outline and describe the impact in such population. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of the characteristics of a cohort of 5062 patients <18 years of age, until June 16, 2020, reported at the National Institute of Health-INS (https://www.ins.gov.co/News./Pages/Coronavirus.aspx), through the national public access database, with all subjects confirmed with COVID-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2. RESULTS: Reviewed on June 16, 2020, a total of 54,971 confirmed cases were reported nationwide for COVID-19, of which 5062 (9.2%) are cases in patients under 18 years of age. There was a statistically significant difference between groups; age was statistically significantly higher in the asymptomatic, compared with: deceased, severe and moderate cases; moreover, age was statistically significantly higher in the mild, compared with: deceased, severe and moderate. Statistically significant difference determined with one-way ANOVA was found between groups (F = 16.08, P < 0.001). Post hoc analysis reveals significant differences between groups, the age of patients at home (9.39 years) and those recovered (9.3 years) being significantly higher than those in intensive care unit (4.9 years), in hospital (6.1 years), or than the deceased (2.9 years).

We advance this literature with a novel framework to analyze these interactions. With county-level data on COVID-19 vaccinations, social capital, and measures of the values people have for personal freedom and public health, we find that vaccination rates depend on individual values, the level of social capital, and the interaction between the two. Social capital mediates the values people hold dear, which can influence vaccination rates in positive and negative ways. Our results are robust to the inclusion of relevant controls and under multiple specifications. These results suggest that individuals and the communities people enter into and exit out of play an important role in decisions to vaccinate, which are independent of formal, governmental public health measures.","output":"Jabbing together?

Study Design: Currently, some prospective phytochemical, black-tea (Camellia-sinensis) extract (BTE) was initially tested in vivo in strong oxidant-mutagen arsenic-induced model rat lung injury similar to that of Covid-19 manifestations like severe inflammation, oxidative stress, lung tissue degenerations, and apoptotic death. In silico, extensive bioinformatics and molecular docking experiments were performed on all catechin or theaflavin derivatives of C. sinensis, and finally theaflavin-3-O-gallate (TFMG) were screened for blocking or inactivation of several proteins of SARS CoV-2 and host adversely-acting proteins or factors. Methods: In vivo experiments in DNA stability (ladder, comet assay), free radicals attack (malondialdehyde; MDA, superoxide dismutase SOD, catalase gel-zymogram assay), extra cellular matrix damage (matrix metalloprotease; MMP2and9 zymogram assay) and inflammation (TNF-, ELISA).In silico experiments- molecular docking by AutoDock-Patchdock analysis, Surface Topology Calculation by CASTp, Grid-value calculation, and Ramachandran Plot study. Results: The BTE showed strong protection of lung DNA and cell-matrix by decreasing MMPs, TNF-, and free radicals, the same factors affecting Covid-19 patients.

The present study first demonstrated that PRRSV inhibited post-transcriptionally the protein induction of IFN- in primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) during early infection, and the inhibition effect mediated by the Chinese highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV was stronger. Next, we analyzed the cellular microRNA (miRNA)-modulated protein expression of porcine IFN- by dual firefly/Renilla luciferase reporter assay, transfection of miRNA mimics and inhibitor assay and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) treatment of PAMs, showing that porcine miRNAs including let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 are able to inhibit IFN- protein expression in primary PAMs by directly targeting sequences within the porcine IFN- 3UTR locating at 160C181, 9C31, 27C47 and 12C32 bp, respectively. Finally, we confirmed that let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145, were upregulated in PRRSV-infected PAMs early in vitro, and the expression level of these miRNAs in HP-PRRSV JXwn06-infected PAMs were higher than those in low pathogenic PRRSV HB-1/3.9-infected PAMs. The endogenous cellular miRNA-mediated inhibition of IFN- induction in PRRSV-infected PAMs early could be relieved by miRNA antagonists. Taken together, our findings suggest for the first time that PRRSV can suppress post-transcriptionally protein expression of IFN- by upregulating cellular miRNAs in PAMs in vitro, providing novel insight into mechanisms in relation to the PRRSV-mediated immunomodulation of porcine innate immunity.","output":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus suppresses post-transcriptionally the protein expression of IFN- by upregulating cellular microRNAs in porcine alveolar macrophages in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fifty four patients aged from 1 to 6 years who had had recurrent attacks of wheezy bronchitis were prospectively followed up for three months to find out if there was an association between different viral respiratory infections and episodes of wheezing.

An ideal test for COVID-19 would combine the sensitivity of laboratory-based PCR combined with the speed and ease of use of point-of-care (POC) or home-based rapid antigen testing. METHODS: To evaluate the performance of the Diagnostic Analyzer for Selective Hybridization (DASH) SARS-CoV-2 POC PCR (sample insertion to result time of 16 minutes), we conducted a cross-sectional study of adults with and without symptoms of COVID-19 at four clinical sites. We collected two bilateral anterior nasal swabs from each participant and information on COVID-19 symptoms, vaccination, and exposure. One swab was tested with the DASH SARS-CoV-2 POC PCR and the second in a central laboratory using Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 PCR. We assessed test concordance and calculated sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values using Xpert as the gold standard. RESULTS: We enrolled 315 and analyzed 313 participants with median age 42 years; 65% were female, 62% symptomatic, 75% had received 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and 16% currently COVID-19 positive. There were concordant results for 307 tests indicating an overall agreement for DASH of 0.98 [95% CI 0.96, 0.99] compared to Xpert. DASH performed at 0.96 [95% CI 0.86, 1.00] sensitivity and 0.98 [95% CI 0.96, 1.00] specificity, with a positive predictive value of 0.85 [95% CI 0.73, 0.96] and negative predictive value of 0.996 [95% CI 0.99, 1.00].

Medical education has shifted to online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic, creating challenges in adequate training of US. Objectives: In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic and the discontinuation of traditional classroom teaching, a tele-didactic US course for undergraduate medical students was developed. This study is examining the educational outcome of a new digital US course of the abdomen, thorax and the thyroid gland with the implementation of a modern portable US system. Methods: A tele-guided US course was established between April 1st and June 20th, 2020, at the University Hospital in Bonn, Germany. Students completed preand post-course surveys and underwent six US organ modules. Each module took place in a flipped-classroom concept including a digital learning platform. An objective structured assessment of US skills (OSAUS) [2] was implemented as final exam. Further, US images of the course and exam were rated by the Brightness Mode Quality Ultrasound Imaging Examination Technique (B-QUIET) [3]. Achieved points in image rating were compared to the OSAUS exam and survey results. Results: A total of 15 medical students were enrolled. There was a significant increase in self-assessed theoretical and practical ability (p < 0.001). Students achieved an average score of 154.5 (SD  11.72) out of 175 points (88.29%) in OSAUS, which corresponded to the image rating using B-QUIET and self-assessment data obtained in surveys. Interrater analysis of US images showed a favorable agreement with an ICC (2,1) of 0.895 (95% confidence interval 0.858 < ICC < 0.924). Conclusion: US training via teleguidance should be considered in medical education. Our pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of this concept that can be used in the future to improve US training of medical students even during a pandemic. The digital implementation with an affordable, portable point-of-care-US device could be an incredible opportunity to expedite US training worldwide.","output":"Conception and feasibility of a digital teleguided abdomen, thorax and thyroid gland ultrasound course for medical students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a procedure of performing in silico (virtual) screening using a web-based service, the MTiOpenScreen, which is freely accessible to non-commercial users.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial mediators and regulators of host immunity and the role of human cell surface TLRs in SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory pathogenesis has been demonstrated recently. However, the functional significance of the human intracellular TLRs including TLR3, 7, 8, and 9 is yet unclear. Hitherto, the involvement of these intracellular TLRs in inducing pro-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 has been reported but the identity of the interacting viral RNA molecule(s) and the corresponding TLRs have not been explored. This study hopes to rationalize the comparative binding of the major SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs to the intracellular TLRs, considering the solvent-based force-fields operational in the cytosolic aqueous microenvironment that predominantly drives these interactions. Our in silico study on the binding of all mRNAs with the intracellular TLRs depicts that the mRNA of NSP10, S2, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are possible virus-associated molecular patterns that bind to TLR3, TLR9, and TLR7, respectively, and trigger downstream cascade reactions. Intriguingly, binding of the viral mRNAs resulted in variable degrees of conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain of the TLRs ratifying the activation of the downstream inflammatory signaling cascade. Taken together, the current study is the maiden report to describe the role of TLR3, 7, and 9 in COVID-19 immunobiology and these could serve as useful targets for the conception of a therapeutic strategy against the pandemic.","output":"In silico analyses on the comparative sensing of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA by the intracellular TLRs of humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the pandemic outbreak of Covid-19 in December 2019, several lateral flow assay (LFA) devices were developed to enable the constant monitoring of regional and global infection processes. Additionally, innumerable lateral flow test devices are frequently used for determination of different clinical parameters, food safety, and environmental factors. Since common LFAs rely on non-biodegradable nitrocellulose membranes, we focused on their replacement by cellulose-composed, biodegradable papers. We report the development of cellulose paper-based lateral flow immunoassays using a carbohydrate-binding module-fused to detection antibodies. Studies regarding the protein binding capacity and potential protein wash-off effects on cellulose paper demonstrated a 2.7-fold protein binding capacity of CBM-fused antibody fragments compared to the sole antibody fragment. Furthermore, this strategy improved the spatial retention of CBM-fused detection antibodies to the test area, which resulted in an enhanced sensitivity and improved overall LFA-performance compared to the naked detection antibody. CBM-assisted antibodies were validated by implementation into two model lateral flow test devices (pregnancy detection and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies). The CBM-assisted pregnancy LFA demonstrated sensitive detection of human gonadotropin (hCG) in synthetic urine and the CBM-assisted Covid-19 antibody LFA was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies present in serum.

We have shown that infection with RbCV results in the development of myocarditis and congestive heart failure and that some survivors of RbCV infection go on to develop dilated cardiomyopathy in the chronic phase. Serial ECGs were recorded on 31 RbCV-infected rabbits. Measurements of heart rate; P-R interval; QRS duration; QTc interval; and P-, QRS-, and T-wave voltages were taken. The recordings were also examined for disturbances of conduction, rhythm, and repolarization. The acute and subacute phases were characterized by sinus tachycardia with depressed R- and T-wave voltages as well as disturbances of conduction, rhythm, and repolarization. In most animals in the chronic phase, the sinus rate returned to near-baseline values with resolution of the QRS voltage changes. The ECG changes observed during RbCV infection are similar to the spectrum of interval/segment abnormalities, rhythm disturbances, conduction defects, and myocardial pathology seen in human myocarditis, heart failure, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Because animals often died suddenly in the absence of severe clinical signs of congestive heart failure during the acute phase, RbCV infection may increase ventricular vulnerability, resulting in sudden cardiac death. RbCV infection may provide a rare opportunity to study sudden cardiac death in an animal model in which the ventricle is capable of supporting ventricular fibrillation, and invasive techniques monitoring cardiac function can be performed.","output":"ECG changes after rabbit coronavirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, telemedicine services have been introduced in the public health care systems of several industrialized countries. In Catalonia, the use of eConsulta, an asynchronous teleconsultation service between primary care professionals and citizens in the public health care system, has already reached 1 million cases. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of eConsulta was growing at a monthly rate of 7%, and the growth has been exponential from March 15, 2020 to the present day. Despite its widespread usage, there is little qualitative evidence describing how this tool is used. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to annotate a random sample of teleconsultations from eConsulta, and to evaluate the level of agreement between health care professionals with respect to the annotation. METHODS: Twenty general practitioners retrospectively annotated a random sample of 5382 cases managed by eConsulta according to three aspects: the type of interaction according to 6 author-proposed categories, whether the practitioners believed a face-to-face visit was avoided, and whether they believed the patient would have requested a face-to-face visit had eConsulta not been available. A total of 1217 cases were classified three times by three different professionals to assess the degree of consensus among them. RESULTS: The general practitioners considered that 79.60% (4284/5382) of the teleconsultations resulted in avoiding a face-to-face visit, and considered that 64.96% (3496/5382) of the time, the patient would have made a face-to-face visit in the absence of a service like eConsulta. The most frequent uses were for management of test results (26.77%, 1433/5354), management of repeat prescriptions (24.30%, 1301/5354), and medical enquiries (14.23%, 762/5354). The degree of agreement among professionals as to the annotations was mixed, with the highest consensus demonstrated for the question \\"Has the online consultation avoided a face-to-face visit?\\" (3/3 professionals agreed 67.95% of the time, 827/1217), and the lowest consensus for the type of use of the teleconsultation (3/3 professionals agreed 57.60% of the time, 701/1217). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the ability of eConsulta to reduce the number of face-to-face visits for 55% (79%  65%) to 79% of cases. In comparison to previous research, these results are slightly more pessimistic, although the rates are still high and in line with administrative data proxies, showing that 84% of patients using teleconsultations do not make an in-person appointment in the following 3 months. With respect to the type of consultation performed, our results are similar to the existing literature, thus providing robust support for eConsulta's usage. The mixed degree of consensus among professionals implies that results derived from artificial intelligence tools such as message classification algorithms should be interpreted in light of these shortcomings.","output":"Teleconsultation Between Patients and Health Care Professionals in the Catalan Primary Care Service: Message Annotation Analysis in a Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate compassion fatigue (CF) and compassion satisfaction (CS) in nursing care providers in COVID\\\\19 units.

REVIEW METHODS A systematic review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Study selection, quality appraisal and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. A third arbiter was available if discrepancies. RESULTS A total of 719 articles were reviewed and 17 studies met the inclusion and quality criteria. The included studies related to smoking, chronic pain, obesity and mental illness. Most interventions were based on cognitive behavioural theory. Most of the included studies (12/17, 70.5%) showed improvements in health and significant reductions in anxiety, pain and depression with variable effect sizes. Patients reported a high satisfaction rate and indicated lectures or self-report writings as helpful in their recovery compared with more interactive items.

Existing global centrality measures suffer from the high computational complexity and unrealistic assumptions, limiting their applications on real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a new centrality measure, Node Conductance, to effectively detect spanning structural hole nodes and predict the formation of new edges. Node Conductance is the sum of the probability that node i is revisited at r-th step, where r is an integer between 1 and infinity. Moreover, with the help of node embedding techniques, Node Conductance is able to be approximately calculated on big networks effectively and efficiently. Thorough experiments present the differences between existing centralities and Node Conductance, its outstanding ability of detecting influential nodes on both static and dynamic network, and its superior efficiency compared with other global centralities.

Among other vaccines in clinical trials, a recombinant VSV-?G-spike vaccine was developed by the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) and is being evaluated. The development of an efficient downstream purification process (DSP) enables the vaccine to be advanced to clinical trials. The DSP must eliminate impurities, either process- or product-related, to yield a sufficient product with high purity, potency and quality. To acquire critical information on process restrictions and qualities, the application of in-line monitoring is vital and should significantly impact the process yield, product quality and economy of the entire process. Here, we describe an in-line monitoring technique that was applied in the DSP of the VSV-?G-spike vaccine. The technique is based on determining the concentrations of metabolites, nutrients and a host cell protein using the automatic chemistry analyzer, Cobas Integra 400 Plus. The analysis revealed critical information on process parameters and significantly impacted purification processes. The technique is rapid, easy and efficient.

We performed immunophenotyping of viral antigen-specific and unconventional T cell responses, neutralizing antibodies, and serum proteins in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, using influenza infection, SARS-CoV-2-convalescent health care workers, and healthy adults as controls. We identify mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell activation as an independent and significant predictor of death in COVID-19 (HR = 5.92, 95% CI = 2.49C14.1). MAIT cell activation correlates with several other mortality-associated immunologic measures including broad activation of CD8(+) T cells and non-V2 æT cells, and elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines, including GM-CSF, CXCL10, CCL2, and IL-6. MAIT cell activation is also a predictor of disease severity in influenza (ECMO/death HR = 4.43, 95% CI = 1.08C18.2). Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals a shift from focused IFN-driven signals in COVID-19 ICU patients who survive to broad pro-inflammatory responses in fatal COVID-19 Ca feature not observed in severe influenza. We conclude that fatal COVID-19 infection is driven by uncoordinated inflammatory responses that drive a hierarchy of T cell activation, elements of which can serve as prognostic indicators and potential targets for immune intervention.","output":"Identification of immune correlates of fatal outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Safety and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine are unknown in hematological patients; both were evaluated prospectively in 42 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and 50 with myeloproliferative malignancies (MPM) (20 chronic myeloid leukemias and 30 myeloproliferative neoplasms), all of them on active anti-cancer treatment, in comparison with 36 elderly controls not suffering from cancer. Subjects serologically and/or molecularly (by nasal/throat swab) positives at basal for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded. Primary endpoint was to compare titers of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and seroprotection rates among the cohorts at 3 and 5 weeks from first dose. METHODS: Titration was done using LIAISON? SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test, a quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay approved by FDA on the basis of robust evidences of concordance (94.4%) between the test at cutoff of 15 AU/mL and the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test 90% at 1:40 ratio. Cutoff of 15 AU/mL was assumed to discriminate responders to vaccination with a protective titer. Cohorts were compared using Fisher exact test and the MannCWhitney test as appropriated. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), geometric mean ratios and response rates after 1st and 2nd dose were compared in each cohort by Wilcoxon and McNemar tests, respectively. RESULTS: At 5 weeks, GMC of IgG in elderly controls was 353.3 AU/mL versus 106.7 in MM (p = 0.003) and 172.9 in MPM patients (p = 0.049). Seroprotection rate at cutoff of 15 AU/mL was 100% in controls compared to 78.6% in MM (p = 0.003) and 88% in MPM patients (p = 0.038). In terms of logarithm of IgG titer, in a generalized multivariate linear model, no gender effect was observed (p = 0.913), while there was a significant trend toward lower titers by increasing age (p < 0.001) and in disease cohorts with respect to controls (MM: p < 0.001 and MPM: p < 0.001). An ongoing treatment without daratumumab was associated with higher likelihood of response in MM patients (p = 0.003). No swabs resulted positive on each time point. No safety concerns were observed. CONCLUSIONS: BNT162b2 has demonstrated to be immunogenic at different extent among the cohorts. Response was 88% and robust in MPM patients. MM patients responded significantly less, particularly those on anti-CD38-based treatment. These latter patients should be advised to maintain masks and social distancing regardless of vaccination status, and their cohabiting family members need to be vaccinated in order to reduce the risk of contagion from the family.

AIM: We aimed to report the largest number of COVID-19-positive cases in KTR in a single center and to discuss their demographics, management, and evolution. METHODS: We enrolled all the two thousand KTR followed up in our center in Kuwait and collected the data of all COVID-19-positive KTR (104) from the start of the outbreak till the end of July 2020 and have reported the clinical features, management details, and both patient and graft outcomes. RESULTS: Out of the one hundred and four cases reported, most of them were males aged 49.3  14.7 years. Eighty-two of them needed hospitalization, of which thirty-one were managed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Main comorbidities among these patients were hypertension in 64.4%, diabetes in 51%, and ischemic heart disease in 20.2%. Management strategies included anticoagulation in 56.7%, withdrawal of antimetabolites in 54.8%, calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) withdrawal in 33.7%, the addition of antibiotics in 57.7%, Tocilizumab in 8.7%, and antivirals in 16.3%. During a follow-up of 30 days, the reported number of acute kidney injury (AKI) was 28.7%, respiratory failure requiring oxygen therapy 46.2%, and overall mortality rate was 10.6% with hospital mortality of 13.4% including an ICU mortality rate of 35.5%. CONCLUSION: Better outcome of COVID-19-positive KTR in our cohort during this unremitting stage could be due to the younger age of patients and early optimized management of anticoagulation, modification of immunosuppression, and prompt treatment of secondary bacterial infections.

The large public debt build-up following the 2009 global financial and economic crisis acted as a shock absorber for output, while in the recent and more severe COVID19-crisis, an increase in public debt is even more justified given the nature of the crisis. Yet, once the crisis is over and the recovery firmly sets in, keeping debt at high levels over the medium term is a source of vulnerability in itself. Moreover, in the euro area, where monetary policy focuses on the area-wide aggregate, countries with high levels of indebtedness are poorly equipped to withstand future asymmetric shocks. Using three large scale DSGE models, the simulation results suggest that high-debt economies (1) can lose more output in a crisis, (2) may spend more time at the zero-lower bound, (3) are more heavily affected by spillover effects, (4) face a crowding out of private debt in the short and long run, (5) have less scope for counter-cyclical fiscal policy and (6) are adversely affected in terms of potential (long-term) output, with a significant impairment in case of large sovereign risk premia reaction and use of most distortionary type of taxation to finance the additional debt burden in the future. Going forward, reforms at national level, together with currently planned reforms at the EU level, need to be timely implemented to ensure both risk reduction and risk sharing and to enable high debt economies address their vulnerabilities.","output":"Economic Consequences of High Public Debt: Evidence from Three Large Scale DSGE Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAutonomic dysfunction is a common complication of post-acute sequalae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC)/long COVID, however prevalence and severity rates are unknown. ObjectiveThe primary goal of this study was to assess the frequency and severity of autonomic symptoms in PASC. We also aimed to assess symptom burden in PASC though well-validated questionnaires, evaluate which pre-existing conditions are associated with an increased risk of developing autonomic dysfunction, and determine whether the severity of acute COVID-19 illness is associated with the severity of autonomic dysfunction in this population. MethodsWe conducted an online survey of 2,314 adults with PASC using several validated questionnaires including the COMPASS-31 to evaluate for autonomic dysfunction. We included both participants who had tested positive for COVID-19 (test-confirmed) and participants who were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on clinical symptoms alone (test-unconfirmed). Additional analyses were performed on test-confirmed participants, comparing hospitalized to non-hospitalized participants. Results67% of PASC patients had a COMPASS-31 score >20, suggestive of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction. COMPASS-31 scores did not differ between test-confirmed hospitalized and non-hospitalized participants (28.95{+/-}30.98 vs 26.4{+/-}28.35, p=0.06). Both hospitalized and non-hospitalized participants reported significant functional disability across all quality-of-life domains.

RESULT: Nine studies were entered; including180 cases (92: women, 88: men, age range: 9-83 years). The dosages of each Rituximab cycle varied between ultra-low-dose (&#8804;500 mg for a cycle, either multiple infusions or a single infusion), low-dose (2  375 mg/m2 or 2  500 mg) and modified-dose (3  375 mg/m2 or 3  500 mg). The efficacy and safety of Rituximab in the studies are known by the recovery time, relapse time, and side events. According to the studies, 2  500 can lead to complete remission in a broad range, from 35 to 82%. These differences might be explained by different end-points and variable cumulative corticosteroid dosage after RTX administration. Although the studies showed that low dose RTX is efficient, there are some controversies regarding the choosing low-dose for severe patients. CONCLUSION: Considering the effectiveness of low-dose, intermediate dose, and ultra-low-dose protocols of Rituximab in inducing remission in pemphigus disease and considering factors such as cost of therapy, and the need to induce a minimum of immunosuppression for a minimum duration in the COVID-19 pandemic, suggested to use low-dose Rituximab protocol (2 infusions of 500 mg Rituximab: interval of 2 weeks) to induce the remission in mild-to-moderate pemphigus patients.","output":"A systematic review on efficacy, safety, and treatment-durability of low-dose rituximab for the treatment of Pemphigus: special focus on COVID-19 pandemic concerns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbial contaminants can cause physical-chemical alterations of pharmaceuticals and medicine-related infections. This study aimed to examine the microbiological quality of selected local and imported non-sterile pharmaceutical products in the Dar es Salaam market and the antibiogram of the isolated microorganisms. Methods: Samples were collected between April and June 2021 and analysed for microbial content as per the harmonised methods of the European Pharmacopoeia (EP). Antibiotic susceptibility of the microbial isolates was studied using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Results: Fifty percent (50%) of the samples failed both bacterial and fungal enumeration tests. In this study, local products recorded lower microbial counts than imported products. Major bacterial contaminants isolated were P. aeruginosa (45.5%), S. epidermidis, (45.5%) and K. pneumoniae, while major fungal contaminants were A. flavus (58.3%), followed by A. fumigatus (25%) and Penicillium spp (16.7%). The isolated bacterial contaminants recorded high resistance levels to commonly used antibiotics. Conclusion: The tested products were contaminated with microorganisms at different levels, most of them exceeding the maximum acceptable colony counts. Syrups or suspensions were more contaminated than tablets and capsules. The isolated bacterial contaminants were highly resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Recommendations: We recommend that pharmaceutical manufacturers abide by good manufacturing, distribution and storage practices to limit contamination and cross-contamination of products.

RESULTS Of 92 patients approached, 89 (96.7%) agreed to mobility assessment. Eighty-nine completed MAT-sf, and 97.8% (87/89) completed 4-meter walk test. Sixty-seven (75%) met eligibility criteria, and 59 (88%) consented to be randomized either to the PA counseling intervention (Video-PA) or to active control (Video-C). Most participants viewed the walk test positively (51/59; 86.4%). Staff reported that completion of patient surveys, MAT-sf, and videos required significant staff time and support (median = 26 minutes for all), resulting in low acceptability of MAT-sf and the videos.

A third theme formed was individual vulnerabilities predisposing poor mental health outcomes. The final theme related to impacts dependent on context and meaning attached. Findings suggest a consideration of a spectrum approach encompassing a broader range of potential psychological challenges and perceived harms beyond safety concerns and addiction in understanding problematic adolescent online experiences. Understanding perceived harms can aid the objective setting of interventions and consideration of mental health literacy in school curricula.","output":"Perceived Challenges and Online Harms from Social Media Use on a Severity Continuum: A Qualitative Psychological Stakeholder Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To describe, based on morphological features, a new copepod species of Rhinergasilus, Rhinergasilus unguilongus n. sp., collected from gills of the Streaked prochilod, Prochilodus lineatus (Valenciennes, 1837), sampled in the Veados and Paranapanema Rivers, two tributaries of the Jurumirim Reservoir (Upper Paranapanema River, Paran River Basin), S?o Paulo State, Brazil. METHODS Fish were collected using multi-panel gill nets. The gills of each fish were washed and examined for copepods using a stereo microscope. The copepods found were stored in 70% ethanol, cleared in lactic acid, and mounted in Hoyer's medium. Drawings were made with the aid of a microscope equipped with a drawing tube. RESULTS The new copepod species can be distinguished from its two congeners, Rhinergasilus piranhus (type-species) Boeger et Thatcher, 1988 and Rhinergasilus digitus Narciso, Brand?o, Perbiche-Neves et Silva, 2020, due to its extremely long antennary claw (etymology of the species), being longer than the other antennary segments; third leg lacking any interpodal plate; and third endopodal segment of third leg lacking a distal spine. CONCLUSIONS Based on the morphological differences, we erected a new species of Rhinergasilus.

Scholars have started to examine the persuasion techniques used in conspiracy messages such as uncertainty and fear yet, little is understood about the visual narratives, especially how visual narratives differ in videos that debunk conspiracies versus those that propagate conspiracies. This paper addresses this gap in understanding visual framing in conspiracy videos through analyzing millions of frames from conspiracy and counter-conspiracy YouTube videos using computational methods. We found that conspiracy videos tended to use lower color variance and brightness, especially in thumbnails and earlier parts of the videos. This paper also demonstrates how researchers can integrate textual and visual features in machine learning models to study conspiracies on social media and discusses the implications of computational modeling for scholars interested in studying visual manipulation in the digital era. The analysis of visual and textual features presented in this paper could be useful for future studies focused on designing systems to identify conspiracy content on the Internet.","output":"Visual Framing of Science Conspiracy Videos: Integrating Machine Learning with Communication Theories to Study the Use of Color and Brightness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While gold compound have been approved for Rheumatoid arthritis treatment as it well suppresses inflammatory cytokines of patients, no such treatment is currently available for COVID-19 treatment in vivo.

However, the evidence about how the pandemic has affected clinical management of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, two common diseases worldwide, is lacking. We therefore aimed to examine the trends in the number of outpatients with thyroid disorders and their thyrotropin (TSH) levels before and during the pandemic in Japan. Methods: This cohort study included all patients aged 20 years who visited Ito Hospital, one of the largest hospitals that specialize in thyroid disorders in Japan, during 2019/1-2020/6. Our outcomes of interest were 1) trends in the aggregated number of visits at the clinic and 2) trends in average TSH levels from January 2019 to June 2020. The trends in TSH according to the clinic visit in early 2020 were assessed utilizing difference-in-difference models controlling for age, sex, and city of residence, stratified by each medication use (i.e., levothyroxine [LT4], antithyroid drug [ATD], potassium iodine [KI], or no medication). Results: During 2019/1-2020/6, we observed 517,412 visits at Ito Hospital for thyroid disorders, and the average number of visits per month was significantly decreased for both the first visits (1,995 in 2019 vs. 1,268 in 2020; reduction rate, 36%; p<0.001) and the follow-up visits (29,509 in 2019 vs. 21,959 in 2020; reduction rate, 26%; p<0.001). Among 15,455 patients who had been followed in 2019, we found a higher TSH at the follow-up visits during 2020/4-2020/6 among patients with LT4 who did not visit the clinic during 2020/1-2020/3 than those who did (difference-in-difference [95%CI]=+1.77 [1.25-2.29], p<0.001). We also found decreased trends in TSH among patients with ATD or KI who visited the clinic during 2020/1-2020/3 (p<0.001 for both categories), but not among patients with no medications (p=0.29).

Susceptibility has been associated with age, biological sex, and other prior existing health conditions. However, host genes are involved in viral infectivity and pathogenicity, and polymorphisms in these could be responsible for the interethnic/interindividual variability observed in infection and progression of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Clinical exome data of 103 individuals was analyzed to identify sequence variants in five selected candidate genes: ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD209, IFITM3, and MUC5B to assess their prevalence and role to understand the COVID-19 infectivity and progression in our population. Results: A total of 497 polymorphisms were identified in the five selected genes in the exomes analyzed. Thirty-eight polymorphisms identified in our cohort have been reported earlier in literature and have functional significance or association with health conditions. These variants were classified into three groups: protective, susceptible, and responsible for comorbidities. Discussion and Conclusion: The two polymorphisms described in literature as risk inducing are rs35705950 in MUC5B gene and TMPRSS2 haplotype (rs463727, rs34624090, rs55964536, rs734056, rs4290734, rs34783969, rs11702475, rs35899679, and rs35041537) were absent in our cohort explaining the slower infectivity of the disease in this part of India.

In a murine model of severe neuroinflammation induced by West Nile virus encephalitis (WNE), we showed PLX5622 efficiently depleted both microglia and a sub-population of border-associated macrophages in the CNS. However, PLX5622 also significantly depleted mature Ly6C(hi) monocytes in the bone marrow (BM), inhibiting their proliferation and lethal recruitment into the infected brain, reducing neuroinflammation and clinical disease scores. Notably, in addition, BM dendritic cell subsets, plasmacytoid DC and classical DC, were depleted differentially in infected and uninfected mice. Confirming its protective effect in WNE, cessation of PLX5622 treatment exacerbated disease scores and was associated with robust repopulation of microglia, rebound BM monopoiesis and markedly increased inflammatory monocyte infiltration into the CNS. Monoclonal anti-CSF-1R antibody blockade late in WNE also impeded BM monocyte proliferation and recruitment to the brain, suggesting that the protective effect of PLX5622 is via the inhibition of CSF-1R, rather than other kinase targets. Importantly, BrdU incorporation in PLX5622-treated mice, suggest remaining microglia proliferate independently of CSF-1 in WNE.

The need to address this gap gains relevance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic as it demonstrated a crucial relationship between health system capacities and effective health security response. Acknowledging the importance of developing stronger and more resilient health systems globally for health emergency preparedness, the WHO developed a Health Systems for Health Security framework that aims to promote a common understanding of what health systems for health security entails whilst identifying key capacities required. METHODS/ RESULTS: To further explore and analyse the conceptual and practical links between health systems and health security within the peer reviewed literature, a rapid scoping review was carried out to provide an overview of the type, extent and quantity of research available. Studies were included if they had been peer-reviewed and were published in English (seven databases 2000 to 2020). 343 articles were identified, of those 204 discussed health systems and health security (high and medium relevance), 101 discussed just health systems and 47 discussed only health security (low relevance). Within the high and medium relevance articles, several concepts emerged, including the prioritization of health security over health systems, the tendency to treat health security as exceptionalism focusing on acute health emergencies, and a conceptualisation of security as state security not human security or population health. CONCLUSION: Examples of literature exploring links between health systems and health security are provided. We also present recommendations for further research, offering several investments and/or programmes that could reliably lead to maximal gains from both a health system and a health security perspective, and why these should be explored further.

However, the nature and magnitude of tissue-level effects are modulated by factors that regulate local glucocorticoid activity; accordingly, inter-individual differences could contribute to susceptibility. In the present study, we characterized effects of ozone (O(3)) inhalation on glucocorticoid-regulating factors in the lungs of rat strains with contrasting hypothalamicCpituitaryCadrenal stress axis responses. Hyper-responsive Fischer (F344) and less responsive Lewis (LEW) rats were exposed to air or 0.8 ppm O(3) for 4 h by nose-only inhalation. Levels of the high-specificity and -affinity corticosteroid-binding globulin protein increased in the lungs of both strains proportional to the rise in corticosterone levels following O(3) exposure. Ozone reduced the ratio of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSDB1)/HSDB2 mRNA in the lungs of F344 but not LEW, indicating strain-specific transcriptional regulation of the major glucocorticoid metabolism factors that control tissue-level action. Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and total elastase activity were increased by O(3) in both strains, consistent with extravasation and tissue remodeling processes following injury. However, mRNA levels of inflammatory markers were significantly higher in the lungs of O(3)-exposed LEW compared to F344. The data show that strain differences in the glucocorticoid response to O(3) are accompanied by corresponding changes in regulatory factors, and that these effects are collectively associated with a differential inflammatory response to O(3).

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of HFNC compared to standard oxygen therapy, or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), for respiratory support in adults in the ICU. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane COVID-19 Register (17 April 2020), clinical trial registers (6 April 2020) and conducted forward and backward citation searches. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled studies (RCTs) with a parallel-group or cross-over design comparing HFNC use versus other types of non-invasive respiratory support (standard oxygen therapy via nasal cannulae or mask; or NIV or NIPPV which included continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure) in adults admitted to the ICU. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included 31 studies (22 parallel-group and nine cross-over designs) with 5136 participants; this update included 20 new studies. Twenty-one studies compared HFNC with standard oxygen therapy, and 13 compared HFNC with NIV or NIPPV; three studies included both comparisons.

HFNC versus standard oxygen therapy HFNC may lead to less treatment failure as indicated by escalation to alternative types of oxygen therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.86; 15 studies, 3044 participants; low-certainty evidence). HFNC probably makes little or no difference in mortality when compared with standard oxygen therapy (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.11; 11 studies, 2673 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). HFNC probably results in little or no difference to cases of pneumonia (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.09; 4 studies, 1057 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and we were uncertain of its effect on nasal mucosa or skin trauma (RR 3.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 31.48; 2 studies, 617 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We found low-certainty evidence that HFNC may make little or no difference to the length of ICU stay according to the type of respiratory support used (MD 0.12 days, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.27; 7 studies, 1014 participants). We are uncertain whether HFNC made any difference to the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) within 24 hours of treatment (MD 10.34 mmHg, 95% CI -17.31 to 38; 5 studies, 600 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether HFNC made any difference to short-term comfort (MD 0.31, 95% CI -0.60 to 1.22; 4 studies, 662 participants, very low-certainty evidence), or to long-term comfort (MD 0.59, 95% CI -2.29 to 3.47; 2 studies, 445 participants, very low-certainty evidence). HFNC versus NIV or NIPPV We found no evidence of a difference between groups in treatment failure when HFNC were used post-extubation or without prior use of mechanical ventilation (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.22; 5 studies, 1758 participants; low-certainty evidence), or in-hospital mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.31; 5 studies, 1758 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of using HFNC on incidence of pneumonia (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.52; 3 studies, 1750 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and HFNC may result in little or no difference to barotrauma (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.14; 1 study, 830 participants; low-certainty evidence). HFNC may make little or no difference to the length of ICU stay (MD -0.72 days, 95% CI -2.85 to 1.42; 2 studies, 246 participants; low-certainty evidence). The ratio of PaO2/FiO2 may be lower up to 24 hours with HFNC use (MD -58.10 mmHg, 95% CI -71.68 to -44.51; 3 studies, 1086 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether HFNC improved short-term comfort when measured using comfort scores (MD 1.33, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.92; 2 studies, 258 participants) and responses to questionnaires (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.53; 1 study, 168 participants); evidence for short-term comfort was very low certainty. No studies reported on nasal mucosa or skin trauma. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HFNC may lead to less treatment failure when compared to standard oxygen therapy, but probably makes little or no difference to treatment failure when compared to NIV or NIPPV. For most other review outcomes, we found no evidence of a difference in effect. However, the evidence was often of low or very low certainty. We found a large number of ongoing studies; including these in future updates could increase the certainty or may alter the direction of these effects.","output":"High-flow nasal cannulae for respiratory support in adult intensive care patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The infection caused due to novel coronavirus 2 can cause wide spectrum of disease from asymptomatic mild disease to life threatening disease. The widespread inflammation is most likely the cause of the adverse outcomes. There are numerous markers of the inflammation which are used to identify the severity and prognosis of the disease. Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is one such marker which is easily available and feasible in all the hospital settings. This study intended to evaluate the NLR as a marker of disease severity and prognosis, in those with Covid-19. MATERIAL This was a retrospective study to determine the utility of NLR as a marker of severity and prognosis among patients with Covid disease. Medical records of 60 patients admitted with mild to moderate Covid-19 disease were reviewed and relevant data was retrieved. The NLR at admission and 72 hours later was noted. High resolution computerised tomography was done and computerised tomography severity score (CT-SS) was calculated. The outcomes of these patients were noted. OBSERVATION Mean NLR at admission in mild disease was 5.6 and in moderate disease was 9.2. This difference was found to be statistically significant. It was also seen that NLR had a positive co-relation with CT severity score, duration of hospital stay, C- reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer. CONCLUSION The study shows that neutrophil- lymphocyte ratio is a good indicator of disease severity and has prognostic significance in Covid-19. There is a positive correlation with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest score and other markers of inflammation among patients with Covid-19. Serial monitoring of NLR can be utilised as a surrogate to HRCT chest to determine disease severity whenever the latter is not available. This can ensure early intervention and help prevent mortality.","output":"Utility of Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) as an Indicator of Disease Severity and Prognostic Marker among Patients with Covid-19 Infection in a Tertiary Care Centre in Bangalore - A Retrospective Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increasing global adoption of COVID-19 vaccines, limitations on mass gathering events have started to gradually loosen. However, the large vaccine inequality recorded among different countries is an important aspect that policymakers must address when implementing control measures for such events. In this paper, we propose a model for the assessment of different control measures with the consideration of vaccine inequality in the population. Two control measures are considered: selecting participants based on vaccine efficacy and restricting the event capacity. We build the model using agent-based modeling to capture the spatiotemporal crowd dynamics and utilize a genetic algorithm to assess the control strategies. This assessment is based on factors that are important for policymakers such as disease prevalence, vaccine diversity, and event capacity. A quantitative evaluation of vaccine diversity using the Simpsons Diversity Index is also provided. The Hajj ritual is used as a case study. We show that strategies that prioritized lowering the prevalence resulted in low event capacity but facilitated vaccine diversity. Moreover, strategies that prioritized diversity resulted in high infection rates. However, increasing the prioritization of participants with high vaccine efficacy significantly decreased the disease prevalence. Strategies that prioritized ritual capacity did not show clear trends.","output":"Evaluating COVID-19 control measures in mass gathering events with vaccine inequalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated the adoption and implementation of digital mental health tools.

Hypocalcemia is the potential complication after thyroidectomy, where is persistency can lead to serious systemic effects. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of hypocalcemia in thyroidectomy patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients referred to (XXX) for thyroidectomy from 2019 to 2020 were enrolled. Preoperative serum calcium and postoperative 24- and 48-h calcium levels were evaluated in these patients. Demographic data (sex and gender), calcium levels, type of thyroidectomy and duration of surgery was recorded for all the patients. SPSS v22 was used for statistical analysis. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 143 patients included in the study, the mean age was 49.7  10.9 years and 61.5% were females and 38.5% were males. 49% patients had hypocalcemia in the first 24 hours after surgery and 63.6% following 48 hours of the surgery. The difference in calcium levels at three intervals were statistically significant, p = 0.001. The incidence of hypocalcemia was significantly more in women at 48 postoperative hours, p = 0.025. The age and duration of surgery was not significantly correlated with hypocalcemia, p > 0.05, whereas, patients who underwent total thyroidectomy had greater incidence of hypocalcemia 24 hours after the surgery, p = 0.021.

Logistic regression analysis was performed and the proportion of treatment effect explained by BMD in vertebral fracture risk was estimated. The results demonstrate that both total hip BMD T-score and change can be strong predictors of subsequent fracture risk, and that total hip BMD change explained 73%, while T-score explained 23%, of the treatment effect. In contrast, neither femoral neck BMD change nor T-score can predict the effect of denosumab on vertebral fracture risk. Furthermore, although lumbar spine BMD T-score was associated with vertebral fracture incidence, lumbar spine BMD change was inversely related to vertebral fracture risk. Because there was no relationship between lumbar spine BMD change and T-score at 24 months of denosumab treatment, and because there can be small undetectable vertebral deformities that may increase BMD values, these results suggest that lumbar spine BMD change is not a good surrogate for vertebral fracture risk assessment. It is suggested that both total hip BMD change and T-score can be good surrogates for predicting vertebral fracture risk in Japanese patients with osteoporosis under denosumab treatment.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00680953.","output":"Relationship Between Bone Mineral Density and Risk of Vertebral Fractures with Denosumab Treatment in Japanese Postmenopausal Women and Men with Osteoporosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Up to now, the established leadership research has widely ignored the specific leadership practices in family-run companies.

Increased presenteeism, decreased absenteeism, and low uptake of the influenza vaccine can contribute to the spread of influenza among HCP in healthcare settings. We used a mixed methods approach to investigate attitudes and behaviors of HCP in Israel towards influenza vaccination, presenteeism, and absenteeism. METHODS: The study took place over three influenza seasons (2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019) at the largest hospital in southern Israel. We administered a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) questionnaire and conducted semi-structured interviews with HCP who had been recently ill with respiratory symptoms. The KAP questionnaire included closed-ended questions about attitudes and behaviors regarding influenza, working while sick, and influenza vaccination. The interviews investigated HCP's perceptions of influenza infection and attitudes about absenteeism, presenteeism, and the influenza vaccine. RESULTS: We conducted 74 semi-structured interviews over three influenza seasons. Four HCP were interviewed twice, in separate seasons for different illness episodes. The 70 individuals interviewed included 16 physicians, 45 nurses or technicians, and 9 administrative staff. The median age was 42.5 years (range: 25-60), and most (79%) were female. Half (50%) got vaccinated against influenza before their illness episode. In interviews, most HCP said they come to work while sick (presenteeism) due to a strong personal work ethic and an institutional culture that discourages taking sick leave (absenteeism). HCP expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine as well as concern that the influenza vaccine causes severe illness. DISCUSSION: Over three influenza seasons in Israel, HCP cited a number of reasons for working while sick, and doubted the usefulness of influenza vaccine. Addressing reasons for presenteeism and vaccine hesitancy among HCP is crucial to protect HCP and patients from influenza virus infection and other viral respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19.","output":"\\"You Have to Die Not to Come to Work\\": A Mixed Methods Study of Attitudes and Behaviors regarding Presenteeism, Absenteeism and Influenza Vaccination among Healthcare Personnel with Respiratory Illness in Israel, 2016-2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assume one has the capability of determining whether a node in a network is infectious or not by probing it. Then problem of optimizing sentinel surveillance in networks is to identify the nodes to probe such that an emerging disease outbreak can be discovered early or reliably. Whether the emphasis should be on early or reliable detection depends on the scenario in question. We investigate three objective measures from the literature quantifying the performance of nodes in sentinel surveillance: the time to detection or extinction, the time to detection, and the frequency of detection. As a basis for the comparison, we use the susceptible-infectious-recovered model on static and temporal networks of human contacts. We show that, for some regions of parameter space, the three objective measures can rank the nodes very differently. This means sentinel surveillance is a class of problems, and solutions need to chose an objective measure for the particular scenario in question. As opposed to other problems in network epidemiology, we draw similar conclusions from the static and temporal networks.

Although it is often assumed that a participants health predicts future study dropout, only a few studies have examined this topic, with conflicting findings. This study aims to contribute to the literature by clarifying the relationship between different aspects of health and study dropout. METHODS: The 2008 baseline sample of the German Aging Survey was used to predict study dropout (N = 4442). Indicators of health included physical health using the number of chronic conditions, physical functioning using the SF-36 Physical Functioning subscale, cognitive functioning using the digit symbol substitution test, and depression using the CESD-15. RESULTS: It was found that different aspects of health had differential associations with survey dropout: Worse physical functioning and in part worse cognitive functioning predicted increased dropout rates; contrarily, worse physical health predicted decreased dropout when controlling for other health aspects and covariates. Depression was not significantly related to study dropout. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, participants with chronic conditions, but minimal physical and cognitive disability were most likely to participate in the future. These findings suggest that health has a complex relationship with survey dropout and must be accounted for in longitudinal studies. Neglecting this systematic attrition due to health problems bears the risk of severely under- or overestimating health-related effects and trends.","output":"Health and study dropout: health aspects differentially predict attrition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, the causative agent of the pandemic disease COVID-19, emerged in December 2019 forcing lockdown of communities in many countries. The absence of specific drugs and vaccines, the rapid transmission of the virus, and the increasing number of deaths worldwide necessitated the discovery of new substances for anti-COVID-19 drug development. With the aid of bioinformatics and computational modelling, ninety seven antiviral secondary metabolites from fungi were docked onto five SARS-CoV2 enzymes involved in viral attachment, replication, post-translational modification, and host immunity evasion infection mechanisms followed by molecular dynamics simulation and in silico ADMET prediction (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) of the hit compounds. Thus, three fumiquinazoline alkaloids scedapin C (15), quinadoline B (19) and norquinadoline A (20), the polyketide isochaetochromin D1 (8), and the terpenoid 11a-dehydroxyisoterreulactone A (11) exhibited high binding affinities on the target proteins, papain-like protease (PLpro), chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp), non-structural protein 15 (nsp15), and the spike binding domain to GRP78. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to optimize the interaction and investigate the stability of the top-scoring ligands in complex with the five target proteins. All tested complexes were found to have dynamic stability.

In particular, regarding the humidity, the empirically least favorable conditions for the survival of viral pathogens are found at intermediate humidities. However, the precise physico-chemical mechanisms that generate such least-favorable conditions are not understood yet. In this work, we analyze the evaporation dynamics of respiratory-like droplets in air, semi-levitating them on superhydrophobic substrates with minimal solid-liquid contact area. Our results reveal that, compared to pure water droplets, the salt dissolved in the droplets can significantly change the evaporation behaviour, especially for high humidities close to and above the deliquesence limit. Due to the hygroscopic properties of salt, water evaporation is inhibited once the salt concentration reaches a critical value that depends on the relative humidity. The salt concentration in a stable droplet reaches its maximum at around 75% relative humidity, generating conditions that might shorten the time in which pathogens remain infectious.","output":"Stability of Respiratory-Like Droplets under Evaporation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is regarded as the gold-standard for diagnostic testing. However, the detection of residual viral RNA genome fragments is affecting several percent of recovered patients, which unnecessarily pro-longs quarantines or delays clinical procedures. To minimize the detection of such fragments, we introduced a single modification in the COVID-19 RT-qPCR to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious viral RNA. After validation of the assay using UVC inactivation of infectious virus, we analyzed positive COVID-19 clinical samples from two different countries. We find that after 15 days of the onset of symptoms, the modified RT-qPCR protocol leads to significantly fewer positive diagnoses in persistently positive samples compared to the standard RT-qPCR test, without compromising diagnoses within 5 days of the onset of symptoms.

Understanding its genome pattern is important for developing new and faster ways of testing for identifying the genome of the virus and also for better understanding of its origin and evolution. Methods: For that, it was calculated the alpha coefficient by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) for the sequences of these genomes converted to binary numbers in order to determine if it is a chaotic or a random series of data. Also, it applied the random walking for obtaining a fractal map of the whole genome and calculated the fractal dimension (FD) by box-counting of this map by two different software. Results: With this, it was found that the alpha coefficient of the first SARS viruses was &gt; 0.5, indicating that the series is chaotic or fractal, and has a persistent long-range memory or self-similarity along its sequence. This is not the case for MERS virus, which showed to have a completely random sequence ( &lt; 0.5).

To circumvent resistance to therapy, combination therapies with additive mechanisms of action are needed. CD70, a tumor necrosis factor receptor ligand, and its receptor CD27 are expressed on LSCs and AML blasts, but not on hematopoietic stem cells. Cusatuzumab, a high-affinity humanized monoclonal anti-CD70 antibody, kills CD70-expressing cells by Fc domain-mediated effector functions and is a potent inhibitor of CD70-CD27 signaling. Here we report initial results of a study of cusatuzumab in combination with the current standard of care therapy, venetoclax plus azacitidine (CVA), in patients with untreated AML (de novo or secondary) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy due to age 75 years or medical comorbidities. Methods: The primary objective of this open label, multicenter, phase 1b study was to assess safety and tolerability of CVA. Key secondary objectives included response rate per ELN 2017 criteria and time to response. Patients received cusatuzumab 10 or 20 mg/kg IV on Day 3 and Day 17, a 3-day ramp-up of venetoclax (100, 200, and 400 mg PO) followed by 400 mg daily dosing, and azacitidine 75 mg/m 2 SC or IV on Days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle. Results: Based on data through Jul 9, 2021, 44 patients enrolled with median age 75 years (range 32-89), 36.4% had secondary AML, 40.9% had an ECOG performance status of 2, and ELN risk was favorable, intermediate and adverse in 18.2%, 20.5% and 61.4%, respectively. All patients received 20 mg/kg cusatuzumab except for 3 patients who received a starting dose of 10 mg/kg with the option to escalate to 20 mg/kg. Of these 3 patients, 1 escalated to 20 mg/kg. At a median follow-up of 29.1 weeks, the median number of treatment cycles was 4.0 (range 1.0-11.0). Grade 3 or above TEAEs were reported in 97.7% of patients;the most common (reported in 10%) were neutropenia (68.2%), thrombocytopenia (65.9%), febrile neutropenia (36.4%), anemia (34.1%), leukopenia (29.5%), sepsis (27.3%), and lymphopenia (15.9%). Treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 75% of patients;the most common (reported in at least 5%) were febrile neutropenia (27.3%), sepsis (22.7%), COVID-19 (6.8%), and thrombocytopenia (6.8%). Treatment-emergent SAEs of grade 3 were reported in 72.7% of the patients. Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) were reported for 11.4% of patients with 2.3% at grade 3. Six (13.6%) patients discontinued treatment due to AEs, and 5 (11.4%) TEAEs resulted in death. The mortality rate within 30 days from start of treatment was 4.5%. Table 1 summarizes best response to study treatment. In the intent-to-treat analysis set (n=44) complete remission (CR) rate was 45.5%, while CR + CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) + CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) was 77.3%;MLFS was observed in 11.4% of patients. Of 34 responders (defined as CR, CRi or CRh), 47% were MRD negative by flow cytometry at or after achievement of response. Median time to first response for patients who achieved CR, CRh or CRi was 4.21 (3.0-25.0) weeks. Best response rates in the post-hoc response evaluable analysis set (n=42) that excluded two patients who died before the first disease evaluation were: CR in 47.6%, CR + CRh + CRi in 81.0% and MLFS in 11.9% of patients (Table 1). The majority (97.1%) of responders experienced at least one cycle delay in administration of CVA post response. Conclusions: Cusatuzumab administered in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine to elderly patients with untreated AML was generally well tolerated and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with that previously reported with venetoclax-azacitidine, with the addition of generally manageable IRRs. Response rates support an additive effect of cusatuzumab to the standard of care with potential for improved clinical outcomes. However, further clinical trials are needed for validation of these initial results. HK and GB contributed equally to this publ cation.

Glycemic control is central in diabetes management, yet complex and challenging to achieve; it can be affected by various factors. Diabetes self-care behaviors are vital strategies for effective T2DM management. PURPOSE: To evaluate the levels of glycemic control and diabetes self-care behaviors, and the significance of each behavior on glycemic control among patients with T2DM in Jordan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in medical and endocrinology outpatient clinics of three hospitals in northern Jordan. A convenience sample of 520 patients with T2DM participated in the study. Diabetes self-care behaviors, including diet, exercise, blood glucose testing, taking medication, and foot care behaviors, were measured using the Arabic version of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA-Arabic) questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured using the Arabic version of the 4-items Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were used to assess glycemic control. RESULTS: Out of 520 participants, 92.7% (n= 482) had poor glycemic control (HbA1c 7%), with a mean of 9.29% (SD=2.06) for HbA1c. The SDSCA overall mean score was 3.25 days (SD=0.88), indicating an unsatisfactory level, with 79.2% of participants having performed self-care activities 4-days/week. Greater adherence to diabetes self-care behaviors was associated with better glycemic control. Exercise was the most important predictor of HbA1c (p<0.001), followed by general diet (p<0.001), specific diet (p<0.001), and blood sugar testing (p<0.001). Moreover, the Body Mass Index (p<0.001), treatment type (p<0.001), and income (p=0.03) were significant predictors. CONCLUSION: The proportions of poor glycemic control and unsatisfactory self-care behaviors were high among T2DM patients. To enhance patients self-care behaviors and lifestyles changes, the patients need tailored diabetes self-care management educational and supportive programs, conducted by qualified diabetes educators using culturally sensitive strategies.","output":"Glycemic Control and Its Relationship with Diabetes Self-Care Behaviors Among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes in Northern Jordan: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics are frequently prescribed to patients with severe COVID-19, motivated by concern about bacterial coinfection. There is no evidence of benefit from such a strategy, while the dangers of inappropriate antibiotics are well described. OBJECTIVES To investigate the frequency, profile and related outcomes of infections by bacterial pathogens in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS This was a prospective, descriptive study in a dedicated COVID-19 ICU in Cape Town, South Africa, involving all adult patients admitted to the ICU with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia between 26 March and 31 August 2020. We collected data on patient comorbidities, laboratory results, antibiotic treatment, duration of admission and in-hospital outcome. RESULTS We included 363 patients, who collectively had 1 199 blood cultures, 308 tracheal aspirates and 317 urine cultures performed. We found positive cultures for pathogens in 20 patients (5.5%) within the first 48 hours of ICU admission, while 73 additional patients (20.1%) had positive cultures later during their stay. The most frequently isolated pathogens at all sites were Acinetobacter baumannii (n=54), Klebsiella species (n=13) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=9). Length of ICU stay (p<0.001) and intubation (p<0.001) were associated with positive cultures on multivariate analysis. Disease severity (p=0.5), early antibiotic use (p=0.5), diabetes mellitus (p=0.1) and HIV (p=0.9) were not associated with positive cultures. Positive cultures, particularly for tracheal aspirates (p<0.05), were associated with longer ICU length of stay and mortality. Early empirical antibiotic use was not associated with mortality (odds ratio 2.5; 95% confidence interval 0.95 - 6.81). CONCLUSIONS Bacterial coinfection was uncommon in patients at the time of admission to the ICU with severe COVID-19. Avoiding early empirical antibiotic therapy is therefore reasonable. Strategies to avoid coinfection and outbreaks in hospital, such as infection prevention and control, as well as the strict use of personal protective equipment, are important to improve outcomes.","output":"Bacterial infection, antibiotic use and COVID-19: Lessons from the intensive care unit."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The relevance of tissue oxygenation in the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction during sepsis is controversial. We compared oxygen transport, lactate metabolism, and mitochondrial function in pigs with septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or hypoxic hypoxia. METHODS Thirty-two anaesthetized, ventilated pigs were randomized to faecal peritonitis (P), cardiac tamponade (CT), hypoxic hypoxia (HH) or controls. Systemic and regional blood flows, lactate, mitochondrial respiration, and tissue hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1) were measured for 24 h. RESULTS Mortality was 50% in each intervention group. While systemic oxygen consumption (VO(2) ) was maintained in all groups, hepatic VO(2) tended to decrease in CT [0.84 (0.5-1.3) vs. 0.42 (0.06-0.8)/ml/min/kg; P = 0.06]. In P, fractional hepatic, celiac trunk, and portal vein blood flows, and especially renal blood flow [by 46 (14-91)%; P = 0.001] decreased. In CT, renal blood flow [by 50.4 (23-81)%; P = 0.004] and in HH, superior mesenteric blood flow decreased [by 38.9 (16-100)%, P = 0.009]. Hepatic lactate influx increased > 100% in P and HH, and > 200% in CT (all P < 0.02). Hepatic lactate uptake remained unchanged in P and HH and converted to release in CT. Mitochondrial respiration remained normal. Muscle adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations decreased in P (5.9  1.4 mol/g wt vs. 2.8  2.7 mol/g wt, P = 0.04). HIF-1 expression was not detectable in any group. CONCLUSION We conclude that despite shock and renal hypoperfusion, tissue hypoxia is not a major pathophysiological issue in early and established faecal peritonitis. The reasons for reduced skeletal muscle tissue ATP levels in the presence of well-preserved in-vitro muscle mitochondrial respiration should be further investigated.","output":"Oxygen transport and mitochondrial function in porcine septic shock, cardiogenic shock, and hypoxaemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As of November 1, 2020, there have been more than 230K deaths and 9M confirmed and probable cases attributable to SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. However, this overwhelming toll has not been distributed equally, with geographic, race-ethnic, age, and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality defining features of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the U.S. state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks. RESULTS: In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than Whites for all groups except Native Americans. Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 infection (Age-standardized incidence = 1,626/100,000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate 244/100,000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.5 (95% Posterior Credible Interval [CrI] = 5.4, 5.6) and 6.7 (95% CrI = 6.4, 7.1) times higher than Whites, respectively. We found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates. CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests that well-documented racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality in hard-hit settings, such as the U.S. state of Michigan, are driven primarily by variation in household, community and workplace exposure rather than case-fatality rates.","output":"Racial Disparities in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Mortality Are Driven by Unequal Infection Risks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The progression and geographical distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the United Kingdom (UK) and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic individuals are diagnosed. We performed a serological study of blood donors in Scotland in the spring of 2020 to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection and epidemic progression. AIM: Our objective was to determine if sera from blood bank donors can be used to track the emergence and progression of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. METHODS: A pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study comprised samples from 3,500 blood donors collected in Scotland between 17 March and 18 May 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019. RESULTS: All samples collected on 17 March 2020 (n = 500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in six of 500 donors from 23 to 26 March. The number of samples containing neutralising antibodies did not significantly rise after 5C6 April until the end of the study on 18 May. We found that infections were concentrated in certain postcodes, indicating that outbreaks of infection were extremely localised. In contrast, other areas remained comparatively untouched by the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Although blood donors are not representative of the overall population, we demonstrated that serosurveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic such as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","output":"Detection of neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to determine population exposure in Scottish blood donors between March and May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chronic lung disorders like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are characterized by exacerbations. They are unpleasant for patients and sometimes severe enough to cause hospital admission and death. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable populations with these disorders are at high risk, and their routine care cannot be done properly. Remote monitoring offers a low cost and safe solution for gaining visibility into the health of people in their daily lives, making it useful for vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring using wearables and mobile phones in patients with pulmonary diseases. The secondary objective is to provide power calculations for future studies centered around understanding the number of exacerbations according to sample size and duration. METHODS: Twenty participants will be recruited in each of three cohorts (COPD, IPF, and posthospitalization COVID). Data collection will be done remotely using the RADAR-Base (Remote Assessment of Disease And Relapse) mobile health (mHealth) platform for different devices, including Garmin wearable devices and smart spirometers, mobile app questionnaires, surveys, and finger pulse oximeters. Passive data include wearable-derived continuous heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, activity, and sleep. Active data include disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures, mental health questionnaires, and symptom tracking to track disease trajectory. Analyses will assess the feasibility of lung disorder remote monitoring (including data quality, data completeness, system usability, and system acceptability). We will attempt to explore disease trajectory, patient stratification, and identification of acute clinical events such as exacerbations. A key aspect is understanding the potential of real-time data collection. We will simulate an intervention to acquire responses at the time of the event to assess model performance for exacerbation identification. RESULTS: The Remote Assessment of Lung Disease and Impact on Physical and Mental Health (RALPMH) study provides a unique opportunity to assess the use of remote monitoring in the evaluation of lung disorders. The study started in the middle of June 2021. The data collection apparatus, questionnaires, and wearable integrations were setup and tested by the clinical teams prior to the start of recruitment. While recruitment is ongoing, real-time exacerbation identification models are currently being constructed. The models will be pretrained daily on data of previous days, but the inference will be run in real time. CONCLUSIONS: The RALPMH study will provide a reference infrastructure for remote monitoring of lung diseases. It specifically involves information regarding the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring and the potential of real-time data collection and analysis in the context of chronic lung disorders. It will help plan and inform decisions in future studies in the area of respiratory health.

The virusChost-specific interactions, molecular targets on host cell deaths, and the involved signaling are crucial issues, which become potential targets for treatment. Spike protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), cathepsin L-cysteine peptidase, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), open reading frame 7a (ORF7a), viral main protease (3C-like protease (3CLpro) or Mpro), RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Nsp12), non-structural protein 13 (Nsp13) helicase, and papain-like proteinase (PLpro) are molecules associated with SARS-CoV infection and propagation. SARS-CoV-2 can induce host cell death via five kinds of regulated cell death, i.e., apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, autophagy, and PANoptosis. The mechanisms of these cell deaths are well established and can be disrupted by synthetic small molecules or natural products. There are a variety of compounds proven to play roles in the cell death inhibition, such as pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) for apoptosis, necrostatin-1 for necroptosis, MCC950, a potent and specific inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome in pyroptosis, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, which can mitigate the corresponding cell death pathways. However, NF-B signaling is another critical anti-apoptotic or survival route mediated by SARS-CoV-2. Such signaling promotes viral survival, proliferation, and inflammation by inducing the expression of apoptosis inhibitors such as Bcl-2 and XIAP, as well as cytokines, e.g., TNF. As a result, tiny natural compounds functioning as proteasome inhibitors such as celastrol and curcumin can be used to modify NF-B signaling, providing a responsible method for treating SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The natural constituents that aid in inhibiting viral infection, progression, and amplification of coronaviruses are also emphasized, which are in the groups of alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, diarylheptanoids, and anthraquinones. Natural constituents derived from medicinal herbs have anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, as well as inhibitory effects, on the viral life cycle, including viral entry, replication, assembly, and release of COVID-19 virions. The phytochemicals contain a high potential for COVID-19 treatment. As a result, SARS-CoV-2-infected cell death processes and signaling might be of high efficacy for therapeutic targeting effects and yielding encouraging outcomes.","output":"Coronavirus Infection-Associated Cell Death Signaling and Potential Therapeutic Targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nephrotic syndrome is a unique clinical disorder, which provides interesting teaching opportunities that connect physiological and pathological aspects to clinical practice. During the current COVID-19 outbreak, in-person teaching in our institution was not permitted, thus creating a unique challenge for clinical skills teaching. A case-based electronic learning (e-learning) activity was designed to replace the traditional in-person teaching of renal semiology. e-Learning activities have been shown to be effective for knowledge retention and increasing novice learners' performance. However, major knowledge gaps exist concerning the satisfaction of learners with e-learning activities as the sole form of teaching, specifically for undergraduate clinical skills education. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to prospectively assess undergraduate medical students' perceptions of and satisfaction with an e-learning activity teaching renal semiology. METHODS: All second-year medical students (novice learners) from the medical faculty of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, undertook the e-learning activity and were invited to participate in a nonmandatory, validated web-based survey, comprising questions answered using a 10-point Likert scale and one qualitative open-ended question. For comparison and to provide further insights, 17 fourth- to sixth-year students (advanced learners) were prospectively recruited to participate in both the e-learning activity and the evaluation. A mixed methods analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 88 (63%) out of 141 novice learners and all advanced learners responded to the evaluation survey. Advanced learners reported significantly higher satisfaction with the e-learning activity (mean 8.7, SD 1.0 vs mean 7.3, SD 1.8; P<.001), clarity of objectives (mean 9.6, SD 0.8 vs mean 7.7, SD 1.7; P<.001), and attainability of objectives (mean 9.8, SD 0.5 vs mean 7.3, SD 1.3; P<.001). Both groups showed high interest in the inclusion of the activity as part of a blended learning approach; however, there was low interest in the activity being the sole means of teaching. CONCLUSIONS: Case-based e-learning activities might be better suited for advanced learners and could increase learners' satisfaction within a blended teaching instructional design. More research on students' satisfaction with e-learning activities in the field of clinical skills education should be done. In addition, more effort should be put into finding alternative teaching tools for clinical skills education in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future health crises.","output":"Novice and

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire, The survey comprised of questions about (i) sociodemographic information, (ii) the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), (iii) coping activities , and (iv) the students most serious concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 381 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Female participants slightly predominated the sample (n=199, 52.2%). The respondents aged 18-38 years (mean 22.6 years, SD: 3.16). The total K10 distress scores had a mean of 34.2 (SD:9.4). However, the mean of total K10 distress scores had no significant association with gender (P=0.57). Age was negatively associated with total K10 distress scores (P=0.0013). Concerning severity, most of the respondents were regarded as having severe psychological distress (n=265, 69.5%), and females were found to have a statistically significant higher percentage in mild and severe psychological distress (P= 0.035), (P=0.016); respectively. 209 students (54.9%) reported that they had no motivation for distance learning. There was a statistically significant inverse relationship between severe psychological distress and motivation for distance learning (P<0.0001). The most common coping strategy among students was Spending more time on social media (n=269, 70.6%). Besides, 49 students (12.9%) reported the use of medications to cope with COVID-10 related distress, and 209 students (54.9%) reported distance learning was their most serious concern. Conclusion The COVID-19 control measures resulted in a severe disruption of various human life activities, and this could impact the mental health of individuals, including students. A nationwide psychological support program should be incorporated into Jordan response strategy in combating the COVID-19, considering students and other vulnerable groups in Jordan.

With the raising obesity risk, key aspects to consider are accurate body mass index classification, as well as metabolic and cardiovascular, and hepatic consequences. DATA SOURCES: The authors performed a systematic literature search in PubMed and EMBASE, using selected key words (obesity, childhood, cardiovascular, liver health). In particular, they focused their search on papers evaluating the impact of obesity on cardiovascular and liver health. RESULTS: We evaluated the current literature dealing with the impact of excessive body fat accumulation in childhood and across adulthood, as a predisposing factor to cardiovascular and hepatic alterations. We also evaluated the impact of physical and dietary behaviors starting from childhood on cardio-metabolic consequences. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemic of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities worldwide raises concerns about the impact of early abnormalities during childhood and adolescence. Two key abnormalities in this context include cardiovascular diseases, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Appropriate metabolic screenings and associated comorbidities should start as early as possible in obese children and adolescents. Nevertheless, improving dietary intake and increasing physical activity performance are to date the best therapeutic tools in children to weaken the onset of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes risk during adulthood.","output":"Childhood obesity, cardiovascular and liver health: a growing epidemic with age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sixty-nine fecal samples from diarrheic puppies were examined by reverse transcription-PCR assays for the M and the S genes of canine coronaviruses (CCoVs).

In the current study, bioinformatic approaches were employed to screen potent bioactive compounds that might be ACE-2 receptor inhibitors. The employment of a docking study using ACE receptor protein with a ready-to-dock database of phytochemicals via MOE software revealed five compounds as potent molecules. Among them, astragaloside exhibited the highest binding affinity -21.8 kcal/mol and stable interactions within the active site of the ACE-2 receptor. Similarly, the phytochemicals such as pterocaryanin B, isoastragaloside II, and astraisoflavan glucoside followed by oleuropein showed a stronger binding affinity.

Yet, decisions for if, when, how, and for whom GBL should be designed cannot be made on a solid empirical basis. Though the act of play seems to be intertwined with GBL, it is generally ignored in the current scientific literature. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to explore students perceptions of play in leisure time and of GBL as part of a mechanistic, bottom-up approach towards evidence-informed design and implementation of GBL in health profession education. METHODS: We conducted 6 focus group discussions with medical and dentistry students, which were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 58 students participated. We identified 4 major themes based on the students perception of play in leisure time and on the combination of play and learning. Our results indicate that, while play preferences were highly various in our health profession student cohort, pleasure was the common ground reported for playing. Crucially, play and the serious act of learning seemed paradoxical, indicating that the value and meaning of play are strongly context-dependent for students. CONCLUSIONS: Four key points can be constructed from our study. First, students play for pleasure. Perceptions of pleasure vary considerably among students. Second, students consider play as inefficient. Inefficiency will only be justified when it increases learning. Third, play should be balanced with the serious and only be used for difficult or tedious courses. Fourth, GBL activities should not be made compulsory for students. We provide practical implications and directions for future research.","output":"Medical Students Perceptions of Play and Learning: Qualitative Study With Focus Groups and Thematic Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Recently, subunit vaccines are replacing some of the traditional vaccines because they offer a higher margin of safety. However, generally subunit vaccines have low antigenicity. Adjuvants are used in vaccine formulations to increase their immunogenicity, but current research suggests that adjuvants could induce serious side effects in susceptible individuals; therefore, the improvement of antigens and adjuvants is important. AREAS COVERED Here we reviewed some self-aggregating peptides (SAPs) used as antigen delivery systems. SAPs are based on a short sequence of amino acids, which have self-aggregating properties, inducing self-interaction among peptide molecules by means of non-covalent interactions to generate nanoparticles (NPs). EXPERT COMMENTARY SAPs increase the immunogenicity of fused/conjugated antigens because they can interact with antigen-presenting cells and induce adaptive immunity based on both humoral and cellular responses. As an example, we report an antigen delivery system based on SAPs forming NPs. These NPs are synthesized using a recombinant baculovirus. We fused the green fluorescent protein to the first 110 amino acids of polyhedrin protein from Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus, which has self-aggregating properties. We showed that these NPs prompt high antibody levels without inducing inflammation, similarly to some SAPs reported here.","output":"Induction of adaptive immune response by self-aggregating peptides."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Production of affordable coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in low- and middle-income countries is needed.

It is being developed in Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil; herein are initial results from Thailand. This phase 1 stage of a randomised, dose-escalation, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial was conducted at the Vaccine Trial Centre, Mahidol University (Bangkok). Healthy adults aged 18-59 years, non-pregnant and negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were eligible. Participants were block randomised to receive one of six treatments by intramuscular injection twice, 28 days apart: 1 microgram (mcg) +/- CpG1018 (a toll-like receptor 9 agonist), 3 mcg +/- CpG1018, 10 mcg, or placebo. Participants and personnel assessing outcomes were masked to treatment. The primary outcomes were solicited and spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs) during 7 and 28 days after each vaccination, respectively. Secondary outcomes were immunogenicity measures (anti-S IgG and pseudotyped virus neutralisation). An interim analysis assessed safety at day 57 in treatment-exposed individuals and immunogenicity through day 43 per protocol. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04764422). Between March 20 and April 23, 2021, 377 individuals were screened and 210 were enrolled (35 per group); all received dose one; five missed dose two. The most common solicited AEs among vaccinees, all predominantly mild, were injection site pain (<63%), fatigue (<35%), headache (<32%), and myalgia (<32%). The proportion reporting a vaccine-related AE ranged from 5.7% to 17.1% among vaccine groups and was 2.9% in controls; there was no vaccine-related serious adverse event. The immunogenicity of the 10 mcg formulation ranked best, followed by 3 mcg+CpG1018, 3 mcg, 1 mcg+CpG1018, and 1 mcg formulations. On day 43, the geometric mean concentrations of 50% neutralising antibody ranged from 122.23 IU/mL (1 mcg, 95% CI 86.40-172.91) to 474.35 IU/mL (10 mcg, 95% CI 320.90-701.19), with 93.9% to 100% of vaccine groups attaining a => 4-fold increase over baseline.

We show that activation of Neu3 sialidase, also known as Neuraminidase-3, causing conversion of GD1a and GT1b to GM1 ganglioside, is an essential step in regeneration occurring in PNS (sensory) but not CNS (retinal) axons in adult rat. In PNS axons, axotomy activates Neu3 sialidase, increasing the ratio of GM1/GD1a and GM1/GT1b gangliosides immediately after injury in vitro and in vivo. No change in the GM1/GD1a ratio after axotomy was observed in retinal axons (in vitro and in vivo), despite the presence of Neu3 sialidase. Externally applied sialidase converted GD1a ganglioside to GM1 and rescued axon regeneration in CNS axons and in PNS axons after Neu3 sialidase blockade. Neu3 sialidase activation in DRGs is initiated by an influx of extracellular calcium, activating P38MAPK and then Neu3 sialidase. Ganglioside conversion by Neu3 sialidase further activates the ERK pathway.

It removes the need for in-person testing procedures especially for rural regions where related medical supplies, experienced workers, and equipment are limited. However, existing sound-based diagnostic approaches are trained in a fully supervised manner, which requires large scale well-labelled data. It is critical to discover new methods to leverage unlabelled respiratory data, which can be obtained more easily. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning enabled framework for COVID-19 cough classification. A contrastive pre-training phase is introduced to train a Transformer-based feature encoder with unlabelled data. Specifically, we design a random masking mechanism to learn robust representations of respiratory sounds. The pre-trained feature encoder is then fine-tuned in the downstream phase to perform cough classification. In addition, different ensembles with varied random masking rates are also explored in the downstream phase. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed contrastive pre-training, the random masking mechanism, and the ensemble architecture contribute to improving cough classification performance.","output":"Exploring Self-Supervised Representation Ensembles for COVID-19 Cough Classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep learning research has demonstrated the effectiveness of using pre-trained networks as feature encoders.

Since these artifacts can represent an obstacle for the detection of periprocedural bleeding, this study investigated the effect of artifact reduction by an iterative metal artifact reduction (iMAR) software in CT in a brain phantom. METHODS Two different in vitro models with two-dimensional tube and three-dimensional AVM-like configuration were filled with Onyx 18. The models were inserted into a brain imaging phantom and images with (n = 5) and without (n = 10) an experimental hemorrhage adjacent were acquired. Afterwards, the iMAR algorithm was applied for artifact reduction. The IAs of the original and the post-processed images were graded quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, qualitative definition of the experimental hemorrhage was investigated. RESULTS Comparing the IAs of the original and the post-processed CT images, quantitative and qualitative analysis showed a lower degree of IAs in the post-processed images, i.e. quantitative analysis: 2D tube model: 23.92  8.02 Hounsfield units (HU; no iMAR; mean  standard deviation) vs. 5.93  0.43 HU (with iMAR; p < 0.001); qualitative analysis: 3D AVM model: 4.93  0.18 vs. 3.40  0.48 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, definition of the experimental hemorrhage was better in the post-processed images of both in vitro models (2D tube model: p = 0.004; 3D AVM model: p = 0.002). CONCLUSION The iMAR algorithm can significantly reduce the IAs evoked by Onyx 18 in CT.

Carbyne, often called linear carbon, has a higher predicted gravimetric modulus and gravimetric strength than any other form of carbon, but possibly reacts under near-ambient conditions because of the extended sp1 hybridization. The successful fabrication of carbon nanotube wrapped single carbyne chain (Shi et al. Nat. Mater. 2016, 15, 634) suggests the possibility of carbyne's bulk production. Herein, we designed a type of carbon assembly that includes a possibly large array of carbyne chains confined within a single-walled nanotube sheath (nanotube wrapped carbynes, NTWCs), in which carbyne chains act as reinforcing building blocks, and the carbon nanotube sheath protects the multiple carbyne chains against chemical or topochemical reaction. We showed that NTWCs exhibit confinement-enhanced stabilities, even when they contain multiple neighboring carbyne chains. We developed a mechanics model for exploring the mechanical properties of NTWCs. On the basis of this model, the gravimetric modulus (and strength) of NTWCs was predicted to increase from 356.4 (50.25) to 977.2 GPag-1cm3 (71.20 GPag-1cm3) as the mass ratio of carbyne carbons to sheath carbons increases, which is supported by atomistic simulations. The highest calculated gravimetric modulus and strength of NTWCs are 174.2% and 41.7%, respectively, higher than those of either graphene or carbon nanotubes. The corresponding highest values of engineering modulus and strength of NTWCs with a density of 1.54 gcm-3 are 1505 and 109.6 GPa, respectively.

We documented a 6.9% excess in MRR (proxy for COVID-19 mortality) for each tonne/km(2) increase in NH(3) emissions, explained by the interaction of the period variable with NH(3) exposure, considering all pollutants together. Despite the limitations of the ecological design of the study, following the precautionary principle, we recommend the implementation of public health measures to limit environmental NH(3) exposure, particularly while the COVID-19 pandemic continues.

Coaching, broadly accepted as a training modality in medical education, has been proven a successful tool for teaching communication skills. Little research is available thus far to investigate virtual coaching on communication skills for telemedicine encounters. The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that virtually coaching residents on communication skills is feasible and acceptable. We surveyed 21 resident-faculty pairs participating in a fully virtual coaching session (patient, coach, and resident were virtual). METHODS: We asked 50 neurology resident-faculty coach pairs to complete one fully virtual coaching session between May 20 and August 31, 2020. After each session, the resident and coach completed a 15-item survey, including Likert-style scale and open-ended questions, assessing feasibility and acceptability. Descriptive statistics and qualitative content and thematic analyses were performed. RESULTS: Forty-two percent (21/50) of all eligible residents completed fully virtual coaching sessions. The overall survey response rate was 91 % (38/42). The majority of respondents agreed that the direct observation and debriefing conversation were easy to schedule and occurred without technical difficulties and that debriefing elements (self-reflection, feedback, takeaways) were useful for residents. Ninety-five percent of respondents rated the coachs virtual presence to be not at all disruptive to the resident-patient interaction. Virtual coaching alleviated resident stress associated with observation and was perceived as an opportunity for immediate feedback and a unique approach for resident education that will persist into the future. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, residents and faculty coaches found virtual coaching on communication skills feasible and acceptable for telemedicine encounters. Many elements of our intervention may be adoptable by other residency programs. For example, residents may share their communication goals with clinic faculty supervisors and then invite them to directly observe virtual encounters what could facilitate targeted feedback related to the residents goals. Moreover, virtual coaching on communication skills in both the in-person and telemedicine settings may particularly benefit residents in challenging encounters such as those with cognitively impaired patients or with surrogate decision-makers.

Entrepreneurship fosters the innovation needed not only to take advantage of new opportunities, boost productivity and create employment, but also to address the economic shockwave triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Slovenia, as a small open economy, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic. Therefore, the main objective of the paper is to analyse and compare how the entrepreneurial sector responded to the first lockdown situation in Slovenia. The data will be obtained from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor database and the results will be compared with European countries. The question is whether the response of the entrepreneurial sector was to some extent dependent on the response of the government. The results allow a first approximation of the rapid changes that entrepreneurs have to face in order to adapt to the new scenario and prevent the deterioration of the economy or its reconstruction. Government policies need to be adapted to the economy's developmental level and depend on the type of entrepreneurship that needs to be encouraged. Policy makers need to create coherent, holistic and conducive frameworks for entrepreneurs to thrive in a post COVID -19 world. In sum, there is much potential for small businesses to contribute to the \\"post-covid economy\\", especially if they are empowered through targeted support measures.","output":"Early Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic on Entrepreneurship in Slovenia;based on Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To assess whether mistrust in the government and scientists reinforces social and racial inequalities in vaccination practises Design A follow-up of a random population-based cohort survey. Setting In July 2021, in France. Participants 80,971 participants aged 18 years and more. Main outcome measures Adjusted odds ratios of Covid-19 vaccination status (received at least one dose/ intends to get vaccinated/ does not know whether to get vaccinated/refuses vaccination) were assessed using multinomial regressions to test associations with social and mistrust factors and to study how these two factors interacted with each other. Results In all, 72.2% were vaccinated at the time of the survey. The population of unvaccinated people was younger, less educated, had lower incomes, and more often belonged to racialised minorities, as compared to vaccinated people. Mistrust of government and scientists to curb the spread of the epidemic were the factors most associated with refusing to be vaccinated: OR=8.86 (7.13 to 11.00) for the government and OR=9.07 (7.71 to 10.07) for scientists, compared to vaccinated people. Mistrust was more prevalent among the poorer which consequently reinforced social inequalities in vaccination. The 10% poorest who did not trust the government reached an OR of 16.2 (11.9 to 22) for refusing to be vaccinated compared to the 10% richest who did. Conclusion There is a need to develop depoliticised outreach programmes targeted at the most socially disadvantaged groups, and to design vaccination strategies conceived with people from different social and racial backgrounds to enable them to make fully informed choices.","output":"When mistrust in the government and scientists reinforce social inequalities in vaccination against Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying clinical pictures.

METHODOLOGY: This retrospective and cross-sectional study included 112 patients, who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 via the Bio-Rad CFX96 TouchTM system. Cycle threshold values for the RdRp gene obtained from reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction positive patients were recorded. RESULTS: The mean age of the 112 patients was 47.57  17 years. No relationship was found in symptoms, pneumonia, oxygen need, follow-up in intensive care unit, and mortality between patient groups with cycle threshold values of < 30 and  30. Frequencies of thrombocytopenia (50%) and elevated LDH levels were higher in patients with cycle threshold values of  30 (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04, respectively). There was a weak but significant correlation between cycle threshold values and CRP levels (Pearson's r = 0.207, p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms or clinical prognosis were not significantly related to the SARS-CoV-2 viral load levels tested at admission or for the first time within the scope of this study.

Although the value and effectiveness of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in severe respiratory illness from COVID-19 remains unclear at this time, there is emerging evidence suggesting that it could be utilized as an ultimate treatment in appropriately selected patients not responding to conventional care. We present a case of a 32-year-old COVID-19 positive male with a history of diabetes mellitus who was intubated for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patients hypoxemia failed to improve despite positive pressure ventilation, prone positioning, and use of neuromuscular blockade for ventilator asynchrony. He was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team for considering ECMO for refractory ARDS. He was initiated on venovenous ECMO via dual-site cannulation performed at the bedside. Although his ECMO course was complicated by bleeding, he showed a remarkable improvement in his lung function. ECMO was successfully decannulated after 17 days of initiation. The patient was discharged home after 47 days of hospitalization without any supplemental oxygen and was able to undergo active physical rehabilitation. A multidisciplinary approach is imperative in the initiation and management of ECMO in COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS. While ECMO is labor-intensive, using it in the right phenotype and in specialized centers may lead to positive results.

We aimed to review the public health interventions used during the COVID-19 outbreak and describe the impact on seasonal influenza activity in Korea. METHODS: National response strategies and public health interventions, along with daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Korea were reviewed during the pandemic. National influenza surveillance data were compared between seven sequential seasons. Characteristics of each season, including the rate of influenza-like illness (ILI), duration of epidemic, date of termination of epidemic, distribution of influenza virus strain and hospitalization were analyzed. RESULTS: After various public health interventions including enforced public education on hand hygiene, cough etiquette and staying at home with respiratory symptoms, universal mask use in public places, refrain from non-essential social activities and school closure, the duration of the influenza epidemic in 2019/2020 decreased by 6-12 weeks and the influenza activity peak rated 49.8 ILI/1,000 visits compared to 71.9-86.2 ILI/1,000 visits of previous seasons. During the period of enforced social distancing from week 9 to 17 of 2020, influenza hospitalization cases were 11.9-26.9-fold lower compared with previous seasons. During the 2019/2020 season, influenza B accounted for only 4%, in contrast with previous seasons in which influenza B accounted for 26.6% to 54.9% of all cases.

Finally, we confirmed these findings in an independent external autopsy cohort (n=9). Findings: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was mainly localized in epithelial cells, endothelial and mesenchymal cells across all organs. Next to lung, trachea, kidney, heart, or liver, viral RNA was also found in tonsils, salivary glands, oropharynx, thyroid, adrenal gland, testicles, prostate, ovaries, small bowel, lymph nodes, skin and skeletal muscle. Viral RNA was predominantly found in cells expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, or both. The SARS-CoV-2 replicating RNA was also detected in these organs. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were not suitable for reliable and specific SARS-CoV-2 detection in autopsies. The findings were validated using in situ hybridization on external COVID-19 autopsy samples. Finally, apart from the lung, correlation of virus detection and histopathological assessment did not reveal any specific alterations that could be attributed to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 could be observed in virtually all organs, colocalizing with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mainly in epithelial but also in mesenchymal and endothelial cells, and viral replication was found across all organ systems.

Ozone concentrations are highest in summer, driven by fast photochemical production of hydrogen oxide radicals (HOx) that can overcome the radical titration caused by high emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from fuel combustion. Ozone has been very low during winter haze (particulate) pollution episodes. However, the abrupt decrease of NOx emissions following the COVID-19 lockdown in January 2020 reveals a switch to fast ozone production during winter haze episodes with maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) ozone concentrations of 60 to 70 parts per billion. We reproduce this switch with the GEOS-Chem model, where the fast production of ozone is driven by HOx radicals from photolysis of formaldehyde, overcoming radical titration from the decreased NOx emissions. Formaldehyde is produced by oxidation of reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which have very high emissions in the North China Plain. This remarkable switch to an ozone-producing regime in January-February following the lockdown illustrates a more general tendency from 2013 to 2019 of increasing winter-spring ozone in the North China Plain and increasing association of high ozone with winter haze events, as pollution control efforts have targeted NOx emissions (30% decrease) while VOC emissions have remained constant.

Pharmacotherapy has not yet been able to find a definitive treatment for COVID-19. Since SARS-CoV-2 affects several organs, treatment strategies that target the virus in a wider range are expected to be ultimately more successful. To this end, a two-step treatment strategy has been presented. In the first phase of the disease, when the patient is newly infected with the virus and the cytokine storm has not yet been developed, a chimeric peptide is used to inhibit virus entry into the host cell cytosol (by inhibiting endosomal pH acidification) and viral replication. After the virus entry and decrease of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) level, some people are unable to properly compensate for the ACE2 pathway and progress toward the cytokine storm. In the beginning of the cytokine storm, sACE2 protein is very effective in regulating the immune system toward the anti-inflammatory pathway, including M2 macrophages. Hence, the genes of 8P9R chimeric peptide and sACE2 would be inserted in an episomal vector with a separate promoter for each gene: the chimeric peptide gene promoter is a CMV promoter, while the sACE2 gene promoter is a NF-B-sensitive promoter. The NF-B-sensitive promoter induces the expression of sACE2 gene soon after elevation of NF-B which is the main transcription factor of inflammatory genes. Thus, as the expression of inflammatory cytokines increases, the expression of sACE2 increases simultaneously. In this condition, sACE2 can prevent the cytokine storm by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory pathways. To deliver the designed vector to the target cells, mesenchymal stem cell-derived (MSC-derived) exosome-liposome hybrids are used. Herein, the strategy can be considered as a personalized clinical therapy for COVID-19, that can prevent morbidity and mortality in the future.","output":"Developing Cytokine Storm-Sensitive Therapeutic Strategy in COVID-19 Using 8P9R Chimeric Peptide and Soluble ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020 Italy went into lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic and children changed rapidly their lifestyles with possible negative effects on their health status.

METHODS: Aggregate data from clinical encounters and call records to an emergency triage phone line from March 30 through May 8, 2020 were used to describe the characteristics of dental emergencies, clinical encounters and procedures performed. RESULTS: A total of 466 patient interactions occurred during this period, resulting in 199 patients advised by phone and 267 clinical encounters. The most common dental emergencies were severe dental pain from pulpal inflammation (27.7% of clinical encounters) followed by surgical post-operative visit (13.1%). The most frequent procedures were extractions (13.9% of clinical encounters) and surgical follow up (13.5%). 50.2% of the clinical encounters were categorized as aerosol-generating, and 86.1% of encounters would have required treatment in a hospital emergency department if dental care was not available.

We sought to investigate the value of directly observed, once-weekly fluoxetine dosing in MDD. STUDY DESIGN: Feasibility trial of adult hemodialysis patients with untreated MDD. The diagnosis of MDD was determined using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 16 patients at 15 hemodialysis facilities in Northeast Ohio. INTERVENTION: Patients were initially prescribed 20 mg of fluoxetine once daily for 2 weeks to assess their tolerance. The patients took this daily fluoxetine unobserved at home. They were then transitioned to 90 mg of fluoxetine once weekly for 10 weeks. The patients took this weekly fluoxetine during hemodialysis treatment and were observed by the study staff. The dose was increased to 180 mg once weekly among patients with an inadequate response based on the judgment of the prescribing clinician. OUTCOMES: Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview diagnosis of MDD at the end of the trial and changes in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores over 12 weeks. RESULTS: One patient withdrew from active treatment after 2 daily doses of 20 mg of fluoxetine because of side effects of stomach cramping, vomiting, dizziness, and lightheadedness but completed the baseline and final assessments. The remaining 15 patients received all scheduled weekly fluoxetine doses during the trial. At 12 weeks, 14 of 16 patients (87.5%) no longer met the criteria for MDD (P < 0.001).

The primary outcomes are QBL and obstetric hemorrhage. The secondary outcomes analyzed were a maternal composite outcome that consisted of obstetric hemorrhage, telemetry-level (intermediate care unit) or intensive care unit, transfusion, length of stay greater than 5 days, or intraamniotic infection, and individual components of the maternal composite outcome. Groups were compared using Student's t-test, Chi-squared tests, or Fisher's exact. Logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding variables. RESULTS: Of 813 women who delivered a live infant between April 1 and July 22, 2020, 53 women were diagnosed with COVID-19 on admission to the hospital. Women with a COVID-19 diagnosis at their time of delivery were significantly more likely to identify as a race other than white (p = 0.01), to deliver preterm (p = 0.05), to be diagnosed with preeclampsia with severe features (p < 0.01), and to require general anesthesia (p < 0.01).

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: All ICUs in Iceland (Landspitali University Hospital and Akureyri Regional Hospital). PATIENTS: All patients admitted to the ICU for management of coronavirus disease 2019 between March 14, 2020, and April 13, 2020, with follow-up through May 5, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 27 patients were admitted to the ICU for coronavirus disease 2019 out of 1,788 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive cases, rendering an overall admission ratio of 1.5% (95% CI, 1.0C2.2%). The population rate of ICU admission for coronavirus disease 2019 was 7.4 (95% CI, 4.9C10.8) admissions per 100,000 individuals. The hospital mortality of patients admitted to the ICU was 15% (95% CI, 4C34%), and the mortality of patients receiving mechanical ventilation was 19% (95% CI, 4C46%). CONCLUSIONS: We report a lower overall ratio of ICU admissions for coronavirus disease 2019 among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive patients and a lower hospital mortality for patients treated in the ICU for coronavirus disease 2019 compared with initial reports from Italy and China.

While early solutions such as AromaRama and Smell-O-Vision were beset by technical challenges, low-tech scratch and sniff (Odorama) and, more recently, Edible Cinema-type solutions (where the audience get to consume flavourful, and often aromatic, morsels in time with the events on screen) have proved somewhat more successful. Nevertheless, there are a number of key psychological factors that will likely inhibit the uptake of scented cinema in the future, even should the technical and financial issues (associated with retrofitting cinemas, and providing the appropriate fragrances) one day be satisfactorily resolved. These include the phenomenon of inattentional anosmia as well as the fundamental misattribution error, whereby people (who are, by-and-large, visually-dominant) tend to attribute their enjoyment to the action seen on screen, rather than to smell, and hence are unlikely to pay a premium for the latter.","output":"Scent and the Cinema"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: During the early days of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Singapore, Tan Tock Seng Hospital implemented an enhanced pneumonia surveillance (EPS) programme enrolling all patients who were admitted from the Emergency Department (ED) with a diagnosis of pneumonia but not meeting the prevalent COVID-19 suspect case definition. HYPOTHESIS/GAP STATEMENT: There is a paucity of data supporting the implementation of such a programme. AIMS: To compare and contrast our hospital-resource utilization of an EPS programme for COVID-19 infection detection with a suitable comparison group. METHODOLOGY: We enrolled all patients admitted under the EPS programme from TTSHs ED from 7 February 2020 (date of EPS implementation) to 20 March 2020 (date of study ethics application) inclusive. We designated a comparison cohort over a similar duration the preceding year. Relevant demographic and clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical records. RESULTS: There was a 3.2 times higher incidence of patients with an admitting diagnosis of pneumonia from the ED in the EPS cohort compared to the comparison cohort (P<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the median length of stay of 7 days (P=0.160). Within the EPS cohort, stroke and fluid overload occur more frequently as alternative primary diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study successfully evaluated our hospital-resource utilization demanded by our EPS programme in relation to an appropriate comparison group.

The first phase of CONCEPTION cohort aims to compare country-specific mental health status in pregnant women following the start of the pandemic.Methods: Pregnant women, >18 years were recruited, and data collected using a web-based strategy. Although Canadian women were primarily targeted, pregnant women worldwide were eligible. The current analysis includes data on women enrolled between 06/2020-11/2020. Self-reported data included COVID-19 testing/diagnosis, mental health measures (Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD-7)), prenatal care/birth plan changes. We compared maternal mental health stratifying on country/continents of residence;and identified determinants of mental health with multivariable linear regression models.Findings: Of 2,109 pregnant women recruited (mean gestational age, 247 weeks (SD 97)), 1,932 were from Canada, 48 the United States (US), 73 Europe, 35 Africa, and 21 Asia/Oceania. Among the 226 pregnant women who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, 26 were positive (115% test positivity rate);COVID-19 prevalence was 12% (26/2,109). Mean depressive symptom scores were lower in Canada (EPDS 82, SD 52) compared to the US (EPDS 105, SD 48) and Europe (EPDS 104, SD 65) (p<005). Maternal anxiety, stress, decreased income and access to health care due to the pandemic were independently increasing maternal depression. Mean anxiety symptoms were higher in the US (GAD-7 65, SD 43) than Canada (GAD-7 43, SD 38) (p<005). Maternal depression, stress, and earlier recruitment during the pandemic were independently associated with increased maternal anxiety.Interpretation: In this first international study on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, CONCEPTION has shown significant country/continent-specific variations in depression and anxiety during pregnancy. Given that gestational depression/anxiety have been associated with preterm birth and childhood cognitive problems, strategies are needed to reduce COVID-19s mental health burden.

It has been shown that nearly 80% of S. aureus infections following surgery are the same as those in the anterior nares of patients, suggesting that the anterior nares is the source of the infection strain. This has led to the use of mupirocin ointment being applied nasally to reduce infections; mupirocin resistance is being observed. This study was undertaken to determine whether gel composed of 5% glycerol monolaurate solubilized in a glycol-based, nonaqueous gel (5% GML gel) could be used as an alternative. In our study, 40 healthy human volunteers swabbed their anterior nares for 3 days with the 5% GML gel. Prior to swabbing and 8 to 12 h after swabbing, S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal CFU per milliliter were determined by plating the swabs on mannitol salt agar. Fourteen of the volunteers had S. aureus in their nares prior to 5% GML gel treatment, most persons with the organisms present in both nares; five had pure cultures of S. aureus All participants without pure culture of S. aureus were cocolonized with S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Five of the S. aureus strains produced the superantigens commonly associated with toxic shock syndrome, though none of the participants became ill. For both S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, the 5% GML gel treatment resulted in a 3-log-unit reduction in microorganisms. For S. aureus, the reduction persisted for 2 or 3 days.IMPORTANCE In this microflora study, we show that a 5% glycerol monolaurate nonaqueous gel is safe for use in the anterior nares. The gel was effective in reducing Staphylococcus aureus nasally, a highly significant hospital-associated pathogen. The gel may be a useful alternative or additive to mupirocin ointment for nasal use prior to surgery, noting that 80% of hospital-associated S. aureus infections are due to the same organism found in the nose. This gel also kills all enveloped viruses tested and should be considered for studies to reduce infection and transmission of coronaviruses and influenza viruses.","output":"Decolonization of Human Anterior Nares of Staphylococcus aureus with Use of a Glycerol Monolaurate Nonaqueous Gel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Murine norovirus (MNV), identified in 2003, is the only norovirus which replicates efficiently in tissue culture and as a result has been used extensively as a model for human noroviruses, a major cause of acute gastroenteritis.

Materials and Methods Microarray data was collected to identify key genes and lncRNAs involved in AMI pathogenesis. The differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were employed to identify the upregulated and downregulated genes and pathways in AMI. The protein-protein interaction network and protein-RNA interaction analysis were utilized to reveal key long noncoding RNAs. Results In the present study, we utilized gene expression profiles of circulating endothelial cells (CEC) from 49 patients of AMI and 50 controls and identified a total of 552 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Based on these DEGs, we also observed that inflammatory response-related genes and pathways were highly upregulated in AMI. Mapping the DEGs to the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and identifying the subnetworks, we found that OMD and WDFY3 were the hub nodes of two subnetworks with the highest connectivity, which were found to be involved in circadian rhythm and organ- or tissue-specific immune response. Furthermore, 23 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between AMI and control groups. Specifically, we identified some functional lncRNAs, including XIST and its antisense RNA, TSIX, and three lncRNAs (LINC00528, LINC00936, and LINC01001), which were predicted to be interacting with TLR2 and participate in Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. In addition, we also employed the MMPC algorithm to identify six gene signatures for AMI diagnosis. Particularly, the multivariable SVM model based on the six genes has achieved a satisfying performance (AUC = 0.97). Conclusion In conclusion, we have identified key regulatory lncRNAs implicated in AMI, which not only deepens our understanding of the lncRNA-related molecular mechanism of AMI but also provides computationally predicted regulatory lncRNAs for AMI researchers.","output":"Identification of Key Genes Involved in Acute Myocardial Infarction by Comparative Transcriptome Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019), it is crucial to take extraordinary prevention and safety measures in dental offices, and to defer all elective and non-urgent procedures.

We evaluated this virtual format's effectiveness at teaching, facilitating bilingual discussion, and encouraging cross-cultural exchange of experiences - all aimed at improving orthopedic knowledge in a low-resource country like Haiti. DESIGN: Planned collaboratively between North American and Haitian colleagues, the conference involved 4 bilingual weekly Zoom meetings comprised of 4 to 6 prerecorded presentations and live-translated discussion. Pre- and postmeeting knowledge assessments in French (Haitian language of medical instruction) were administered weekly with results compared via 2-sample t-tests. An online postconference survey evaluated attendee satisfaction with the virtual format. SETTING: Virtual. PARTICIPANTS: Weekly attendance involved approximately 50 Haitian orthopedists and trainees, with 20 to 25 completing pre- and postmeeting assessments. RESULTS: Statistically significant increases between pre/post scores were seen during 3 of 4 sessions. Session-wide significant score increases occurred for residents and attending surgeons with <10 years of experience. 85.7% of attendees reported the virtual platform exceeded expectations and 100% indicated likely or extremely likely participation in further virtual events. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot virtual HAAOT was extremely well received with high desire for future sessions. Beyond short-term knowledge retention among attendees, nonmeasurable benefits included collaboration between orthopedists and trainees in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Haiti, and Burkina Faso.

Both Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency have recently approved the first COVID\\\\19 vaccines, and a few more are going to be approved soon. METHODS: Several different approaches have been used to stimulate the immune system in mounting a humoral response. As more traditional approaches are under investigation (inactivated virus vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, recombinant virus vaccines), more recent and innovative strategies have been tried (non\\\\replicating viral vector vaccines, RNA based vaccines, DNA based vaccines). RESULTS: Since vaccinations campaigns started in December 2020 in both the US and Europe, gastroenterologists will be one of the main sources of information regarding SARS\\\\CoV 2 vaccination for patients in their practice, including vulnerable patients such as those with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), patients with chronic liver disease, and GI cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we must ourselves be well educated and updated in order to provide unambiguous counseling to these categories of vulnerable patients. In this commentary, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of both approved COVID\\\\19 vaccines and the ones still under development, and explore potential risks, benefits and prioritization of vaccination.","output":"What gastroenterologists should know about SARSCCoV 2 vaccine: World Endoscopy Organization perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, is a pandemic that has weighed heavily on the socio-economic affairs of the world. Research into the production of relevant vaccines is progressively being advanced with the development of the Pfizer and BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Sputnik V, Janssen, Sinopharm, Valneva, Novavax and Sanofi Pasteur vaccines. There is, however, a need for a computational intelligence solution approach to mediate the process of facilitating quick detection of the disease. Different computational intelligence methods, which comprise natural language processing, knowledge engineering, and deep learning, have been proposed in the literature to tackle the spread of coronavirus disease. More so, the application of deep learning models have demonstrated an impressive performance compared to other methods. This paper aims to advance the application of deep learning and image pre-processing techniques to characterise and detect novel coronavirus infection. Furthermore, the study proposes a framework named CovFrameNet., which consist of a pipelined image pre-processing method and a deep learning model for feature extraction, classification, and performance measurement. The novelty of this study lies in the design of a CNN architecture that incorporates an enhanced image pre-processing mechanism. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Chest X-Ray dataset and COVID-19 Radiography database were used to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning model. Results obtained revealed that the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.1, recall/precision of 0.85, F-measure of 0.9, and specificity of 1.0. Thus, the study's outcome showed that a CNN-based method with image pre-processing capability could be adopted for the pre-screening of suspected COVID-19 cases, and the confirmation of RT-PCR-based detected cases of COVID-19.","output":"CovFrameNet: An Enhanced Deep Learning Framework for COVID-19 Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the pediatric age, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) testing is most commonly ordered by general pediatricians to evaluate children with musculoskeletal system complaints. Given the limited utility of the test, we aimed to estimate the effectivity of ordering ANA testing in childhood. METHODS: Children referred to our department to be examined due to ANA positivity between 2008 and 2020 were included in the study. Those with less than one-year follow-up period, those with previously known rheumatic or autoimmune disease, and those diagnosed as an autoimmune and/or rheumatic disease at the first visit were excluded. Data were obtained from their medical records, retrospectively. The parents of all of the patients were called via phone, data were verified, and missing information was collected. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-eight patients (230 females) were eligible for the study. The median age at ANA positivity was found is 9.31 (1.3-17.86) years old and the median follow-up duration was 4.85 (1-11.91) years. Most of the patients had no underlying disease (n=337, 94.1%). The most common reason for ordering ANA testing was to evaluate musculoskeletal system symptoms (n=225, 62.8%). None of our patients referred to us due to ANA positivity developed any autoimmune conditions or ANA associated rheumatic disease. Hypermobility syndrome is the most common final diagnosis among our ANA-positive patients CONCLUSION: We suggest that instead of using it as a screening tool, ANA testing should be performed if only there is a strong suspicion of autoimmune diseases or certain rheumatic conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus.","output":"Anti-nuclear Antibody Testing in Children: How Much Is It Really Necessary?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The consequences of COVID-19 infection varies substantially based on individual social risk factors and predisposing health conditions.

Previously developed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) point-of-care devices are based on the specific molecular recognition using subunit protein antibodies and protein receptors that selectively capture the viral proteins. However, these necessarily involve complex and lengthy development and processing times and are notoriously prone to a loss of biological activity upon sensor immobilization and device interfacing, potentially limiting their use in applications at scale. Here, we report a synthetic strategy for nanoparticle corona interfaces that enables the molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 proteins without any antibody and receptor design. Our nanosensor constructs consist of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)phospholipid heteropolymers adsorbed onto near-infrared (nIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) that recognize the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 using unique three-dimensional (3D) nanosensor interfaces. This results in rapid and label-free nIR fluorescence detection. This antibody-free nanosensor shows up to 50% sensor responses within 5 min of viral protein injections with limit of detection (LOD) values of 48 fM and 350 pM for N and S proteins, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: This narrative review summarizes the current background, evaluation, and management of TTS for emergency clinicians. DISCUSSION: TTS, also known as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, is a reaction associated with exposure to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) and AD26.COV2S (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine, which may result in thrombocytopenia and thrombotic events. There are several case series of patients diagnosed with TTS, but the overall incidence is rare. TTS is characterized by exposure to one of the aforementioned vaccines 4-30 days prior to presentation, followed by thrombosis, mild-to-severe thrombocytopenia, and a positive platelet factor-4 (PF4)-heparin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Thrombosis typically involves atypical locations, including cerebral venous thrombosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis. Evaluation should include complete blood count, peripheral smear, D-dimer, fibrinogen, coagulation panel, renal and liver function, and electrolytes, as well as PF4-heparin ELISA if available. Consultation with hematology is recommended if suspected or confirmed. Treatment may include intravenous immunoglobulin and anticoagulation, while avoiding heparin-based agents and platelet transfusion.

Although recent studies have begun to explore the neural mechanisms underlying these responses (Cowell and Decety, 2015; Gredeb?ck et al., 2015), these studies were based on relatively small samples and focused on distinct aspects of sociomoral responding. The current preregistered study systematically examined infants neural responses both to prosocial/antisocial interactions and to prosocial/antisocial characters, using larger samples and two distinct age groups. We found that 6- (but not 12-) month-olds showed higher relative right frontal alpha power (indexing approach motivation) when viewing helping versus hindering scenarios. Consistent with past EEG work, infants showed no group-level manual preferences for the helper. However, analyses of infants neural responses toward images of the helper versus hinderer revealed that both 6- and 12-month-olds showed differential event-related potential (ERP) responses in the P400 and N290 components (indexing social perception) but not in the Nc component (indexing attentional allocation), suggestive that infants neural responses to prosocial versus antisocial characters reflect social processing. Together, these findings provide a more comprehensive account of infants responses to prosocial/antisocial interactions and characters, and support the hypothesis that both motivational and socially relevant processes are implicated in infants sociomoral responding.","output":"Infants neural responses to helping and hindering scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-COV-2 pandemic is a worldwide public health problem due to the large medical burden and limited number of therapies available. Corticosteroids have a rather unclear efficacy in viral non-SARS-COV-2 pneumonias and therefore their use is not universally recommended. In SARS-COV-2 pneumonia however, it is expected that they can reduce the deleterious consequences of the virus-related systemic inflammation. AREAS COVERED: a MEDLINE search covering the period 1995-2020 was completed to identify relevant papers. SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis is very complex and is represented by the interplay of many cytokine-driven inflammation pathways. Its most severe form so called cytokine storm, is an exaggerate reaction of the host infected by the virus rapidly resulting in multiple organ dysfunction (MODS). Corticosteroids have the potential to blunt the inflammation response in such patients, but their efficacy is not the same for all patients. Further on the certainties and uncertainties regarding the efficacy of this therapy in SARS-COV-2 pneumonia are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: In patients with severe SARS-COV-2 pneumonia, corticosteroids can be efficacious, but it is still not clear if they can be safely used in patients with comorbid cardiovascular disease or how the optimal duration of therapy can be established.","output":"Corticosteroids in SARS-COV2 infection: certainties and uncertainties in clinical practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Acquired uterine AVM is an abnormal and non-functional connection between uterine arteries and veins.

CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Uterine AVMs are extremely rare and should be considered in cases of heavy and persistent uterine bleeding. Uterine AVMs are either acquired or, more rarely, congenital, due to abnormal differentiation of the primary vascular structures during embryogenesis. The invasive technique allows confirmation of the diagnosis and identification of the major feeding vessels when embolization may be indicated as a treatment option.

Specifically, the 2020/21 season was entirely dominated by SARS-CoV-2, while influenza activity reached an all-time low, despite initial warnings that a double concurrent epidemic could be possible. The current season, 2021/22, started with the shift of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants from delta to omicron, which then rapidly spread globally, as most countries, including Romania, removed all restrictions and compulsory non-pharmaceutical interventions. In this report we present the clinical reality observed in March 2022 in a tertiary paediatric hospital in Bucharest, Romania, where we observed a sudden surge in influenza cases, after two consecutive years (March 2020 to March 2022) when influenza had stopped circulating in our country. Thus, in March 2022 the positivity rate of rapid influenza antigen tests unexpectedly increased to 33.5%, paralleled by a decrease to 7.5% in the positivity rate of rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests. This significant increase in the influenza attack rate was observed from the first week (14.9% positivity rate), through the fourth week of March (42.1% positivity rate, p < 0.001), while the COVID-19 attack rate displayed a significant decreasing trend (from 11.2% to 4.8%, p < 0.001). These data serve as a warning about relaxing restrictions in a precipitous approach with minimised vigilance. The evolution of these observations needs to be followed very carefully in all countries, particularly in settings where epidemiological interactions and non-pharmaceutical interventions have so far led to the extensive circulation of only one of these viruses, and we should now be prepared to perform a correct differential diagnosis between influenza and COVID-19, in order to ensure the best quality of care and personalized management of each case of respiratory infection.

Case Report: A 52-year-old male patient, with a family history of autoimmune diseases, presented with a new onset of worsening headache with nausea and vomiting post-vaccination. The patient was diagnosed with VITT based on laboratory findings demonstrating thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, and dural sinus thrombosis identified on neuroimaging. The patient was successfully treated with high-dose immunoglobulin, steroids, and non-heparin anticoagulants, without any neurologic sequelae. Finally, a confirmatory test with anti-platelet factor 4 antibody was strongly positive. Conclusion: Physicians should be vigilant when treating patients presenting with new-onset thunderclap headache, progressive worsening headache, and awakening headache accompanied by nausea or vomiting after vaccination, even if no definite clinical neurological deficits are identified. Emergency laboratory test results for demonstrating elevated D-dimer levels, decreased platelet count, and neuroimaging correlation are integral for diagnosis and must be the standard protocol. Treatment with non-heparin anticoagulants, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, and steroids that halt or slow the immune-mediated prothrombotic process should be initiated immediately. Considering the high mortality rate of VITT, treatment should be initiated prior to confirmatory test results.","output":"Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis, Pulmonary Embolism, and Thrombocytopenia After COVID-19 Vaccination in a Taiwanese Man: A Case Report and Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with several types of cancer. Several clinical studies have targeted EBV antigens as immune therapeutic targets with limited efficacy of EBV malignancies, suggesting that additional targets might be important. BamHI-A rightward frame 1 (BARF1) is an EBV antigen that is highly expressed in EBV(+) nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC). BARF1 antigen can transform human epithelial cells in vivo. BARF1-specific antibodies and cytotoxic T cells were detected in some EBV(+) NPC patients. However, BARF1 has not been evaluated as an antigen in the context of therapeutic immunization. Its possible importance in this context is unclear. Here, we developed a synthetic-DNA-based expression cassette as immunotherapy targeting BARF1 (pBARF1). Immunization with pBARF1 induced potent antigen-specific humoral and T cell responses in vivo. Immunization with pBARF1 plasmid impacted tumor progression through the induction of CD8(+) T cells in novel BARF1(+) carcinoma models. Using an in vivo imaging system, we observed that pBARF1-immunized animals rapidly cleared cancer cells. We demonstrated that pBARF1 can induce antigen-specific immune responses that can impact cancer progression. Further study of this immune target is likely important as part of therapeutic approaches for EBV(+) malignancies.","output":"DNA immunotherapy targeting BARF1 induces potent anti-tumor responses against Epstein-Barr-virus-associated carcinomas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, designated as SARS-CoV-2, has caused millions of infections worldwide, including in patients with concomitant infections.

METHODS: We conducted a multi-center retrospective study involving all adults with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU between March and May 2020. Patients were divided into normoglycemic (average blood glucose < 140 mg/dL) and hyperglycemic (average blood glucose > 140 mg/dL) groups. Outcomes such as mortality, need and duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital and ICU stays were measured. RESULTS: Among 495 patients, 58.4% were male with a median age of 68 years (IQR: 58.00-77.00), and baseline average blood glucose was 186.6 (SD+130.8). Pre-existing diabetes was present in 35.8% of the studied cohort. Combined ICU and hospital mortality rates were 23.8%; mortality rate and mechanical ventilation were significantly higher in the hyperglycemic group (31.4 % vs. 16.6%, p=0.001) and (50.0% vs. 37.2%, p=0.004) respectively. Age above 60 years (HR:3.21 [95% CI 1.78, 5.78]) and hyperglycemia (HR:1.79 [95% CI 1.14, 2.82]) were the only significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Increased risk for hyperglycemia was found in patients with steroids use (OR:1.521 [95% CI 1.054, 2.194]), triglycerides > 150 mg/dL (OR:1.62 [95% CI 1.109, 2.379]), and African-American race (OR:0.79 [95% CI 0.65, 0.95]). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients is significantly associated with prolonged ICU length of stay, higher need of mechanical ventilation, and increased risk of mortality in the critical care setting.

The efficacy and safety of sacubitril-valsartan in patients with HF are controversial. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess and compare the effect and adverse events of sacubitril-valsartan, valsartan, and enalapril in patients with HF. METHODS AND RESULTS We conducted a systematic search using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomized controlled trials involving the use of sacubitril-valsartan in patients with HF were included. We assessed the pooled odds ratio (OR) of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization for HF in fixed-effects models and the pooled risk ratio (RR) of symptomatic hypotension, worsening renal function, and hyperkalaemia in fixed-effects models. Of the 315 identified records, six studies involving 14 959 patients were eligible for inclusion. Sacubitril-valsartan reduced the endpoints of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in three trials with pooled ORs of 0.83 (P = 0.0006) and 0.78 (P < 0.0001), respectively. Regarding the composite outcome of hospitalization for HF in five trials, the pooled OR was 0.79 (P < 0.00001). Compared with enalapril or valsartan, sacubitril-valsartan was associated with a high risk of symptomatic hypotension (RR 1.47, P < 0.00001), low risk of worsening renal function (RR 0.81, P = 0.005), and low rate of serious hyperkalaemia (6.0 mmol/L) (RR 0.76, P = 0.0007) in all six trials. CONCLUSIONS Compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, sacubitril-valsartan significantly decreased the risk of death from all causes or cardiovascular causes in HFrEF and hospitalization for HF in both patients with HFrEF and HF with preserved ejection fraction. Sacubitril-valsartan reduced the risk of renal dysfunction and serious hyperkalaemia but was associated with more symptomatic hypotension.","output":"Efficacy and safety of sacubitril-valsartan in heart failure: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertension is a common comorbidity in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection.

In this retrospective cohort study, the anonymized medical records of COVID-19 patients were retrieved from an acute field hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical data, drug prescriptions, and laboratory investigations were collected for individual patients with diagnosed hypertension on admission. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risks of adverse outcomes associated with BP control during the hospital stay. Of 803 hypertensive patients, 67 (8.3%) were admitted to the ICU, 30 (3.7%) had respiratory failure, 26 (3.2%) had heart failure, and 35 (4.8%) died. After adjustment for confounders, the significant predictors of heart failure were average systolic blood pressure (SBP) (hazard ratio (HR) per 10 mmHg 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15, 3.13) and pulse pressure (HR per 10 mmHg 2.71, 95% CI: 1.39, 5.29). The standard deviations of SBP and diastolic BP were independently associated with mortality and ICU admission. The risk estimates of poor BP control were comparable between patients receiving ARBs and those not receiving ARBs, with the only exception of a high risk of heart failure in the non-ARB group. Poor BP control was independently associated with higher risks of adverse outcomes of COVID-19.

This Slovenian nationwide population study is the first longitudinal 6-month serosurvey using probability-based sample across all age categories. METHODS: Each participant supplied two blood samples: 1,316 samples in April 2020 (first round) and 1,211 in October/November 2020 (second round). The first-round sera were tested using Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (ELISA) and due to uncertain estimates retested using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S). The second-round sera were concomitantly tested using Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S. RESULTS: The populations of both rounds matched the overall population (n=3,000), with minor settlement type and age differences. The first-round seroprevalence corrected for ELISA's manufacturer's specificity was 2.78% (95%HDI 1.81-3.80%), corrected using pooled ELISA specificity calculated from published data 0.93% (95%CI, 0.00-2.65%), and based on Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S results 0.87% (95%HDI, 0.40-1.38%). The second-round unadjusted lower limit of seroprevalence on November 11, 2020, was 4.06% (95%HDI, 2.97-5.16%) and on October 3, 2020, unadjusted upper limit was 4.29% (95%HDI, 3.18-5.47%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Slovenia increased four-fold from late-April to October/November 2020, mainly due to a devastating second wave. Significant logistic/methodological challenges accompanied both rounds. The main lessons learned were a need for caution when relying on manufacturer-generated assay evaluation data, the importance of multiple manufacturer-independent assay performance assessments, the need for concomitant use of highly-specific serological assays targeting different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in serosurveys conducting in low-prevalence settings or during epidemic exponential growth and the usefulness of a Bayesian approach for overcoming complex methodological challenges.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Slovenia: results of two rounds of a nationwide population study on a probability-based sample, challenges and lessons learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In China, mental health of frontline medical staff might be influenced by clinicians ability to handle the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Few studies to-date have addressed the association between clinicians competencies and mental health in this context. This cross-sectional study has examined the prevalence of mental health symptoms among frontline medical staff handling the COVID-19 outbreak, and explored the associations between their competencies, and separate and concurrent depressive and anxiety symptoms. Methods: : A total of 623 frontline medical staff were included in this study, which took place from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020. Competencies, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the short form of the Chinese clinical physicians competency model, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire, respectively. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between one standard deviation increase in competency scores and the prevalence of mental health problems. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: : Among 623 staff members, the prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms was 40.93%, 31.78%, and 26.00%, respectively. Among the medical staff with higher total competency scores, the prevalence of depressive (OR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.55-0.81), anxiety (OR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.56-0.83), and comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms (OR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.55-0.83) was lower than among their lower-scoring counterparts. Subgroup analyses stratified by core competency scores revealed similar associations as the main analyses. Conclusions: : The present findings highlight the association between high core competency scores and lower prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms.

We recently studied the global distribution of protein domain structures in thousands of completely sequenced viral and cellular proteomes with comparative genomics, phylogenomics, and multidimensional scaling methods. A tree of life describing the evolution of proteomes revealed viruses emerging from the base of the tree as a fourth supergroup of life. A tree of domains indicated an early origin of modern viral lineages from ancient cells that co-existed with the cellular ancestors. However, it was recently argued that the rooting of our trees and the basal placement of viruses was artifactually induced by small genome (proteome) size. Here we show that these claims arise from misunderstanding and misinterpretations of cladistic methodology. Trees are reconstructed unrooted, and thus, their topologies cannot be distorted a posteriori by the rooting methodology. Tracing proteome size in trees and multidimensional views of evolutionary relationships as well as tests of leaf stability and exclusion/inclusion of taxa demonstrated that the smallest proteomes were neither attracted toward the root nor caused any topological distortions of the trees. Simulations confirmed that taxa clustering patterns were independent of proteome size and were determined by the presence of known evolutionary relatives in data matrices, highlighting the need for broader taxon sampling in phylogeny reconstruction. Instead, phylogenetic tracings of proteome size revealed a slowdown in innovation of the structural domain vocabulary and four regimes of allometric scaling that reflected a Heaps law. These regimes explained increasing economies of scale in the evolutionary growth and accretion of kernel proteome repertoires of viruses and cellular organisms that resemble growth of human languages with limited vocabulary sizes. Results reconcile dynamic and static views of domain frequency distributions that are consistent with the axiom of spatiotemporal continuity that is tenet of evolutionary thinking.","output":"Phylogenetic Tracings of Proteome Size Support the Gradual Accretion of Protein Structural Domains and the Early Origin of Viruses from Primordial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, called COVID-19 was discovered in the city of Wuhan China, which spread to various cities as well as other countries At present novel coronavirus has become the most important health hazard, causing severe issues about a concern to the human being and has become a pandemic Due to the prone of this deadly virus, uncertainty is significantly the facility for a health condition There are solutions to handle insecurity about health from coronavirus for assessing the condition through FIS (Fuzzy Inference System) Therefore, for this particular reason we study and develop the fuzzy system to help assess the safety of health-related issues of the patient's condition according to the changes of environment The FIS is permitted to assess the patient's history like temperature of the body, travel history, disinfection frequency, breathing problem, suffering cough and cold and ventilation rate A fuzzy system consists of several steps like fuzzification, fuzzy database rule and also defuzzification Furthermore, a study of FIS identifies the risk of health status according to the patient's condition In this paper, we proposed a fuzzy rule system which is implemented with MATLAB fuzzy tools for simulation to assess the health conditions of the patient and prevention from COVID-19 disease ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Prevention from COVID-19 in India: Fuzzy Logic Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first country that was affected by pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 was China.

Recent studies have shown that UV radiation at 222 nm is effective in killing viruses but safer for humans compared to 265 nm to 280 nm radiation. Another advantage of UVC LEDs is an ability of rapidly adjust the output power of UVC LED lamps that allows to use the feedback and Artificial Intelligence models to optimize the effects of the UV radiation, save power, and ensure safety. One example, where this is important, is the application of deep UVC LED systems with feedback in vaccine production.

Recent evidence has raised doubts about the efficacy of this treatment in preschool-aged children with viral-induced wheezing and in smoking adults. The aims of the study were to: (1) document the magnitude of response to oral corticosteroids in children presenting to the emergency department with moderate or severe asthma; (2) quantify potential determinants of response to corticosteroids and (3) explore the role of gene polymorphisms associated with the responsiveness to corticosteroids. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The design is a prospective cohort study of 1008 children aged 1C17 years meeting a strict definition of asthma and presenting with a clinical score of 4 on the validated Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure. All children will receive standardised severity-specific treatment with prednisone/prednisolone and cointerventions (salbutamol with/without ipratropium bromide). Determinants, namely viral aetiology, environmental tobacco smoke and single nucleotide polymorphism, will be objectively documented. The primary efficacy endpoint is the failure of emergency department (ED) management within 72 h of the ED visit. Secondary endpoints include other measures of asthma severity and time to recovery within 7 days of the index visit. The study has 80% power for detecting a risk difference of 7.5% associated with each determinant from a baseline risk of 21%, at an  of 0.05.

These strategies, however, carry a significant risk for mental health, which can lead to increased short-term and long-term mortality and is currently not included in modeling the impact of the pandemic. METHODS. We used years of life lost (YLL) as the main outcome measure, applied to Switzerland as an example. We focused on suicide, depression, alcohol use disorder, childhood trauma due to domestic violence, changes in marital status, and social isolation, as these are known to increase YLL in the context of imposed restriction in social contact and freedom of movement. We stipulated a minimum duration of mitigation of 3 months based on current public health plans. RESULTS. The study projects that the average person would suffer 0.205 YLL due to psychosocial consequence of COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, this loss would be entirely borne by 2.1% of the population, who will suffer an average of 9.79 YLL. CONCLUSIONS. The results presented here are likely to underestimate the true impact of the mitigation strategies on YLL.

These findings suggest that improving ESG disclosure can help REITs to gain better access to the capital markets and enhance corporate financial flexibility, as lenders have paid close attention to a firms ESG disclosure and integrated evaluation of ESG factors into their lending decisions. Moreover, firm value of REITs is positively associated with their ESG disclosure level. When using the Covid-19 pandemic as a quasi-experimental setting, we find evidence that REITs with higher ESG disclosure levels before the pandemic exhibit higher firm value during the pandemic. These results indicate that investors do value active ESG disclosure by REITs. Additional analyses show that ESG disclosure level is sensitive to institutional ownership, implying that institutional investors may drive REIT ESG disclosure efforts.

The 14-day quarantine caused surgery of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) postponed. We aimed to explore the risk factors of RRD progression in a group of patients whose surgery was postponed during the top-level emergency response of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective case series. Medical records of all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of RRD who underwent a surgical treatment at Beijing Tongren Hospital's retina service from February 16, 2020, to April 30, 2020 have been reviewed retrospectively. Medical history, symptoms, and clinical signs of progression of RRD were recorded. RRD progression was defined as the presence of either choroidal detachment or proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) progression during the quarantine period. Risk factors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model, survival analysis, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Seventy-nine eyes of 79 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The median time from the patients' presentation at the clinic to admission for surgery was 14 days (3-61 days). There were 70 cases (88.6%) who did not present to the hospital within 1 week of the onset of visual symptoms. There were 69 (87.3%) macular-off cases at the presentation and 27 (34.2%) cases combined with choroidal detachment. There were 49 (62.0%) cases with PVR B, 22 (27.8%) cases with PVR C, 4 (5.1%) cases with PVR D, and 4 (5.1%) cases with anterior PVR. After the 14-day quarantine, 21 (26.6%) cases showed RRD progression, and 9 cases showed RRD regression at the time of surgery. Neither the time of onset of the visual symptom (p = 0.46) nor the time between presentation and admission (p = 0.31) was significantly different between the patients with RRD progression and patients without RRD progression.

In our contribution, we focus on the time-critical process of aircraft boarding, where regulations regarding physical distances between passengers will significantly increase boarding time. The passenger behavior is implemented in a field-validated stochastic cellular automata model, which is extended by a module to evaluate the transmission risk. We propose an improved boarding process by considering that most of the passengers are travel together and should be boarded and seated as a group. The NP-hard seat allocation of groups with minimized individual interactions between groups is solved with a genetic algorithm. Then, the improved seat allocation is used to derive an associated boarding sequence aiming at both short boarding times and low risk of virus transmission. Our results show that the consideration of groups will significantly contribute to a faster boarding (reduction of time by about 60%) and less transmission risk (reduced by 85%) compared to the standard random boarding procedures applied in the pandemic scenario.","output":"Analytical approach to solve the problem of aircraft passenger boarding during the coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the hazard impact, it is very important to manage the emergency condition Temporary sheltering is one of the preliminary and main requirements of disaster management COVID 19 poses the necessity of using fast and modular temporary sheltering in the crowded cities to improve treating and curing services for the hospitals However, successful emergency management for current societies is achievable if the resilience approach has been implemented in all procedures of emergency management The concept of resilience could make a new sense of motivation in disaster management while recent research shows that resilience makes a significant improvement in the traditional approach of safety and security during disasters Temporary shelters play an important role in the temporary settlement and also commanding the emergency condition during a disaster period This study aims to develop a resilient modular design of shelters based on a sustainable industrialized Building system (IBS) under the main critical success factors with the approach of resilience and sustainability Critical success factors (CSFs), resilience and sustainability criteria are extracted from literature and the CSFs are evaluated based on the questionnaire survey and using VIKOR as a multi-criteria decision-making method The reduction of mortar usage, IBS, and Interconnected structure are the most impressive factors Based on these factors, the symmetric orthogonal modular system was selected The robustness of the selected system was calculated under the explosive load test Interconnectivity, modularity, mortar-less erecting, disassembling and reassembling abilities are some of the advantages They improve rapidity, transformability of this structure following capacities of resilience ? 2020, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia All rights reserved","output":"Resilient and sustainable modular system for temporary sheltering in emergency condition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent advancements and applications in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have highlighted the need for explainable, interpretable, and actionable AI-ML.

Plantar fasciopathy is a common cause of foot pain associated with decreased activity level and quality of life. Patient-reported outcome measures are important in assessing the burden of a condition as well as in research on the effects of interventions. The Foot Function Index revised short form (FFI-RS) is a region specific questionnaire frequently used in research. This study aimed to cross-culturally adapt the FFI-RS into Norwegian and to test its psychometric properties. METHODS: The FFI-RS was translated into Norwegian (FFI-RSN) following international guidelines. 139 patients with foot disorders (88% with plantar fasciopathy) were included at baseline to measure internal consistency, explorative factor analysis, construct validity and floor and ceiling effects. 54 patients were included after 1 week for test-retest reliability and smallest detectable change analyses. 100 patients were included for responsiveness and minimal important change at 3 months. RESULTS: Cronbachs alpha for internal consistency was 0.97 and factor analysis supported the use of the total score of the FFI-RSN. Two out of three predefined hypotheses were confirmed by assessing the construct validity with Spearmans correlation coefficient. Quadratic weighted Kappa for test-retest reliability showed 0.91 (95% CI 0.86C0.96) and the smallest detectable change was 6.5%. The minimal important change was 8.4% and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for responsiveness was 0.78 (95% CI 0.69C0.87). We found no floor or ceiling effects on the total score of the FFI-RSN. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed excellent reliability of the FFI-RSN and supports the use of the total score of the questionnaire. Furthermore, we found the FFI-RSN to have acceptable responsiveness in relation to change in general health. Smallest detectable change, minimal important change and responsiveness were presented as novel results of the total score of the FFI-RS. FFI-RSN can be used to evaluate global foot health in clinical or research settings with Norwegian patients suffering from plantar fasciopathy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov NCT04207164.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which include exosomes and microvesicles, are released from almost all cell types and play crucial roles in intercellular communication, both in the regulation of homeostasis and the pathogenesis of various diseases. Exosomes are of endosomal origin and range in size from 50 to 150 nm in diameter, while microvesicles are generated by the direct outward budding of the plasma membrane in size ranges of 100C2,000 nm in diameter. EVs can contain various proteins, metabolites, and nucleic acids, such as mRNA, non-coding RNA species, and DNA fragments. In addition, these nucleic acids in EVs can be functional in recipient cells through EV cargo. The endothelium is a distributed organ of considerable biological importance, and disrupted endothelial function is involved in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Endothelial cell-derived EVs (EC-EVs) play crucial roles in both physiological and pathological conditions by traveling to distant sites through systemic circulation. This review summarizes the pathological roles of vascular microRNAs contained in EC-EVs in respiratory diseases, mainly focusing on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Most of the data comes from the official agencies statistics and non-public institutions, however, relying our estimates in just the traditional data mentioned before, have some disadvantages. One of them is that economic uncertainty could not be represented or measured in a proper way based solely in financial or macroeconomic data, another one, is that they are susceptible to lack of information due to extraordinary events, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Comparative SV measurements with transesophageal echocardiography and TPTD were performed at least 5 times during the treatment of the patients. The data were interpreted with a BlandCAltman analysis corrected for repeated measurements. The interchangeability between both measurement modalities was calculated and the effects of extracorporeal blood flow on SV measurements with TPTD was analysed with a linear mixed effect model. GEDVI and EVLWI measurements were performed immediately before the termination of the ECMO therapy at a blood flow of 6 l/min, 4 l/min and 2 l/min and after the disconnection of the circuit in 7 patients. RESULTS: 170 pairs of comparative SV measurements were analysed. Average difference between the two modalities (bias) was 0.28 ml with an upper level of agreement of 40 ml and a lower level of agreement of -39 ml within a 95% confidence interval and an overall interchangeability rate between TPTD and Echo of 64%. ECMO blood flow did not influence the mean bias between Echo and TPTD (0.03 ml per l/min of ECMO blood flow; p = 0.992; CI ? 6.74 to 6.81). GEDVI measurement was not significantly influenced by the blood flow in the ECMO circuit, whereas EVLWI differed at a blood flow of 6 l/min compared to no ECMO flow (25.9  10.1 vs. 11.0  4.2 ml/kg, p = 0.0035). CONCLUSIONS: Irrespectively of an established ECMO therapy, comparative SV measurements with Echo and TPTD are not interchangeable. Such caveats also apply to the interpretation of EVLWI, especially with a high blood flow in the extracorporeal circulation.

Toxins used in traditional immunotoxins are practically difficult to be produced in large amount, have poor tissue penetration and a complex internalization process. We hypothesized that the smaller HALT-1, a cytolysin derived from Hydra magnipapillata, can be used as the toxin moiety in construction of a recombinant immunotoxin. RESULTS In this study, pro-inflammatory macrophage was selected as the target cell due to its major roles in numerous inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. We aimed to construct macrophage-targeted recombinant immunotoxins by combining HALT-1 with anti-CD64-scFv in two orientations, and to assess whether their cytotoxic activity and binding capability could be preserved upon molecular fusion. The recombinant immunotoxins, HALT-1-scFv and scFv-HALT-1, were successfully constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli). Our data showed that HALT-1 still exhibited significant cytotoxicity against CD64+ and CD64- cell lines upon fusion with anti-CD64 scFv, although it had half cytotoxic activity as compared to HALT-1 alone. As positioning HALT-1 at N- or C-terminus did not affect its potency, the two constructs demonstrated comparable cytotoxic activities with IC50 lower in CD64+ cell line than in CD64- cell line. In contrast, the location of targeting moieties anti-CD64 scFv at C-terminal end was crucial in maintaining the scFv binding capability. CONCLUSIONS HALT-1 could be fused with anti-CD64-scFv via a fsexible polypeptide linker. Upon the successful production of this recombinant HALT-1 scFv fusion protein, HALT-1 was proven effective for killing two human cell lines. Hence, this preliminary study strongly suggested that HALT-1 holds potential as the toxin moiety in therapeutic cell targeting.","output":"Evaluation of Hydra HALT-1 as a toxin moiety for recombinant immunotoxin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has caused disruption to medical care and loss of employment and medical insurance for some people with chronic diseases such as diabetes. Further, people with diabetes are at increased risk for severe Covid-19 disease. Our goal was to examine the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms related to the Covid-19 pandemic in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Psychosocial surveys were sent to 3,653 adults with T1D from the Adult Clinic at the Barbara Davis Center. Survey responses were collected from 899 adults from this population between September and October of 2020;65% of respondents were women, and the age range was 18-95 years. Overall, 5% of participants reported testing positive for the virus or having Covid-19 symptoms but not being tested. As shown in the table, overall 49% of adults reported depressive symptoms and 74% reported experiencing anxiety related to Covid-19. Women with T1D were more likely to report Covid-19 related depression and anxiety symptoms, despite similar infection rates in both sexes. Further, women were more likely than men to express concerns about obtaining diabetes care and paying for diabetes supplies during the pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in adults with T1D, particularly among women.

Following the good results obtained in the research project Free_Teen_Desire led by the University of Cambridge and funded by the Marie Curie Actions Program in the prevention of gender violence in adolescents through Dialogic Feminist Gatherings (DFG), the aim of study is to analyze Its transfer and impact on adolescent girls with intellectual disabilities. The DFGs are here understood as generators of a more dialogic environment for girls in general and we wonder if and how It is extended to the context of girls with disabilities. Thus, the research takes the form of a case study with a communicative approach on a DFGs. The intervention is carried out in a special school located in Valencia during the 2018C2019 and 2019C2020 academic years with a group of 19 non-mixed female students, female teachers, and the mother of one of the students. The study analyzes which are the transfer criteria to incorporate the DFGs in a special education context and what is their impact on the prevention of gender violence in girls with disabilities. The data collection techniques consist of two in-depth interviews, analysis of the field diary of 24 intervention sessions and a focus group with seven teachers. It is demonstrated that DFGs are successfully transferred to the special education context of the case study.

The total number of Covid-19-infected people in S?o Paulo has reached more than 1 million, while its total death toll stands at 25% of all the country's fatalities. Joining the Brazilian academia efforts in the fight against Covid-19, in this paper we describe a unified framework for monitoring and forecasting the Covid-19 progress in the state of S?o Paulo. More specifically, a freely available, online platform to collect and exploit Covid-19 time-series data is presented, supporting decision-makers while still allowing the general public to interact with data from different regions of the state. Moreover, a novel forecasting data-driven method has also been proposed, by combining the so-called Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased model with machine learning strategies to better fit the mathematical model's coefficients for predicting Infections, Recoveries, Deaths, and Viral Reproduction Numbers. We show that the obtained predictor is capable of dealing with badly conditioned data samples while still delivering accurate 10-day predictions. Our integrated computational system can be used for guiding government actions mainly in two basic aspects: real-time data assessment and dynamic predictions of Covid-19 curves for different regions of the state.

Pharmaceutical research against COVID-19 and the most frequently used tests for SARS-CoV-2 both depend on the genomic and peptide sequences of the virus for their robustness. Therefore, understanding the mutation rates and content of the virus is critical. Two key proteins for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication are the S protein, responsible for viral entry into the cells, and RdRp, the RNA polymerase responsible for replicating the viral genome. Due to their roles in the viral cycle, these proteins are crucial for the fitness and infectiousness of the virus. Our previous findings had shown that the two most frequently observed mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, 14408C>T in the RdRp coding region, and 23403A>G in the S gene, are correlated with higher mutation density over time. In this study, we further detail the selection dynamics and the mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 genes, comparing them between isolates carrying both mutations, and isolates carrying neither. We find that the S gene and the RdRp coding region show the highest variance between the genotypes, and their selection dynamics contrast each other over time. The S gene displays higher tolerance for positive selection in mutant isolates early during the appearance of the double mutant genotype, and undergoes increasing negative selection over time, whereas the RdRp region in the mutant isolates shows strong negative selection throughout the pandemic.","output":"Different selection dynamics of S and RdRp between SARS-CoV-2 genomes with and without the dominant mutations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the occurrence, treatment, and effectiveness of peri-implant refracture after intramedullary nail fixation for intertrochanteric fractures. Methods: The clinical data of 16 patients with peri-implant refracture after intramedullary nail fixation for intertrochanteric fractures who met the inclusion criteria between April 2014 and November 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 7 males and 9 females with an average age of 78.4 years (range, 65-93 years). The 14 cases of initial intertrochanteric fractures were classified according to the classification of AO/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA): 5 cases of type A1, 7 cases of type A2, and 2 cases of type A3; the other 2 cases were intertrochanteric combined with subtrochanteric fractures (Seinsheimer type a ). According to the classification of peri-implant refracture which was proposed by Chan et al., there were 10 cases of type 1 (6 cases of type 1A, 3 cases of type 1B, 1 case of type 1C) and 6 cases of type 2 (4 cases of type 2A and 2 cases of type 2B). The average interval between refracture and initial surgery was 14.6 months (range, 1-52 months). The incidence of peri-implant refracture in short nail group (the length of intramedullary nail used in initial surgery&#8804;240 mm) was 1.92% (11/573), while the incidence of long nail group (the length of intramedullary nail used in initial surgery&#8805;340 mm) was 1.66% (5/301), showing no significant difference between the two groups ( &#967; 2=0.073, P=0.786). The peri-implant refractures were revised with extended intramedullary nail (5 cases) or fixed with additional limited invasive stabilization system (11 cases). Results: The average operation time was 115.8 minutes (range, 78-168 minutes) and the average intraoperative blood loss was 283.1 mL (range, 120-500 mL). One patient died of myocardial infarction at 3 months after operation, and the other 15 patients were followed up 9-46 months (mean, 16.8 months). The peri-implant refractures healed at 14-20 weeks (mean, 16.4 weeks) after operation. There was no complications such as incision infection, nonunion, internal fixator loosening and rupture, screw cutting-out, and the second refracture during the follow-up. At last follow-up, all injured limbs regained walking function, and the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score was 56-92 (mean, 80.2). The results were classified as excellent in 2 cases, good in 10, fair in 2, and poor in 1, with the excellent and good rate of 80%. Conclusion: Stress concentration at the tip of initial intramedullary nail and distal interlocking screw aera is the main cause of peri-implant refracture after intramedullary nail fixation for intertrochanteric fractures. Revision with extended intramedullary nail or fixation with limited invasive stabilization system according to the length of initial intramedullary nail and the type of refracture can get satisfactory effectiveness.","output":"[Treatment of peri-implant refracture after intramedullary nail fixation for intertrochanteric fractures]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To control the spread of the novel 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19), the Government of India enforced nationwide social and transportation restrictions (lockdown) in three phases from the evening of 24 March to 31 May 2020, which resulted in a significant reduction of primary emissions. Here, we performed the analyses of particle number size distribution measurements in the particle size range of 1.2-3 nm and 10-514 nm carried out from 15 April to 31 May 2020 (lockdown, LCD) and compared with measurements from the previous year during the same time period (15 April to 31 May 2019, business-as-usual, BAU) at University of Hyderabad in Hyderabad, India. The number concentrations of sub-3nm particles were comparable between LCD and BAU, but the number concentrations of particles greater than 10 nm diameter were lower by about 85% during LCD than BAU. It indicates that the reduction in primary anthropogenic emissions did not inhibit the formation of sub-3nm particles. But the frequency of occurrence of the new particle formation and growth (NPF&G) events was three-fold lower during LCD than BAU. The ratio of formaldehyde to nitrogen dioxide indicated that India falls in a NOx-limited regime, which reduces ambient ozone concentrations (lower condensable vapors via ozone oxidation of volatile organic compounds). Besides, the lower temperature (lower hydroxyl radical concentration) and lower wind speed during LCD may have contributed to the suppression of NPF&G events. Therefore, we emphasize the need to account for processes and interactions related to NPF&G in formulating particulate pollution mitigation policies in urban environments.

Prior studies, primarily in adults, have shown that percutaneous abscess drainage is a safe and effective treatment for this condition; however, the data regarding this procedure and indications in pediatric patients is limited. OBJECTIVE Our aim was to determine the success rate of percutaneous abscess drainage for abscesses related to Crohn disease in pediatric patients with a focus on treatment endpoints that are relevant in the era of biological medical therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 25 cases of patients ages 20 years with Crohn disease who underwent percutaneous abscess drainage. Technical success was defined as catheter placement within the abscess with reduction in abscess size on post-treatment imaging. Clinical success was defined as (1) no surgery within 1 year of drainage or (2) surgical resection following drainage with no residual abscess at surgery or on preoperative imaging. Multiple clinical parameters were analyzed for association with treatment success or failure. RESULTS All cases were classified as technical successes. Nineteen cases were classified as clinical successes (76%), including 7 patients (28%) who required no surgery within 1 year of percutaneous drainage and 12 patients (48%) who had elective bowel resection within 1 year. There was a statistically significant association between resumption of immunosuppressive therapy within 8 weeks of drainage and both clinical success (P < 0.01) and avoidance of surgery after 1 year (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Percutaneous abscess drainage is an effective treatment for Crohn disease-related abscesses in pediatric patients. Early resumption of immunosuppressive therapy is statistically associated with both clinical success and avoidance of bowel resection, suggesting a role for percutaneous drainage in facilitating prompt initiation of medical therapy and preventing surgical bowel resection.","output":"Role of percutaneous abscess drainage in the management of young patients with Crohn disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Rupture of large or giant intracranial aneurysms leads to significant morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Both coiling and the Pipeline embolization device (PED) have been shown to be safe and clinically effective for the treatment of unruptured large and giant intracranial aneurysms; however, the relative cost-to-outcome ratio is unknown. The authors present the first cost-effectiveness analysis to compare the economic impact of the PED compared with coiling or no treatment for the endovascular management of large or giant intracranial aneurysms. METHODS A Markov model was constructed to simulate a 60-year-old woman with a large or giant intracranial aneurysm considering a PED, endovascular coiling, or no treatment in terms of neurological outcome, angiographic outcome, retreatment rates, procedural and rehabilitation costs, and rupture rates. Transition probabilities were derived from prior literature reporting outcomes and costs of PED, coiling, and no treatment for the management of aneurysms. Cost-effectiveness was defined, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) defined as difference in costs divided by the difference in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The ICERs < $50,000/QALY gained were considered cost-effective. To study parameter uncertainty, 1-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS The base-case model demonstrated lifetime QALYs of 12.72 for patients in the PED cohort, 12.89 for the endovascular coiling cohort, and 9.7 for patients in the no-treatment cohort. Lifetime rehabilitation and treatment costs were $59,837.52 for PED; $79,025.42 for endovascular coiling; and $193,531.29 in the no-treatment cohort. Patients who did not undergo elective treatment were subject to increased rates of aneurysm rupture and high treatment and rehabilitation costs. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model was most sensitive to assumptions about the costs and mortality risks for PED and coiling. Probabilistic sampling demonstrated that PED was the cost-effective strategy in 58.4% of iterations, coiling was the cost-effective strategy in 41.4% of iterations, and the no-treatment option was the cost-effective strategy in only 0.2% of iterations. CONCLUSIONS The authors' cost-effective model demonstrated that elective endovascular techniques such as PED and endovascular coiling are cost-effective strategies for improving health outcomes and lifetime quality of life measures in patients with large or giant unruptured intracranial aneurysm.","output":"Pipeline embolization device versus coiling for the treatment of large and giant unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a cost-effectiveness analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health recommendations aimed at limiting spread of SARS-CoV-2 have encouraged social distancing and masks as economies across the United States re-open.

Diseases such as lung cancer, heart diseases, and poor prognosis of COVID-19 can be prevented by tobacco cessation. Physicians are trusted among patients and therefore are well-positioned to provide tobacco cessation services, however, their attitudes about such services are unknown. Our purpose is to assess attitudes about providing tobacco cessation services among physicians practicing in KSA. METHODS This study is questionnaire-based and of cross-sectional design. We applied the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) framework to guide our study. Twenty percent (n=25) of primary care centers were randomly selected. A paper-based survey was administered to 291 physicians practicing in the selected primary care centers, each item mapped onto one of the seven TRA constructs. Constructs assessed were: demographics, self-efficacy, knowledge, subjective beliefs, normative beliefs, control beliefs, and intentions to provide tobacco cessation services. Constructs were measured with latent variables, and associations were estimated in a structural equation path model. RESULTS The majority (71%) of physicians reported minimal or no training on tobacco cessation. The average score for tobacco treatment knowledge was 4.09 out of 10 questions. On a scale of 1 to 5, the mean score for intention to provide tobacco cessation services was 3.26. Mean scores for subjective, normative, and control beliefs were 3.45, 3.41, and 3.43, respectively. Mean score for self-efficacy was 3.38. Self-efficacy had a strong influence on intention to provide cessation services via several pathways. CONCLUSIONS Due to lack of prior training among physicians, we recommend delivering future tobacco cessation training. Such training would be effective, given that scores on self-efficacy, beliefs, and intentions, in this study indicate a promising attitude toward the provision of tobacco cessation services. ? 2021.

Data were collected for a relatively short period, limiting the study of long-term outcomes. To broaden the capture of SLS patients data, we undertook the Extended SLS (Ext-SLS), aiming to better understand the patient disease journey and the effects of treatment in a real-world setting, through collection of patient-level data. Here, we present study design information and the challenges and learnings gathered in creating the Ext-SLS. METHODS: The Ext-SLS was intended to augment the SLS by collecting retrospective and prospective (up to 10 years from consent) primary and secondary care electronic health record (EHR) data and patient questionnaires. After ethics approval, general practitioners (GPs) obtained consent from SLS patients remotely (mean 3.2 years post-SLS completion). To facilitate GPs identifying eligible patients, a novel EHR-based approach flagged SLS patients who were alive and registered with their original GP. An automated system sent consent forms/questionnaires to patients. Medical data were collected via EHRs; primary care data were extracted from GPs systems whilst secondary care data were sourced from the UK NHS. RESULTS: Of the 75 GP sites from the SLS, 35 (47%) declined Ext-SLS participation leaving 4158 potentially eligible patients; 1169 (28%) patients were excluded as GPs could not confirm them as SLS participants or due to incapacity. Of 2989 patients invited, 1189 (40%) consented. CONCLUSIONS: Developing an EHR-based trial extension was achieved, with reasonable consent rates amongst invited patients.

A prospective series of 100 consecutive patients admitted to the Spedali Civili University Hospital in Brescia (Italy) between March 9th and March 20th with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS requiring ventilatory support was analyzed to determine whether intravenous administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, was associated with improved outcome. Tocilizumab was administered at a dosage of 8 mg/kg by two consecutive intravenous infusions 12 h apart. A third infusion was optional based on clinical response. The outcome measure was an improvement in acute respiratory failure assessed by means of the Brescia COVID Respiratory Severity Score (BCRSS 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating higher severity) at 24C72 h and 10 days after tocilizumab administration. Out of 100 treated patients (88 M, 12 F; median age: 62 years), 43 received TCZ in the intensive care unit (ICU), while 57 in the general ward as no ICU beds were available. Of these 57 patients, 37 (65%) improved and suspended noninvasive ventilation (NIV) (median BCRSS: 1 [IQR 0C2]), 7 (12%) patients remained stable in NIV, and 13 (23%) patients worsened (10 died, 3 were admitted to ICU).

Methods: Phone interviews and follow-ups were completed with 112 mild COVID-19 RT-PCR-positive adult patients, over a 6 week period. Results: More than one symptom at disease onset was experienced by ~70 of the patients. Over one third of patients experienced fever, dry cough, headache, or muscle ache as the first symptom. If fatigue was reported, it was usually the first symptom to appear. Smell and taste changes had occurred 3.9 {+/-} 5.4 and 4.6 {+/-} 5.7 days (mean {+/-} SD) since disease onset and emerged as first symptoms in 15% and 18% of patients, respectively. Fever was the shortest lasting symptom (5.8 {+/-} 8.6 days (mean {+/-} SD), and smell and taste changes were the most long-lasting symptoms (24.3 {+/-} 22.9 days and 19.4 {+/-} 19.1 (mean {+/-} SD), respectively), with longer smell recovery correlated with smell change severity. In one third of patients who reported cough, smell and taste changes, these symptoms persisted after negative RT-PCR tests. Conclusions: Each symptom can occur as first or later, though some are more likely to appear as firsts, and typically more than one symptom occurs at disease onset.

To shed light on how vaccine breakthrough infections compare with infections in immunologically naive individuals, we examined viral dynamics and infectious virus shedding through daily longitudinal sampling in a small cohort of adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 at varying stages of vaccination. The durations of both infectious virus shedding and symptoms were significantly reduced in vaccinated individuals compared with unvaccinated individuals. We also observed that breakthrough infections are associated with strong tissue compartmentalization and are only detectable in saliva in some cases. These data indicate that vaccination shortens the duration of time of high transmission potential, minimizes symptom duration, and may restrict tissue dissemination.","output":"Longitudinal analysis of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough infections reveal limited infectious virus shedding and restricted tissue distribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anton Korinek and Joseph E Stiglitz make the case for a deliberate effort to steer technological advances in a direction that enhances the role of human workers","output":"Covid-19 driven advances in automation and artificial intelligence risk exacerbating economic inequality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We explored the effect of discontinuing versus continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 according to baseline disease severity. METHODS: We randomized 659 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and classified them as having mild or moderate COVID-19 disease severity at hospital presentation using blood oxygen saturation and lung imaging. The primary outcome was the mean ratio of number of days alive and out of the hospital at 30 days according to disease severity. RESULTS: At presentation, 376 patients (57.1%) had mild and 283 (42.9%) had moderate COVID-19. In patients with mild disease, there was no significant difference in the number of days alive and out of the hospital between ACEI/ARB discontinuation (mean 23.5 [SD 6.3] days) and continuation (mean 23.8 [SD 6.5] days), with a mean ratio of 0.98 (95% CI 0.92C1.04). However, in patients with moderate disease, there were fewer days alive and out of the hospital with ACEI/ARB discontinuation (mean 19.6 [SD 9.5] days) than continuation (mean 21.6 [SD 7.6] days), with a mean ratio of 0.90 (95% CI 0.81C1.00; p-interaction=0.01).

There is no approved drug for the direct treatment of the disease, although several vaccines have been approved for use. Exploring medicinal plants and their phytochemicals has emerged as possible therapeutic alternatives since they are affordable and present minimal toxicity effects. This study sought to investigate the potential of the phytochemical compounds isolated from ethanolic leaf extract of Spondias mombin as potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2. From a select list of bioactive compounds extracted from the leaf of Spondias mombin with known antiviral properties, we identified Geraniin and 2-O-Caffeoyl-(+)-allohydroxycitric acid as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent polymerase, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 viral S-protein and the 3C-like main protease (3CLpro). Analysis of the binding mechanism of these compounds is characterized by the formation of high-affinity intermolecular interactions with respective binding site residues of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent polymerase, 3CLpro, and RBD of viral S-protein, which subsequently contributed to favourable binding affinity. Using the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPB-SA) approach, Geraniin exhibited a binding free energy (Gbind) of -25.87kcal/mol and ? 21.74kcal/mol, respectively, whereas 2-O-Caffeoyl-(+)-allohydroxycitric acid exhibited a Gbind of -32kcal/mol towards 3CLpro.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce symptoms of IBS and to improve HRQL, but access to qualified therapists is limited. Smartphone-based digital therapeutic interventions have potential to increase access to guided CBT at scale, but require careful study to assess their benefits and risks. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a novel app, Zemedy, as a mobile digital therapeutic that delivers a comprehensive CBT program to individuals with IBS. METHODS: This was a crossover randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited online and randomly allocated to either immediate treatment (n=62) or waitlist control (n=59) groups. The Zemedy app consists of 8 modules focusing on psychoeducation, relaxation training, exercise, the cognitive model of stress management, applying CBT to IBS symptoms, reducing avoidance through exposure therapy, behavioral experiments, and information about diet. Users interact with a chatbot that presents the information and encourages specific plans, homework, and exercises. The treatment was fully automated, with no therapist involvement or communication. At baseline and after 8 weeks, participants were asked to complete the battery of primary (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life [IBS-QOL], Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale [GSRS]) and secondary (Fear of Food Questionnaire [FFQ], Visceral Sensitivity Index [VSI], Gastrointestinal Cognition Questionnaire [GI-COG], Depression Anxiety Stress Scale [DASS], and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) outcome measures. Waitlist controls were then offered the opportunity to crossover to treatment. All participants were assessed once more at 3 months posttreatment. RESULTS: Both intention-to-treat and completer analyses at posttreatment revealed significant improvement for the immediate treatment group compared to the waitlist control group on both primary and secondary outcome measures. Gains were generally maintained at 3 months posttreatment. Scores on the GSRS, IBS-QoL, GI-COG, VSI, and FFQ all improved significantly more in the treatment group (F(1,79)=20.49, P<.001, Cohen d=1.01; F(1,79)=20.12, P<.001, d=1.25; F(1,79)=34.71, P<.001, d=1.47; F(1,79)=18.7, P<.001, d=1.07; and F(1,79)=12.13, P=.001, d=0.62, respectively). Depression improved significantly as measured by the PHQ-9 (F(1,79)=10.5, P=.002, d=1.07), and the DASS Depression (F(1,79)=6.03, P=.02, d=.83) and Stress (F(1,79)=4.47, P=.04, d=0.65) subscales in the completer analysis but not in the intention-to-treat analysis. The impact of treatment on HRQL was mediated by reductions in catastrophizing and visceral sensitivity.

Zemedy is an effective modality to deliver CBT for individuals with IBS, and could increase accessibility of this evidence-based treatment.

This raised concerns how ACE2 and the Renin-Angiotensin (Ang)-System (RAS) are to be dealt with given their roles in hypertension and their involvement in COVID-19's morbidity and mortality. Specifically, increased ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs) might theoretically increase COVID-19 risk by increasing SARS-CoV-2 binding sites. However, ACE2 is part of the protective counter-regulatory ACE2-Ang1-7-MasR axis, which opposes the classical ACE-AngII-AT1R regulatory axis. We used Gitelman's and Bartter's syndromes (GS/BS) patients, rare genetic tubulopathies that have endogenously increased levels of ACE2, to explore these issues. Specifically, 128 genetically confirmed GS/BS patients, living in Lombardia, Emilia Romagna and Veneto, the Northern Italy hot spots for COVID-19, were surveyed via telephone survey regarding COVID-19. The survey found no COVID-19 infection and absence of COVID-19 symptoms in any patient. Comparison analysis with the prevalence of COVID-19 in those regions showed statistical significance (p &lt; 0.01). The results of the study strongly suggest that increased ACE2 does not increase risk of COVID-19 and that ACEi and ARBs by blocking excessive AT1R-mediated Ang II activation might favor the increase of ACE2-derived Ang 1-7. GS/BS patients' increased ACE2 and Ang 1-7 levels and their characteristic chronic metabolic alkalosis suggest a mechanism similar to that of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine effect on ACE2 glycosylation alteration with resulting SARS-COV-2 binding inhibition and blockage/inhibition of viral entry. Studies from our laboratory are ongoing to explore GS/BS ACE2 glycosylation and other potential beneficial effects of BS/GS. Importantly, the absence of frank COVID-19 or of COVID-19 symptoms in the BS/GS patients cohort, given no direct ascertainment of COVID-19 status, suggest that elevated ACE2 levels as found in GS/BS patients at a minimum render COVID-19 infection asymptomatic and thus that COVID-19 symptoms are driven by ACE2 levels.","output":"ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 Infection Risk: Insights From Patients With Two Rare Genetic Tubulopathies, Gitelman's and Bartter's Syndromes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ-A) is an instrument that evaluates fear of childbirth through the expectations of women in relation to childbirth and their experience during the birth.

We use multiple data sources to construct this model to characterize the behavioural dynamics underlying the spread of HIV within and between 21 prefecture-level cities (i.e. Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, etc.) in Guangdong province: the online social network via a gay social networking app, the offline human mobility network via the Baidu mobility website, and self-reported sexual behaviours among MSM. Results show that PrEP initiation exponentially delays the occurrence of the virus for the rest of the cities transmitted from the initial outbreak city; hubs on the movement network, such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Foshan are at a higher risk of earliest exposure to the new HIV genotype; most cities acquire the virus directly from the initial outbreak city while others acquire the virus from cities that are not initial outbreak locations and have relatively high betweenness centralities, such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Shantou.

The lockdown that took place in Spain between the months of March and May 2020 may have led to behavioural changes. The aim of the present study was to assess adherence to the MDiet at the end of the lockdown period and to compare it with the situation prior to it. Methods Data were obtained by means of two online questionnaires, one at the beginning of lockdown and the other at the end, completed by adults from the Spanish population, who responded anonymously and voluntarily. The assessment of adherence to the MDiet was carried out using two questionnaires: Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and modified PREDIMED, which contained 14 questions each. Other variables included were: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), Autonomous Community of origin, home living conditions, and level of studies achieved. At the end of the lockdown period, the comparison was made using the Student t statistic and the McNemar test. Results A total of 207 people (137 women) participated, with a mean age 51.3  12.4 years, age range: 20-83 years. After lockdown, BMI remained unchanged (initial 24.55  3.7 kg/m2 and final 24.57  3.7 kg/m2, p = .752), as well as fish consumption (initial 51.2%) and 60.9% at the end, p = .003) mainly due to the women and adherence to the Mdiet. The mean total score of MEDAS increased with 10.6  2.0 at the beginning, and 10.57  2.0 at the end; p = .001). This also occurred with the modified PREDIMED (9.47  2.1 at the beginning and 9.93  2.1 at the end, p < .001). Similarly, the proportion of participants that had a score classified as high at the beginning increased at the end of lockdown: from 80.7% initially in MEDAS to 87.9% at the end, p = .021, and from 68.6% initially in modified PREDIMED to 75.8% at the end, p = .037.

Studies to date indicate that these auto-Abs are mostly detected in men over age 65. METHODS: We screened for type I IFN serum auto-Abs in sera collected < 21 days post-symptom onset in a subset of 103 COVID-19 inpatients and 24 outpatients drawn from a large prospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients enrolled across U.S. Military Treatment Facilities. The mean age of this n = 127 subset of study participants was 55.2 years (SD = 15.2 years, range 7.7 C 86.2 years), and 86/127 (67.7%) were male. RESULTS: Among those hospitalized 49/103 (47.6%) had severe COVID-19 (required at least high flow oxygen), and nine subjects died. We detected neutralizing auto-Abs against IFN-, IFN-, or both, in four inpatients (3.9%, 8.2% of severe cases), with no auto-Abs detected in outpatients. Three of these patients were white males over the age of 62, all with multiple comorbidities; two of whom died and the third requiring high flow oxygen therapy. The fourth patient was a 36-year-old Hispanic female with a history of obesity who required mechanical ventilation during her admission for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: These findings support the association between type I IFN auto-antibody production and life-threatening COVID-19. With further validation, reliable high-throughput screening for type I IFN auto-Abs may inform diagnosis, pathogenesis and treatment strategies for COVID-19, particularly in older males. Our finding of type I IFN auto-Ab production in a younger female prompts further study of this autoimmune phenotype in a broader population. DISCLOSURES: David A.

COVID-19 affects all organs and organ systems. The symptoms of the affected organs can last for a long time after the acute infection. About 1/3 of patients develop neuropsychiatric signs in the clinical course of the disease. The most common symptoms are mental fog, headache, cognitive changes, behavior changes, muscle weakness, anosmia and ageusia. These symptoms may develop due to a direct effect of the virus on the neurons or hyper reactive immune response. Objective: The aim of this article is to describe 2 young adults who developed neuropsychiatric symptoms in the course of Long COVID-19 syndrome. Ischemic vasculitis was proved using CT imaging. Case report: We collected data of two younger females who had previously recovered from the acute form of COVID-19 without respiratory complications. They developed in the next 1-2 months a clinical picture of a brain disorder. In both cases, CT and angiography scans of the brain showed signs of ischemic vasculitis. Neurological therapy has led to an improvement of the neuropsychiatric symptoms. Conclusion: Neuropsychiatric disorders in Long Covid syndrome are common and diverse.

Because spatial-temporal dynamics of viral spread and immune response are challenging to study in vivo, we developed Spatial Immune Model of Coronavirus (SIMCoV), a scalable computational model that simulates hundreds of millions of lung cells, including respiratory epithelial cells and T cells. SIMCoV replicates viral growth dynamics observed in patients and shows how spatially dispersed infections can lead to increased viral loads. The model also shows how the timing and strength of the T cell response can affect viral persistence, oscillations, and control. By incorporating spatial interactions, SIMCoV provides a parsimonious explanation for the dramatically different viral load trajectories among patients by varying only the number of initial sites of infection, and the magnitude and timing of the T cell immune response. When the branching airway structure of the lung is explicitly represented, we find that virus spreads faster than in a 2D layer of epithelial cells, but much more slowly than in an undifferentiated 3D grid or in a well-mixed ODE model. These results illustrate how realistic spatially explicit computational models can improve understanding of within-host dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Summary A key question in SARS-CoV-2 infection is why viral loads and patient outcomes are so different across individuals. Because its difficult to see how the virus spreads in the lungs of infected people, we developed Spatial Immune Model of Coronavirus (SIMCoV), a computational model that simulates hundreds of millions of cells, including lung cells and immune cells. SIMCoV simulates how virus grows and then declines, and the simulations match data observed in patients. SIMCoV shows that when there are more initial infection sites, the virus grows to a higher peak. The model also shows how the timing of the immune response, particularly the T cell response, can affect how long the virus persists and whether it is ultimately cleared from the lungs. SIMCoV shows that the different viral loads in different patients can be explained by how many different places the virus is initially seeded inside their lungs. We explicitly add the branching airway structure of the lung into the model and show that virus spreads slightly faster than it would in a two-dimensional layer of lung cells, but much slower than traditional mathematical models based on differential equations. These results illustrate how realistic spatial computational models can improve understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 infection spreads in the lung.","output":"Spatially distributed infection increases viral load in a computational model of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused significant stress and mental health problems among the general public. However, persons at greatest risk for poor mental health outcomes, such as people with serious mental illness, have been largely overlooked. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to examine the mental health impact of COVID-19 and social distancing behaviors in people with serious mental illness and the behaviors undertaken to prevent COVID-19 infection in this group. METHODS: Participants will include individuals with serious mental illness (eg, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and nonpsychiatric control participants who are currently participating in or have previously participated in several ongoing parent observational studies. Data will be collected from April 2020 through August 2020. Participants will complete phone interviews at 2 time points to assess their current emotional functioning and discuss the measures they have taken to prevent COVID-19 infection. Baseline (pre-COVID-19) mental health, sampled by ecological momentary assessment over an extended period, will be compared with current mental health, also sampled by ecological momentary assessment over an extended period. Demographic, cognitive, and psychosocial factors at baseline will be used to examine risk and resilience to current mental health and coping. RESULTS: The inclusion of participants for the first round of telephone assessments started on April 3, 2020 and will be completed by May 31, 2020. As of April 30, 2020, 101 individuals had completed these first-round assessments. The second round of telephone assessments will likely occur between June 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020. Study results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will have broad implications for understanding the psychological consequences of COVID-19 among vulnerable persons with serious mental illness and will provide the opportunity to identify targets to reduce negative outcomes in the future. We also hope our efforts will provide a roadmap and resources for other researchers who would like to implement a similar approach.

Remdesivir, a broad spectrum anti-viral drug, is now under in vitro and in vivo investigation as a potential agent against SARS-CoV-2. However, the results of this therapy were recently equivocal due to no significant benefit in the clinical trial. Herein, combination molecular docking with dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations is used to theoretically design angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-containing remdesivir-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy. Based on the therapeutic and lung protective effect of ACEI, the classical lisinopril molecule covalently grafted onto PLGA (L-PLGA) has been used to encapsulate remdesivir. A binding model is used to confirm the interactions between lisinopril and ACE on the surface of cells, as well as remdesivir and its intracellular targeting protein (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)). Furthermore, DPD simulations are applied to study the nano-aggregation of drug-free L-PLGA, and remdesivir loaded in L-PLGA. The lisinopril molecules were directly demonstrated to be on the surface of L-PLGA NPs. Molecular docking proved that hydrogen bonding was decisive for the encapsulation of remdesivir. With an increase in concentration, remdesivir loaded L-PLGA formed spherical NPs, and then underwent precipitation. Similar to the above conditions, high remdesivir loading was also observed to cause precipitation formation. Thus, the optimized remdesivir NPs in our study give insights into a rational platform for formulation design against this global pandemic.","output":"Structure-aided ACEI-capped remdesivir-loaded novel PLGA nanoparticles: toward a computational simulation design for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter analyzes the shutdown and later recovery of the public service broadcaster of the Valencia Community region in eastern Spain, a territory that accounts for 10% of Spanish GDP, with over five million inhabitants.

There will be no restriction on language. The primary outcomes will include physical function and pain intensity, and secondary outcomes will include health-related quality of life, fear avoidance, intervention compliance and safety. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2) tool and confidence in the evidence will be assessed using the Confidence in NMA (CINeMA) framework.

Findings Regular employees reported high levels of anxiety and to have thoroughly implemented government-recommended hygiene and safety practices. A majority of respondents were satisfied with mandatory telework from home and desired to continue partial telework after the end of the pandemic. The strongest predictor of satisfaction with mandatory telework from home turned out to be adequate workspace at home for both men and women. However, the antecedents of the desire to continue working from home differed by gender. Practical implications These findings can help individuals, firms and governments better understand the effects of mandatory teleworking from home and devise countermeasures to maximize employee well-being and job performance.

We find that the first alternative alleviates more value added and loss of income, and thus has a greater effect in reducing inequality and the incidence of poverty. ? 2022, Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C..

Seven closed-ended questions were included in the questionnaire. Respondents were to indicate how frequently they experienced specific issues in the previous fortnight: Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge;being unable to stop or control worrying;worrying too much generally;trouble relaxing;being so restless that it's hard to sit still;becoming easily annoyed or irritable, feeling afraid of something awful happening. Participants were required to tick one of four choices for each of the seven parameters - not at all (0), several days (1), more than half the days (2) and nearly every day (3). A person with minimal or no anxiety will score less than 5. The survey was anonymous and circulated in professional online doctors' forums. Participation was voluntary and no incentives were given.Result273 completed surveys were received;120 doctors were in primary care and 153 were in secondary care. Average GAD7 score was 6.4 in primary care and 7.9 in secondary care. 57% of primary care doctors and 66% of secondary care doctors reported score of 5 or more, representing at least mild anxiety symptoms. 22% doctors in primary care and 31% doctors in secondary care reported GAD7 score of 10 or more, indicating moderate to severe anxiety. One in ten doctors in both primary and secondary care reported severe anxiety due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.ConclusionThe finding of more anxiety in secondary care doctors might be because general practitioners could resort early in the pandemic to remote consultations along with inadequacy of resources, greater exposure to suffering/deaths of patients and colleagues in hospital and perceived risk of catching COVID-19 infection.Results are limited due to relatively low numbers and it would be useful to replicate this study on a larger scale. Doctors are less likely to acknowledge their mental health difficulties due to stigma associated with mental health.Many employers have psychological support systems in place for their staff, but it is questionable if affected individuals are willing to receive this support.

Diet, animal age, and health affect the structure of the rumen microbial community. Pathogenic organisms in the rumen negatively affect fermentation processes in favor of energy loss and animal deprivation of nutrients in ingested feed. Drawing from the ban on antibiotic use during the last decade, the livestock industry has been focused on increasing rumen microbial nutrient supply to ruminants through the use of natural supplements that are capable of promoting the activity of beneficial rumen microflora. Selenium (Se) is a trace mineral commonly used as a supplement to regulate animal metabolism. However, a clear understanding of its effects on rumen microbial composition and rumen fermentation is not available. This review summarized the available literature for the effects of Se on specific rumen microorganisms along with consequences for rumen fermentation and digestibility. Some positive effects on total VFA, the molar proportion of propionate, acetate to propionate ratio, ruminal NH3-N, pH, enzymatic activity, ruminal microbiome composition, and digestibility were recorded. Because Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) were more effective than other forms of Se, more studies are needed to compare the effectiveness of synthetic SeNPs and lactic acid bacteria enriched with sodium selenite as a biological source of SeNPs and probiotics.

Hib vaccination was introduced throughout Vietnam in July 2010 without catch-up. In an observational, population based surveillance study we estimated the impact of routine Hib vaccination on all cause radiologically confirmed childhood pneumonia in Nha Trang, Vietnam. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2007 active hospital based surveillance was established in Khanh Hoa General Hospital, the only hospital in Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa province. Nasopharyngeal samples and chest radiographs are taken routinely from all children diagnosed with acute respiratory illness on admission. For admissions between 02/2007 and 03/2012 chest radiographs were interpreted for the presence of WHO primary endpoint pneumonia and nasopharyngeal swabs were analysed by PCR for the presence of Influenza A or B, RSV and rhinovirus. We employed Poisson regression to estimate the impact of Hib vaccination on radiologically confirmed pneumonia (RCP) while statistically accounting for potential differences in viral circulation in the post vaccination era which could have biased the estimate. RESULTS: Of 3151 cases admitted during the study period, 166 had RCP and major viruses were detected in 1601. The adjusted annual incidence of RCP in children younger than 5 years declined by 39% (12C58%) after introduction of Hib vaccination. This decline was most pronounced in children less than 2 years old, adjusted IRR: 0.52 (0.33C0.81), and no significant impact was observed in the 2C4 years old who were not eligible for vaccination, adjusted IRR: 0.96 (0.52C1.72). DISCUSSION: We present early evidence that the burden of Hib associated RCP in Nha Trang before vaccination was substantial and that shortly after introduction to the routine childhood immunisation scheme vaccination has substantially reduced that burden.","output":"Early indication for a reduced burden of radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children following the introduction of routine vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae type b in Nha Trang, Vietnam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, which nowadays has exceeded 2.5 million notified infections in the world and about 200,000 deaths, is a strong reminder that urbanization has changed the way that people and communities live, work, and interact, and it's necessary to make resilient the systems and local capacities to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. How we can re-design the concept of Public Health in relation to the built environment and the contemporary cities?

However, exposure to fragranced cleaning products has been associated with adverse effects on human health. Products can emit a range of volatile chemicals, including some classified as hazardous, but relatively few ingredients are disclosed to the public. Thus, relatively little is known about the specific emissions from these products. This study investigates the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from \\"pandemic products\\" that are being used frequently and extensively in society. In addition, among these emissions, this study identifies potentially hazardous compounds, compares so-called green and regular versions of products, and examines whether ingredients are disclosed to the public. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, 26 commonly used pandemic products, including 13 regular and 13 so-called green versions, were analyzed for their volatile emissions. Product types included hand sanitizers, air disinfectants, multipurpose cleaners, and handwashing soap. All products were fragranced. The analyses found the products collectively emitted 399 VOCs with 127 VOCs classified as potentially hazardous. All products emitted potentially hazardous compounds. Comparing regular products and green products, no significant difference was found in the emissions of the most prevalent compounds. Further, among the 399 compounds emitted, only 4% of all VOCs and 11% of potentially hazardous VOCs were disclosed on any product label or safety data sheet.

Regarding the substantial economic burden, reviewing the trend in prescribed disease modifying treatments (DMTs) could be of help. Here we studied the DMT information of nearly 14000 MS cases and its trends change for 30 years to improve health services to patients. METHODS The population base of this descriptive-analytical (cross-sectional) study consisted of all MS patients in the nationwide MS registry of Iran (NMSRI), up to August 1, 2021. Registrars from 15 provinces, 24 cities, 13 hospitals,8 MS associations, 16 private offices, and 7 clinics had entered the data. RESULTS Overall, 14316 cases were enrolled. The majority (76.1%) were female. The youngest and eldest patients were 5 and 78 years old, respectively. Diagnosis delay was under one year in most cases (median: 0, IQR: 0 - 1). Most (61.4%) had RRMS. Generally, platform injectables (IFN beta, glatiramer acetate) were the most used DMTs until 2010. It seems that introduction of newer agents (antiCD20s and oral DMTs) resulted in a decrease in the use of former drugs since around 2015. Some unusual practices are prominent such as using not approved DMTs for PPMS over the years, or administering high efficacy drugs like natalizumab for CIS. The results indicate the remaining popularity of first line injectable DMTs in female and pediatric patients. DISCUSSION Mean age (SD) at onset in our study (29  8.8) is near the statistics in Asia and Oceania (28  0.7). Concerns about COVID-19 had a noticeable impact on administering high efficacy drugs like rituximab and fingolimod. However, in male patients this approach has not been the case. It may be related to more aggressive disease course in this group. The other possible explanation could be planning for pregnancy in female cases. The popularity of platform injectable drugs in pediatric MS may be related to its favorable safety profile over the years. Another point in this group, is the superiority of rituximab over other highly efficient medications.","output":"Prescription trends of disease-modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis in Iran over the past 30 years."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Based on the latest literature evidence, between 30% and 60% of adults with severe refractory asthma (SRA) are systemic corticosteroid (SCS) dependent.

While mechanical complications are infrequent in the era of primary percutaneous coronary intervention, they are associated with high mortality rates. The concurrent occurrence of mechanical complications such as left ventricular aneurysm and ventricular septal rupture is an extremely rare entity. We hereby delineate a unique case of a 53-year-old Caucasian male who underwent successful concomitant closure of a ventricular septal rupture, left ventricular aneurysmectomy, and 3-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. Due to a delayed initial presentation owing to the patients fear of contracting COVID-19, the surgery was carried out 3 months after the myocardial infarction. His postoperative evaluation confirmed normal contractility of the left ventricle and complete closure of the ventricular septal rupture. Six months postoperatively, the patient continues to do well.

We present a case of tracheobronchitis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus in a 33-year-old male with neutropenia and known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). A 33-year-old male with HIV/AIDS presented to the hospital with symptoms of productive cough for over two months associated with subjective fevers, chills, and body aches. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was significant for scattered sub-centimeter bilateral upper lobe nodules but otherwise normal. The patient underwent an extensive evaluation for his respiratory symptoms, including an initial sputum culture, which grew Haemophilus parainfluenzae in addition to preliminary fungal growth, prompting further evaluation with bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse adherent obstructive pseudomembranous plaques in the trachea and bilateral upper lobe segmental bronchi. Bronchoalveolar lavage cultures later grew Aspergillus fumigatus. Tracheobronchitis due to Aspergillus species is a rare cause of infection in patients with HIV. We believe that this case underscores the importance of further evaluation utilizing bronchoscopy in patients with AIDS who have respiratory symptoms despite mild abnormalities on chest CT.

The researchers focus on the period surrounding the first wave of the outbreak (from February to June 2020), during which the number of cases surged and many steps were taken to curb the epidemic. The paper is based on reports from four countries covered by the Africa-Milk Research Project: Burkina Faso, Kenya, Madagascar and Senegal. Data was collected primarily from nine dairy processors located in those countries. Major conclusions of the study are: (1) Dairy farmers were negatively affected by COVID-19 measures when the health crisis coincided with the peak of the milk production season, and when governments did not take steps to support milk production. (2) Small and informal milk collectors were also affected by traffic restrictions as they could not obtain traffic permits. (3) Milk powder importation remained unaffected during the outbreak. (4) Dairy processors (particularly small ones) faced many challenges restricting their operation. Travel restrictions led to temporary interruptions of milk supply, and because of employee protection and safety measures, processing costs increased. (5) Many small retailers were affected by bans on public transport and reduced their purchases of artisanal dairy products;meanwhile, spoilage of dairy products increased during long curfews coupled with poor storage conditions. Supermarkets were able to increase their market share during the pandemic thanks to their connections with industrial dairy processors and wholesalers. (6) A majority of consumers decreased their consumption of dairy products due to a decrease of purchasing power. In some cases, an increase in consumption occurred (due to Ramadan month and dry season high temperatures) and consumption shifted towards long-life dairy products. (7) Overall, the consequences of the health crisis affected more small and informal dairy supply chains than the larger ones, which are more formal, better organised and finally more resilient to face this kind of global crisis.","output":"Early effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on the African dairy industry: cases of Burkina Faso, Kenya, Madagascar, and Senegal.

Indeed, emerging evidence points to a major shift to consumption of high-sodium foods during the pandemic lockdowns in the population from different countries and cultures. High-sodium foods have sodium contents exceeding 500 mg per 100 g, and many processed and preserved foods fall into this category. Excessive dietary sodium intake is associated with chronic diseases including hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and kidney diseases, and thus poses confounding risks during the pandemic. Here, we review food categories in consumers' shopping lists and food parcels delivered to people who needed assistance during the pandemic, when frozen meals, canned foods, instant foods, snacks, and other high-sodium foods gained substantial popularity. Such change in consumers' behavior is driven by several factors: the perceived risk of viral infection in grocery shopping trips, limited supplies and inflated prices of fresh produce, preference on foods with long shelf lives, and emotional eating. Moreover, the general low awareness of sodium contents in food has contributed to the increased consumption of high-sodium foods during the pandemic. We also discuss the possible effects on COVID-19 infection and severity caused by excessive sodium intake. We conclude that the public should be educated to maintain a healthy sodium intake during the pandemic, and measures should be adopted by governments and private donors in procuring food parcels with more balanced sodium contents to lower the risks of prolonged and excessive sodium intakes in the vulnerable population.","output":"Locked on salt?

OBJECTIVES: The study was aimed to reveal and compare the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among patient-facing HCWs across 3 dental clinics equipped with different types of aspirating systems. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 157 HCWs (43.58  1.66 y) from 3 dental clinics in Ekaterinburg (Russian Federation) who reported to work during the coronavirus disease pandemic. All HCWs underwent serological testing once a week to detect immunoglobulin G and M antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2. The V6000 aspirating system with a vacuum controller (dry or semidry mode) and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters was used at clinics A and B, and the aspirated aerosol and air were evacuated and dissipated into the atmosphere. The VS900 aspirating vacuum pump without HEPA filters was used at clinic C. The aspirated aerosol and air were evacuated and dissipated into the operatories. All dental clinics followed the same recommendations for dental patient management and types of personal protective equipment used. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.5% (19 HCWs) over a 5-mo follow-up (May to August 2020). The prevalence of infection was unaffected by sex or the role of the member in the dental team (dentist/dental assistant). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (+) was significantly higher at clinic C (equipped with an aspirating vacuum pump without HEPA filters) than at other clinics. CONCLUSION: The type of aspirating system used and the presence of HEPA filters could affect the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection across dental clinics. Therefore, we recommend the use of aspirating systems installed with HEPA filters, which evacuate and dissipate aerosols into specialized areas. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: This report confirms that dentists, being patient-facing HCWs, are at a high risk of acquiring the SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifies gaps in the protection of patients and staff in dental settings.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity among Dental Staff and the Role of Aspirating Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pernicious effects of political polarisation and unresolved intra-coalition differences resulted in political party defections that contributed to the fall of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government and the tenuous position of the Perikatan Nasional (PN) government that replaced it.

It promotes intrahepatic lipid accumulation and is associated with lipotoxicity and the more severe phenotypes, including fibrosis and carcinogenesis. Therefore, PNPLA3 appears as an appealing therapeutic target to counter NAFLD progression. AREAS COVERED The scope of this review is to briefly describe the PNPLA3 gene and protein function before discussing therapeutic approaches for fatty liver aiming at this target. Literature review was carried out searching through PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov website and focusing on the most recent works and reviews. EXPERT OPINION The main therapeutic strategies under development for NAFLD have shown variable efficacy and side-effects likely due to disease heterogeneity and lack of engagement of the main pathogenic drivers of liver disease.

The case studies exemplify that research capacity can be strengthened at the micro (practice), meso (institutional) and macro (national policy and international collaboration) levels. Clinicians may lack coverage to enable research time; however, practice-based research is precisely the most relevant for PHC. Increasing research capacity requires local skills, training, investment in infrastructure, and support of local academics and PHC service providers to select, host and manage locally needed research, as well as to disseminate findings to impact local practice and policy. Reliance on funding from high-income countries may limit projects of higher priority in LMIC, and brain drain may reduce available research support; however, we provide recommendations on how to deal with these tensions.","output":"Fostering global primary care research: a capacity-building approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

These three female travelers had stayed at the Metropole Hotel on the same floor as a Chinese physician later diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Hsu et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003). After returning to Singapore, one of the travelers (index A) who developed fever on February 25 was hospitalized at Tan Tock Seng Hospital on March 1, and was managed initially for straightforward community-acquired pneumonia. The other two travelers were also admitted with similar symptoms. Shortly thereafter, clusters of cases emerged in three separate wards, all traceable to the first imported case. By the time index A was isolated on March 6, she had already infected 22 persons, comprising ten health care workers, two inpatients, seven visitors, and three family members. One of the infected health care workers (index case B), with onset of symptoms on March 7 and a provisional diagnosis of dengue fever, was later admitted on March 10 to Ward 8A. At the ward she in turn infected 21 persons, including an inpatient with ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus, before she was isolated on March 13 (Wilder-Smith et al., 2004b). The inpatient (index case C) had been admitted on March 10 with fever, community-acquired pneumonia, and gramnegative bacteremia.

With limited understanding of SARS-CoV-2, current attempts at controlling its spread are focused on the suppressing approach (to reduce a sustained endogenous transmission) and the mitigating approach (to reduce the growth rate of the epidemic). On the one hand, while there has been no firm explanation, many governments have considered immunity passport and herd immunity for paths out of restrictive physical distancing measures imposed to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 but were not successful. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Herein, we attempted to systematize the lessons and shreds of evidence related to the spectrum of illness, the physiological mechanisms of host susceptibility, herd immunity, immunity passport, gender disparities, and severe challenges and uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that the insights provided in this review will help raise the effectiveness of the treatment policies and preventive measures required to end the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: The use of immunity passports is suggested to certify an individual at low risk of acquiring or transmitting SARS-CoV-2. But, an individual might nevertheless carry the virus at similar levels and for a similar duration to those previously uninfected, with an unchanged potential for transmission. Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a complex issue inherent to a vaccine and the population receiving the vaccine. The central epidemiological questions about are as follows: what proportion of the population should be vaccinated to meet elimination (in a local program), eradication (in a global program) or a defined level of control? How is this affected by demographic factors (such as gender)? What is the best age at which to immunize? Besides, although age-dependent mortality risk is estimated to be higher for men and older people, such interpretation across gender, age groups, and countries, however, must be accepted with caution at present. SUMMARY: COVID-19 has taught us that health is the basis of global wealth and international solidarity is an essential response and a superior approach to isolationism.

RESULTS: 34 adult COVID 19 patients (59.8% male, 35.2% obese) requiring mechanical ventilation were assessed prospectively.

The environmental behavior and fate of SMX in agricultural soils are not well understood, especially when the adsorption behavior is disturbed by the dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by crop straw. As canola straw is one of the biomasses widely returned to farmlands, we characterized DOM derived from pristine and decomposed canola straw, and explored the effects and mechanisms of the DOMs on regulating SMX adsorption to purple paddy soils. The spectral analysis showed that the molecular weight, aromaticity, and hydrophobicity of canola straw-derived DOM increased as decomposition proceeded. These physicochemical properties collectively determined the effects of the DOM on SMX adsorption. The DOM derived from pristine canola straw increased SMX maximum adsorption capacity of the soils by approximately 2.6 times, but this positive effect gradually decreased to a steady state by day 90 in the straw decomposition period. Nevertheless, the SMX adsorption behavior in the soils was invariably determined by the DOM extracts. These adsorption processes of SMX were well fitted by the double-chamber kinetics model and the Langmuir and Freundlich thermodynamic models. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that SMX adsorption onto the soils was spontaneous and endothermic, and this adsorption characteristics was not significantly (p > 0.05) changed by the DOM extracts. However, the adsorption kinetics were altered by those DOMs, i.e., the fast and slow adsorption processes were both diminished. Correspondingly, co-adsorption and cumulative adsorption were identified as the main mechanisms determining SMX adsorption to the purple paddy soils in the presence of the straw-derived DOMs. These results collectively indicated that the DOMs released by straw in croplands may decrease the ecological risks of organic pollutants by inhibiting their migration processes.","output":"Effect of straw-derived dissolved organic matter on the adsorption of sulfamethoxazole to purple paddy soils"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of RApid community Point-of-care Testing fOR COVID-19 (RAPTOR-C19) is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of multiple current and emerging point-of-care tests (POCTs) for active and past SARS-CoV2 infection in the community setting. RAPTOR-C19 will provide the community testbed to the COVID-19 National DiagnOstic Research and Evaluation Platform (CONDOR). METHODS: RAPTOR-C19 incorporates a series of prospective observational parallel diagnostic accuracy studies of SARS-CoV2 POCTs against laboratory and composite reference standards in patients with suspected current or past SARS-CoV2 infection attending community settings. Adults and children with suspected current SARS-CoV2 infection who are having an oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal (OP/NP) swab for laboratory SARS-CoV2 reverse transcriptase Digital/Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (d/rRT-PCR) as part of clinical care or community-based testing will be invited to participate. Adults ( 16 years) with suspected past symptomatic infection will also be recruited. Asymptomatic individuals will not be eligible. At the baseline visit, all participants will be asked to submit samples for at least one candidate point-of-care test (POCT) being evaluated (index test/s) as well as an OP/NP swab for laboratory SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR performed by Public Health England (PHE) (reference standard for current infection). Adults will also be asked for a blood sample for laboratory SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing by PHE (reference standard for past infection), where feasible adults will be invited to attend a second visit at 28 days for repeat antibody testing. Additional study data (e.g. demographics, symptoms, observations, household contacts) will be captured electronically. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values for each POCT will be calculated with exact 95% confidence intervals when compared to the reference standard. POCTs will also be compared to composite reference standards constructed using paired antibody test results, patient reported outcomes, linked electronic health records for outcomes related to COVID-19 such as hospitalisation or death, and other test results. DISCUSSION: High-performing POCTs for community use could be transformational. Real-time results could lead to personal and public health impacts such as reducing onward household transmission of SARS-CoV2 infection, improving surveillance of health and social care staff, contributing to accurate prevalence estimates, and understanding of SARS-CoV2 transmission dynamics in the population.

In this work, we have formulated a non-autonomous nonlinear deterministic model to study the control of COVID-19 to unravel the cost and economic health outcomes for the autonomous nonlinear model proposed for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We calculated the strength number and noticed the strength number is less than zero, meaning the proposed model does not capture multiple waves, hence to capture multiple wave new compartmental model may require for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We proposed an optimal control problem based on a previously studied model and proved the existence of the proposed optimal control model. The optimality system associated with the non-autonomous epidemic model is derived using Pontryagins maximum principle. The optimal control model captures four time-dependent control functions, thus, [Formula: see text]-practising physical or social distancing protocols; [Formula: see text]-practising personal hygiene by cleaning contaminated surfaces with alcohol-based detergents; [Formula: see text]-practising proper and safety measures by exposed, asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals; [Formula: see text]-fumigating schools in all levels of education, sports facilities, commercial areas and religious worship centres. We have performed numerical simulations to investigate extensive cost-effectiveness analysis for fourteen optimal control strategies. Comparing the control strategies, we noticed that; Strategy 1 (practising physical or social distancing protocols) is the most cost-saving and most effective control intervention in Saudi Arabia in the absence of vaccination.

The ovary is the first organ to show overt signs of aging, including increased fibrosis in the ovarian stroma. How this fibrosis affects ovarian biomechanics and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using instrumental indentation, we demonstrated a quantitative increase in ovarian stiffness, as evidenced by an increase in Young's modulus, when comparing ovaries from reproductively young (6-12 weeks) and old (14-17 months) mice. This ovarian stiffness was dependent on collagen because ex vivo enzyme-mediated collagen depletion in ovaries from reproductively old mice restored their collagen content and biomechanical properties to those of young controls. In addition to collagen, we also investigated the role of hyaluronan (HA) in regulating ovarian stiffness. HA is an extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan that maintains tissue homeostasis, and its loss can change the biomechanical properties of tissues. The total HA content in the ovarian stroma decreased with age, and this was associated with increased hyaluronidase (Hyal1) and decreased hyaluronan synthase (Has3) expression. These gene expression differences were not accompanied by changes in ovarian HA molecular mass distribution. Furthermore, ovaries from mice deficient in HAS3 were stiffer compared to age-matched WT mice. Our results demonstrate that the ovary becomes stiffer with age and that both collagen and HA matrices are contributing mechanisms regulating ovarian biomechanics. Importantly, the age-associated increase in collagen and decrease in HA are conserved in the human ovary and may impact follicle development and oocyte quality.","output":"Ovarian stiffness increases with age in the mammalian ovary and depends on collagen and hyaluronan matrices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemi COVID-19 telah memberikan dampak yang signifikan dalam dunia pendidikan.

As opioid use rises, so too does the number of people who suffer from opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid overdose-related deaths. As science and medicine progresses, new medications and therapies have arisen in order to help treat patients suffering from addiction. Treatment can be split into two main domains: pharmacological and non-pharmacological. Buprenorphine and methadone, currently the most prescribed medications for patients suffering from OUD, have been shown to be extremely effective in clinical trials but have significant real-world limitations. Geographical disparities between various locations, physician stigma with prescribing these medications, and training required to prescribe medication can make access to these treatments difficult for patients. Non-pharmacological interventions have also been shown to help with limited efficacy when combined with pharmacological interventions. However, the time and resources required to implement these strategies may be a difficult barrier to overcome. In this review, we assess pharmacological interventions, non-pharmacological treatments, examine barriers to treatment for patients, and propose solutions to bypass these barriers.","output":"Opioid Use Disorder: Treatments and Barriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Thiopurine-induced leukopenia, a frequently observed and potentially life-threatening adverse event, complicates the clinical management of IBD patients. AIM To assess risk factors for thiopurine-induced leukopenia in IBD. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS and Cochrane library were searched for studies reporting at least one risk factor for thiopurine-induced leukopenia. Pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated for each potential risk factor using a random effects model. Studies that were not eligible for meta-analysis were described qualitatively. RESULTS Seventy articles were included, 34 (11 229 patients) were included in meta-analyses. A significantly higher thiopurine-induced leukopenia risk was found for TPMT (OR 3.9, 95% [CI] 2.5-6.1) and for NUDT15 R139C (OR 6.9, 95% CI 5.2-9.1), G52A (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-7.9) and 36_37ins/delGGAGTC variant carriers (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.8-11.4). A potential association between high 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) or 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) levels and leukopenia was observed, since most studies reported higher metabolite levels in leukopenic patients (6-TGN: 204-308 (Lennard method) and 397 (Dervieux method), 6-MMP: 4020-10 450 pmol/8 x 108 RBC) compared to controls (6-TGN: 170-212 (Lennard method) and 269 (Dervieux method), 6-MMP: 1025-4550 pmol/8 x 108 RBC). CONCLUSIONS TPMT and NUDT15 variants predict thiopurine-induced leukopenia. High 6-TGN and 6-MMP levels might induce leukopenia, although exact cut-off values remain unclear. Potential preventive measures to reduce the risk of thiopurine-induced leukopenia include pre-treatment TPMT and NUDT15 genotyping. Routine thiopurine metabolite measurement might be efficient, yet cut-off levels must be validated in advance.","output":"Systematic review with meta-analysis: risk factors for thiopurine-induced leukopenia in IBD."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Currently, there is an unmet clinical need in identifying and screening women at high risk of breast cancer, where tumours are often aggressive and treatment intervention is too late to prevent metastasis, recurrence and mortality. This has been brought into sharp focus by the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, constantly changing hospital policies and surgical guidelines in reducing access to established screening and treatment regimens. Nipple aspirate fluid (NAF), is thought to provide a unique window into the biological processes occurring within the breast, particularly in the context of a developing neoplasm. Evaluation of NAF in asymptomatic women, for novel chemical biomarkers of either early disease and/or cancer risk offers tremendous promise as a tool to facilitate early detection and to supplement screening. However, it is acceptability as a method of collection and screening by women is critical and yet unknown. A breast health questionnaire was disseminated to women through breast cancer charities, patient support groups and social media platforms, with the aim of collecting opinions on the acceptability of use of NAF as a potential screening tool. METHOD: Following ethical approval a questionnaire was prepared using online surveys consisting of four parts: (a) introduction on breast health screening in the UK, (b) core demographic data, (c) questions regarding screening and the acceptability of using NAF and (d) opinions about the process of collecting and using nipple fluid for screening. The voluntary and anonymous questionnaire was disseminated through social media, professional networks, charity websites and by individuals between October 2019 and December 2020. Survey responses were collected electronically, and the data analysed using online surveys statistical tools. RESULTS: A total of 3178 women completed the questionnaire (65.9% Caucasian, 27.7% Asian/British Asian, 0.6% black and 5.0% other). Of these, 2650 women (83.4%) had no prior knowledge of NAF and 89.4% were unaware that NAF can be expressed in up to 90% of all women. Concerning their risk of breast cancer, 89.8% of women were keen to know their future risk of breast cancer, 8.5% were unsure whether they wanted to know their risk and a further, 1.6% did not want to know. Regarding screening, 944 women (29.8%) were unaware of the lack of routine National Health Service Breast Screening for those under the age of 47 years. Furthermore, 53.0% of women were unaware that mammographic screening is affected by breast density. In terms of the acceptability of home testing for breast health, 92.0% were keen to undergo a home test. Both 79.7% and 70.9% stated they would consider hand massage and a breast pump to acquire nipple fluid samples, respectively. A further 48.6% of women would consider the use of a hormonal nasal spray for the same purpose. However, with regards to acquiring results from NAF testing, 42.6% of women would prefer to receive results at home and 34.2% in a medical facility. Finally, 91.6% of women believed that breast health should be incorporated as part of school education curriculum. CONCLUSION: Public awareness regarding breast screening protocols and limitations of mammography could be improved. Many women were unaware that NAF might be a useful biofluid for future risk prediction, and yet the concept of self-testing of nipple fluid, with either hand massage or a breast pump was well received. Efforts should be made to increase awareness of the benefits of alternative and supplementary tests, especially in the context of high-risk individuals and younger patients.","output":"Breast health screening: a UK-wide questionnaire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December of 2019.

Some priority elective surgeries were performed, and there was no increase in contagion rates due to safety protocols and protection measures. The study aims to present the coronavirus infection rate of elective hand surgeries and microsurgery performed during pandemics. METHODS: A retrospective study evaluating 188 patients submitted to elective surgical procedures. The exclusion criteria were patients infected by COVID-19 before the surgery and patients who submitted to trauma surgery. Only 108 patients were eligible for this study. The mean age was 47.8 years (range: 15 days-81 years). There were 63 females and 45 males. They were divided into 2 groups: outpatient (n = 49) and inpatient (n = 59) procedures. RESULTS: The overall COVID infection rate was 6.48%. The outpatient infection rate was 2.08%, whereas the inpatient infection rate was 10.17% (Student t test: P = .089). The main factor correlated with infection in the postoperative period was the number of postoperative outpatient visits (Student t test: P = .089). No statistical differences were observed between the variables studied, but there was a tendency for patients who submitted to inpatient surgery to get infected by COVID-19 (P = .089). The statistical power was 0.8 (Cohen's d test), showing that large samples are needed to analyze the correlation better.

Thus, we conducted an open-label, multicenter, single-arm phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of apatinib plus etoposide capsules as the third- or further-line treatment in ES-SCLC patients. Methods Patients with ES-SCLC who experienced disease progression following 2 to 3 previous therapies from 11 medical centers in China were enrolled to receive apatinib (250 mg/d, continuously) and etoposide capsules (50 mg/d, on day 1-21, per 28 days). The treatment continued until disease progression, treatment intolerance, or death. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results Fifty-six patients with relapsed or refractory ES-SCLC were enrolled from January 2018 to February 2020 and 53 of them were eventually included in the evaluation population. The median follow-up was 9.8 months. At the data cut-off time (March 5, 2020), 39 patients (74%) had died and 44 (83%) had progressed. The median PFS was 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.1-3.9) and the median OS was 5.0 months (95% CI, 3.6-6.4). No complete responses were seen. Eleven patients (21%) showed a best response of partial response and 37 (70%) patients achieved stable disease. The ORR was 20.8% (11/53), and the disease control rate (DCR) was 90.6% (48/53). The 6-month OS rate was 40.1% (95% CI, 26.2-54). After 12 months, the OS rate was 18.4% (95% CI, 4.7-32.1).

Decision-making processes are made toward solving health needs and promoting collaboration among institutions and social sectors. This paper presents the context and circumstances that led the University of Guadalajara (UdeG) to install a local health situation room (HSR) to address the COVID-19 pandemic at this institution based in the state of Jalisco, Mexico, a narrative is also made of its working processes and some of its results. Methods: The design of this situation room for COVID-19 was based on the methodology established by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/WHO. This local-type situation room was installed on February 12, 2020. The health problem was characterized, and strategic lines, objectives, and goals were established; the first analysis was derived from an action plan deployed at the UdeG. The strategic lines were situational diagnosis, preventive actions, and containment strategies. Results: The situation room influenced the activities of the UdeG before the epidemic cases started in the state. One of the actions with the greatest impact was developing a mathematical model for predicting COVID-19 cases. Subsequently, new models have been developed according to the epidemiological evolution of the disease, helping manage the epidemic in the state. Another important result was the early closing of face-to-face university activities, reducing contagion risks and the mobility of more than 310,000 students, faculty, and administrative personnel throughout Jalisco. Conclusions: A consequence of the closure was that the confinement generated by the pandemic was the change to virtual meetings from April 2020 to date; but at the same time, this working format was a strength, since it influenced the decision of the university board to change all the academic activities to virtual format before other educational, economic, and social activities in the state did. By April 2020, the situation room transcended its institutional boundaries and was invited to participate at the Jalisco State's Health Committee.

Although this infodemic has spread mainly through social media, there are numerous occasions on which mass media outlets have shared dangerous information, giving resonance to statements without a scientific basis. For these reasons, infoveillance and infodemiology methods are increasingly exploited to monitor information traffic on the web and make epidemiological predictions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to estimate the impact of Italian mass media on users web searches to understand the role of press and television channels in both the infodemic and the interest of Italian netizens in COVID-19. METHODS: We collected the headlines published from January 2020 to March 2021 containing specific COVID-19Crelated keywords published on PubMed, Google, the Italian Ministry of Health website, and the most-read newspapers in Italy. We evaluated the percentages of infodemic terms on these platforms. Through Google Trends, we searched for cross-correlations between newspaper headlines and COVID-19Crelated web searches. Finally, we analyzed the web interest in infodemic content posted on YouTube. RESULTS: During the first wave of COVID-19, the Italian press preferred to draw on infodemic terms (rate of adoption: 1.6%-6.3%) and moderately infodemic terms (rate of adoption: 88%-94%), while scientific sources favored the correct names (rate of adoption: 65%-88%). The correlational analysis showed that the press heavily influenced users in adopting terms to identify the novel coronavirus (cross-correlations of 0.74 to 0.89, P value <.001; maximum lag=1 day). The use of scientific denominations by the press reached acceptable values only during the third wave (approximately 80%, except for the television services Rai and Mediaset). Web queries about COVID-19 symptoms also appeared to be influenced by the press (best average correlation=0.92, P<.007). Furthermore, web users showed pronounced interest in YouTube videos of an infodemic nature. Finally, the press gave resonance to serious fake news on COVID-19, which caused pronounced spikes of interest from web users. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the Italian mass media have played a decisive role in spreading the COVID-19 infodemic and addressing netizens web interest, thus favoring the adoption of terms that are unsuitable for identifying COVID-19. Therefore, the directors of news channels and newspapers should be more cautious, and government dissemination agencies should exert more control over such news stories.","output":"Influence of Mass Media on Italian Web Users During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infodemiological Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of remdesivir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor, for effectiveness in adults with COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: Electronic search for eligible articles of PubMed, Cochrane Central and clinicaltrials.gov was performed on 20 September 2020. PARTICIPANTS AND STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating efficacy of remdesivir in COVID-19 were included for meta-analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Remdesivir was compared with standard of care. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Primary outcome was mortality and secondary outcomes were time to clinical improvement and safety outcomes like serious adverse events, respiratory failure. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Data synthesis was done with Cochrane review manager 5 (RevMan) V.5.3. Cochrane risk of bias V.2.0 tool was used for methodological quality assessment. The GRADE pro GDT was applied for overall quality of evidence. RESULTS: 52 RCTs were screened and 4 studies were included in analysis, with total of 7324 patients. No mortality benefit was observed with remdesivir versus control group (OR=0.92 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.07), p=0.30, moderate quality evidence). Significantly higher rates of clinical improvement (OR=1.52 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.87), p<0.0001, low quality) and faster time to clinical improvement (HR=1.28 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.46), p=0.0002, very low quality) was observed with remdesivir versus control group. Significant decrease was found in the risk of serious adverse events (RR=0.75 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.90), p=0.0003, low quality); however, no difference was found in the risk of respiratory failure (RR=0.85 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.77), p=0.67, very low quality evidence) with remdesivir. CONCLUSIONS: As per the evidence from current review, remdesivir has shown no mortality benefit (moderate quality evidence) in the treatment of COVID-19. From a cost-benefit perspective, it is our personal opinion that it should not be recommended for use, especially in low and lower middle income countries.

Diagnostic cross-sectional or cohort studies that included paediatric study participants and evaluated rapid point-of care tests for diagnosing current SARS-CoV-2 infections against RT-PCR as the reference standard were eligible for inclusion. QUADAS-2 was used to assess the risk of bias and the applicability of the included studies. Bivariate meta-analyses with random effects were performed. Variability was assessed by subgroup analyses. Results: We included 17 studies with a total of 6355 paediatric study participants. All included studies compared antigen tests against RT-PCR. Only one study was at low risk of bias. The pooled overall diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in paediatric populations was 64.2% (95% CI: 57.4%-70.5%) and 99.1% (95% CI: 98.2%-99.5%), respectively.

Microbe invasions, as well as the damage and even death of host cells, can cause and sustain inflammation. To counteract the negative consequences of irritants, the airways are equipped with cellular and host defense immunological systems that block the cellular entrance of these irritants or eliminate them from airway regions by triggering the immune system.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to compare the likelihood of missing a scheduled telemedicine and in-person appointments for spine patients. The secondary objective is to assess the impact of socioeconomic status on missed telemedicine and in-person appointments. METHODS: Patients with scheduled outpatient appointments with orthopedic spine faculty between 2019 and 2021 were divided by appointment type: telemedicine (N = 4,387) and in-person (N = 3810). Socioeconomic status was assessed using Area Deprivation Index (ADI) stratified based on percentile: low (<25), medium (25C75), and high (>75) levels of socioeconomic disadvantage. The primary outcome measure was missed clinic appointments, which was defined as having at least one appointment that was cancelled or labeled no show. RESULTS: Patients with in-person appointments missed appointments more often than patients with telemedicine visits (51.3% vs 24.7%, P < .001). Patients with high ADI missed their in-person appointments more often than patients with medium and low ADI (59.5% vs 52.2% and 47.5%, P < .001). There was no difference in missed telemedicine visits between patients with high, medium, and low ADI (27.6% vs 24.8% vs 23.8%, P = .294).

However, data on the prevalence, microbiology, and outcomes of co-infection and superinfection are limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the occurrence of co-infections and superinfections and their outcomes among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched literature databases for studies published from October 1, 2019, through February 8, 2021. We included studies that reported clinical features and outcomes of co-infection or superinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. We followed PRISMA guidelines, and we registered the protocol with PROSPERO as: CRD42020189763. RESULTS: Of 6639 articles screened, 118 were included in the random effects meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of co-infection was 19% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14%-25%, I2 = 98%) and that of superinfection was 24% (95% CI: 19%-30%). Pooled prevalence of pathogen type stratified by co- or superinfection were: viral co-infections, 10% (95% CI: 6%-14%); viral superinfections, 4% (95% CI: 0%-10%); bacterial co-infections, 8% (95% CI: 5%-11%); bacterial superinfections, 20% (95% CI: 13%-28%); fungal co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 2%-7%); and fungal superinfections, 8% (95% CI: 4%-13%). Patients with a co-infection or superinfection had higher odds of dying than those who only had SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio = 3.31, 95% CI: 1.82-5.99). Compared to those with co-infections, patients with superinfections had a higher prevalence of mechanical ventilation (45% [95% CI: 33%-58%] vs. 10% [95% CI: 5%-16%]), but patients with co-infections had a greater average length of hospital stay than those with superinfections (mean = 29.0 days, standard deviation [SD] = 6.7 vs. mean = 16 days, SD = 6.2, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that as many as 19% of patients with COVID-19 have co-infections and 24% have superinfections. The presence of either co-infection or superinfection was associated with poor outcomes, including increased mortality.

We predict the spatiotemporal spread of reported COVID- 19 cases at the global level during the first few weeks of the current outbreak by analyzing openly available geolocated Twitter social media data. Human mobility patterns were estimated by analyzing geolocated 2013-2015 Twitter data from users who had: i) tweeted at least twice on consecutive days from Wuhan, China, between November 1, 2013, and January 28, 2014, and November 1, 2014, and January 28, 2015; and ii) left Wuhan following their second tweet during the time period under investigation. Publicly available COVID-19 case data were used to investigate the correlation among cases reported during the current outbreak, locations visited by the study cohort of Twitter users, and airports with scheduled flights from Wuhan. Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) data were obtained to identify the capacity of countries receiving travellers from Wuhan to respond to COVID-19. Our study cohort comprised 161 users. Of these users, 133 (82.6%) posted tweets from 157 Chinese cities (1,344 tweets) during the 30 days after leaving Wuhan following their second tweet, with a median of 2 (IQR= 1-3) locations visited and a mean distance of 601 km (IQR= 295.2-834.7 km) traveled. Of our user cohort, 60 (37.2%) traveled abroad to 119 locations in 28 countries. Of the 82 COVID-19 cases reported outside China as of January 30, 2020, 54 cases had known geolocation coordinates and 74.1% (40 cases) were reported less than 15 km (median = 7.4 km, IQR= 2.9-285.5 km) from a location visited by at least one of our study cohort's users. Countries visited by the cohort's users and which have cases reported by January 30, 2020, had a median IDVI equal to 0.74.

Anthrax, caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, has been used as both a biological warfare agent and bioterrorist weapon previously. Although antibiotic therapy is effective in the early stages of anthrax infection, it does not have any effect once exposed individuals become symptomatic due to B. anthracis exotoxin accumulation. The bipartite exotoxins are the major contributing factors to the morbidity and mortality observed in acute anthrax infections. METHODS: Using recombinant B. anthracis protective antigen (PA83), covalently coupled to a novel non-toxic muramyl dipeptide (NT-MDP) derivative we hyper-immunized goats three times over the course of 14 weeks. Goats were plasmapheresed and the IgG fraction (not affinity purified) and F(ab')(2 )derivatives were characterized in vitro and in vivo for protection against lethal toxin mediated intoxication. RESULTS: Anti-PA83 IgG conferred 100% protection at 7.5 g in a cell toxin neutralization assay. Mice exposed to 5 LD(50 )of Bacillus anthracis Ames spores by intranares inoculation demonstrated 60% survival 14 d post-infection when administered a single bolus dose (32 mg/kg body weight) of anti-PA83 IgG at 24 h post spore challenge. Anti-PA83 F(ab')(2 )fragments retained similar neutralization and protection levels both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: The protection afforded by these GMP-grade caprine immunotherapeutics post-exposure in the pilot murine model suggests they could be used effectively to treat post-exposure, symptomatic human anthrax patients following a bioterrorism event. These results also indicate that recombinant PA83 coupled to NT-MDP is a potent inducer of neutralizing antibodies and suggest it would be a promising vaccine candidate for anthrax. The ease of production, ease of covalent attachment, and immunostimulatory activity of the NT-MDP indicate it would be a superior adjuvant to alum or other traditional adjuvants in vaccine formulations.","output":"Rapid generation of an anthrax immunotherapeutic from goats using a novel non-toxic muramyl dipeptide adjuvant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to more visually display and analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of coronavirus disease (COVID- 19), and provide refined data support and information reference of epidemic prevention decisions for government departments, this paper designs and develops a COVID-19 epidemic simulation and visualization system based on WebGIS through a third-party open-source framework and visualization library The system can visually portray the microscopic behavior of individuals spreading the epidemic and the macroscopic epidemic situation The system implements three modules: epidemic visualization, intra-urban travel intensity and individual model transmission simulation In this paper, the changes of travel intensity within the city and the temporal and spatial evolution of the epidemic were analyzed with Wuhan city as an example This study is valuable for the development of systems for visualizing outbreaks of highly infectious epidemics ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Design and Development of a Visualization System for COVID-19 Simulation Based on WebGIS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural history collections (NHCs) are important resources for a diverse array of scientific fields Recent digitization initiatives have broadened the user base of NHCs, and new technological innovations are using materials generated from collections to address novel scientific questions Simultaneously, NHCs are increasingly imperiled by reductions in funding and resources Ensuring that NHCs continue to serve as a valuable resource for future generations will require the scientific community to increase their contribution to and acknowledgement of collections We provide recommendations and guidelines for scientists to support NHCs, focusing particularly on new users that may be unfamiliar with collections We hope that this perspective will motivate debate on the future of NHCs and the role of the scientific community in maintaining and improving biological collections","output":"Building Natural History Collections for the Twenty-First Century and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adaptation of organisms to stressors is coordinated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), which involves glucocorticoids (GCs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs).

The aim of the current study is to review the latest literature data to identify the prevalance and predictors of clopidogrel high on-treatment platelet reactivity among stroke subjects and to establish the potential impact on clinical outcomes and prognosis. Clinical databases were searched by two independent researchers to select relevant papers on the topic, including all types of articles. Several important predictors contributing to clopidogrel resistance were identified, including genetic polymorphisms, the concomitant use of other drugs, or vascular risk factors, in particular nonsmoking and diabetes. Clopidogrel high on-treatment platelet reactivity has a negative impact on the clinical course of stroke, worsens the early- and long-term prognoses, and increases the risk of recurrent vascular events. Platelet function testing should be considered in selected stroke individuals, especially those predisposed to clopidogrel resistance, for whom an improvement in the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy is essential. This particular group may become the greatest beneficiaries of the modification of existing therapy based on platelet function monitoring.","output":"The Phenomenon of Clopidogrel High On-Treatment Platelet Reactivity in Ischemic Stroke Subjects: A Comprehensive Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a great demand on the personal protection products such as reusable masks. As a key raw material for masks, meltblown fabrics play an important role in rejection of aerosols. However, the electrostatic dominated aerosol rejection mechanism of meltblown fabrics prevents the mask from maintaining the desired protective effect after the static charge degradation. Herein, novel reusable masks with high aerosols rejection efficiency were fabricated by the introduction of spider-web bionic nanofiber membrane (nano cobweb-biomimetic membrane). The reuse stability of meltblown and nanofiber membrane mask was separately evaluated by infiltrating water, 75% alcohol solution, and exposing under ultraviolet (UV) light. After the water immersion test, the filtration efficiency of meltblown mask was decreased to about 79%, while the nanofiber membrane was maintained at 99%. The same phenomenon could be observed after the 75% alcohol treatment, a high filtration efficiency of 99% was maintained in nanofiber membrane, but obvious negative effect was observed in meltblown mask, which decreased to about 50%. In addition, after long-term expose under UV light, no filtration efficiency decrease was observed in nanofiber membrane, which provide a suitable way to disinfect the potential carried virus. This work successfully achieved the daily disinfection and reuse of masks, which effectively alleviate the shortage of masks during this special period.","output":"Meltblown fabric vs nanofiber membrane, which is better for fabricating personal protective equipments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contemporary Issues in Mediation (CIIM) Volume 6 builds on the success of the past five volumes as testament to a growing interest of authors and readers in the wide variety of issues that arise with mediation.

Oncology nurse burnout is likely to be an increasingly significant issue for cancer services as the true cost of the pandemic is revealed. Delays in diagnosis and treatment of cancers are reported widely, inevitably leading to poor prognosis and more aggressive treatments for patients. Gaining a better understanding of oncology nurse burnout, its prevalence and causes as well as strategies to reduce or prevent it will help to improve patient care and support staff wellbeing during and after the pandemic. Methodology: A search of the literature related to oncology nurse burnout, covering North America and Europe over 5 years (August 2014-January 2020), resulted in 31 articles for review. None of the studies were carried out in the UK, suggesting a need for robust investigations into oncology nurse burnout in the British health service. Summary: The prevalence of burnout among oncology nurses before the COVID-19 outbreak appeared to be high and is likely to have increased as a result of the pandemic. However, the studies investigating oncology nurse burnout are small and cross-sectional, with low-quality methods. The literature suggests the major causes of burnout arise in the workplace, particularly aspects of the environment that prevent nurses from working according to their values. Although burnout is frequently attributed to workplace factors, interventions remain focused on individuals' coping mechanisms and rarely on the workplace factors that are known to cause it.","output":"The importance of understanding burnout: an oncology nurse perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is used to treat a variety of cancers. It exerts its mechanism of action by blocking the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). Toxicity concerns include immune-related toxicities, including colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, endocrine toxicities and more rarely, myocarditis and other organ system toxicities. OBJECTIVE: To review a real-world case involving immunotherapy induced myocarditis after a patient received pembrolizumab and discuss how the current pandemic created complexity in toxicity management. DISCUSSION: An 83 year old male with metastatic lung cancer developed fatal myocarditis after receiving 2 doses of pembrolizumab. Applying the Naranjo score, the likelihood of pembrolizumab causing the myocarditis is probable, with a score of 6. Severe cardiac toxicities are rare with pembrolizumab, but can still occur. It is vital to be aware of these toxicities, and educate patients on signs and symptoms. Complicating the situation even further was the global pandemic, which created fear and hesitation in the patient and the patient's family to seek medical treatment out of fear of exposure. This pandemic adds another layer to the complexity of care for patients with cancer and management of toxicities. Pharmacists play a significant role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of medications, especially oncology agents. CONCLUSION: Proper education of patients regarding symptoms and when to report are paramount to assisting in early detection and intervention for immunotherapy-related adverse events. New management and treatment strategies will need to be discussed and implemented considering the changing landscape around the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"Immune-checkpoint inhibitor toxicity during a pandemic: Overcoming patient fears to provide care.

This study aimed to implement and evaluate the effects of sustained engagement in physical activity on mental, social and physical health outcomes through the use of the Seniors Exercise Park physical activity program for older people (the ENJOY project). METHOD: People aged 60 years underwent a 12-week structured supervised physical activity program using outdoor exercise park equipment followed by 6 months unstructured independent use of the exercise park. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3 months and 9 months and completed a test battery evaluating physical activity, physical function and health related quality of life measures. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare differences between baseline, 3 and 9 months. RESULTS: Of the 95 participants, 80 (84.2%) completed the 3 months supervised program, and 58 (61%) completed the 9 month assessment (the latter impacted by COVID-19 restrictions). A significant increase in physical activity level was demonstrated following the 12 weeks intervention (p < 0.01). Significant improvements were also demonstrated in all physical function measures (p < 0.01), self-rated quality of life (p < 0.05), wellbeing (p < 0.01), fear of falls (p < 0.01), falls risk (p < 0.01), depressive symptoms (p = 0.01) and loneliness (p = 0.03) at 3 months. At the 9 months follow up, significant improvements from baseline were demonstrated in the frequency, duration and total of physical activity level (p < 0.05), and all physical function measures (p < 0.05), with no decline in these measures from 3 to 9 months. At 9 months, significant changes were observed in the health related quality of life mobility and self care domains with reductions in both fear of falls and falls risk (p < 0.05).

The manta ray model motion is reconstructed from synchronized high-resolution videos of manta ray swimming. Rotation angles of the model skeletal joints are altered to scale the pitching and bending, resulting in eight models with different pectoral fin pitching and bending ratios. Simulations are performed using an in-house developed immersed boundary method-based numerical solver. Pectoral fin pitching ratio (PR) is found to have significant implications in the thrust and efficiency of the manta model. This occurs due to more optimal vortex formation and shedding caused by the lower pitching ratio. Leading edge vortexes (LEVs) formed on the bottom of the fin, a characteristic of the higher PR cases, produced parasitic low pressure that hinders thrust force. Lowering the PR reduces the influence of this vortex while another LEV that forms on the top surface of the fin strengthens it. A moderately high bending ratio (BR) can slightly reduce power consumption. Finally, by combining a moderately high BR = 0.83 with PR = 0.67, further performance improvements can be made. This enhanced understanding of manta-inspired propulsive mechanics fills a gap in our understanding of the manta-like mobuliform locomotion.

In addition to full length aaRS genes, genomes of many organisms are sprinkled with truncated genes encoding single-domain aaRS-like proteins, which often have relinquished their canonical role in genetic code translation. We have identified the genes for putative seryl-tRNA synthetase homologs widespread in bacterial genomes and characterized three of them biochemically and structurally. The proteins encoded are homologous to the catalytic domain of highly diverged, atypical seryl-tRNA synthetases (aSerRSs) found only in methanogenic archaea and are deprived of the tRNA-binding domain. Remarkably, in comparison to SerRSs, aSerRS homologs display different and relaxed amino acid specificity. aSerRS homologs lack canonical tRNA aminoacylating activity and instead transfer activated amino acid to phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of putative carrier proteins, whose genes were identified in the genomic surroundings of aSerRS homologs. Detailed kinetic analysis confirmed that aSerRS homologs aminoacylate these carrier proteins efficiently and specifically. Accordingly, aSerRS homologs were renamed amino acid:[carrier protein] ligases (AMP forming). The enzymatic activity of aSerRS homologs is reminiscent of adenylation domains in nonribosomal peptide synthesis, and thus they represent an intriguing link between programmable ribosomal protein biosynthesis and template-independent nonribosomal peptide synthesis.","output":"Homologs of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases acylate carrier proteins and provide a link between ribosomal and nonribosomal peptide synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The high prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with psychiatric disorders, almost double the prevalence reported for the general population, is worrying.

Evidence showed that patients with DOC lasting 1 year or longer after a brain injury were less likely to recover. However, the reasons why outcomes of DOC patients differ greatly remain unclear. With a variety of analytical methods and through quantitative behavioral assessments, we aimed to track the progression of a patient with severe brain injury, in order to advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of DOC. CASE PRESENTATION: We performed a longitudinal study for a 52-year-old male DOC patient who has remained in the state for 1.5 years with comprehensive rehabilitative therapies. The patient underwent 3 times of assessments of Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and ultra-high-field 7 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both topologic properties and brain microstructure were analyzed to track disease progression. We observed dynamic increases of fiber densities with measurements at three time points (t1:1.5 M, t2:7.5 M t3:17.5 M). Specifically, fiber densities of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and arcuate fasciculus nerve fiber bundles improved mostly in the visual, verbal, and auditory subscales, which was consistent with the CRS-R scores. Moreover, the graph-theory analyses demonstrated that network topologic properties showed an improvement although the disease duration exceeded 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: DOC patients with a course longer than 1 year remain possible to improve, and including evaluation methods such as WM connectome analysis and graph theory could be potentially valuable for a more precise assessment of patients with a longer course of DOC.","output":"Chronic disorders of consciousness: a case report with longitudinal evaluation of disease progression using 7 T magnetic resonance imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a \\"public health emergency of international concern\\" (PHEIC).

Indeed, studies have revealed that immune alteration is not merely an association, as it might occur in systemic infections, but, very likely, the core pathogenic element of COVID-19. In addition, precise management of immune response in COVID-19, i.e. enhancing anti-viral immunity while inhibiting systemic inflammation, may be key to successful treatment.

At present, CE is considered to grant the most traction for companies to achieve sustainable development. However, CE is still rarely adopted by enterprises. As the backbone of the fourth industrial revolution, the digital economy (DE) is considered to have a disruptive effect. Studies have shown that digital technology has great potential in promoting the development of CE. Especially during the COVID-19 epidemic that has severely negatively affected the global economy, environment, and society, CE and DE are receiving high attention from policy makers, practitioners, and scholars around the world. However, the integration of CE and digital technology is a small and rapidly developing research field that is still in its infancy. Although there is a large amount of research in the fields of CE and DE, respectively, there are few studies that look into integrating these two fields. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the research progress and trends of the integration of CE and DE, and provide an overview for future research.

It is a matter of controversy whether acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome is a distinct clinical entity. This is the first Asian report on acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome to be made outside Japan. METHODS: From January 1989 to December 1999, 8,085 patients underwent total colonoscopy at our institution. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records and colonoscopic files. The diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome was made by means of the clinical, histologic, and colonoscopic findings. RESULTS: Among the 8,085 patients, 19 patients (11 males; mean age, 71.2  10.1 years) were diagnosed with acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome, which accounted for 2.8 percent of the patients with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The duration from hospitalization to the onset of massive bleeding ranged from 3 to 14 (mean, 9  3.3) days. Characteristics of colonoscopic appearance were solitary or multiple rectal ulcer(s), with round, circumferential, geographical, or Dieulafoy-like lesions located within a mean of 4.7 cm  1.5 cm from the dentate line. Histopathologically, the lesions appeared as necrosis with denudation of covering epithelium, hemorrhage, and multiple thrombi in the vessels of the mucosa and underlying stroma, which is considered to be similar to stress-related mucosa injury. Successful hemostasis was obtained in 74 percent (14/19) of patients with direct therapeutic maneuvers. Prognosis was largely dependent on accurate diagnosis and management of the underlying disorders. CONCLUSIONS: We assert that acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome is a rare but important entity and stress that awareness of this clinical entity should lead to a high index of suspicion resulting in early detection, diagnosis, and appropriate therapy.","output":"Acute Hemorrhagic Rectal Ulcer Syndrome: A New Clinical Entity?

We document robust evidence of significant spatial effects in both the dependent and the main explanatory variables of interest. For the whole period considered in this study, the COVID-19 vaccination was found to significantly increase the COVID-19 infection and death ratios in the total county population. This result is caused by two opposite effects of the COVID-19 vaccination of two age groups. Specifically, the COVID-19 vaccination of county population aged 65 and below significantly increased the county COVID-19 infection and death ratios while the COVID-19 vaccination of county population aged over 65 significantly reduced them. The finding of strong opposite effects suggests that the moral hazard issue is disproportionally worse among vaccinated and probably unvaccinated group of young people, which might cause a surge of the COVID-19 cases and deaths in the period leading to the herd immunity. Finally, we also find that while remaining significant for the period between January 01 and October 15, 2021, the moral hazard-related impact of the COVID-19 vaccination was substantially decreasing over time as the COVID-19 vaccine coverage increased.","output":"How Does the COVID-19 Vaccination Matter?

What makes Mizrachi et al.s findings particularly intriguing, despite several caveats, is the manner in which they demonstrated a commitment to genuinely listen to individual voices. The researchers spoke openly and bluntly with interviewees as peers and were rewarded with specific, well-defined and applicable answers with the potential to be used. The most striking findings came in candid answers that went beyond the factors intrinsic to the online offerings and addressed important factors in what regular Internet users often refer to as IRL (in real life), such as support from family. The necessity of avoiding preconceptions about the most effective manner to engage patients underscores the importance of patient and family advisory councils (PFACs). PFACs, increasingly being adopted by health care organizations globally, provide an ongoing ability to listen and respond to the patient voice. Effectively addressing obstacles to older adults use of the full range of online health resources will require the involvement not just of health plans and government, but also of voluntary organizations, providers, families and others integral to users offline real lives.

While high\\\\throughput metabarcoding has revolutionized the study of bacterial communities, generating comparable viral communities has proven elusive, particularly in wildlife samples where the diversity of viruses and limited quantities of viral nucleic acid present distinctive challenges. Metagenomic sequencing is a promising solution for studying viral communities, but the lack of standardized methods currently precludes comparisons across host taxa or localities. Here, we developed an untargeted shotgun metagenomic sequencing protocol to generate comparable viral communities from noninvasively collected faecal and oropharyngeal swabs. Using samples from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus), a key species for virus transmission to humans and domestic animals, we tested how different storage media, nucleic acid extraction procedures and enrichment steps affect viral community detection. Based on finding viral contamination in foetal bovine serum, we recommend storing swabs in RNAlater or another nonbiological medium. We recommend extracting nucleic acid directly from swabs rather than from supernatant or pelleted material, which had undetectable levels of viral RNA. Results from a low\\\\input RNA library preparation protocol suggest that ribosomal RNA depletion and light DNase treatment reduce host and bacterial nucleic acid, and improve virus detection. Finally, applying our approach to twelve pooled samples from seven localities in Peru, we showed that detected viral communities saturated at the attained sequencing depth, allowing unbiased comparisons of viral community composition. Future studies using the methods outlined here will elucidate the determinants of viral communities across host species, environments and time.","output":"Using noninvasive metagenomics to characterize viral communities from wildlife"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the effect of the isolation during the lockdown period on psychological distress and well-being in a sample of professors (N=150), students (N=150) and technical administrative staff (N=150) from 3 Italian Universities, in the region of Tuscany.

When generated in moderate amounts, ROS promote sperm capacitation by facilitating cholesterol efflux from the plasma membrane, enhancing cAMP generation, inducing cytoplasmic alkalinization, increasing intracellular calcium levels, and stimulating the protein phosphorylation events that drive the attainment of a capacitated state. However, when ROS generation is excessive and/or the antioxidant defences of the reproductive system are compromised, a state of oxidative stress may be induced that disrupts the fertilizing capacity of the spermatozoa and the structural integrity of their DNA. This article focusses on the sources of ROS within this system and examines the circumstances under which the adequacy of antioxidant protection might become a limiting factor. Seminal leukocyte contamination can contribute to oxidative stress in the ejaculate while, in the germ line, the dysregulation of electron transport in the sperm mitochondria, elevated NADPH oxidase activity, or the excessive stimulation of amino acid oxidase action are all potential contributors to oxidative stress. A knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for creating such stress within the human ejaculate is essential in order to develop better antioxidant strategies that avoid the unintentional creation of its reductive counterpart.","output":"Male Infertility and Oxidative Stress: A Focus on the Underlying Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Residents of nursing homes are at high risk of infectious complications due to respiratory infection.

The purpose of this study was to document how the experience of providing medical assistance in dying (MAiD) changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using semistructured interviews with key informants in Canada who provided or coordinated MAiD before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We interviewed participants from April to June 2020 by telephone or email. We collected and analyzed data in an iterative manner and reached theme saturation. Our team reached consensus on the major themes and subthemes. RESULTS: We interviewed 1 MAiD coordinator and 15 providers, including 14 physicians and 1 nurse practitioner. We identified 4 main themes. The most important theme was the perception that the pandemic increased the suffering of patients receiving MAiD by isolating them from loved ones and reducing available services. Providers were distressed by the difficulty of establishing rapport and closeness at the end of life, given the requirements for physical distancing and personal protective equipment. They were concerned about the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and found it difficult to enforce rules about distancing and the number of people present. Logistics and access to MAiD became more difficult because of the new restrictions, but there were many adaptations to solve these problems. INTERPRETATION: Providers and coordinators had many challenges in providing MAiD during the COVID-19 pandemic, including their perception that the suffering of their patients increased. Some changes in how MAiD is provided that have occurred during the pandemic, including more telemedicine assessments and virtual witnessing, are likely to remain after the pandemic and may improve service.","output":"How the experience of medical assistance in dying changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada: a qualitative study of providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has led to large-scale lifestyle changes and increased social isolation and stress on a societal level.

AIM: This study aimed to assess the evolution of training participants self-reported competency in mental health care and the number of referrals made to higher levels of care as well as to reflect on the possible broader effects of the training. SETTING: The programme and study were conducted in South Africa with Medical Officers and Professional Nurses working at public sector primary and secondary level health care facilities. METHODS: A descriptive observational study collected data from training participants through a pre- and post-course, and 3-month follow-up survey. RESULTS: The average confidence ratings for performing mental health care activities and managing mental health conditions increased from pre- to post-course, and was either maintained or increased further at 3-month follow-up. A decrease in the self-reported percentage of patients being referred to a higher level of care was observed 3-months after the training.

Latest reports revealed that more than 800 thousand people in over 200 countries are involved in the epidemic disease by SARS-CoV-2. Due to the high mortality rate and the lack of optimum therapeutics, it is crucial to understand the biological characteristics of the virus and its possible pathogenesis to respond to the SARS-CoV-2. Rapid diagnostics and effective therapeutics are also important interventions for the management of infection control. However, the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 exerted tremendous challenges on its diagnostics and therapeutics. Therefore, there is an urgent need to summarize the existing research results to guide decision-making on the prioritization of resources for research and development.

We asked the respondents about their current healthcare-seeking behaviours for influenza-like illness (ILI), protective measures (personal hygiene, social distancing), and compliance with health authorities. We then asked what they would do during a hypothetical pandemic. We interviewed 256 Beijing participants in our study (response rate 56%).

Fifty-five percent (95% CI 48-62) of the participants would seek care from a more specialized hospital during a pandemic than currently. More than 90% of the participants reported already practising hand-washing or covering their coughs or sneezes during a non-pandemic period; this percentage changed little under a pandemic scenario.

Whether exercise lowers susceptibility or severity is not known. METHODS: We identified 944 cancer patients from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (mean age: 64; 85% female; 78% White) completing an exercise survey before receiving a confirmed positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 test. Exercise was defined as reporting moderate-intensity 5 days per week, 30 minutes/session or strenuous-intensity 3 days per week, 20 minutes/session. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between exercise and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity (i.e., composite of hospital admission or death events) with adjustment for clinical-epidemiologic covariates. RESULTS: Twenty-four percent (230/944) of the overall cohort were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 35% (333/944) were exercisers. During a median follow-up of 10 months, 26% (156/611) of nonexercising patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 compared with 22% (74/333) of exercising patients. The adjusted OR for risk of COVID-19 was 0.65 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.44-0.96, P = 0.03] for exercisers compared with nonexercisers. A total of 20% (47/230) of COVID-19 positive patients were hospitalized or died. No difference in the risk of severe COVID-19 as a function of exercise status was observed (P > 0.9).

In this study, we examined the association between social capital and mental health problems among in-school adolescents in Harari Regional State, eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 3227 in-school adolescents of 13C19 years. A multistage sampling was used to select participants. Guided self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Mental health problem was measured using a self-administered version of the strength and difficulty questionnaire (SDQ), while social capital questionnaire for adolescent students (SCQ-AS) was used to collect data about the condition of social capital. The data were double entered, validated, and cleaned using EpiData 3.1 and analyzed using STATA 14.1. The association between the outcome variable and predictors was analyzed using an ordinal logistic regression model. The result was reported using an odds ratio along with 95% confidence interval (CI) and a p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant association. RESULTS: A total of 740 (22.93%) students had mental health problem, of which 9.7% (95% CI, 8.7C10.8) and 13.20% (95% CI, 12C14) were classified as abnormal and borderline, respectively.

We tested the new self-fixating mesh Parietene progrip vs. traditional suture fixating Lichtenstein repair in a double-blinded randomized study evaluating postoperative pain and the use of analgesics. METHODS Fifty patients were randomized into two groups: Patients of group A (24 patients) were operated with the new self-fixating Parietene progrip mesh without fixation sutures and patients of group B (26 patients) were operated with the traditional Lichtenstein repair. Postoperative course including pain and the use of analgesics were monitored. Patients were reinvestigated after 6 months regarding pain score and the amount of analgesics used during this interval. Primary end point was pain on the first operative day. RESULTS The visual analog scale pain score showed at the first postoperative day a significantly lower level in group A than in group B (mean 17.9 vs. 32.3 mm, p = 0.03). Additionally, the cumulative dose of postoperatively required analgesics was lower in group A than in group B. The operative time in group A was significantly shorter than in group B.

The goal of this work was the development, characterization, and evaluation of the cytocompatibility of otoliths-incorporated sodium alginate and gelatin scaffolds. Cynoscion acoupa-derived otoliths were characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (FRX), particle size, free lime, and weight loss by calcination. Furthermore, otoliths were incorporated into sodium alginate (ALG/OTL-s) or gelatin (GEL/OTL-s) scaffolds, previously developed by freeze-drying. Then, the scaffolds were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/DTG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared spectroscopy with Fourier transform (FTIR), swelling tests, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cytotoxicity assays were run against J774.G8 macrophages and MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Data obtained from TGA/DTG, DSC, and FTIR analyses confirmed the interaction between otoliths and the polymeric scaffolds. SEM showed the homogeneous porous 3D structure rich in otolith micro-fragments in both scaffolds. Swelling of the GEL/OTL-s (63.54  3.0%) was greater than of ALG/OTL-s (13.36  9.9%) (p < 0.001). The viability of J774.G8 macrophages treated with both scaffolds was statistically similar to the group treated with DMEM only (p > 0.05) and significantly higher than that treated with Triton-X (p < 0.01) at 72 h. Both scaffolds showed approximately 100% growth of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts by 24 h, similarly to control (p > 0.05). However, by 48 h, only ALG/OTL-s showed growth similar to control (p > 0.05), whereas GEL/OTL showed a significantly lower growth index (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the physicochemical profiles suggest proper interaction between the otoliths and the two developed polymeric 3D scaffolds. Moreover, both materials showed cytocompatibility with J774.G8 macrophages but the growth of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts was higher when exposed to ALG/OTL-s.

To reach the spatiotemporal understanding of epidemics, we have developed Haplotype Explorer. In Haplotype Explorer, users can explore the network interactively with metadata like accession number, locations, and collection dates. Time dependent transition of the network can be exported as continuous sections for making a movie. Here, we introduce features and products of Haplotype Explorer, demonstrating time-dependent snapshots and a movie of haplotype networks inferred from total of 4,282 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. ABSTRACT: The worldwide eruption of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 reached 10 million cases by late June 2020. In order to understand the epidemiological landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have attempted to elucidate phylogenetic relationships between collected viral genome sequences using haplotype networks. However, currently available applications for network visualization are not suited to understand the COVID-19 epidemic spatiotemporally due to functional limitations, that motivated us to develop Haplotype Explorer, an intuitive tool for visualizing and exploring haplotype networks. Haplotype Explorer enables to dissect epidemiological consequences via interactive node filters and provides the perspective on infectious disease dynamics depend on regions and time, such as introduction, outbreak, expansion, and containment. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Haplotype Explorer by showing features and an example of visualization. The demo using SARS-CoV-2 genomes are available at https://github.com/TKSjp/HaplotypeExplorer/blob/master/Example/.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Public HealthSeattle & King County (PHSKC) CI/CT program, including its reach, timeliness, effect on isolation and quarantine (I&Q) adherence, and potential to mitigate pandemic-related hardships. DESIGN: This program evaluation used descriptive statistics to analyze surveillance records, case and contact interviews, referral records, and survey data provided by a sample of cases who had recently ended isolation. SETTING: The PHSKC is one of the largest governmental local health departments in the United States. It serves more than 2.2 million people who reside in Seattle and 38 other municipalities. PARTICIPANTS: King County residents who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between July 2020 and June 2021. INTERVENTION: The PHSKC integrated COVID-19 CI/CT with prevention education and service provision. RESULTS: The PHSKC CI/CT team interviewed 42 900 cases (82% of cases eligible for CI/CT), a mean of 6.1 days after symptom onset and 3.4 days after SARS-CoV-2 testing. Cases disclosed the names and addresses of 10 817 unique worksites (mean = 0.8/interview) and 11 432 other recently visited locations (mean = 0.5/interview) and provided contact information for 62 987 household members (mean = 2.7/interview) and 14 398 nonhousehold contacts (mean = 0.3/interview).

MIP-T3 interacts specifically with TRAF3, but its function in innate IFN response remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated a negative regulatory role of MIP-T3 in type I IFN production. Overexpression of MIP-T3 inhibited RIG-I-, MDA5-, VISA-, TBK1-, and IKK-induced transcriptional activity mediated by IFN-stimulated response elements and IFN- promoter. MIP-T3 interacted with TRAF3 and perturbed in a dose-dependent manner the formation of functional complexes of TRAF3 with VISA, TBK1, IKK, and IFN regulatory factor 3. Consistent with this finding, retinoic acid-inducible gene I- and TBK1-induced phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 was significantly diminished when MIP-T3 was overexpressed. Depletion of MIP-T3 facilitated Sendai virus-induced activation of IFN production and attenuated the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus. In addition, MIP-T3 was found to be dissociated from TRAF3 during the course of Sendai virus infection.

The vicarious stresses associated with the covid-19 pandemic have been reported to cause psychosocial behavioral changes in individuals not infected with the virus. No reports have evaluated the effect of these stresses on triggering acute ST-segment elevation and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI and NSTEMI, respectively) in such individuals. Purpose. We sought to study the nature of MI triggers and clinical profiles in non covid-19 individuals during the pandemic. Methods: Patients not infected with the covid-19 virus admitted to 9 hospitals with STEMI and NSTEMI during the pandemic crisis in Jordan from February through December 2020 were evaluated for pre-MI exposure to psychosocial and economic triggers related to the pandemic, lockdown and shutdown. Results: Of 144 patients enrolled, 58 (40.3%) had STEMI and 86 (59.7%) had NSTEMI. Compared with the NSTEMI group, the STEMI group tended to be younger (59.0 + 13.8 vs. 62.3 + 12.7 years, p = 0.14), had significantly more men than women (94.9% vs. 75.6%, p = 0.005), were more likely to be smokers (75.9% vs. 55.8, p = 0.02) and had lower prevalence of prior coronary revascularization (17.2% vs. 45.3%, p = 0.001). In-hospital mortality among the 133 patients who were alive upon hospital arrival was 1.5%. All patients reported exposure to at least one psychosocial stressful trigger, including lockdown and loneliness stress (65.3%), fear of contacting covid-19 infection or of uncertainty (26.4%), anger (18.8%), and death of a significant person during the pandemic (4.2%) Financial hardship and volatile income were reported by 42.4% of patients. STEMI and NSTEMI patients did not have significant differences in the frequency of psychosocial (100% vs. 99.9%, respectively, p = NS) or economic triggers (34.5% vs. 47.7%, respectively, p = NS). Conclusions. Exposure to psychosocial and financial stresses related to the covid-19 pandemic and its related lockdown can trigger acute MI.

Background: The spread of the coronavirus and the attempts of governments to slow it down are severely affecting livelihoods worldwide. The institutionalised ageism underlying these government measures affects the youngest and oldest in society in particular (Ayalon et al. 2020;van Dyk et al. 2020). Intergenerational relations of social reproduction enacted, inter alia, through practices of eldercare, grandparenting, or voluntary work, are significantly limited in the current pandemic, as older adults are framed as an 'at-risk group', children as 'silent transmitters', and young adults as a 'risky group' (Ayalon et al. 2020;Stokes & Patterson 2020). These constructions contribute to the constitution, stabilisation and 'doing' of age in the pandemic. Method: We present findings from longitudinal research that was conducted through qualitative, problem-centred interviews between March 2020 and February 2021 with persons of different ages living in different household and care constellations in Germany. Results: Whereas in non-pandemic times doing age can be constitutive for doing family - as a constellation traditionally perceived to comprise multiple generations - we see the opposite happening in the pandemic: as age-based government measures to contain the spread of the virus limit intergenerational relations, older adults face the risk of being excluded from families. Hence, doing age can lead to a redoing or even an undoing of family.

To prevent an outbreak in the community, identifying the likely sources of infection (hotspots) of COVID-19 is important. The goal of this study is to formulate a bipartite network model of COVID-19 transmissions by incorporating patient mobility data to address the assumption on population homogeneity made in the conventional models and focus on indirect transmission. Two types of nodes C human and location C are the main concern in the research scenario. 21 location nodes and 31 human nodes are identified from a patients pre-processed mobility data. The parameters used in this study for location node and human node quantifications are the ventilation rate of a location and the environmental properties of the location that affect the stability of the virus such as temperature and relative humidity. The summation rule is applied to quantify all nodes in the network and the link weight between the human node and the location node. The ranking of location and human nodes in this network is computed using a web search algorithm. This model is considered verified as the error obtained from the comparison made between the benchmark model and the COVID-19 bipartite network model is small. As a result, the higher ranking of the location is denoted as a hotspot in this study, and for a human node attached to this node will be ranked higher in the human node ranking. Consequently, the hotspot has a higher risk of transmission compared to other locations. These findings are proposed to provide a framework for public health authorities to identify the sources of infection and high-risk groups of people in the COVID-19 cases to control the transmission at the initial stage. ? 2021 by the author(s).","output":"Modelling COVID-19 hotspot using bipartite network approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally distributed, soil associated Metarhizium species used in insect biological control are evidently facultatively sexual and obligately outcrossing, yet sexual morphs have not been observed for most species and corroboration they recombine in nature remains limited. Community-wide genetic diversity of Metarhizium species among 480 soil isolates from 14 states of western USA was investigated to assess the contributions of clonality and recombination in determining each species' population structure. Seven species, varying >100-fold in relative abundance, were identified by phylogenetic analysis of 5' EF1-&#945; (5TEF), including M. robertsii (n=372), M. guizhouense (n=37), M. brunneum (n=37), M. lepidiotae (n=14), M. pemphigi (n=11), M. anisopliae (n=7) and M. pingshaense (n=2). Analyses of composite multilocus genotypes integrating 5TEF sequences, multilocus microsatellites and mating type idiomorphs conducted on a subset of 239 isolates revealed that all species populations display pronounced clonal structure. Following clone-correction procedures to remove redundant clonal genotypes and collapse clonal lineages, each species' population sample was determined to be composed of a dozen or fewer genetically unique individuals. Thus, the Metarhizium community inhabiting western USA is conservatively estimated to comprise as few as 34 distinct genetic individuals, with a single, geographically ubiquitous clonal lineage of M. robertsii constituting 45% of total isolates. M. robertsii was the only population determined to be in linkage equilibrium. However, the high proportion of private alleles differentiating most M. robertsii clonal lineages argues against contemporary panmixia, thus the recombination signal detected may be historical. Nevertheless, within M. robertsii, M. brunneum and M. guizhouense there are closely related genotypes of opposite mating type, which suggests that if recombination is contemporary, it likely occurs between closely related individuals. The restricted number of genetic individuals observed throughout western North American Metarhizium species may signify these represent peripheral populations descended from limited numbers of founders among whom there has been little recombination relative to the extent of clone expansion and within-clone genetic divergence.","output":"Genetic structure of Metarhizium species in western USA: finite populations composed of divergent clonal lineages with limited evidence for recent recombination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented destabilization of the world's health and economic systems.

On March 11, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. The first instance of the virus in Nigeria was documented on February 27, 2020. Methods This study provides a preliminary epidemiological analysis of the first 45 days of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria quantifying. We estimated the early transmissibility via time-varying reproduction number based on Bayesian method that incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of serial interval (time interval between symptoms onset in an infected individual and the infector) and adjusted for disease importation. Findings By April 11, 2020, 318 confirmed cases and 10 deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in Nigeria. At day 45, the exponential growth rate was 0.07 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.05-0.10) with doubling time of 9.84 days (95% CI: 7.28 - 15.18). Separately for travel related and local cases the doubling time was 12.88 days and 2.86 days, respectively. Furthermore, we estimated the reproduction number for each day of the outbreak using three-weekly window while adjusting for travel related cases. The estimated reproduction number was 4.98 (95% CrI: 2.65 -8.41) at day 22 (March 19, 2020), peaking at 5.61 (95% CrI: 3.83 -7.88) at day 25 (March 22, 2020). The median reproduction number over the study period was 2.71 and the latest value at April 11, 2020 was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.26 - 1.58).

However, the pathogenesis and medical treatment of PMs remain largely unelucidated. METHODS Laparoscopically-induced PM xenografted mouse model was conducted by xenografting human uterine myoma fragments into the abdominal cavity of SCID mice and hormonal manipulation was performed using this mouse model to demonstrate the role of oestrogen in the development of implanted PMs. Immunohistochemistry of oestrogen receptor  (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), vimentin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), microvessel density (MVD) and Ki-67 index was performed and compared. RESULTS In the patient with PMs, ER, PR, angiogenesis and proliferative property expression were upregulated in PM lesions compared to uterine myomas. In the laparoscopically-induced PM mouse model, implanted myomas had more steroid receptor expressions, angiogenesis and proliferative property compared with pre-xenografted or non-implanted myoma. Depletion of oestrogen in the ovariectomized (OVX) mice decreased laparoscopically-induced PM implantations. In comparison, the implantations of PMs were increased with additional E2 supplement. Hormonal manipulation in the PM mouse model, including AI, GnRHa and SERM groups, were compared and AI significantly decreased the implantations, steroid receptor, angiogenesis, cell density, and proliferative index of PMs compared with control group.

STARLINER aimed to characterise disease behaviour in patients with suspected ILD during the peri-diagnostic period using real-time home-based assessments. METHODS: STARLINER (NCT03261037) was an international, multicentre study. Patients  50 years old with suspected ILD were followed throughout the peri-diagnostic period, consisting of a pre-diagnostic period (from enrolment to diagnosis) and a post-diagnostic period (from diagnosis to treatment initiation). Study length was variable ( 18 months). The primary endpoint was time-adjusted semi-annual forced vital capacity (FVC) change measured during the peri-diagnostic period using daily home spirometry in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Secondary outcomes included changes in FVC (home spirometry) in patients with non-IPF ILD, changes in FVC (site spirometry), changes in physical functional capacity measured by daily home accelerometry and site 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in IPF or non-IPF ILD. RESULTS: Of the 178 patients enrolled in the study, 68 patients were diagnosed with IPF, 62 patients were diagnosed with non-IPF ILD, 9 patients received a non-ILD diagnosis and 39 patients did not receive a diagnosis. Technical and analytical issues led to problems in applying the prespecified linear regression model to analyse the home FVC data. Time-adjusted median (quartile [Q]1, Q3) semi-annual FVC change during the peri-diagnostic period measured using home and site spirometry, respectively, was C 147.7 (C 723.8, 376.2) ml and C 149.0 (C 314.6, 163.9) ml for IPF and 19.1 (C 194.9, 519.0) ml and C 23.4 (C 117.9, 133.5) ml in non-IPF ILD. A greater decline in steps per day was observed for IPF versus non-IPF ILD, whereas an increase in 6MWD was observed for patients with IPF versus a decline in 6MWD for patients with non-IPF ILD. No clear patterns of disease behaviour were observed for IPF versus non-IPF ILD for PROs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite home spirometry being feasible for most patients and centres, technical and analytical challenges in the home-based assessments prevented firm conclusions regarding disease behaviour. This highlights that further optimisation of the technology and analysis methods is required before widespread implementation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03261037.

SQS1 gene from G. uralensis (GuSQS1) was cloned and over-expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Six recombinant P. pastoris strains containing different copy number of GuSQS1 were constructed. HPLC was used to assay the level of ergosterol in all transgenic P. pastoris strains containing GuSQS1. HPLC analysis showed that the contents of ergosterol in all of the transgenic P. pastoris containing GuSQS1 were higher than that in the negative control. And with the increase of copy number of GuSQS1, the content of ergosterol showed an increasing-decreasing-increasing pattern. The contents of ergosterol in 10-copy-GuSQS1 P. pastoris and 47-copy-GuSQS1 P. pastoris were significantly higher than that in the rest recombinant P. pastoris strains. In conclusion, the CNVs of GuSQS1 influence the content of secondary metabolites in the MVA pathway.

However, little is known about the infectiousness of RT-PCR positive patients who pass undetected by AGT. In a screening setting for mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with high COVID-19 prevalence (30-40%), 1141 patients were tested using one of five AGTs and RT-PCR. Where the results differed, virus viability in the samples was tested on cell culture (CV-1 cells). The test battery included AGTs by JOYSBIO, Assure Tech, SD Biosensor, VivaChek Biotech and NDFOS. Sensitivities of the ATGs compared to RT-PCR ranged from 42% to 76%. The best test yielded a 76% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 92% positive, and 89% negative predictive values, respectively. However, in the best performing ATG tests, almost 90% of samples with \\"false negative\\" AGT results contained no viable virus. Corrected on the virus viability, sensitivities grew to 81-97% and, with one exception, the tests yielded high specificities >96%. Performance characteristics of the best test after adjustment were 96% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 92% positive, and 99% negative predictive values (high prevalence population). We, therefore, believe that virus viability should be considered when assessing the AGT performance. Also, our results indicate that a well-performing antigen test could in a high-prevalence setting serve as an excellent tool for identifying patients shedding viable virus. We also propose that the high proportion of RT-PCR-positive samples containing no viable virus in the group of \\"false negatives\\" of the antigen test should be further investigated with the aim of possibly preventing needless isolation of such patients.","output":"Five Antigen Tests for SARS-CoV-2: Virus Viability Matters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked population health administrative databases of pregnant people giving birth in any hospital in Ontario between July 2002 and December 2020. We calculated preterm birth and stillbirth rates. We assessed preterm birth at 22-28, 29-32 and 33-36 weeks' gestation, and stillbirths at term and preterm gestation. We used Laney control P' charts for the 18-year study period (6-mo observation periods) and interrupted time-series analyses for monthly rates for the most recent 4 years. RESULTS: We evaluated 2 465 387 pregnancies, including 13 781 that resulted in stillbirth. The mean preterm birth rate for our cohort was 7.96% (range 7.32%-8.59%). From January to December 2020, we determined that the preterm birth rate in Ontario was 7.87%, with no special cause variation. The mean stillbirth rate for the cohort was 0.56% (range 0.48%-0.70%). From January to December 2020, the stillbirth rate was 0.53%, with no special cause variation. We did not find any special cause variation for preterm birth or stillbirth subgroups. We found no changes in slope or gap between prepandemic and pandemic periods using interrupted time-series analyses.

Using siRNA-mediated depletion of specific ER components, in combination with the potent Sec61 inhibitor ipomoeassin F (Ipom-F), we show that type III TMPs utilise a distinct pathway for membrane integration at the ER. Hence, following SRP-mediated delivery to the ER, type III TMPs can uniquely access the membrane insertase activity of the ER membrane complex (EMC) via a mechanism that is facilitated by the Sec61 translocon.

Studies of CXR scoring in the European population found a higher score in males than in females and significantly correlated with age. Because there have not been studies in the Mexican-mestizo community, we aimed to compare the differences in CXR scores between males and females and their correlation with age after controlling comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of 1000 CXR of Mexican-mestizo patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by RT-PCR. Significant differences between age, age groups, symptoms, comorbidities, and CXR scores between males and females used the Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square tests (&#967; 2), and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The relationship between the total CXR score and age was measured with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (Rs); partial correlation analysis controlled the effect of symptoms, risk factors, and comorbidities. Results: The total CXR score did not show a difference between males and females grouped by age. There was a positive, low correlation between the total CXR score and age in males, Rs = 0.260, p < 0.001 (N = 616), and in females, Rs = 0.170, p = 0.001 (N = 384).

Rs decreased its magnitude (from Rs = 0.152 to Rs = 0.046) and lost its significance (change in p value from p < 0.001 to p = 0.145) after controlling the effect of hypertension. Conclusions: There is no significant difference in CXR score between males and females in the Mexican-mestizo population grouped by age. Hypertension cancels the significance of CXR severity with age pointing to its role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19.

To demonstrate the use of RV for damage detection, we simulate accelerated damage on sputtered iridium oxide film (SIROF) electrodes using potential cycling. RV measurements of the degraded electrodes are compared against standard characterization methods of cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.Main results.Our theoretical discussion illustrates how an intrinsic RV arises even from perfectly balanced biphasic pulses due to leakage via the charge-transfer resistance. Preliminary data inin-vivorat experiments follow the derived model of RV growth, thereby validating our hypothesis that RV is a characteristic of the electrode-tissue interface. RV can therefore be utilized for detecting damage at the electrode. Our experimental results for damage detection show that delamination of SIROF electrodes causes a reduction in charge storage capacity, which in turn reflects a measurable increase in RV.Significance.Chronically implanted electrical stimulation systems with multi-electrode arrays have been the focus of physiological engineering research for the last decade. Changes in RV over time can be a quick and effective method to identify and disconnect faulty electrodes in large arrays. Timely diagnoses of electrode status can ensure optimal long term operation, and prevent further damage to the tissue near these electrodes.","output":"Residual voltage as an ad-hoc indicator of electrode damage in biphasic electrical stimulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been confirmed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can transmit through droplets created when an infected human coughs or sneezes. Accordingly, 1.83-m (6-feet) social distancing is advised to reduce the spread of the disease among humans. This is based on the assumption that no air circulation exists around people. However, it is not well investigated whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets to transport farther in the air, making the current social distancing policy insufficient. To provide evidence and insight into the social distancing guidelines, a validated computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) model was employed to simulate the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets emitted by coughs, with different environmental wind velocities and RHs. Initial droplet diameters range from 2 to 2000 m, and the wind velocities range from 0 to 16 km/h, representing different wind forces from calm air to moderate breeze. The comparison between a steady-state wind and a gust with a constant frequency has also been performed. Ambient RHs are 40% and 99.5%. The distances between the two virtual humans are 1.83 m and 3.05 m (6 feet and 10 feet). The facial covering effect on reducing the airborne transmission of the cough droplets has also been evaluated. Numerical results indicate that the ambient wind will enhance the complexity of the secondary flows with recirculation between the two virtual humans. Microdroplets follow the airflow streamlines well and deposit on both human bodies and head regions, even with the 3.05-m (10-feet) separation distance. The rest of the microdroplets can transport in the air farther than 3.05 m (10 feet) due to wind convection, causing a potential health risk to nearby people. High RH will increase the droplet sizes due to the hygroscopic growth effect, which increases the deposition fractions on both humans and the ground. With the complex environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects and can be transported from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5 s. Thus, due to the complex real-world environmental ventilation conditions, a social distance longer than 6 feet needs to be considered. Wearing masks should also be recommended for both infected and healthy humans to reduce the airborne cough droplet numbers.","output":"Influence of wind and relative humidity on the social distancing effectiveness to prevent COVID-19 airborne transmission: A numerical study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, Polish universities had to suspend all on-site activities due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Many countries are surfing subsequent waves of COVID-19, yet there is no global data in general nor from Iraq in particular regarding the extent of return of cardiac services to normal during the second year of pandemic, so, we investigated the rate of change in cardiac services during the second year of pandemic in Iraq. Methods: A 23-item online survey was sent via social media to healthcare professionals who were involved in providing cardiac services. Survey focused on rate of change in non-invasive and invasive cardiac services in 2021 compared with 2020 and type of PPE currently used by participants. It also assessed the academic achievements of respondents during pandemic compared to pre-pandemic era. Results: Thirty-two healthcare professionals responded, 15.6% were women, 15.6 % work in COVID-19 designated hospital, 81.3% were interventional cardiologists,9.4% were clinical cardiologists and 9.3% were pharmacists. Respondents were fellows-in training in 54.3%.

Patients and methods We retrospectively identified hospitalized patients in whom stroke and SARS-CoV-2 infection were diagnosed within the same 3-month interval between the period of September 2019 and December 2020, and extracted data on all available variables of interest. We further incorporated our findings into the existing body of basic science research to present a schematic model illustrating the proposed pathogenesis of ischemic stroke in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Results We identified 30 cases during the study period yielding a 0.5% stroke rate across 6381 SARS-CoV-2 infected hospitalized patients. Strokes were ischemic in 26/30 cases and hemorrhagic in 4/30. Traditional risk factors were common including hypertension (24/30), hyperlipidemia (18/30), smoking history (13/30), diabetes (11/30) and atrial fibrillation (8/30). The most common ischemic stroke mechanisms were cardioembolism (9/26) and cryptogenic (9/26). Intravenous alteplase and mechanical thrombectomy were administered in 2/26 and 1/26 respectively.

Phase 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reporting cardiotoxicity in MM patients (newly diagnoses and/or relapsed) treated with iMiD and/or PI. Studies, where iMiD or PI was used alongside the chemotherapy vs. placebo or no additional drugs (control) in the other arm were included. The primary outcome was the presence of cardiotoxicity after follow-up. Pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis were performed using the frequentist's approach to estimate the odds ratio (OR). Twenty RCTs with 10,373 MM patients were included in this analysis. Eleven studies compared iMiDs with control, seven studies compared PIs with control, and two studies compared bortezomib against carfilzomib. CTACE high-grade ( grade 3) cardiotoxic events were increased with iMiDs compared to their control counterpart (OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.30-3.26).

However, the stimulation of autophagy by external factors such as chemical compounds or viral infection mostly tends to induce apoptosis/cell death. This study hypothesizes that manipulation of the autophagy mechanism to the pro-cell survival and/or decreased pro-viral niche can be a strategy for effective antiviral and anticancer treatment. Cells susceptible to viral infection, namely LLC-MK2, normal monkey epithelium, and K562, human immune-related lymphocyte, which is also a cancer cell line, were treated with fludarabine nucleoside analog (Fdb), interferon alpha (IFN-), and a combination of Fdb and IFN-, and then were evaluated for signs of adaptive autophagy and STAT1 antiviral signaling by Western blotting and immunolabeling assays. The results showed that the low concentration of Fdb was able to activate an autophagy response in both cell types, as demonstrated by the intense immunostaining of LC3B foci in the autophagosomes of living cells. Treatment with IFN- (10 U/mL) showed no alteration in the initiator of mTOR autophagy but dramatically increased the intracellular STAT1 signaling molecules in both cell types. Although in the combined Fdb and IFN- treatment, both LLC-MK2 and K562 cells showed only slight changes in the autophagy-responsive proteins p-mTOR and LC3B, an adaptive autophagy event was clearly shown in the autophagosome of the LLC-MK2 cell, suggesting the survival phase of the normal cell. The combined effect of Fdb and IFN- treatment on the antiviral response was identified by the level of activation of the STAT1 antiviral marker. Significantly, the adaptive autophagy mediated by Fdb was able to suppress the IFN--mediated pSTAT1 signaling in both cell types to a level that is appropriate for cellular function. It is concluded that the administration of an appropriate dose of Fdb and IFN- in combination is beneficial for the treatment of some types of cancer and viral infection.","output":"Combined Effects of Fludarabine and Interferon Alpha on Autophagy Regulation Define the Phase of Cell Survival and Promotes Responses in LLC-MK2 and K562 Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has critically impacted the spread of infection within nursing facilities. We evaluated the usefulness of genetic and serological tests conducted during a COVID-19 outbreak in a nursing facility in Japan. Methods: : After the first identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a comprehensive, facility- and/or unit-wide PCR testing from nasopharyngeal swabs was repeatedly performed in a three-unit facility including 99 residents with dementia and 53 healthcare personnel. Additionally, PCR testing was conducted separately for residents and staff with fever of 37.5 o C. Facility-wide serological testing, including rapid kit testing and quantitative assay, was conducted twice over 1 month apart. Results: : A total of 322 PCR and 257 antibody tests were performed. 37 (24.3%) of the 152 individuals (25/99 residents, 25.3%;12/53 staff, 22.6%) were identified as PCR-positive. Seven residents died with a mortality of 7.1% (7/99). Among the 37 individuals, 10 (27.0%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing. PCR positivity was concentrated on one unit (Unit 1) (20/30 residents, 66.7%;9/14 staff, 64.3%). The other units showed a limited spread of infection. In unit-wide and separate tests, PCR positivity detection was highly prevalent (22.9% and 44.4%, respectively) in Unit 1, compared with that in the other units. Serological testing identified two additional infected residents with a negative PCR result and showed that no staff was newly identified as infected. Conclusions: : Thorough PCR testing, in combination with comprehensive and separate tests, is critical for managing COVID-19 outbreaks in nursing facilities, particularly, in units considered an epicenter. Serological testing is also beneficial for tracing contacts, confirming the number of infected individuals, and authorizing the termination of the outbreak.","output":"?Genetic testing and serological screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a COVID-19 outbreak in a nursing facility in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the SARS pandemic in Hong Kong, panic and worry were prevalent in the community and the general public avoided staying in public areas.

This study examined the prevalence of the avoidance behaviors (i.e. avoiding going out, visiting crowded places and visiting hospitals) and negative psychological responses of the general population in Hong Kong at the initial stage of the H1N1 epidemic. METHODS: A sample of 999 respondents was recruited in a population-based survey. Using random telephone numbers, respondents completed a structured questionnaire by telephone interviews at the 'pre-community spread phase' of the H1N1 epidemic in Hong Kong. RESULTS: This study found that 76.5% of the respondents currently avoided going out or visiting crowded places or hospitals, whilst 15% felt much worried about contracting H1N1 and 6% showed signs of emotional distress. Females, older respondents, those having unconfirmed beliefs about modes of transmissions, and those feeling worried and emotionally distressed due to H1N1 outbreak were more likely than others to adopt some avoidance behaviors. Those who perceived high severity and susceptibility of getting H1N1 and doubted the adequacy of governmental preparedness were more likely than others to feel emotionally distressed. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of avoidance behaviors was very high. Cognitions, including unconfirmed beliefs about modes of transmission, perceived severity and susceptibility were associated with some of the avoidance behaviors and emotional distress variables.

Experimental absolute IR intensities and vibrational band centers of the overtones 21, 31, 41 of HFA were measured and compared with their ab initio counterparts, calculated by the second-order canonical vibrational perturbation theory (CVPT2).

They had limited clinical exposure during COVID-19 resulting in difficulty transitioning into practice providing safe patient care. As a result, these nurses lacked the fundamental knowledge needed to care for acutely ill burn and wound patients resulting in the new graduate registered nurses (NGRNs) feeling overwhelmed at the bedside. These findings coincide with assessments noted in Kavanagh and Sharpnacks (2021), article identifying only 9% of NGRNs were practice ready, with 7% failing to recognize urgency or a change in a patients condition. Methods In order to achieve the designated American Burn Association (ABA) competencies, our center designed a program based on Patricia Benners Novice to Expert nursing theory. Additionally, we divided the competencies into achievable goals and domains using the Donna Wright's nursing competency model. StaRN program: didactics/simulation/skills/unit orientation one on one with a preceptor Competency based staged orientation program for new staff Burn Specific Education includes: 1) Burn and complex wound care didactic 2) Burn specific High-fidelity simulation scenario utilizing critical care equipment promoting critical thinking and critical reasoning skills 3) Task trainers 4) On-going preceptor education 5) Nurse Extern program Results NGRNS arriving at our unit in early 2020 were found to be incapable of performing clinical tasks in the burn ICU (BICU) setting at the level of competency recommended by the ABA. We immediately placed this cohort into the revised training program incorporating Benners Novice to Expert Theory and Wrights Competency Model. Of the 25, 17 were able to be placed in the BICU (68%), and 8 were able to transfer to a lower level of care (progressive care/med-surg). All 25 were given extended orientation (12 weeks instead of the normal 8, as recommended by our facility). We will follow this group to determine retention rates. Conclusions Current levels of competencies by the ABA creates gaps in care for graduate nurses entering the workforce with deficits. Applying Benner's Novice to Expert Theory and Wrights Competency Model to modify approaches to training helps identify gaps in care, addresses areas that are weak for the nurse, and help guide the graduate nurse through stages of expertise to arrive more confidently at the level of competency expected by the ABA.","output":"Nursing Theory and Burn Competency Training Practices to Address Gaps in Post-covid Trained Graduate Nurses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Although the pause in elective surgery was necessary to preserve healthcare resources at the height of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, recent data have highlighted the worsening pain, decline in physical activity, and increase in anxiety among cancelled total hip and knee arthroplasty patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our staged reopening protocol and the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among elective arthroplasty patients. METHODS: We identified all elective hip and knee arthroplasty patients who underwent our universal COVID-19 testing protocol during our phased reopening between May 1, 2020, and July 21, 2020, at our institution. We recorded the SARS-CoV-2 test results of each patient along with their demographics, medical comorbidities, and symptoms at the time of testing. We followed each of these positive patients through their rescheduled cases and recorded any complications or potential SARS-CoV-2 healthcare exposures. RESULTS: Of the 2,329 patients, we identified five patients (0.21%) with a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction--confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive test, none with symptoms. All patients were successfully rescheduled and underwent their elective arthroplasty procedure within 6 weeks of their original surgery date. None of these patients experienced a perioperative complication at the time of their rescheduled arthroplasty procedure. No orthopaedic surgeon or staff member caring for these patients reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. CONCLUSION: Our phased reopening protocol with universal preoperative virus testing was safe and identified a low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic, elective arthroplasty patients at our institution. With uncertainty regarding the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope that this research can guide future policy decisions regarding elective surgery.","output":"Low Incidence of Asymptomatic Positive Patients Detected During Preoperative Testing for Total Joint Arthroplasty During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To evaluate the prevalence of cardiac injury and its association with mortality in hospitalized patients infected with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A total of 133 hospitals in 17 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities of mainland China that admitted influenza A (H7N9) virusCinfected patients between January 22, 2015, and June 16, 2017. PATIENTS: A total of 321 patients with influenza A (H7N9) virus infection were included in the final analysis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographics and clinical characteristics were collected from medical records. Cardiac injury was defined according to cardiac biomarkers, electrocardiography, or echocardiography. Among the 321 patients, 203 (63.2%) showed evidence of cardiac injury. Compared with the uninjured group, the cardiac injury group had lower Pao(2)/Fio(2) (median, 102.0 vs 148.4 mm Hg; p < 0.001), higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (median, 17.0 vs 11.0; p < 0.001), longer stay in the ICU (10.0 vs 9.0 d; p = 0.029), and higher proportion of in-hospital death (64.0% vs 20.3%; p < 0.001). The proportion of virus clearance until discharge or death was lower in the cardiac injury group than in the uninjured group (58.6% vs 86.4%; p < 0.001). Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that cardiac injury was associated with higher mortality (hazards ratio, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.31C3.24) during hospitalization.

In this study, we demonstrated that the N protein of SARS-CoV could inhibit IFN-beta (IFN-) induced by poly(I:C) or Sendai virus. However, we found that N protein could not inhibit IFN- production induced by overexpression of downstream signaling molecules of two important IFN- induction pathways, toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR)-dependent pathways. These results indicate that SARS-CoV N protein targets the initial step, probably the cellular PRRs (pattern recognition receptors)-RNAs-recognition step in the innate immune pathways, to suppress IFN expression responses. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that N protein did not interact with RIG-I or MDA5. Further, an assay using truncated mutants revealed that the C-terminal domain of N protein was critical for its antagonism of IFN induction, and the N deletion mutant impaired for RNA-binding almost completely lost the IFN- antagonist activity. These results contribute to our further understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.","output":"SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein antagonizes IFN- response by targeting initial step of IFN- induction pathway, and its C-terminal region is critical for the antagonism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting effective communication between patients and their families has been a recognised challenge in the healthcare environment. Virtual communication via telecommunication and video-calling is more important than ever, but with minimal clinician education, preparation and relevant technological infrastructure available in the context of a global pandemic, we have recognised communication as an area for improvement as junior doctors working on a COVID-19 ward. METHODS: We interviewed via telephone 22 nominated next of kin relatives of patients admitted to a COVID-19 ward in the University Hospital of Llandough during May 2020 using a pre-prepared survey. We then provided relatives with the opportunity to engage with video-call updates from a doctor (with the patients permission). In appropriate scenarios, we used video calling to break bad news and to facilitate difficult communications with family members. These video calls were provided via Accurx, an NHS approved video communication system. RESULTS: Initial survey results showed an average understanding score of their relatives current clinical plan of 5.5/10, with 63% of respondents saying they did not feel well informed. Nearly a quarter of respondents (22%) had received difficult news over the phone during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 86% said they would find video communication useful. Post-intervention survey results suggested a unanimous improvement in relative satisfaction, with relatives reporting an increased understanding around the admission, reassurance around the quality of care being given and less isolation from the patient. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has provided novel communication challenges to physicians, promoting flexibility and adaptation to some of the core inter-personal skills we develop throughout training. Technology plays a huge role in this, and the use of video calling in particular can preserve non-verbal communication within the doctor-relative relationship and improve emotional connection between patients and their loved ones.","output":"141 Face Time for the First Time: Patients, Families and Junior Doctors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has a complex etiology which is not fully elucidated. Identification of gene perturbations and hub genes of T2D may assist in personalizing care. Objectives We aimed to identify highly perturbed genes and hub genes associated with T2D in different tissues of adult humans via an extensive workflow. Methods Workflow comprised five sequential steps: systematic review of NCBI GEO database; identification and classification of differentially expressed genes (DEG); identification of highly perturbed genes via meta-analysis; identification of hub genes via network analysis; downstream analyses. Three meta-analytic strategies: random effects model (REM); vote counting approach (VC); p-value combining approach (CA), were applied. Nodes having above average betweenness, closeness, and degree in the network were defined as hub genes. Downstream analyses included gene ontologies, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, metabolomics, COVID-19 related genes, and Genotype-Tissue Expression profiles. Results Analysis of 27 eligible microarrays identified 6284 DEG (4592 down-regulated and 1692 up-regulated) within four tissue types. Tissue-specific gene expression was significantly greater than tissue non-specific (shared) gene expression. Meta-analysis of DEG identified 49, 27, and 8 highly perturbed genes via REM, VC, and CA, respectively, producing a compiled set of 79 highly perturbed (41 down-regulated and 38 up-regulated) genes. The 28 hub genes comprised 13 up-regulated, 9 down-regulated, and 6 predicted genes. Downstream analyses identified enrichments of: shared genes with other diabetes phenotypes; insulin synthesis and action related pathways and metabolomics; mechanistic associations with apoptosis and immunity-related pathways, COVID-19 related gene sets; and cell types demonstrating over- and under-expression of marker genes of T2D. Conclusions We identified highly perturbed genes and hub genes of T2D and revealed their associations with other diabetes phenotypes and COVID-19 as well as pathophysiological manifestations such as those related to insulin, immunity, and apoptosis.

The presence of this type of psychopathology increases the risk of involvement with or worsens the use of addictive substances and alcohol as a maladaptive coping strategy.1 According to these data, people with substance use disorders are a population at high risk for COVID-19 infection and serious illness.  large controlled retrospective case study in the US found that people with substance use disorders are significantly more vulnerable to COVID-19 and its complications (primarily those with opioid use disorder OR = 10.21 and with tobacco use disorder OR = 8.25), and that the course and outcome of the disease (hospitalization, death) was worse than in non-dependent individuals. The main culprits are increased physical co-morbidity (frequent respiratory and cardiovascular problems), poor health and living conditions, marginalization and difficulties in accessing health services. 2,3 nternational epidemiological data during the first months of the pandemic regarding the use of addictive substances do not lead to safe conclusions. A cross-sectional online epidemiological study conducted on a sample of 36,538 adults from 21 European countries between April and July 2020 found an overall decrease in alcohol use, which was mainly attributed to the reduction of heavy episodic consumption, while at the same time an increase in alcohol consumption among people with severe alcohol use was recorded. he use of cannabis and nicotine showed increasing trends, as well as the use of cocaine, but to a lesser extent, while the use of MDMA (ecstasy) showed a decrease.4 In a review of 45 cross-sectional studies conducted between December 2019 and November 2020, alcohol use was on the rise overall, despite geographical variations, as was the use of other addictive substances, cannabis in particular.5 It should be noted that those who increased alcohol use during quarantine were those exhibiting higher levels of negative emotionality mechanisms.6 In Greece, an online cross-sectional survey in April 2020 in the general population during the first lockdown showed a reduction in alcohol use (43.7% of alcohol users reduced or quit), a reduction in cannabis (67.3% quit), while 33.3% increased nicotine use. These changes were attributed to the limitation of alcohol availability, social distancing, changes in daily routine and income reduction.7,8 Also, wastewater samples from Athens, analyzed by the Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry of EKPA, showed a significant increase in the use of cocaine (67%), amphetamine (350%) and methamphetamine (37%), and a decrease in the use of MDMA (- 38%) during the first lockdown, compared to the corresponding period of the previous year.9 Analysis of wastewater samples from other European cities \\"suggest that levels of use of most drugs appear generally lower during the initial lockdowns, but then appear to bounce back once lockdown was lifted. A comparison with 2019 appears to suggest similar overall consumption of most drugs, and in several cities possibly even higher levels, based on this data source. Exceptions here appear to be MDMA and methamphetamine, two drugs for which the levels observed in 2020 appear lower in most of the participating cities\\".10,11 There were also changes in the locations of use of the substances, as with the periodic restrictions the use was transferred mainly at home and in open public spaces; in some cases, it was associated with increased intravenous use and cases of intoxication. Finally, intermittent difficulties in drug availability and trafficking have led users to search for other substances, increase experimentation and multidrug use, and make online purchases. In addition, there is concern about the increasing abuse of benzodiazepines, which are either diverted from therapeutic use or appear on the illicit market, often as new benzodiazepines.10,12 According to the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), \\"the drug market has been remarkably resilient to disruption caused by the pandemic\\" Drug trafficking has adapted to the new conditions with changes in routes and methods of trafficking, and by further enhancing the digital presence of the drug market \\"Any reductions in drug consumption seen during the initial lockdowns rapidly disappeared as social distancing measures were eased. In general terms, there appears to have been less consumer interest in drugs usually associated with recreational events, such as MDMA, and greater interest in drugs linked with home use. However, the easing of restrictions during the summer was associated with a rebound in the levels of use\\". Also, \\"survey data suggest that those using drugs occasionally prior to COVID-19 may have reduced or even ceased their use during the pandemic, but more-regular users may have increased their drug consumption\\".10 Measures taken to control the pandemic have reduced and modified the mental health and addiction treatment services provided. Although services have been adequately restored, there has initially been a 60% reduction in the availability and provision of detoxification services in Europe.13 Live contact, mainly at group level, was significantly reduced or stopped altogether for a long period, as well as the frequency of individual appointments. Therapeutic programs sought to respond to the new conditions using technology and telemedicine, providing online group support and psychotherapy. Substitution treatment programs have become more flexible by providing long-term pharmaceutical substitutes (take home) to prevent users from moving. There have also been facilitations in prescribing by treating physicians. Thus, the addicts' contact with the treatment process was maintained, but it was insufficient to meet their increased needs during this period. In conclusion, it should be noted that substance use appears to have an autonomous dynamism in relation to the pandemic and the consequent psychopathology, being in a \\"loose\\" causal relationship with it. Therefore, hasty and untimely generalizations should be avoided, and easy conclusions should not be drawn through extrapolations from previous socio-economic crises of different types or through partial spatiotemporal understandings, which are usually presented by the media in the form of negative alarming information.","output":"Substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic: What is really happening?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Data on pathological changes in COVID-19 are scarce.

The Linezolid enantiomers were optimized at B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,p) level of theory. Molecular docking of the system (S)-Linezolid?RBD?ACE2 and (R)-Linezolid?RBD?ACE2 was performed, the analysis was made using LigPlot+ and NCIplot software packages, to understand the intermolecular interactions. The UV-Vis and ECD of the complexes - (R and S)-Linezolid?RBD?ACE2 were performed in two layers with DFT/6-311++G(3df,2p) and DFT/6-31G(d), respectively. The results showed that only the (S)-Linezolid had a stable interaction with ? 8.05 kcal.mol(? 1), whereas all the R-enantiomeric configurations had positive values of binding energy. The (S)-Linezolid had the same interactions as in the (S)-Linezolid ? Haluarcula morismortui Ribosomal system, where it is well-known the fact that the latter has biological activity. A specific interaction on the fluorine ring justified an attenuation on the ECD signal, in comparison to isolated species. Therefore, some biological activity of (S)-Linezolid with SARS-CoV-2 RBD was expected, indicated by the modification of its ECD signal and justified by a similar interaction in the S-Linezolid?Haluarcula marismortui Ribosomal system.

In SLE, the most frequent finding is pleural effusion, while in pSS, airway disease and parenchymal disorders prevail. In both cases, there is an increased risk of pre-capillary and post-capillary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary venous thromboembolism (VTE). The risk of VTE is in part due to an increased thrombophilic status secondary to systemic inflammation or to the well-established association with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). The lung can also be the site of an organ-specific complication due to the aberrant pathologic immune-hyperactivation as occurs in the development of lymphoma or amyloidosis in pSS. Respiratory infections are a major issue to be addressed when approaching the differential diagnosis, and their exclusion is required to safely start an immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment strategy is mainly based on glucocorticoids (GCs) and immunosuppressants, with a variable response according to the primary pathologic process.

There are currently many approaches for its management, using both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The National Institute of Health - Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score is a validated measure commonly used to measure CP/CPPS symptoms. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of non-pharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). SEARCH METHODS We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases, trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with a diagnosis of CP/CPPS. We included all available non-pharmacological interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies, performed statistical analyses and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to the GRADE methods. MAIN RESULTS We included 38 unique studies with 3290 men with CP/CPPS across 23 comparisons.1. Acupuncture: (three studies, 204 participants) based on short-term follow-up, acupuncture reduces prostatitis symptoms in an appreciable number of participants compared with sham procedure (mean difference (MD) in total NIH-CPSI score -5.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.32 to -4.26, high QoE). Acupuncture likely results in little to no difference in adverse events (moderate QoE). It probably also decreases prostatitis symptoms compared with standard medical therapy in an appreciable number of participants (MD -6.05, 95% CI -7.87 to -4.24, two studies, 78 participants, moderate QoE).2. Circumcision: (one study, 713 participants) based on short-term follow-up, early circumcision probably decreases prostatitis symptoms slightly (NIH-CPSI score MD -3.00, 95% CI -3.82 to -2.18, moderate QoE) and may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events compared with control (a waiting list to be circumcised, low QoE).3. Electromagnetic chair: (two studies, 57 participants) based on short-term follow-up, we are uncertain of the effects of the use of an electromagnetic chair on prostatitis symptoms. It may be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events compared with sham procedure (low to very low QoE).4. Lifestyle modifications: (one study, 100 participants) based on short-term follow-up, lifestyle modifications may be associated with a greater improvement in prostatitis symptoms in an appreciable number of participants compared with control (risk ratio (RR) for improvement in NIH-CPSI scores 3.90, 95% CI 2.20 to 6.92, very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events.5. Physical activity: (one study, 85 participants) based on short-term follow-up, a physical activity programme may cause a small reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH-CPSI score MD -2.50, 95% CI -4.69 to -0.31, low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events.6. Prostatic massage: (two studies, 115 participants) based on short-term follow-up, we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases prostatitis symptoms compared with control (very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events.7. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy: (three studies, 157 participants) based on short-term follow-up, extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH-CPSI score MD -6.18, 95% CI -7.46 to -4.89, high QoE). These results may not be sustained at medium-term follow-up (low QoE). This treatment may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events (low QoE).8. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy: (two studies, 237 participants) based on short-term follow-up, transrectal thermotherapy alone or in combination with medical therapy may decrease prostatitis symptoms slightly when compared with medical therapy alone (NIH-CPSI score MD -2.50, 95% CI -3.82 to -1.18, low QoE). One included study reported that participants may experience transient adverse events.9. Other interventions: there is uncertainty about the effects of other interventions included in this review. We found no information regarding psychological support or prostatic surgery. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Some of the interventions can decrease prostatitis symptoms in an appreciable number without a greater incidence of adverse events. The QoE was mostly low. Future clinical trials should include a full report of their methods including adequate masking, consistent assessment of all patient-important outcomes including potential treatment-related adverse events and appropriate sample sizes.","output":"Non-pharmacological interventions for treating chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To better understand the effects of COVID-19 on air quality in Taiyuan, hourly in situ measurements of PM(2.5)(particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mm) and chemical components (water-soluble ions, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and trace elements) were conducted before (P1: 1 JanuaryC23 January 2020) and during (P2: 24 JanuaryC15 February 2020) the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.

Participants had inadequate knowledge about COVID-19 risk during pregnancy, including potential vertical transmission (58.5%), preferred route of delivery (52%), safety of breastfeeding (50%), birth defects (44.7%), rooming in and skin-to-skin contact (58.5%). The majority (85.1%) had a high concern score, and negative attitude (62.8%). Only 43.6% said that they would not hide their symptoms, while 37.2% stated that they will deliver at hospital if they tested positive. Only 30.9% of respondents had good practices. During visits, 39.4% maintained social distancing and sanitized hands while only 37.2% said that they did not bring more than one person with them. CONCLUSIONS: The study population had inadequate knowledge, negative attitude, and poor practices regarding pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than half of the respondents thought that concealing symptoms and delivering at home would be better. Awareness programs are urgently needed.","output":"Pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic: Knowledge, concerns, attitudes and practices of Pakistani women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tensor completion aims at imputing missing entries from a partially observed tensor. Existing tensor completion methods often assume either multi-linear or nonlinear relationships between latent components. However, real-world tensors have much more complex patterns where both multi-linear and nonlinear relationships may coexist. In such cases, the existing methods are insufficient to describe the data structure. This paper proposes a Joint mUlti-linear and nonLinear IdentificAtion (JULIA) framework for large-scale tensor completion. JULIA unifies the multi-linear and nonlinear tensor completion models with several advantages over the existing methods: 1) Flexible model selection, i.e., it fits a tensor by assigning its values as a combination of multi-linear and nonlinear components; 2) Compatible with existing nonlinear tensor completion methods; 3) Efficient training based on a well-designed alternating optimization approach. Experiments on six real large-scale tensors demonstrate that JULIA outperforms many existing tensor completion algorithms. Furthermore, JULIA can improve the performance of a class of nonlinear tensor completion methods. The results show that in some large-scale tensor completion scenarios, baseline methods with JULIA are able to obtain up to 55% lower root mean-squared-error and save 67% computational complexity.","output":"JULIA: Joint Multi-linear and Nonlinear Identification for Tensor Completion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maskne is a new term coined during the 2020 COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

The aim of this study was to compare first-year surgical complication rates in implant-based immediate breast reconstruction with a biological mesh with that of a synthetic mesh, in the same patient. METHODS This study is a clinical, randomized, prospective trial. Patients operated on with bilateral mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction were randomized to biological mesh on one side and synthetic mesh on the other side. RESULTS A total of 48 breasts were randomized. As the synthetically and the biologically reconstructed breasts that were compared belonged to the same woman, systemic factors were exactly the same in the two groups. The most common complication was seroma formation with a frequency of 38% in the biological group and 3.8% in the synthetical group (p = .011). A higher frequency of total implant loss could be seen in the biologic mesh group (8.5% vs. 2%), albeit not statistically significant (p = .083).

In response, pooled testing has emerged as a promising strategy that can immediately increase testing capacity. In pooled sample testing, multiple samples are combined (or pooled) together and tested as a single unit. If the pool is positive, the individual samples can then be individually tested to identify the positive case(s). Here, we provide support for the adoption of sample pooling with the point-of-care Cepheid Xpert? Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. Corroborating previous findings, the limit of detection of this assay was comparable to laboratory-developed reverse-transcription quantitative PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, with observed detection below 100 copies/mL. The Xpert? Xpress assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after samples with minimum viral loads of 461 copies/mL were pooled in groups of six. Based on these data, we recommend the adoption of pooled testing with the Xpert? Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay where warranted based on public health needs. The suggested number of samples per pool, or the pooling depth, is unique for each point-of-care testing site and can be determined by the positive test rates. To statistically determine appropriate pooling depth, we have calculated the pooling efficiency for numerous combinations of pool sizes and test rates. This information is included as a supplemental dataset that we encourage public health authorities to use as a guide to make recommendations that will maximize testing capacity and resource conservation.","output":"Recommendations for sample pooling on the Cepheid GeneXpert? system using the Cepheid Xpert?

Despite large and increased research efforts within this field (Sorensen and Jovanovi? 2021), clear guidelines on safe concentrations, thresholds and ultimately adverse effects for environmental health are lacking (Toussaint B et al 2019.). This can be largely attributed to the fact that micro- and nanoplastics are, unlike other groups of contaminants, an extremely heterogeneous group. They vary in shape, size and chemical composition and each of these parameters may influence the behaviour, fate, transport and effects. In the past, most studies have focussed on homogenous pristine micro- or nanoplastics in a defined shape and size class (Paul-Pont et al. 2018). While these studies certainly have value in unravelling modes of action and mechanisms of toxicity, the gap between laboratory and natural exposure is large and these studies remain far from environmental reality. Micro- and nanoplastics can actually be seen as a mixture of different types of particles that can further interact with the environment. These interactions include environmental weathering, absorption/desorption of chemicals and additives (Lusher et al. 2017; Koelmans et al. 2016) and biofilm formation which may lead to pathogen transfer (Huang et al. 2021). At present, more and more studies are addressing these issues and the current knowledge gaps are primarily related to small micro- and nanoplastics and their fate, transport and ultimately environmental risk. This is can be partly attributed to analytical challenges in terms of extraction, quantification and characterization in complex environmental matrices where only recently significant progress was made (Silva et al 2018). This special issues integrates publications that will contribute scientific knowledge to (1) improved analytical methodologies for complex environmental matrices, (2) effect assessments of micro- and nanoplastics accounting for physico-chemical properties as well as environmental interactions and (3) integrated perspectives and analyses on risk assessment.

Here we investigated the potential of using pooling of samples followed by one-step retrotranscription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity. METHODS: We first evaluated different sample pooling (1:5, 1:10 and 1:15) prior to RNA extractions followed by standard RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 diagnosis. The pool size achieving reproducible results in independent tests was then used for assessing nasopharyngeal samples in a tertiary hospital during August 2020. RESULTS: We found that pool size of five samples achieved the highest sensitivity compared to pool sizes of 10 and 15, showing a mean ( SD) Ct shift of 3.5  2.2 between the pooled test and positive samples in the pool. We then used a pool size of five to test a total of 895 pools (4,475 prospective samples) using two different RT-qPCR kits available at that time. The Real Accurate Quadruplex corona-plus PCR Kit (PathoFinder) reported the lowest mean Ct ( SD) shift (2.2  2.4) among the pool and the individual samples. The strategy allows detecting individual samples in the positive pools with Cts in the range of 16.7-39.4.

The coprimary endpoint was a set of ventilator parameters, including tidal volume normalized for predicted bodyweight, positive end-expiratory pressure, driving pressure, and respiratory system compliance in the first 4 days of invasive ventilation. Secondary endpoints were other ventilation parameters, the use of rescue therapies, pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications in the first 28 days in the ICU, hospital- and ICU stay, and mortality. Results: 1122 patients were divided into four groups based on age quartiles. No meaningful differences were found in ventilation parameters and in the use of rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia in the first 4 days of invasive ventilation. Older patients received more often a tracheostomy, developed more frequently acute kidney injury and myocardial infarction, stayed longer in hospital and ICU, and had a higher mortality.

Clinicians claim that the surge demonstrates a deregulated immune defence in host, as infected cell expression analysis depicts a delay in type-I (interferon-I) and type-III IFNs expression, along with a limited Interferon-Stimulated Gene (ISG) response, which later resume and culminates in elicitation of several cytokines including- IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF&#945;, IL-17, MCP-1, IP-10 and IL-10 etc. Although cytokines are messenger molecules of the immune system, but their increased concentration results in inflammation, infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and lung injury in patients. This inflammatory response results in the precarious pathogenesis of COVID-19; thus, a complete estimation of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is vital in designing a harmless and effective vaccine. In pathogenesis analysis, it emerges that a timely forceful type-I IFN production (18-24hrs post infection) promotes innate and acquired immune responses, while a delay in IFNs production (3-4 days post infection) actually renders both innate and acquired responses ineffective in fighting infection. Further, underlying conditions including hypertension, obesity, cardio-vascular disease etc may increase the chances of putting people in risk groups, which end up having critical form of infection. This review summarizes the events starting from viral entry, its struggle with the immune system and failure of host immunological parameters to obliterate the infections, which finally culminate into massive release of CRS and inflammation in gravely ill patients.","output":"The deregulated immune reaction and cytokines release storm (CRS) in COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the case of a 39-year-old man with epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting.

STUDY DESIGNS: A total of 554 women respondents age 18 to 49 and reside in the United States were recruited using social media between May 16, 2020 and June 16, 2020. Logistic regression models assessed predictors of reporting pandemic-related changes in economic conditions, desire for pregnancy, and contraceptive access. RESULTS: Compared to White/Caucasian respondents, Hispanics/Latinx and Black/African Americans have 4 times the odds of experiencing inability to afford food, transportation, and/or housing (p < 0.01) during the pandemic; Hispanics/Latinx have twice the odds of experiencing food insecurity (p < 0.05). Inability to afford food, transportation, and/or housing was associated with drop in desire to be pregnant (p < 0.01). Despite the 25% of participants who reported a drop in desire for pregnancy, 1 in 6 reported difficulty accessing contraceptives, particularly those who experienced reduced income (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In our sample, the pandemic unevenly affected people from different socioeconomic groups. Many simultaneously experienced reduced income, difficulties in accessing contraception, and a greater desire to avoid a pregnancy. This combination of factors increases the chance that people will experience unintended pregnancies. IMPLICATIONS: The pandemic caused economic hardship and an increased desire to postpone or prevent pregnancy at the same time that it created new barriers to contraceptive services.

We hypothesized that peoples' endorsement of this belief-their relative perception of a connection and moral commitment to other humans-would predict their tendencies to adopt World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and to help others. To assess this, we conducted a global online study (N = 2537 participants) of four WHO-recommended health behaviors and four pandemic-related moral dilemmas that we constructed to be relevant to helping others at a potential cost to oneself. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) that included 10 predictor variables (demographic, contextual, and psychological) for each of five outcome measures (a WHO cooperative health behavior score, plus responses to each of our four moral, helping dilemmas). Identification with all humanity was the most consistent and consequential predictor of individuals' cooperative health behavior and helpful responding.

Reverse-genetics studies of viral genes and mutations have proven highly valuable in advancing basic virus research, leading to the development of therapeutics. We developed a functional and highly versatile full-length SARS-CoV-2 infectious system by cloning the sequence of a COVID-19 associated virus isolate (DK-AHH1) into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Viruses recovered after RNA-transfection of in vitro transcripts into Vero E6 cells showed growth kinetics and remdesivir susceptibility similar to the DK-AHH1 virus isolate. Insertion of reporter genes, green fluorescent protein, and nanoluciferase into the ORF7 genomic region led to high levels of reporter activity, which facilitated high throughput treatment experiments. We found that putative coronavirus remdesivir resistance-associated substitutions F480L and V570Land naturally found polymorphisms A97V, P323L, and N491S, all in nsp12did not decrease SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to remdesivir. A nanoluciferase reporter clone with deletion of spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins exhibited high levels of transient replication, was inhibited by remdesivir, and therefore could function as an efficient non-infectious subgenomic replicon system.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the S-protein is an essential determinant of virulence and pathogenicity. Therefore we studied the S-gene as an indicator molecule for selection processes employing two different MHV-JHM variants. First, Lewis-rats were infected with MHV-JHM-Pi, a variant that causes demyelinating disease after several weeks p.i. It was not possible to isolate infectious MHV-JHM-Pi from such rats, although viral proteins were expressed. The S-gene was rescued directly from brain tissue employing RT-PCR technology. The amplicons were sequenced in bulk or at the level of single clones. We detected no evidence for an increase of S-gene mutants during the length of time. Only few mutations were found at the clonal level. The changes were distributed throughout the analysed S-gene fragments without a predilection in their location. The frequency of mutation remained low within a range of 0.03 to 0.5 mutations per thousand nucleotides. As a second approach, we sequenced the S-genes of viruses isolated from brain tissue infected with MHV-JHM-ts43. Infection of adult Lewis rats with that mutant resulted several weeks to months p.i. in demyelinating encephalomyelitis. The S-gene of this virus contains an insertion of 423 bp in the S1 region, which is identical to a polymorphic region described for MHV-4. In contrast to JHM-Pi, infectious MHV-JHM-ts43 was readily to isolate from brain tissue. The S-gene sequences of virus isolated 45-106 days p.i. from diseased rats were identical with that of the input virus.

Participants were selected at random to provide blood for Elecsys immunoassay for detection of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibodies. A Bayesian regression model was used to estimate seroprevalence after adjusting for the demographic characteristics of each district. RESULTS: In total, 3005 participants from 623 households were enrolled in this study. In Phase 2, adjusted seroprevalence was estimated as 8.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-13.1] and 15.1% (95% CI 9.4-21.7) in low- and high-transmission areas, respectively, compared with 0.2% (95% CI 0-0.7) and 0.4% (95% CI 0-1.3) in Phase 1. In Phase 3, it was 12.8% (95% CI 8.3-17.7) and 21.5% (95% CI 15.6-28) in low- and high-transmission areas, respectively.

The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 24, 2020 were investigated and prediction was made until April 15, 2020. METHODS By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and timedependent death rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. RESULTS Based on our predictions of Iran about 29000 people will be infected from March 25 to April 15, 2020. On average, 1292 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within 3 days (March 25 to March 27, 2020) and reaches its highest point on March 25, 2020 with 1715 infected cases.

Two aerosol generation principles were evaluated: bubble bursting, a common natural aerosolization mechanism, and nebulization, a common aerosolization technique in laboratory studies. The aerosolization setup was characterized by physical and viral dilution factors, generated aerosol particle size distributions, and the viral infectivity after aerosolization. We found a lower physical dilution factor when using the nebulization generator than with the bubble bursting generator. The viral dilution factor of the system was higher than the physical dilution; however, when comparing the physical and viral dilution factors, bubble bursting generation was more efficient. The infectivity per virus was similar using either generation principle, suggesting that the generation itself had a minor impact on MNV infectivity and that instead, the effect of drying in air could be a major reason for infectivity losses.","output":"Aerosolization and recovery of viable murine norovirus in an experimental setup"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This study was undertaken with an aim to assess the feasibility of substitution of real-life clinical follow up with a review of smartphone captured digital photographs of post-surgical wounds by a clinician to assess wound healing.

Herein, we described the dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in Brazil from May to September 2020, to better understand viral changes that may affect the ongoing pandemic. Our data demonstrate that some of the mutations identified are currently observed in variants of interest and variants of concern, and emphasize the importance of studying previous periods in order to comprehend the emergence of new variants. From 720 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, we found few sites under positive selection pressure, such as the D614G (98.5 %) in the spike, that has replaced the old variant; the V1167F in the spike (41 %), identified in the P.2 variant that emerged from Brazil during the period of analysis; and I292T (39 %) in the N protein. There were a few alterations in the UTRs, which was expected, however, our data suggest that the emergence of new variants was not influenced by mutations in UTR regions, since it maintained its conformational structure in most analysed sequences.

Given the lack of specific antiviral therapies, application of human convalescent plasma retaining neutralizing activity could be a viable therapeutic option that can bridge this gap. METHODS: We traced antibody responses and memory B cells in peripheral blood collected from 70 recovered MERS-CoV patients for three years after the 2015 outbreak in South Korea. We also used a mouse infection model to examine whether the neutralizing activity of collected sera could provide therapeutic benefit in vivo upon lethal MERS-CoV challenge. RESULTS: Anti-spike-specific IgG responses, including neutralizing activity and antibody-secreting memory B cells, persisted for up to 3 years, especially in MERS patients that suffered from severe pneumonia. Mean antibody titers gradually decreased annually by less than two fold. Levels of antibody responses were significantly correlated with fever duration, viral shedding periods, and maximum viral loads observed during infection periods. In a transgenic mice model challenged with lethal doses of MERS-CoV, a significant reduction in viral loads and enhanced survival was observed when therapeutically treated with human plasma retaining high neutralizing titer (> 1/5,000). However, this failed to reduce pulmonary pathogenesis, as revealed by pathological changes in lungs and initial weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: High titers of neutralizing activity are required for suppressive effect on the viral replication but may not be sufficient to reduce inflammatory lesions upon fatal infection.

We aimed to explore whether ARDS phenotypes can be identified using clinical data, are reproducible and are associated with clinical outcomes and treatment response. METHODS: This study is based on a retrospective analysis of data from the telehealth intensive care unit (eICU) collaborative research database and three ARDS randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (ALVEOLI, FACTT and SAILS trials). We derived phenotypes in the eICU by cluster analysis based on clinical data and compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of each phenotype. The reproducibility of the derived phenotypes was tested using the data from three RCTs, and treatment effects were evaluated. RESULTS: Three clinical phenotypes were identified in the training cohort of 3875 ARDS patients. Of the three phenotypes identified, phenotype I (n = 1565; 40%) was associated with fewer laboratory abnormalities, less organ dysfunction and the lowest in-hospital mortality rate (8%). Phenotype II (n = 1232; 32%) was correlated with more inflammation and shock and had a higher mortality rate (18%). Phenotype III (n = 1078; 28%) was strongly correlated with renal dysfunction and acidosis and had the highest mortality rate (22%). These results were validated using the data from the validation cohort (n = 3670) and three RCTs (n = 2289) and had reproducibility. Patients with these ARDS phenotypes had different treatment responses to randomized interventions. Specifically, in the ALVEOLI cohort, the effects of ventilation strategy (high PEEP vs low PEEP) on ventilator-free days differed by phenotype (p = 0.001); in the FACTT cohort, there was a significant interaction between phenotype and fluid-management strategy for 60-day mortality (p = 0.01). The fluid-conservative strategy was associated with improved mortality in phenotype II but had the opposite effect in phenotype III. CONCLUSION: Three clinical phenotypes of ARDS were identified and had different clinical characteristics and outcomes. The analysis shows evidence of a phenotype-specific treatment benefit in the ALVEOLI and FACTT trials. These findings may improve the identification of distinct subsets of ARDS patients for exploration in future RCTs.

SESRE can operate well on a Ni-based catalyst with dolomite as a sorbent in packed-bed reactors. In this study, the circulating fluidized bed (CFB) concept was proposed to obtain higher productivity and continuous operation of SESRE. Particular focus was directed to the design and selection of suitable operating conditions of the CFB riser. Two-dimensional transient models using the Euler-Euler approach and the kinetic theory of granular flows were applied to investigate the H2 production performance from a pilot-scale riser. The 2 k full factorial design method was utilized to examine the significances of five specific parameters, namely, the riser diameter, inlet temperature, catalyst-to-sorbent ratio, solid flux, and inlet gas velocity on two response variables, namely, H2 purity and H2 flux. From the ANOVA results, either the main effect or the interactions of each parameter were shown to be significant on both the H2 purity and the H2 flux, particularly the riser diameter and the solid flux. For optimizing the operation and reaction parameters, the best case was the system with riser diameter of 0.2 m, inlet temperature of 600 C, catalyst-to-sorbent ratio of 2.54 kg kg-1, solid flux of 200 kg m-2 s-1, and gas velocity of 3 m s-1, obtaining H2 purity of 91.30% on a dry basis with a significantly high H2 flux of 0.147 kg m-2 s-1. The hydrodynamics showed that SESRE reached breakthrough within the bottom dense zone.

This study deals with the analysis of uncertainties in the data on material properties and model parameters, and their influence on the results delivered by advanced computational models of lyophilisation. As a means of uncertainty analysis, the Stochastic Collocation Method is applied, allowing the use of existing reliable deterministic models as black boxes in the stochastic computations. As a deterministic model, the lyophilisation model is used, based on the axisymmetric approximation of a vial, and the Boundary Element Method as a solver. Five parameters, covering material properties, process conditions and model constants, are selected for the sensitivity analysis simulation of the lyophilisation of an aqueous mannitol solution. The results show that during the initial stage of the primary drying heat transfer from the shelf is crucial, and that the uncertainties in the contact surface area and material properties of the vial play a more important role than the thermal properties of the drying material. When the temperature of the material reaches its distinct primary drying stage level the mass transfer through the porous cake becomes the most important, with great sensitivity to the Knudsen diffusivity in the porous cake. We observed uncertainties in the results for the primary drying time in the order of 6%, and uncertainties in the results for temperatures of 0.6C in the frozen material and 3C in the porous cake. The uncertainty analysis proved to be a great help in determining the critical parameters in the heat and mass transfer during the important primary drying step, which led to a better definition of the numerical model for use in the context of design space determination.","output":"Experimental and stochastic analysis of lyophilisation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How do governments take strategic actions in weaving public health and safety nets to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic?

This study aimed to investigate psychological distress among parents of children with ASD during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 1764 parents of children with ASD and 4962 parents of typically developing (TD) children were recruited. The participants completed an online survey which contained demographic information, the impact due to COVID-19 crisis, resilience, coping styles, anxiety and depression. Hierarchical linear regression was used to assess the contributions of these variables to anxiety and depression. RESULTS: After adjusting for demographic variables, the following factors were associated with parents' anxiety and depression symptoms: (i) Whether or not the participants had a child with ASD; (ii) resilience; (iii) coping strategies, and; (iv) the impact due to COVID-19. Among these, the psychological stress caused by COVID-19 played the most important role in parental anxiety (? = 0.353) and depression (? = 0.242) symptoms. Parents of children with ASD had lower levels of resilience and positive coping, and used more negative coping strategies than parents of TD children. Among all participants, 8.0 and 24.2% of parents had symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Compared to parents of TD children, more parents of children with ASD exhibited symptoms of anxiety and depression (12.2% vs. 6.6%; 31.0% vs. 21.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents experienced varying levels of anxiety and depression, particularly, parents of children with ASD.

Method The audit included routine referrals to the CMHT Inverness Sector A, NHS Highland from GP practices: Kingsmills, Burnfield, Riverside, Fairfield, Foyers and Drumnadrochit Medical Practices. The number of referrals and the number and proportion of clients given appointments for assessments were calculated. Referrals were received directly from primary care and the Mental Health Liaison Team or following Out of Hours contacts at the Mental Health Assessment Team. Data were collected retrospectively: referrals from 1 Jan 2020C31 Aug 2020. Sample size came to 160 patients aged 16C65 years. Data were collected via review of recorded documentation on the NHSH electronic patient record systems (SCIstore), from 5thC25th January 2021. Result 160 patients (male 82, female 78) were referred from 1 Jan to 1 Sept 2020. Of these, 140 (87.5%) were given an appointment for an assessment. The mean waiting time was 12 weeks for 103 patients (64%), with 57 patients (36%) waiting longer than 13 weeks. The bimodal distribution of waiting times prompted an analysis of those with longer waiting times. In some instances, appointments were delayed because patients either did not attend (DNA) or cancelled their appointments. Reasons for delays included: postponement until further information was available;cancellation of meetings or patients DNA. In 20 cases (12.5%), the referrals deemed inadequate, prompting further liaison with the referrer for clarification about the nature of the problem and previous psychological interventions. Conclusion The number of transactions (any amendment to a patient record) was higher than the number of patients affected, as several transactions can relate to one patients record. Most referrals are vetted in advance via the daily Inverness triage huddle. Ways of improving the quality of information provided by referrers would be explored. On receipt of each referral, the date of the 12 week deadline would be calculated and highlighted in a database.

However, these benefits are partly reliant on the accurate entry of patients' medical record numbers by healthcare staff. This study assessed the accuracy of such data entry, comparing the periods before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This retrospective observational study analysed glucose meter medical record number entries at a large hospital in Victoria, Australia. The study period spanned from September 2019, when the networked blood glucose monitoring system was introduced, to July 2020. The proportion of inaccurate entries were presented as a percentage of the total number of entries and comparisons were made between the pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 onset periods. Data were analysed using an interrupted time series methodology and presented using a Quasipoisson distribution. Results A gradual decrease in the percentage of accurate medical record number entries was observed following the introduction of the networked blood glucose monitoring system. This decline in accuracy decreased further following the onset of COVID-19, despite the hospital serving a relatively low number of patients with the virus. Conclusions The ongoing decrease in accuracy of data entry into the networked blood glucose monitoring system is thought to be a result of insufficient training and time constraints, which were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic because of protocol changes and furloughed staff. It is recommended that accurate use of the networked blood glucose monitoring system is allocated more regular training in hospital wards.","output":"The storm that was delayed: the deterioration of an in-hospital diabetes process-of-care metric during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three feline coronavirus (FCoV) isolates KUK-H, M91-266, and M91-267 were examined to elucidate their biological and antigenic properties as well as disease potential in cats.

The isolates efficiently grew in fcwf-4 cell culture showing lytic CPE enough to form distinct plaques: when measured 48 hr after infection, plaque sizes of both M91-266 and M91-267 were approximately 1 mm in diameter, and a mixture of small (less than 1 mm in diameter) and large (approximately 3 mm in diameter) plaques were produced in the case of KUK-H. Strains KUK-H, M91-266 and M91-267 produced feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in 50%, 67% and 89% of experimentally inoculated kittens, respectively. Furthermore, 80% of the kittens inoculated with the small plaque former of KUK-H developed FIP accompanied by more prominent clinical signs as well as pathological changes when compared with 28.6% of kittens inoculated with the large plaque former. These results suggest that serotype II FIPVs producing smaller size of plaques are more virulent than those producing larger size of plaques.","output":"Antigenic and plaque variations of serotype II feline infectious peritonitis coronaviruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores the conditions under which financialization may foster sustainable total factor productivity (TFP) We examine the inverted U-shaped relationship between corporate financialization and TFP by employing a panel threshold model using microeconomic non-financial panel data from Chinese firms in the 2007 to 2018 period Our results suggest that the turning point is more significant in holding short-term financial assets and state-owned enterprises The threshold effect suggests that technical innovation determines the optimal threshold at which TFP is affected by financialization Further, financialization is considered an alternative to cash in order to increase the value of capital, leading to a positive effect on TFP Contrary to their positive effects below the optimal thresholds, financialization exceeds a certain level, displaces technical innovation, and becomes detrimental to TFP Our analysis thus establishes the importance of sustainable growth of TFP and minimize the adverse effect of financialization","output":"Does Corporate Financialization Have a Non-Linear Impact on Sustainable Total Factor Productivity?

Recently, it has been reported that topoisomerases play a key role in DNA repair, suggesting an additional regulatory mechanism of the chromosome structure on DNA metabolism and cell cycle checkpoints. Despite the progress made toward the understanding of the genome organization and expression, few changes have been reported in the chromosome scaffold of malignant cells associated with the cancer phenotype. In a previous work, we reported LFM-1 protein (Licensing Factor Model-1) as a chromosomal-scaffold component transiently associated with mitotic chromosomes in MDCK (Madin Darby canine kidney) epithelial cells (Vega-Salas and Salas 1996). In this work, we explore LFM-1 expression in human epithelia with contrasting tumorigenicity during the progression of the cell cycle. Although cell metabolic labeling shows synthesis of a common 87-kDa LFM-1 precursor during G(2)-phase in both non-tumorigenic and cancer cells, surprisingly, the post-translational LFM-1 chromosome-bound polypeptide displays a different apparent molecular weight and binding to chromosomes in the cancer phenotype. The finding of a highly phosphorylated LFM-1 60-kDa form with abnormal binding to chromosomes in human carcinoma cells suggests a structural/regulatory role(s) of the chromosome-scaffold/matrix in DNA metabolism in cancer-related events of cell proliferation.","output":"Characterization and changes of a chromosomal-scaffolding protein in human epithelia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)3 is a valid anticancer therapeutic target.

The resulting severe, pandemic-related circumstances have disrupted physical and face-to-face contact teaching practices, thereby requiring many students to actively use mobile technologies for learning. Mobile learning technologies offer viable web-based teaching and learning platforms that are accessible to teachers and learners worldwide. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the use of mobile learning platforms for instruction purposes in United Arab Emirates higher education institutions. METHODS: An extended technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior model were proposed to analyze university students' adoption of mobile learning platforms for accessing course materials, searching the web for information related to their disciplines, sharing knowledge, and submitting assignments during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected a total of 1880 questionnaires from different universities in the United Arab Emirates. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling and machine learning algorithms were used to assess the research model, which was based on the data gathered from a student survey. RESULTS: Based on our results, each hypothesized relationship within the research model was supported by our data analysis results. It should also be noted that the J48 classifier (89.37% accuracy) typically performed better than the other classifiers when it came to the prediction of the dependent variable. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that teaching and learning could considerably benefit from adopting remote learning systems as educational tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the value of such systems could be lessened because of the emotions that students experience, including a fear of poor grades, stress resulting from family circumstances, and sadness resulting from a loss of friends. Accordingly, these issues can only be resolved by evaluating the emotions of students during the pandemic.","output":"Using Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict People's Intention to Use Mobile Learning Platforms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Machine Learning Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Despite an overall reduction in the number of stroke cases presenting to hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, a remarkably high incidence of acute cerebrovascular disease associated with the infection has been reported In this systematic review, we assess the neurological outcomes and complications of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for large vessel occlusions (LVO) in COVID-19 patients Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed from December 1, 2019 through September 1st, 2020 using different combinations of suitable keywords Ten studies reporting EVT outcomes and complications were identified Two studies that included non-LVO pathologies and COVID-19 negative patients with the outcomes analysis were excluded Patient demographics, comorbidities, anatomic thrombus location, neurological and angiographic outcomes were assessed Results: A total of 8 studies, in addition to our institutional case series, were ultimately included in this review The mean age was 62 2 years, of which 67 6% were males M1 segment involvement was the most commonly reported (53 8%) thrombus location The mean NIHSS at presentation was 20 4 with no significant change at 24 h Successful revascularization (TICI &gt;= 2b) was achieved in 89% Early proximal cerebral re-occlusion was reported in 6 patients (11%) and cerebral hemorrhage in 3 patients (4%) In hospital mortality was reported in 15 patients (28 8%) Conclusion: Despite angiographically successful EVT of LVOs in the majority of patients, this literature analysis demonstrates overall poor outcomes and high mortality in COVID-19 patients post EVT An unusual incidence of early intracerebral proximal arterial re-occlusion was notable","output":"Endovascular Thrombectomy of COVID-19-Related Large Vessel Occlusion: A Systematic Review and Summary of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a validated assessment, the Microbiology for Health Sciences Concept Inventory (MHSCI) is a valuable tool to evaluate student progress in health sciences microbiology courses.

RESEARCH QUESTION: What street reallocation interventions were implemented, and what were the socio-spatial equity patterns? METHODS: We collected data on street reallocations (interventions that expand street space for active transportation or physical distancing) from April 1 to August 15, 2020 from websites and media. For each city, we summarized length of street reallocations (km) and described implementation strategies and communications. We assessed socio-spatial patterning of interventions by comparing differences in where interventions were implemented by area-level mobility, accessibility, and socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Two themes motivated street reallocations: supporting mobility, recreation, and physical distancing in populous areas, and bolstering COVID-19 recovery for businesses. The scale of responses ranged across cities, from Halifax adding an additional 20% distance to their bicycle network to Kelowna closing only one main street section. Interventions were located in downtown cores, areas with high population density, higher use of active transportation, and close proximity to essential destinations. With respect to socio-demographics, interventions tended to be implemented in areas with fewer children and areas with fewer visible minority populations. In Victoria, the interventions were in areas with lower income populations and higher proportions of Indigenous people. CONCLUSION: In this early response phase, some cities acted swiftly even in the context of massive uncertainties. As cities move toward recovery and resilience, they should leverage early learnings as they act to create more permanent solutions that support safe and equitable mobility.","output":"COVID-19 street reallocation in mid-sized Canadian cities: socio-spatial equity patterns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are special locational value and natural resources in coastal wetlands.

This study aimed to examine the effect of perceived stress and social isolation on self-reported continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use and treatment adherence among sleep medicine clinic patients during the pandemic. METHODS: Between June-November 2020, 81 sleep medicine clinic patients (54.815.9y, 44% male, 69% Caucasian) completed an online survey that included self-reported changes in CPAP use and using CPAP as advised; and PROMIS Social Isolation and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). CPAP measures were categorized based on reported changes during the pandemic. Stepwise logistic regression was performed using SAS to determine if Social Isolation and PSS predicted change in CPAP measures. RESULTS: Among participants, 53% reported using CPAP. Out of those, 61% reported change, 16% reported no change, and 23% reported they do not know if there is a change in using CPAP as advised during the pandemic. Social Isolation predicted an increase in odds of CPAP use by a factor of 1.15 (p=0.024). PSS predicted a decrease in odds of using CPAP therapy as advised by a factor of 0.86 (p=0.049). CONCLUSION: Increases in perceived stress predicted lower odds of utilizing CPAP as advised. Increases in self-reported social isolation predicted greater odds of CPAP use in sleep medicine clinic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We now report the occurrence of cell-mediated immune reactions against basic myelin proteins in the course of coronavirus infections in Lewis rats. Infection of rats with the murine coronavirus JHM leads to demyelinating encephalomyelitis developing several weeks to months post-infection(3C7). Lymphocytes from these diseased Lewis rats can be restimulated with basic myelin protein (BMP) and adoptive transfer of these cells leads to lesions resembling those of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in recipients, which can be accompanied by a mild clinical disease.

Using Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regressions, the paper takes initial steps to analyze the determinants of policy makers responsiveness and activity in emerging markets and developing economies, respectively. The results indicate that policy makers in richer and more populous countries have been significantly more responsive and have taken more policy measures. Belonging to a monetary union is also significantly associated with a faster and more frequent intervention. Countries with higher private debt levels tend to respond earlier with banking sector and liquidity and funding measures. The spread of COVID-19, macro-financial fundamentals, pressure on foreign exchange markets, political settings, and fiscal and containment policies appear to play a limited role in determining policy response. In a substantially smaller sample, the paper explores the role of banking sector characteristics and finds that emerging markets and developing economies with higher private bank credit to GDP and that have adopted Basel III reforms have taken fewer policy measures.","output":"Financial Sector Policy Response to COVID-19 in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bloody diarrhea is a common condition in dogs, but studies evaluating the enteropathogens involved specifically in adult dogs are scarce.

OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impact of Tubaramure, a FA-MCHN program in Burundi, on child (0 to 24 months) wasting and the differential impacts by socio-economic characteristics and age. The program targeted women and their children during the first 1000 days and included 1) food rations, 2) strengthening and promotion of use of health services, and 3) behavior change communication (BCC). METHODS: We conducted a 4-arm, cluster-randomized, controlled trial (2010C2012). Clusters were defined as collines (communities). Impact was estimated using repeated cross-sectional data (n = 2620 children in each round). Treatment arms received household and individual (mother or child in the first 1000 days) food rations (corn-soy blend and micronutrient-fortified vegetable oil) from pregnancy to 24 months (T24 arm), from pregnancy to 18 months (T18), or from birth to 24 months (TNFP). All beneficiaries received the same BCC for the first 1000 days. The control arm received no rations or BCC. RESULTS: Wasting (weight-for-length Z-score <2 SD) increased from baseline to follow-up in the control group (from 6.5% to 8%), but Tubaramure had a significant (P < 0.05) protective effect on wasting [treatment arms combined, ?3.3 percentage points (pp); T18, ?4.5 pp] and on the weight-for-length z-score (treatment arms combined, +0.15; T24, +0.20; T18, +0.17).

Mitigation policies and local epidemiological conditions explain some of the variation in unemployment patterns. However, the historically unprecedented increase in new UI claims during the weeks of March 15-21 and March 22-28 was largely across-the-board and occurred in all states.

In the pre-COVID times, SFR's followed the practice of overstocking many brands for capturing the maximum market and then clearing the inventory at the end of the season through heavy discounting. This strategy became ineffective after the COVID-19 disruption. SFR's must now optimize their brand portfolio to minimize the overchoice effect and maximize the inventory turnover ratio. To this effect, we propose an efficient fuzzy probability-based brand portfolio optimization model, which relies on primary data analysis to classify brands in groups of substitutes.

Our aim was to determine whether some of these symptoms were more associated with past SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other conditions. METHODS: This prospective survey was nested in CONSTANCES, a randomly selected French population-based cohort, started in 2012. All participants being followed-up by internet completed 2 questionnaires during the first wave of the pandemic focusing on the acute symptoms of their COVID-19-like illness. Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 were then performed (May-Nov 2020). Between December 2020 and January 2021, participants completed a third questionnaire about symptoms that had lasted more than 2 months. Participants were classified into four groups according to both European Center for Diseases Control (ECDC) criteria for COVID-19 (ECDC+ or ECDC-) and serological SARS-CoV-2 test results (Sero+ or Sero-). To compare the risk of each persistent symptom among the groups, logistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, educational level, comorbidities, and the number of acute symptoms declared during the first wave of the epidemic. A mediation analysis was performed to estimate the direct effect of the infection on persistent symptoms and its indirect effect via the initial clinical presentation. FINDINGS: The analysis was performed in 25,910 participants. There was a higher risk of persistent dysgeusia/anosmia, dyspnea and asthenia in the ECDC+/Sero+ group than in the ECDC+/Sero- group (OR: 6.83 [4.47C10.42], 1.69 [1.07C2.6] and 1.48 [1.05C2.07], respectively). Abdominal pain, sensory symptoms or sleep disorders were at lower risk in the ECDC+/Sero+ group than in the ECDC+/Sero- group (0.51 [0.24C0.96], 0.40 [0.16C0.85], and 0.69 [0.49C0.95], respectively). The mediation analysis revealed that the association of the serological test results with each symptom was mainly mediated by ECDC symptoms (proportion mediated range 50C107%). CONCLUSION: A greater risk of persistent dysgeusia/anosmia, dyspnea and asthenia was observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected people. The initial clinical presentation substantially drives the association of positive serological test results with persistent symptoms.

Participant awareness of and knowledge about CRC screening methods varied across focus groups; overall, 95% of participants had heard of colonoscopy. Participants were less familiar with fecal tests and had confusion about them. Colonoscopy was associated with negative perceptions regarding the time, cost, and discomfort of the preparation and procedure, but some providers did not discuss alternative methods unless the patient resisted colonoscopy. Healthcare providers played a key role educating rural communities about CRC screening recommendations (age, risk) and testing options and being persistent in those recommendations. CRC awareness campaigns should include a variety of communication channels (TV, radio, billboards, health fairs, churches, healthcare settings). Promotion of CRC screening should include education about screening age guidelines, alternative test types, and informed decision-making between provider and patient regarding preferred screening methods based on the pros and cons of each test type.

Social media may be a useful adjunct for laparoscopic training, but its utility in developing countries like India has not been studied carefully. This paper describes an observational, cross-sectional study on the educational utility of Facebook groups based in India and which focus on laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. METHODS: The most popular Facebook groups involving Indians and focusing on laparoscopic gynecology were identified using appropriate search terms as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria. Demographic data related to the groups, the authors of posts as well as descriptive statistics of all the posts during the study period were collected and appropriate statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: All the groups in this study were large and growing steadily. Posts related to laparoscopy were more likely to be videos, dealing with operative techniques and having educational value for postgraduate residents (p value < 0.001) compared to posts unrelated to laparoscopic surgery. The majority of posts (88.2%) presented original content created by group members rather than material shared from other sources. Members preferred to share laparoscopic content using links to their personal YouTube channels rather than using institutional YouTube channels, dedicated websites for laparoscopic surgery or direct posts on Facebook. Group members liked educational content and laparoscopic surgery-related content significantly more than other content. Only 16.7% of the laparoscopic surgeons could be identified to be working in academic institutes. CONCLUSION: Social media for medical education has inherent advantages and disadvantages.

We assessed the experiences of adults with type 2 diabetes participating in a federally-qualified health center diabetes management program. Of 72 patients called, 61 completed telephone surveys from July to October 2020 in Spanish and English. 74% of respondents were Latino with Spanish as their preferred language. Respondents' mean age was 54 years, 62% were female, and 57% had less than a high school degree. Five patients reported testing positive for COVID-19, and 7 lived with someone who tested positive. Of 33 respondents who worked outside the home before COVID-19, 61% had lost their jobs or now worked fewer hours. When asked how diabetes management behaviors changed during the pandemic, 53% of respondents reported less physical activity, while 25% reported more. 18% reported eating less healthfully, while 38% reported eating more healthfully. 43% found it more difficult to obtain healthy food. 15% reported taking their medications more regularly, while 5% reported less. 61% reported increased difficulty accessing medical care. 41% felt more worried about being able to manage their diabetes during the pandemic and 49% felt more socially isolated. Changes in diabetes self-management behaviors related to COVID-19 were both positive and negative for patients in this low-resource urban setting.

We present the clinical validation of a pH-dependent colorimetric RT-LAMP (reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification) for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The method revealed a limit of detection of 19.3 viral genomic copies/uL when using RNA extracted samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs collected in guanidine-containing viral transport medium. Typical RT-LAMP reactions were performed at 65 C for 30 min. When compared to RT-qPCR, up to Ct value 32, RT-LAMP presented 97% (87.4-99.4% 95% CI) sensitivity and 100% (86.2-100%) specificity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection targeting N gene. No cross-reactivity was detected when testing other non-SARS-CoV virus, confirming high specificity. The test is compatible with primary RNA extraction free samples. We also demonstrated that colorimetric RT-LAMP can detect SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI), such as variants occurring in Brazil named P.1, P.2, B.1.1.374 and B.1.1.371. The method meets point-of-care requirements and can be deployed in the field for high-throughput COVID-19 testing campaigns, especially in countries where COVID-19 testing efforts are far from ideal to tackle the pandemics. Although RT-qPCR is considered the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, it requires expensive equipments, infrastructure and highly trained personnel. In contrast, RT-LAMP emerges as an affordable, inexpensive and simple alternative for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection that can be applied to massive COVID-19 testing campaigns and save lives.","output":"Clinical validation of colorimetric RT-LAMP, a fast, highly sensitive and specific COVID-19 molecular diagnostic tool that is robust to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, and mostly taking a broad perspective, it is clearly relevant to study environmental factors that could affect eventual future outbreaks due to coronaviruses and/or other pathogenic microorganisms.

Liver injury was evaluated using serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, and hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to evaluate the pathological changes in liver tissue. Apoptosis of hepatocytes was detected by TUNEL staining. The expression levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver were detected to evaluate oxidative stress. Western blotting was performed to assess expression levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response elements (ARE) pathway proteins in liver tissue. BAI pre-treatment significantly decreased elevation of serum aminotransferase levels induced by IR and alleviated histological damage to the liver. BAI decreased production of ROS and MDA in liver tissue induced by IR and increased the activity of SOD. At the same time, BAI inhibited apoptosis of liver cells induced by oxidative stress. Furthermore, BAI promoted the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus and increased the expression of total heme oxygenase-1 and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone-1.

This study aims to use the dynamic capability view (DCV) theory to analyze how three key supply chain capabilities C organizational flexibility, integration and agility C should be combined to obtain the desired supply chain performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors designed a conceptual model in which the relationships between these three key capabilities and supply chain performance were hypothesized. The model was first tested through partial least square regression using survey data collected from 98 members of the Peruvian coffee supply chain. A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was conducted to uncover how DCs could be combined in successful supply chain configurations. Findings: The authors show that organizational flexibility is a driver of higher agility in agri-food supply chains, together with external and internal supply chain integration, that have a direct impact on agility, which positively affects supply chain performance. Higher levels of supply chain agility are necessary but insufficient to guarantee high performance, as sufficiency is reached when both integration (internal and/or external) and agility are present.

While the first wave of the pandemic was a very challenging time in all countries, it is still uncertain whether various lockdown intensities and infection rates differed regarding their psychosocial impact. This work therefore aimed to investigate (i) the psychosocial effects of home confinement in two European countries that underwent different lockdown intensities: Italy and the Netherlands and (ii) the role of communication technology in relation to feelings of loneliness. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional online survey inquiring about different psychosocial variables and the use of and satisfaction towards communication technology was circulated among the general public during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 629 participants (66% female, 68% from the Netherlands) answered each question twice, referring to \\"before\\" and \\"during\\" the pandemic. (3) Results: We found significant negative effects of COVID-19 home confinement on depressive feelings (p < 0.001, %&#8710; = +54%), loneliness (p < 0.001, %&#8710; = +37.3%), life satisfaction (p < 0.001, %&#8710; = -19.8%) and mental wellbeing (p < 0.001, %&#8710; = -10.6%) which were accompanied with a significantly increased need for psychosocial support (p < 0.001, %&#8710; = +17.3%). However, the magnitude of psychosocial impact did not significantly differ between residents undergoing a more intense (Italy) versus a less intense (Netherlands) lockdown, although the decrease in social participation was found to be significantly different for both countries (z = -7.714, p < 0.001). Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the increase in loneliness was associated with the adoption of new digital communication tools (r = 0.21, p < 0.001), and significantly higher for individuals who started to adopt at least one new digital communication tool during confinement than for those who did not (z = -4.252, p < 0.001).

However, several safety concerns have been raised from chloroquine use due to the lack of essential information regarding its dosing. The aim of this study is to provide a critical appraisal of the safety information regarding chloroquine treatment and to apply simulation techniques to unveil relationships between the observed serious adverse events and overdosing, as well as to propose optimized dosage regimens. The dose related adverse events of chloroquine are unveiled and maximum tolerated doses and concentration levels are quoted. Among others, treatment with chloroquine can lead to severe adverse effects like prolongation of the QT interval and cardiomyopathy. In case of chloroquine overdosing, conditions similar to those produced by SARS-CoV2, such as pulmonary oedema with respiratory insufficiency and circulatory collapse, can be observed. Co-administration of chloroquine with other drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, like azithromycin, can further increase the risk of QT prolongation and cardiomyopathy. For elder patients there is a high risk for toxicity and dose reduction should be made.

Our aim is to provide guidance for urologists to help prioritize urological cancer surgeries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed published literature on bladder cancer, upper tract urothelial carcinoma, penile cancer, testis cancer, prostate cancer, renal cancer and adrenal cancer. RESULTS: For muscle invasive bladder cancer delays should be less than roughly 10 weeks and neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered. Patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer should be counseled appropriately based on risk and intravesical therapies can continue. Upper tract urothelial carcinoma should also be treated with minimal delays for high risk patients, especially with ureteral tumors. Surgery for T1 renal cancers when indicated can be delayed until adequate resources are available. Patients with T2 renal cancer should be considered for early surgery if there are unfavorable preoperative characteristics. Higher stage renal tumors should be considered for early surgery. An early multidisciplinary approach is recommended for metastatic renal cancers. High risk prostate cancer may need preferential treatment and consideration of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. Penile cancer can have worse sexual or oncologic outcomes with prolonged surgical delay. Likewise, adrenal cancer is aggressive and needs early surgical treatment. Testicular cancer should be treated in a timely manner with surgery or chemotherapy, as indicated.

OBJECTIVE The study aim was to evaluate Pharmacy and Pharm.D students' knowledge and information needs about COVID-19. METHOD A cross-sectional web-based design survey was used to assess socio-demographics and knowledge about COVID-19 amongst Pharmacy and Pharm. D students. After being validated, the questionnaire was formatted into Google forms and distributed amongst undergraduate Pharmacy and Pharm. D students in accredited Universities in Jordan. RESULTS A total of 860 Pharmacy and Pharm.D students completed the questionnaire. Results revealed moderate students' knowledge about COVID-19 (mean knowledge score was 5.6 out of 10). Students had high correct response rates in questions asking about transmission method, treatment, zoonotic transmission and medications to be avoided. However, the students demonstrated low knowledge in questions asking about the incubation period and degree of contagion scores. Several factors were associated with students' level of knowledge including the field of study and academic year. Few students relied on their faculty as the main source of information about the infection and most of them relied on self-reading and social network. CONCLUSION The results of this study clearly demonstrate an unsatisfactory level of knowledge and a lot of information needs about COVID-19 amongst Pharmacy and Pharm. D students.

Here we propose a neurophysiological account attributing these perceptual capacity limits directly to limits on cerebral cellular metabolism. We hypothesized that overall cerebral energy supply remains constant, irrespective of mental task demand, and therefore an attention mechanism is required to regulate cellular metabolism levels in line with task demands. Increased perceptual load in a task (imposing a greater demand on neural computations) should thus result in increased metabolism underlying attended processing, and reduced metabolism mediating unattended processing. We tested this prediction measuring oxidation states of cytochrome c oxidase (oxCCO), an intracellular marker of cellular metabolism. Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy was used to record oxCCO levels from human visual cortex while participants (both sexes) performed a rapid sequential visual search task under either high perceptual load (complex feature-conjunction search) or low load (feature pop-out search). A task-irrelevant, peripheral checkerboard was presented on a random half of trials. Our findings showed that oxCCO levels in visual cortex regions responsive to the attended-task stimuli were increased in high versus low perceptual load, while oxCCO levels related to unattended processing were significantly reduced. A negative temporal correlation of these load effects further supported our metabolism trade-off account. These results demonstrate an attentional compensation mechanism that regulates cellular metabolism levels according to processing demands. Moreover, they provide novel evidence for the widely-held stipulation that overall cerebral metabolism levels remain constant irrespective of mental task demand and establish a neurophysiological account for capacity limits in perception.Significance StatementWe investigated whether capacity limits in perception can be explained by the effects of attention on the allocation of limited cellular metabolic energy for perceptual processing. We measured the oxidation state of cytochrome c oxidase, an intracellular measure of metabolism, in human visual cortex during task performance. The results showed increased levels of cellular metabolism associated with attended processing and reduced levels of metabolism underlying unattended processing when the task was more demanding. A temporal correlation between these effects supported an attention-directed metabolism trade-off. These findings support an account for inattentional blindness grounded in cellular biochemistry. They also provide novel evidence for the claim that cerebral processing is limited by a constant energy supply, which thus requires attentional regulation.","output":"Attention and capacity limits in perception: A cellular metabolism account"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutralizing antibodies have become an important tool in treating infectious diseases.

Additionally, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, transplant patients are increasingly isolated because of their immunosuppressed state. To address this, we paired medical students with transplant recipients or donors for semi-structured, virtual encounters and studied the impact on both students and patients. Methods: Kidney or liver transplant recipients and donors were recruited by their medical team and paired with students for virtual visits via telephone or video-conferencing. Participants were briefed on the purposes and boundaries of the interactions, and a discussion guide focused the conversation on the patients personal experience. Separate focus groups were conducted with three groups of students and two groups of patients. The survey responses and focus group discussions were deidentified and analyzed using a constant comparative method. Results: 23 medical students on their surgery clerkship and 15 patients participated in virtual encounters. All encounters lasted more than 30 minutes, with 36% lasting greater than one hour. Students described how the encounters changed their perceptions of transplant-related relationships, including a deeper understanding of how recipients relate to living donors and the families of deceased donors and the multidisciplinary care relationships between patients and providers. Student perceptions of organ donation were also altered, including their ability to counsel patients, willingness to donate and confidence in speaking to friends and patients about organ donation. Patients derived personal benefit from these encounters as a chance to reflect and process their transplant experience, describing them as cathartic and personally illuminating. Additionally, patients appreciated the opportunity to educate students about donation and transplantation, subsequently helping them develop into more compassionate, empathetic physicians. Conclusion: Utilizing virtual non-medical visits between medical students and transplant patients is a feasible, well-received and effective method for students to learn about organ transplantation, donation and the multidisciplinary nature of transplant care. Additionally, these encounters provide an opportunity for patients to process their transplant experience and embrace their role as a teacher.

To extract the correct action and maximally assist their human controller, robots must reason over their context: for example, pressing a joystick down when interacting with a coffee cup indicates a different action than when interacting with knife. In this work, we develop assistive robots that condition their latent embeddings on visual inputs.

It is well established that ACE2 is the receptor that can mark the beginning of the infection. In light of this, the organs that express higher levels of ACE2 are generally considered at higher risk, while those with lower levels should be somehow more protected. This - if related to the scarcity of ace2-expressing cells in the brain - seems to contrast with the presence of a variety of neurological symptoms that follow infection with ace2. The aim of this work was to analyze ACE2 expression in the human brain, focusing on the choroid plexuses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty brain samples were obtained at autopsy from ten human fetuses and from ten adult subjects. All samples were selected to contain the choroid plexus. Specimens were fixed in 10% formalin, routinely processed and paraffin embedded. 5-micron sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and immunostained with a commercial anti-human ACE2 rabbit monoclonal antibody at 1:100 dilution. RESULTS: We analyzed 20 samples by immunohistochemistry, and we noted that, as far as fetal samples are concerned, a strong reactivity for ACE2 was detected in the myxoid stroma of the choroid plexuses and in the endothelial cells in fetuses. The complete absence of the ACE2 marker was detected in epithelial cells, neurons and glial cells of the cerebral cortex, both in fetuses and in adults. Whereas a strong but selective reactivity for ACE2 was also detected in adult choroid plexuses, mainly localized in the endothelial cells of the choroid capillaries.

From the integrated omics datasets, we found that Dox prolongs lifespan of both worm strains through shared and strain-specific mechanisms. Specifically, Dox strongly impacts mitochondria, upregulates defense response, and lipid metabolism, while decreasing triglycerides. We further validated that lipid genes acs-2/20 and fat-7/6 were required for Dox-induced UPRmt and longevity in N2 and CB4856 worms, respectively.

METHODS: Forty participants were assigned to three groups receiving either only AChEI (n = 14), AChEI + CS (n = 15), or only CS (n = 11). Cognition was evaluated at baseline and after three months. Linear mixed-effects models were used to investigate differences among the treatments in terms of changes in the patients' neuropsychological profiles. RESULTS: Results, although preliminary because of the small sample size, suggest that a general improvement was found in patients who received AChEI + CS and those who received only CS compared with those who received only AChEI. Interestingly, individuals who received only CS showed a significant improvement in immediate memory recall than those who received only AChEI. Furthermore, the group receiving AChEI + CS showed an improvement in delayed recall than the other two groups.

We conducted several robustness checks and cross-checked our results using seasonal Holt-Winters, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages, and generalized additive linear models.Results: We found declines in outpatient visits (-229%), inpatient admissions (-100%), pneumonia (-222%), bed-nets (-394%), malaria (-53%), antenatal care (-93%), and facility births (-57%). We found an increase in family planning visits (+110%) and in Caesarean sections (+58%). We found model-dependent, bidirectional effects on infant immunizations, facility-reported deaths, and maternal deaths.Conclusions: While there was an overall drop in health service use, our results indicate mixed health system effects in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with effect sizes and directionality that are dependent on the time series approach used. Measures to address large drops in service coverage like long lasting insecticide treated nets (LLIN) distribution may mitigate their long-term impacts on population health.

Therefore, how to carry out ROP screening safely and effectively during the epidemic was very important and urgent. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of ROP screening assisted by telemedicine network during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Wuhan Childrens hospital in Wuhan, China, from January to October, 2020. The measures which were performed to make the ROP screening more safe and effective were summarized and the comparison between ROP screening assisted by telemedicine network in 2020 and usual screening in 2019 were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 267 outpatient infants completed ROP screening. The median gestational age was 32 weeks (30w to 34w) and the median birth weight was 1780 g (1460 g to 2100 g). Meanwhile, 149 (55.8%) out of 267 infants were males. During January to May in 2020, 86 screening appointments were received, among which 67 (77.9%) were from telemedicine platform online. The completing percentage of total online ROP appointments was higher than that of total face-to-face appointments (58.1% VS 22. 1%, P = 0.018). As for the number of infants screened between 2020 and 2019 from Februaryto October, 54 infants completed ROP screening in 2020, which was higher than that (51participants) in 2019 on September. Furthermore, compared with the usual screening in 2019, ROP screening assisted by telemedicine network in 2020 had smaller gestational age (32w VS 33w, p<0.001) and lower birth weight (1780 g VS 1900 g, p = 0.001). However, of the 267 infants screened, 18(6.7%) had ROP while the percentage of ROP screened in 2019 was the same (44[6.7%]). During follow-up, none of medical staffs was infected and no adverse reaction was reported.

We used the epi-Israeli IBD Research Nucleus (IIRN) database to perform a population-based study exploring the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on disease course in IBD patients. Methods: We included all IBD patients insured in two of the four Israeli HMOs, covering 35% of the population, by validated algorithms, and selected those who received two doses of Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. These were matched to unvaccinated IBD patients by demographics, parameters of disease severity at baseline generated by hierarchical clustering of laboratory data, and length of time from previous exacerbation to baseline. The primary outcome was rate of IBD exacerbation as defined by proxies of hospitalizations, treatment escalation, and commencement of corticosteroid or enema. The study period was December, 2020 to June, 2021 Results: 707 pairs of vaccinated and unvaccinated IBD patients were compared. The pairs matched exactly for gender, district, IBD type and disease severity, and 1 year for age at IBD diagnosis and at vaccination.

However, information is limited about pathological changes in the liver in this infection, so the mechanism of liver injury is unclear. Here we describe liver histopathology and clinical correlates of 27 patients who died of COVID\\\\19 in Manaus, Brazil. There was a high prevalence of liver injury (elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in 44% and 48% of patients, respectively) in these patients. Histological analysis showed sinusoidal congestion and ischemic necrosis in more than 85% of the cases, but these appeared to be secondary to systemic rather than intrahepatic thrombotic events, as only 14% and 22% of samples were positive for CD61 (marker of platelet activation) and C4d (activated complement factor), respectively. Furthermore, the extent of these vascular findings did not correlate with the extent of transaminase elevations. Steatosis was present in 63% of patients, and portal inflammation was present in 52%. In most cases, hepatocytes expressed angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is responsible for binding and entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), even though this ectoenzyme was minimally expressed on hepatocytes in normal controls.

METHODS: This prospective study included adult patients with suspected appendicitis at a single UK centre from March-June 2020. The primary outcome measures were rates of US and CT imaging. Secondary outcomes included subsequent operative and histological findings. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included. A clinical diagnosis of appendicitis was made in 11 (15%). Thirty-five (47%) patients had CT, 22 (29%) had an US and 7 (9%) had both. The appendix was visualised in only 10 patients and a radiological diagnosis of appendicitis was made in 6 cases. Appendicitis was confirmed on histology in 67% of subsequently operated cases. CT evidence of appendicitis correlated with operative appendicitis in 93% (28/30) of cases. There were two cases of appendiceal malignancy not demonstrated on CT. Correlation of complicated appendicitis between CT and operative findings was poor; one third (10/28) of patients had appendiceal perforation not identified on CT.

Pullbacks were started during a nonocclusive flush, mechanically injecting 24 mL of 50% diluted contrast at 6 mL/s to displace blood from the artery. Two independent physicians judged the quality of images on a predefined 1-10 scale. The proportions of specific agreement and kappa values () were calculated. RESULTS No procedural or in-hospital neurological complications occurred (any stroke/death 0%). The technical success of OCT pullbacks was 97.3% (73/75). The total amount of contrast was 8618 mL/patient. No significant alteration in glomerular filtration rate or any other significant adverse event occurred. The images obtained were of high quality (mean value 8.1 out of 10), with good inter- and intraobserver agreement ( = 0.81-0.87 and  = 0.95, respectively).

Novel pathogens pose dangers to fieldwork staff, particularly when there are global or local shortages of personal protective equipment. Action During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, New South Wales (NSW) Healths Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC) deployed staff for fieldwork in a range of settings.

However, the application of SPR to detect trace targets is hampered by non-specific binding and poor signal. A variety of approaches for amplification have been explored to overcome this deficiency including DNA aptamers as versatile target detection tools. Hybridization chain reaction (HCR) is a high-efficiency enzyme-free DNA amplification method operated at room temperature, in which two stable species of DNA hairpins coexist in solution until the introduction of the initiator strand triggers a cascade of hybridization events. At an optimal salt condition, as the concentrations of H1 and H2 increased, the HCR signals were enhanced, leading to signal amplification reaching up to 6.5-fold of the detection measure at 30 min. This feature enables DNA to act as an amplifying transducer for biosensing applications to provide an enzyme-free alternative that can easily detect complex DNA sequences. Improvement of more diverse recognition events can be achieved by integrating HCR with a phase-sensitive SPR (pSPR)-tested aptamer stimulus. This work seeks to establish pSPR aptamer system for highly informative sensing by means of an amplification HCR.

However, relevant conformational states may be missed at common cryogenic (cryo) data-collection temperatures but can be populated at room temperature. To assess the impact of temperature on making structural and computational discoveries, we systematically investigated protein conformational changes in response to temperature and ligand binding in a structural and computational workhorse, the T4 lysozyme L99A cavity. Despite decades of work on this protein, shifting to RT reveals new global and local structural changes. These include uncovering an apo helix conformation that is hidden at cryo but relevant for ligand binding, and altered side chain and ligand conformations. To evaluate the impact of temperature-induced protein and ligand changes on the utility of structural information in computation, we evaluated how temperature can mislead computational methods that employ cryo structures for validation. We find that when comparing simulated structures just to experimental cryo structures, hidden successes and failures often go unnoticed. When using structural information in ligand binding predictions, both coarse docking and rigorous binding free energy calculations are influenced by temperature effects. The trend that cryo artifacts limit the utility of structures for computation holds across five distinct protein classes.

Scientists have made strides in estimating key transmission and epidemiological parameters. In particular, accumulating evidence points to a substantial fraction of asymptomatic or subclinical infections, which influences our understanding of the transmission potential and severity of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. METHODS: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City together with epidemiological data of Japanese repatriated from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis. RESULTS: Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China, in 2019C2020 reached values at 3.49 (95% CrI 3.39C3.62) with a mean serial interval of 6.0 days, and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23 in 2020 was associated with a significantly reduced R at 0.84 (95% CrI 0.81C0.88), with the total number of infections (i.e., cumulative infections) estimated at 1,906,634 (95% CrI 1,373,500C2,651,124) in Wuhan City, elevating the overall proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95% CrI 13.5C26.6%). We also estimated the most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and timeCdelay adjusted IFR at 0.04% (95% CrI 0.03C0.06%) and 0.12% (95% CrI 0.08C0.17%), respectively, estimates that are substantially smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.06%. CONCLUSIONS: We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, during JanuaryCFebruary 2020 using an ecological modeling approach that is suitable to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems. Our estimate of timeCdelay adjusted IFR falls in the range of the median IFR estimates based on multiple serological studies conducted in several areas of the world.","output":"Early epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential and virulence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China, JanuaryCFebruary, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assess workplace vaping as a trigger for tobacco use; examine interest in and prevalence of vaping cessation programs; determine needs of parents whose children vape.

While platelet activation and elevated platelet counts (thrombocytosis) are associated with increased risk of thrombotic complications, low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and several platelet function disorders increase the risk of bleeding. Over the last years, more and more evidence has emerged that platelets and their activation state can also modulate innate and adaptive immune responses and low platelet counts have been identified as a surrogate marker for poor prognosis in septic patients. Viral infections often coincide with platelet activation. Host inflammatory responses result in the release of platelet activating mediators and a pro-oxidative and pro-coagulant environment, which favors platelet activation. However, viruses can also directly interact with platelets and megakaryocytes and modulate their function. Furthermore, platelets can be activated by viral antigenCantibody complexes and in response to some viruses B-lymphocytes also generate anti-platelet antibodies. All these processes contributing to platelet activation result in increased platelet consumption and removal and often lead to thrombocytopenia, which is frequently observed during viral infection. However, virus-induced platelet activation does not only modulate platelet count but also shape immune responses. Platelets and their released products have been reported to directly and indirectly suppress infection and to support virus persistence in response to certain viruses, making platelets a double-edged sword during viral infections. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on platelet interaction with different types of viruses, the viral impact on platelet activation, and platelet-mediated modulations of innate and adaptive immune responses.","output":"Platelets and Infection C An Emerging Role of Platelets in Viral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic created massive disruptions in meat supply chains including the US poultry industry.

Access to a safe, stable, and high quality food supply is often taken for granted by Canadians but it is one of the key roles that our agricultural industry serves and underlines why it is designated an essential service. Despite the federal governments assurance that our nations food supply remains stable, concerns have been mounting from both consumers and the agricultural industry that disruptions in the food supply chain will cause food insecurity and severe economic distress. As a whole, Canadas agri-food industry is well-positioned to adapt to the present crisis and continue supplying domestic and export markets. However, this does not mean that our food system is impermeable to disruption. In fact, challenges caused by COVID-19 have highlighted vulnerabilities in the food supply chain. Labour shortages, major shifts in consumer demand, and the slowdowns/closures at processing plants have already exacerbated food insecurity among Canadians and increased financial pressure on primary producers. As the foundation of the food supply chain, Canadian farmers are key to its stability. As many farms were experiencing severe economic hardship prior to the pandemic, the challenges of market uncertainty and increased production costs put these operations at greater financial risk. Policy action will be key to ensure the short and long-term viability of our primary industry and maintain the capacity to meet domestic and export market demands. Canada is still in the early stages of crisis management but government support of Canadian agriculture has been largely inadequate in alleviating the financial impact on farmers.

Previous research on SAs was limited to alerts featuring White senior citizens. The present study is the first to extend SA research to Black senior citizens. A sample of college students (N = 210) viewed a mock SA along with a short video of a missing couple and later attempted to recognize the two individuals from a series of photos. The male and female targets were shown in the SA either together or separately and with or without glasses, and participants were shown photos with and without glasses. The results indicated no effect of whether the couple was shown together or separately, but participants were more likely to recognize the missing male without glasses when he had been shown without glasses in the SA. The female target was recognized more often when wearing glasses than when not wearing glasses, irrespective of how she had been shown in the SA.

OBJECTIVE: Given that emotion regulation (ER) difficulties have been linked to adult psychopathology and maladaptive parenting, the goal of the present study was to examine the mechanisms through which a maternal history of child maltreatment, and subsequent difficulties with ER, might contribute to unsupportive emotion socialization and the intergenerational transmission of ER difficulties. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Mothers and their young adult children (aged 18-25) were recruited from across Canada to participate in an online study (N = 185 dyads). METHODS: Mothers responded to questionnaires assessing their child maltreatment histories and ER difficulties. Young adults retrospectively reported on their mothers' emotion socialization behaviours in adolescence as well as their own difficulties with ER. RESULTS: A moderated mediation analysis revealed that mothers who endorsed more types of child maltreatment were described as using more unsupportive contingencies, but only in the context of high levels of maternal ER difficulties. The indirect effect of maternal child maltreatment on young adults' ER difficulties was only significant for mothers with high levels of ER difficulties. More specifically, maternal difficulties with impulse control and emotional clarity contributed to more unsupportive contingencies. CONCLUSIONS: Mothers who have experienced multiple forms of child maltreatment may be more likely to struggle with ER and engage in unsupportive emotion socialization behaviours, which may increase the risk of emotional difficulties in their children. Survivors of child maltreatment should have access to interventions that promote ER skills to improve their own well-being and to prevent the transmission of ER difficulties to future generations.","output":"The role of maternal child maltreatment history and unsupportive emotion socialization in the intergenerational transmission of emotion regulation difficulties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The acknowledgement section in the original article was published incorrectly.","output":"Correction to: Genetic Evidence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-Cov) and Widespread Seroprevalence among Camels in Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which recently has been characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) having killed almost 250,000 people worldwide as of May 4th 2020.

Infrared spectroscopy of molecules trapped in helium nanodroplets is a promising methodology for the measurement of thermochemical parameters. When molecules are captured in a helium nanodroplet, the rate of cooling to an equilibrium temperature of ca. 0.4 K is generally faster than the rate of isomerization, resulting in \\"shock-freezing\\" that kinetically traps molecules in local conformational minima. This unique property enables the study of temperature-dependent conformational equilibria via infrared spectroscopy at 0.4 K, thereby avoiding the deleterious effects of spectral broadening at higher temperatures. Herein, we demonstrate the first application of this approach to ionic species by coupling electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with helium nanodroplet infrared action spectroscopy to probe the structure and thermochemistry of deprotonated DNA dinucleotides. Dinucleotide anions were generated by ESI, confined in an ion trap at temperatures between 90 and 350 K, and entrained in traversing helium nanodroplets. The infrared action spectra of the entrained ions show a strong dependence on pre-pickup ion temperature, consistent with the preservation of conformer population upon cooling to 0.4 K. Non-negative matrix factorization was utilized to identify component conformer infrared spectra and determine temperature-dependent conformer populations. Relative enthalpies and entropies of conformers were subsequently obtained from a van't Hoff analysis. IR spectra and conformer thermochemistry are compared to results from ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and electronic structure methods. The implementation of ESI-MS as a source of dopant molecules expands the diversity of molecules accessible for thermochemical measurements, enabling the study of larger, non-volatile species.","output":"Probing the conformational landscape and thermochemistry of DNA dinucleotide anions via helium nanodroplet infrared action spectroscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has created havoc in healthcare systems worldwide, including shortages in equipment and supplies for dialysis in the acute setting.

CONCLUSION: Planning for an expected surge in hospitalized patients requiring RRT demands coordination between critical care, dialysis and nursing services as well as community and hospital providers to make certain there are adequate dialysis resources. Our experience suggests that continuous dialysis is in greatest demand early in the illness, and that plans to increase supplies should be put in place. But, planning should also focus on unforeseen hospital-specific infrastructure shortages that can develop over time and hamper intermittent dialysis delivery to all patients who require treatment.","output":"Inpatient Dialysis Planning During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Single-Center Experience and Review of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a threat to health systems around the world and Rwanda is not an exception. The impact of the pandemic is far-reaching and access to health commodities is not spared. Proper drug supply is critical for a robust healthcare system. It determines the extent at which the population are likely to have access to essential medicines and treatments. In Rwanda, the pharmaceutical sector heavily relies on imports. With the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, the drug supply system was interrupted leaving many stores from small local pharmacies to the big medical stores running out of stock. The reasons were limited importation of goods from abroad, and the panic buying practice among the customers and some institutions when responding to the pandemic. Drug and medicines accessibility, availability and affordability should be the core of any drug management policy. It is with no doubt that, Rwanda has made a tremendous work to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on the countrys drug supply; however, efforts are still needed to invest in local pharmaceutical production as a way to minimize import expenses in the country. Good policy on drug importation, production and distribution should be enforced to avoid any drug shortage that may be encountered in the Rwandan drug market.","output":"Drug supply situation in Rwanda during COVID-19: issues, efforts and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A duplex TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay was developed for the detection of St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), for use in human and vector surveillance.

Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can be re-opened. In this paper, a simpler model is presented in order to guide various countries on the (possible) re-opening of the economy (or re-opening in stages/phases) alongside risk categories and ratios. Factors that need to be considered when applying the model include the healthcare capacity in terms of the number of hospitals, beds and healthcare workers that are available to capacitate this virus. In addition, population size, physical distancing measures, socio-economic disparities, lockdown regulations in each country, and more importantly - the amount and accuracy of testing conducted, is also imperative to consider. Decisions adopted by leaders around the world have the most difficult decision to make (yet), and have to weigh up on what really matters; health or wealth.

The use of multiple prescribers is not a problem per se and can be legitimate, as when the patient's regular physician is not available or a concurrent painful condition is being cared for by a different practitioner. PURPOSE The primary objective of this study was to determine if those patients who used a few prescribers (two to five) in a 1-year period were distinguishable from those who used only one prescriber. METHODS We performed a secondary data analysis of the California Prescription Monitoring Program, the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System, by using data collected during 1999-2007. RESULTS The group who used a few providers (two to five) differed substantially from those who visited one provider over a 1-year period. However, the dissimilarity did not suggest that these patients were more prone to the abuse of opioids. CONCLUSIONS The decision not to investigate patients who visit a low number of multiple prescribers (two to five) appears to be justifiable. If the number of providers in a given period of time is used to determine if a patient should be challenged as being a \\"doctor shopper,\\" cutoffs with high specificity (low false-positive rates) should be chosen.

In an A/B test, traffic is randomly allocated between a treatment group, which uses the new algorithm, and a control group, which uses the existing algorithm. However, because networks are congested, both treatment and control traffic compete against each other for resources in a way that biases the outcome of these tests. This bias can have a surprisingly large effect; for example, in lab A/B tests with two widely used congestion control algorithms, the treatment appeared to deliver 150% higher throughput when used by a few flows, and 75% lower throughput when used by most flows-despite the fact that the two algorithms have identical throughput when used by all traffic. Beyond the lab, we show that A/B tests can also be biased at scale. In an experiment run in cooperation with Netflix, estimates from A/B tests mistake the direction of change of some metrics, miss changes in other metrics, and overestimate the size of effects.

It will help determine if education is needed to increase the vaccination rate and, if so, what areas to target. The study will also provide insight into vaccine hesitancy among pharmacy students. METHODS: In April 2021, a survey was sent to pharmacy students in professional years 1, 2, 3, and 4 at Western New England University in Springfield, Massachusetts. Information gathered included if the student had received and completed the vaccine series, why the student was motivated to receive the vaccine, or why they were hesitant, along with work and experiential rotation information. RESULTS: The response rate to the survey was 63% (133 of 212). Eighty-six percent of the respondents were at least partially vaccinated against COVID-19. Four percent of respondents were not considering receiving the vaccine, 6% were, and another 4% were undecided. Unvaccinated students attributed their hesitancy mostly to being concerned about the vaccine's long-term effects (85%) followed by not wanting to miss an exam/class (23%). Vaccinated students were more likely to work at a site that administered the COVID-19 vaccine (81.6% vs. 50%, P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the pandemic, COVID-19 vaccination rates were not higher than voluntary influenza vaccination rates.

Electronic-textile (e-textile)-based cardiac monitoring offers a viable option to allow cardiac rehabilitation programs to be conducted outside of the hospital. Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether signals produced by an e-textile ECG monitor with textile electrodes in an EASI configuration are of sufficient quality to be used for cardiac monitoring. Specific objectives were to investigate the effect of the textile electrode characteristics, placement, and condition on signal quality, and finally to compare results to a reference ECG obtained from a current clinical standard the Holter monitor. Methods: ECGs during different body movements (yawning, deep-breathing, coughing, sideways, and up movement) and activities of daily living (sitting, sitting/standing from a chair, and climbing stairs) were collected from a baseline standard of normal healthy adult male using a novel e-textile ECG and a reference Holter monitor. Each movement or activity was recorded for 5 min with 2-min intervals between each recording. Three different textile area electrodes (40, 60, and 70 mm(2)) and electrode thicknesses (3, 5, and 10 mm) were considered in the experiment. The effect of electrode placement within the EASI configuration was also studied. Different signal quality parameters, including signal to noise ratio, approximate entropy, baseline power signal quality index, and QRS duration and QT intervals, were used to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the textile-based ECG monitor. Results: The overall signal quality from the 70 mm(2) textile electrodes was higher compared to the smaller area electrodes. Results showed that the ECGs from 3 and 5 mm textile electrodes showed good quality. Regarding location, placing the A and I electrodes on the left and right anterior axillary points, respectively, showed higher signal quality compared to the standard EASI electrode placement. Wet textile electrodes showed better signal quality compared to their dry counterparts. When compared to the traditional Holter monitor, there was no significant difference in signal quality, which indicated textile monitoring was as good as current clinical standards (non-inferior). Conclusion: The e-textile EASI ECG monitor could be a viable option for real-time monitoring of cardiac activities.

The flow rate, type, and severity of cases presented to emergency departments varied during the pandemic in comparison to the past years. However, this change has not been well-described among the cases of hospital admission due to toxic exposure. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Recognition of the pattern of toxic exposure among the cases refereed to Tanta Poison Control Center (TPCC; Tanta, Egypt) during the past five years, and furthermore, exploration of the impact of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the pattern of presented cases. METHODS: The current study is a five-year retrospective, comparative cross-sectional study carried out among acutely intoxicated patients admitted to TPCC during the spring months (March through May) of 2016-2020. A total of 1,916 patients with complete medical records were recruited. The type and manner of toxic exposure, demographic, clinical data, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The current study noted that there were delays in time from toxic exposure to emergency services during the lockdown period. This was reflected in significant lower recovery rates (884.8/1,000 population; z = -3.0) and higher death rates (49.4/1,000 population; z = 2.1) despite the marked decrease in the total number of hospital admissions in comparison to the past four years.

METHODS: Samples were collected from six asymptomatic and six symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-confirmed hospitalized patients in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. Clinical details, biochemical parameters, and treatment regimen were collected from a hospital; viral load was determined by RT-PCR; and the levels of cytokines and circulating antibodies in plasma were assessed by Bio-Plex and isotyping, respectively. In addition, whole-genome sequencing of viral strains and mutational analysis were carried out. RESULTS: Analysis of the biochemical parameters highlighted the increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum SGPT, serum SGOT, and ferritin in symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patients were mostly with one or more comorbidities, especially type 2 diabetes (66.6%). The virological estimation revealed that there was no significant difference in viral load of oropharyngeal (OP) samples between the two groups. On the other hand, viral load was higher in plasma and serum samples of symptomatic patients, and they develop sufficient amounts of antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA). The levels of seven cytokines (IL-6, IL-1, IP-10, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-2, IL-15) were found to be highly elevated in symptomatic patients, while three cytokines (soluble CD40L, GRO, and MDC) were remarkably higher in asymptomatic patients. The whole-genome sequence analysis revealed that the current isolates were clustered with 19B, 20A, and 20B clades; however, 11 additional changes in Orf1ab, spike, Orf3a, Orf8, and nucleocapsid proteins were acquired. The D614G mutation in spike protein is linked with higher virus replication efficiency and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection as three patients had higher viral load, and among them, two patients with this mutation passed away.

Based on these observations we propose a hypothesis that those who harbor elevated frequencies of MN within their cells are more prone to RNA virus infection and are more likely, through combined effects of leakage of self-DNA from MN and RNA from viruses, to escalate pro-inflammatory cytokine production via the cyclic GMPCAMP synthase (cGAS), stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) mechanisms to an extent that is unresolvable and therefore confers high risk of causing tissue damage by an excessive and overtly toxic immune response.

In the community, the use of face masks is increasing world-wide, but documentation for the efficacy of this remedy is lacking. This trial investigates whether the use of face masks in the community will reduce wearers' risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS This study will be a two-arm, unblinded, randomised controlled trial. We will include adults (>18 years of age) without prior confirmed COVID-19 or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, who spend more than three hours per day outside the home with exposure to other people. A total of 6,000 participants are randomly assigned 1:1 to use face masks or not for a 30-day period during the pandemic. Participants will perform self-testing; quick test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG)) (the Livzon lateral flow test) and oropharyngeal/nasal swabs for viral detection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primary endpoint following the 30-day study period is the difference in the number of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals between the two study groups as assessed by a positive nasopharyngeal swap, a positive antibody test or a hospital-based diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS We will study whether a face mask protects the wearer of the mask against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings are expected to apply to the present pandemic and to future viral outbreaks and to provide evidence for authority recommendations across the world.

This study aims to identify and evaluate the forms of supportive care for patients with respiratory diseases. Methods: An umbrella review of supportive care for patient respiratory diseases was undertaken. We comprehensively searched the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wanfang Data and CBM (SinoMed) from their inception to 31 March 2020, and other sources to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to supportive treatments for patient with respiratory diseases including COVID-19, SARS, MERS and influenza. We assessed the methodological quality using the AMSTAR score and the quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of each included systematic review and meta-analysis. Results: We included 18 systematic reviews and meta-analyses in this study. Most studies focused on the respiratory and circulatory support. Ten studies were of high methodological quality, five studies of medium quality, and three studies of low quality. According to four studies extracorporeal membrane oxygenation did not reduce mortality in adults (OR/RR ranging from 0.71 to 1.28), but two studies reported significantly lower mortality in patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than in the control group (OR/RR ranging from 0.38 to 0.73). Besides, monitoring of vital signs and increasing the number of medical staff may also reduce the mortality in patients with respiratory diseases. Conclusions: Our overview suggests that supportive care may reduce the mortality of patients with respiratory diseases to some extent. However, the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes in the included studies was low to moderate. Further systematic reviews and meta-analyses are needed to address the evidence gap regarding the supportive care for SARS, MERS and COVID-19.","output":"Supportive Care for Patient with Respiratory Diseases: An Umbrella Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graphical This paper contributes to the literature on the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic impacts on the Bitcoin futures (BTCF) market and to the ongoing consideration of the dynamic relationship between volatility (or returns) and trading behavior variables, such as volume and open interest as a proxy for belief dispersion.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we conducted multivariable regression analysis with the Physician Uneven Distribution Index (PUDI), a recently developed and adopted policy index in Japan that uniquely incorporates the gap between medical supply and demand, as the independent variable and CeVD death rate as the dependent variable. Population density, mean annual income, and prevalence of hypertension were used as covariates. Results: The coefficient of the PUDI for the CeVD death rate was ?0.34 (95%CI: ?0.49C?0.19) before adjusting for covariates and was ?0.19 (95%CI: ?0.30C?0.07) after adjusting. The adjusted R squared of the analysis for the PUDI was 0.71 in the final model. However, the same multivariable regression model showed that the number of physicians per 100,000 people (NPPP) was not associated with the CeVD death rates before or after adjusting for the covariates.

This age-stratified, serological survey was aimed to measure the COVID-19 distribution and determinants in district Islamabad of Pakistan. Methodology: Three-stage cluster sampling, using population proportionate to size technique, starting with a random number was used. A structured, pretested questionnaire was used after taking informed written consent, to gather demographic, risk factor information. Results: Seroprevalence was found 16.5% (AR: 16.5%/100,000). The mean age was 35 (sd:16 Years). The majority were male (64%), self-employed (29%), and had primary level education (33%). The highest seroprevalence was found in the 21-30 years age group (24.8%) while the 41-50 years age group showed the highest attack rate (112.9/100,000 population). The proportion of the population tested that were asymptomatic was 69% (n=711) while the most frequently reported sign/symptom was cough (99%) followed by fever (20%). No known co-morbidity was reported in 86% (n=884) of respondents while hypertension remained the most reported condition (8%). High seroprevalence was observed in urban areas (12.3%) compared to rural union councils (6.4%). Visiting a house where COVID-19 case was isolated (OR 2, CI 1.38-2.84, P< 0.001), history of contact with a known case of COVID-19 (OR 1.42, CI 1.11-1.82, P=0.005), and attending a mass gathering (OR 1.21, CI: 1.02-1.42, p=0.02) were significant risk factors associated with contracting an infection. A Chi-Square test of independence showed significant protection while using regular hand hygiene practices (6.5; p<0.05) and regular usage of face masks (8.6; p<0.05). Conclusion: Seroprevalence gives a direct estimation of population groups exposed to the virus. A remarkable difference in prevalence is found in urban and rural areas, extreme age groups, and socioeconomic statuses, suggesting targeted public health interventions.

Especially in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic nowadays, many kinds of abdominal surgery have been rescheduled and we must make priorities of what procedures should be done during the pandemic. Many guidelines (such as Royal College Surgery) suggested to postpone and reschedule the operative treatment during the pandemic, even in gastrointestinal cancer surgery. In this pandemic era, those guidelines could be applied in many elective settings, but not in emergency abdominal surgery procedures, we must face increasing post operative morbidity and mortality on performing surgery in confirmed COVID-19 will evaluate the post operative morbidity which leads to increased mortality of COVID-19 patients whose underwent emergency abdominal surgery during the pandemic.MethodsThis study has conducted at Digestive Surgery Division at Moewardi General Hospital, Indonesia, from April 2020 until March 2021. Emergency abdominal surgery, including trauma and non-trauma cases, will be included in this study. All patients have already confirmed with positive COVID-19 pre-operatively. The procedure of this emergency surgery is laparotomy exploration with standardized level 3 PPE during surgery. The exclusion criteria of this study are to redo surgery and pediatric surgery case. The presence of post operative morbidity and in-hospital mortality will be recorded following this study.ResultsFrom April 2020 until March 2021, we reported 39 emergency abdominal surgery cases. All of them have been done emergency exploratory laparotomy. The most common procedure is diffuse peritonitis due to peptic ulcer perforation (reported in 21 cases), other procedures are complicated appendicitis in 9 cases, two cases of blunt abdominal trauma, large bowel obstruction was found in 4 cases and 3 cases of incarcerated groin hernia. Thirty-one patients survived following the emergency abdominal surgery and 8 patients did not survive with post operative pneumonia and uncontrolled sepsis in the ICU.ConclusionsPost operative pneumonia is the important factor which has an impact on unfavorable clinical outcome during emergency abdominal surgery procedures on confirmed COVID-19 positive patients.

The machine learning models have been applied to the radiological images of the Covid-19 positive patients for disease prediction and severity assessment. However, a segmentation model for detecting the opacity regions like haziness, ground-glass opacity and lung consolidation from the Covid-19 positive chest X-rays is still lacking. The recently published dataset of a collection of radiological images for a rural population in United States had made development of such a model a possibility due to the high quality of the radiological images and the consistency in clinical measurements. We manually annotated 221 chest X-ray images with lung fields and opacity regions and trained a segmentation model for the opacity region. The model has a good performance in regarding the overlap between predicted and manually labelled opacity regions for both the testing data set and the validation dataset from very different sources. In addition, the percentage of the opacity region over the area of the total lung fields shows a good predictive power for the patient severity. In view of the above, our model is a successful first try in developing a segmentation model for the opacity regions for the Covid-19 positive chest X-rays. However, careful manual examinations of the model predictions by experienced radiologists show mistakenly predicted opacity regions caused probably by the anatomical complexities.

We tested 126/127 residents for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR and performed symptom assessments. We calculated the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and assessed symptom onset over 30-day follow-up to determine: 1) the proportion of cases who were symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and asymptomatic and 2) incidence of symptoms among those who tested negative. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to determine the 30-day probability of death for cases. RESULTS: Of 126 residents tested, 33 had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 on March 15. Nineteen (58%) had symptoms at the time of testing, 1 (3%) developed symptoms over follow-up, and 13 (39%) remained asymptomatic.

We assessed the prevalence of recently (past 6 months) receiving naloxone and currently having naloxone, the type(s) of the naloxone kits received, and the perceived ease/difficultly of accessing naloxone. We also assessed participants knowledge of where naloxone was available in the community. RESULTS: One third (35.7%) of participants had recently received naloxone. Most who had received naloxone received two doses (72.1%), nasal naloxone (86.9%), and education about naloxone use (72.1%). Most currently had naloxone in their possession (either on their person or at home; 78.7%). One third (34.4%) believed naloxone was difficult to obtain in their community. Only half (56.7%) knew of multiple locations where they could get naloxone. The health department was the most commonly identified naloxone source (58.0%).

Evaluation on 129,084 past cases shows that the top-3 suggestions made by our model have an accuracy of 95.5% in classifying 265 subheadings. This promising result implies algorithms may reduce the time and effort taken by customs officers substantially by assisting the HS code classification task.","output":"Classification of Goods Using Text Descriptions With Sentences Retrieval"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To assess the role of brief neuropsychological assessments in prediction and identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and progression to AD dementia. Method: Adults (N = 255; range = 40-81 years) with self-reported cognitive decline underwent baseline and 2-year follow-up clinical assessment, including a brief neuropsychological screening and lumbar puncture. Five different mild cognitive impairment (MCI) algorithms were applied on baseline cognitive test results: one conventional, three amnestic (lenient, stringent, multidomain), and one comprehensive criterion. We compared predictive and diagnostic accuracy of these MCI criteria by performing logistic regression analyses and calculating diagnostic accuracy measures for 2-year outcomes of (1) clinical diagnosis of AD dementia and (2) cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in the Alzheimer's continuum. Results: The lenient amnestic MCI criterion showed the largest effect size for predicting progression to AD dementia (OR = 13.762, 99% CI = 1.969-96.194, p = .001) and AD biomarkers (OR = 4.855, 99% CI = 1.974-11.924, p < .001) after 2 years. This criterion was sensitive for progression to dementia (sensitivity = 92.0%, specificity = 54.8%, positive likelihood ratio [LR+] = 2.03, LR- = 0.15) and showed the highest overall diagnostic accuracy for AD biomarkers (sensitivity = 72.7%, specificity = 59.1%, LR+ = 1.78, negative likelihood ratio [LR-] = 0.46). The multidomain amnestic MCI criterion produced the highest specificity for dementia (sensitivity = 76.0%, specificity = 73.0%, LR+ = 2.82, LR- = 0.33) and AD biomarkers (sensitivity = 46.8% specificity = 70.9% LR+ = 1.61, LR- = 0.75). Conclusions: Defining MCI using a brief neuropsychological battery provided limited accuracy for progression to AD dementia and cerebrospinal fluid A. The lenient amnestic MCI criterion identified the highest number of individuals who progressed to clinical AD or showed biomarker pathology, but this approach included a substantial number of false positives.

BACKGROUND Burnout of healthcare professionals can be a major cost to the Australian economy and public healthcare sector. According to the social exchange theory, when healthcare professionals perceive that their organisation proactively allocates resources to caring for its employees, then they are more likely to reciprocate and become more engaged in their work roles. DESIGN The study used a pre and post survey of healthcare professionals who participated in the wellbeing initiative. METHODS Between February and June 2019, 172 healthcare professionals were surveyed before and after a wellbeing initiative. The survey included questions on workplace engagement, workplace wellbeing, and job satisfaction. Paired t-tests were used to determine if the difference between before and after averages were significant. The TREND statement was utilised to ensure the quality reporting of this study. RESULTS The wellbeing initiative had a positive impact on the healthcare professionals involved in the initiative. Nursing staff benefitted the most from the wellbeing initiative while the full-time staff members and highly experienced demonstrated an increase in engagement. CONCLUSION Wellbeing initiatives can be a targeted strategy to help alleviate burnout amongst healthcare professionals and build a mutually beneficial relationship between management and employees. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE This study shows how implementing a staff wellbeing initiative increases workplace engagement, which benefits both the individual and the organisation.","output":"Caring for the carers in a public health district: A wellbeing initiative to support healthcare professionals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myocarditis is a rare complication of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. We previously reported a case series of 15 adolescents with vaccine-associated myocarditis, 87% of whom had abnormalities on initial cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), including late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in 80%. We performed follow-up CMRs to determine the trajectory of myocardial recovery and better understand the natural history of vaccine-associated myocarditis. Case series of patients age < 19 years admitted to Boston Childrens Hospital with acute vaccine-associated myocarditis following the BNT162b2 vaccine who had abnormal CMR at the time of initial presentation, and underwent follow-up testing. CMR assessment included left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, T2-weighted myocardial imaging, LV global native T1, LV global T2, extracellular volume (ECV), and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Ten patients (9 male, median age 15 years) with vaccine-associated myocarditis underwent follow-up CMR at a median of 92 days (range 76C119) after hospital discharge. LGE was persistent in 80% of patients, though improved from prior in all cases. Two patients (20%) had abnormal LV global T1 at presentation, which normalized on follow-up. ECV decreased between acute presentation and follow-up in 6/10 patients; it remained elevated at follow-up in 1 patient and borderline in 3 patients. Conclusion: CMR performed ~3 months after admission for COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis showed improvement of LGE in all patients, but persistent in the majority.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, health systems rapidly expanded telemedicine services for urgent and nonurgent healthcare delivery, even in urban settings. The New York University health system implemented a prompt systemwide expansion of video-enabled telemedicine visits, increasing telemedicine to >8000 visits daily within 6 weeks of the beginning of the pandemic. There are limited studies that explore patient and provider satisfaction of telemedicine visits in obstetrical patients during the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly in the United States. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate both the patients and the providers satisfaction with the administration of maternal-fetal medicine services through telemedicine and to identify the factors that drive the patients desire for future obstetrical telemedicine services. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was administered to patients who completed a telemedicine video visit with the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at the New York University Langone HospitalLong Island from March 19, 2020, to May 26, 2020. A 10-question survey assessing the patients digital experience and desire for future use was either administered by telephone or self-administered by the patients via a link after obtaining verbal consent. The survey responses were scored from 1strongly disagree to 5strongly agree. We analyzed the demographics and survey responses of the patients who agreed to vs those who answered neutral or disagree to the question I would like telehealth to be an option for future obstetric visits. The providers also answered a similar 10-question survey. The median scores were compared using appropriate tests. A P value of <.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 253 patients participated in 433 telemedicine visits, and 165 patients completed the survey, resulting in a 65% survey response rate. Overall, there were high rates of patient satisfaction in all areas assessed. Those who desired future telemedicine had significantly greater agreeability that they were able to see and hear their provider easily (5 [4.5, 5] vs 5 [4, 5]; P=.014) and that the lack of physical activity was not an issue (5 [4, 5] vs 5 [4, 5]; P=.032). They were also more likely to agree that the telemedicine visits were as good as in-person visits (4 [3, 5] vs 3 [2, 3]; P<.001) and that telehealth made it easier for them to see doctors or specialists (5 [4, 5] vs 3 [2, 3]; P<.001). The patients seeking consults for poor obstetrical history were more likely to desire future telemedicine compared with other visit types (19 (90%) vs 2 (10%); P=.05). Provider survey responses also demonstrated high levels of satisfaction, with 83% agreeing that they would like telemedicine to be an option for future obstetrical visits. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that maternal-fetal medicine obstetrical patients and providers were highly satisfied with the implementation of telemedicine during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and a majority of them desire telemedicine as an option for future visits. A patient's desire for future telemedicine visits was significantly affected by their digital experience, the perception of a lack of need for physical contact, perceived time saved on travel, and access to healthcare providers. Health systems need to continue to improve healthcare delivery and invest in innovative solutions to conduct physical examinations remotely.","output":"Application of telemedicine video visits in a maternal-fetal medicine practice at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A substantial proportion of atrial fibrillation patients initiating direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are vitamin K antagonists (VKA)-experienced, e.g., switchers from VKA to DOAC. With this study, we aimed to summarize available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of DOAC vs. VKA in real-life VKA-experienced atrial fibrillation patients. We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library systematically for English-language studies indexed any time before October 2018. We included studies of VKA-experienced atrial fibrillation patients initiating DOAC therapy, with continued VKA therapy as comparator. Outcomes included arterial thromboembolism and bleeding. When appropriate, meta-analysis was performed by calculating pooled, weighted, adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Eight cohort studies comparing VKA-experienced DOAC (dabigatran or rivaroxaban) users with continued VKA users were included. When comparing DOAC to VKA, an increased risk of ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction was found for dabigatran (pooled aHR of 1.61 (95% CI 1.19-2.19, I2 =65%) and 1.29 (95% CI 1.10-1.52, I2 =0%)), respectively), but not for rivaroxaban. Use of dabigatran in VKA-experienced users was associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (pooled aHR 1.63 (95% CI 1.36-1.94, I2 =30%)), but a decreased risk of intracranial bleeding (pooled aHR 0.45 (95% CI 0.32-0.64, I2 =0%)). In conclusion, use of dabigatran in prior VKA users in clinical practice was associated with a slightly increased risk of arterial thromboembolism and gastrointestinal bleeding, but a decreased risk of intracranial bleeding. Importantly, observational studies of real-life VKA-experienced oral anticoagulant users may be confounded by the reason for switching. This article is protected by copyright.

We describe neurological manifestations in an international cohort of hospitalized pediatric patients.Methods: This is a multi-national observational study involving tertiary healthcare institutions in Canada, Costa Rica and Iran. We included patients 1 day-18 years admitted for any medical reason February 1, 2020-January 31, 2021 with laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR or serological testing. Descriptive analyses and logistic regression were performed where appropriate using JASP version 0?13.Findings: 298 hospitalized children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age 3?9 years [IQR 0?6-10?1]) from Canada (n=152), Costa Rica (n=115) and Iran (n=31) were included. Fifty-one (17%) had neurological manifestations, of which headache (73%), seizures (23%) and altered mental status (6%) were most frequently seen. Children with neurological symptoms had equivalent rates of comorbidities overall but were more likely to have underlying chronic neurological conditions. Additionally, those with neurological symptoms were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (15/51 [29%] vs. 32/247 [13%];p =0?0033) and had longer length of hospital stay (6 days [IQR 3-8] vs. 4 days [IQR 2-7];p =0?0060). Abnormalities were found in all children with neurological manifestations who received neuroimaging (n=6). Neurological manifestations were seen in 19% of the Iranian cohort, 23% of the Costa Rican cohort, and 12% of the Canadian cohort. Country of residence Costa Rica (adjusted OR: 2?520, 95% CI: 1?325-4?791, p =0?005), ICU admission (adjusted OR: 2?678, 95% CI: 1?307-5?486, p =0?007) and number of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms (adjusted OR: 1?355, 95% CI: 1?232-1?491, p <0?0001) were independently associated with neurological manifestations using multivariate analysis.Interpretation: We show that children with underlying comorbidities, especially underlying neurological diagnoses, are more likely to develop neurological complications of SARS CoV-2, and that sociodemographic factors, such as country of residence associate with varying rates of neurological manifestations.

Representation learning using deep neural networks has achieved promising performance compared with traditional machine learning methods; hence, extensive research efforts have been made in learning the feature representation of proteins and compounds. However, such feature representation learning relies on a large-scale labelled dataset, which is not always available. RESULTS: We present an end-to-end deep learning framework, ELECTRA-DTA, to predict the binding affinity of drug-target pairs. This framework incorporates an unsupervised learning mechanism to train two ELECTRA-based contextual embedding models, one for protein amino acids and the other for compound SMILES string encoding. In addition, ELECTRA-DTA leverages a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) convolutional neural network block stacked over three fully connected layers to further capture the sequential and spatial features of the protein sequence and SMILES for the DTA regression task. Experimental evaluations show that ELECTRA-DTA outperforms various state-of-the-art DTA prediction models, especially with the challenging, interaction-sparse BindingDB dataset. In target selection and drug repurposing for COVID-19, ELECTRA-DTA also offers competitive performance, suggesting its potential in speeding drug discovery and generalizability for other compound- or protein-related computational tasks.

Each participant completed a videofluoroscopic swallow study while receiving airflow via HFNC across a control condition of zero flow and conditions of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 L/min. Five raters rated dLVC and PAS scores. Laryngeal vestibule closure was complete on all swallows. Linear regression revealed that the amount of airflow via HFNC significantly influenced dLVC, F(1, 810) = 19.056, p < .001. The mode of airway invasion for each airflow condition was PAS 2, with > 80% frequency compared to other PAS scores. Aspiration (PAS 7 or 8) did not occur. A Fisher's Exact test determined there was no association between normal/abnormal PAS score and no airflow/HFNC (p = .610). Findings indicate that for healthy adults, airflow via HFNC influenced dLVC in a dose-dependent manner with no change in airway invasion. The influence of HFNC on dLVC was a positive relationship, meaning when airflow increased, dLVC increased, and when airflow decreased, dLVC decreased. Modulation of dLVC in response to the amount of airflow highlights the ability of healthy adults to adapt to swallow conditions as needed to protect the airway.","output":"The Influence of Airflow Via High-Flow Nasal Cannula on Duration of Laryngeal Vestibule Closure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evidence of racial health disparities is profound.

Although COVID-19 is a new disease, the reason for the health disparity is the same as in maternal morbidity and mortality: implicit bias and structural racism. Implicit bias among health care professionals leads to disparities in how health care is delivered. Generations of structural racism perpetuated through racial residential segregation, economic suppression, and health care inequality have normalized the poorer health outcomes for Black Americans. It is easy to dismiss these issues as someone else's problem, because health care professionals often fail to acknowledge the effect of implicit bias in their own practices.

The corresponding common targets of the five FUs were all significantly enriched in Go Ontology (oxidoreductase activity, lipid metabolic process, homeostatic process, etc.), KEGG pathways (steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway, etc.), TTD diseases (chronic inflammatory diseases, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary Disease, etc.), miRNA (MIR183), kinase (CDK7) and TF (LXR). QFPD contained 257 specific targets in addition to HCoV, pneumonia and ACE2 co-expression proteins. Then, network topology analysis of the five components-target-pathway-disease networks yielded 67 active ingredients. In addition, ADMET estimations showed that 20 compounds passed the stringent lead-like criteria and in silico drug-likeness test with high gastrointestinal absorption and the median lethal dose (LD50 > 1600 mg/kg).

We previously established a clustering method termed BLSOM (batch-learning self-organizing map) that does not depend on sequence alignment and can characterize and compare even 1 million genomic sequences in one run. Strategies for comparing a vast number of genomic sequences simultaneously become increasingly important in genome studies because of remarkable progresses in nucleotide sequencing. In this study, we have constructed BLSOMs based on the oligonucleotide and codon composition of all influenza A viral strains available. Without prior information with regard to their hosts, sequences derived from strains isolated from avian or human sources were successfully clustered according to the hosts.

Description of the problem Implantation of SOC services regionalized and integrated in a healthcare network coordinated by Primary Care (PC) seems to be a potential strategy to restore balance between demand and supply by SOC. The Health Care Planning (HCP) method, proposes a population-based management SOC model with horizontal and collaborative relation between SOC and PC, different from the conventional model focused on medical specialties. Thus, SOC assumes three functions besides assistance: educational, research and supervisory. In 2018, the PlanificaSUS project started the implantation of this model in 25 regions of 19 Brazilian states. Each region chose one SOC service and one priority line of care, based on local epidemiological indicators. Workshops and tutoring activities were conducted and SOC teams were trained based on the continuous care cycle, in an inter-professional and collaborative way. Results Priority lines of care were chosen as follows: maternal and child (n = 17);elderly health (n = 1);mental health (n = 1);and hypertension and diabetes (n = 6). Each SOC service mapped PC services in region, defined evidence-based clinical guidelines in the healthcare network and organized SOC portfolio, composed of multi-professional team, equipment and physical structure. Team training was concluded in 19 SOC services, in which educational function was introduced with PC through a risk stratification course. This course was based on common clinical guideline between PC and SOC, contributing to shared and resolutive care. Lessons The proposed model for SOC organization could be a potential strategy to integrate SOC with PC in different settings, in spite of important challenges, such as: covid-19 pandemic, necessity local health managers' protagonism and politics to support SOC integration in healthcare network.

This downside has recently become a motivation for the research community to pursue the ideas of hybrid approaches, resulting in novel hybrid systems classified as deep neuro-fuzzy systems (DNFS). Studies regarding the implementation of DNFS have rapidly increased in the domains of computing, healthcare, transportation, and finance with high interpretability and reasonable accuracy. However, relatively few survey studies have been found in the literature to provide a comprehensive insight into this domain. Therefore, this study aims to perform a systematic review to evaluate the current progress, trends, arising issues, research gaps, challenges, and future scope related to DNFS studies. A study mapping process was prepared to guide a systematic search for publications related to DNFS published between 2015 and 2020 using five established scientific directories. As a result, a total of 105 studies were identified and critically analyzed to address research questions with the objectives: (i) to understand the concept of DNFS; (ii) to find out DNFS optimization methods; (iii) to visualize the intensity of work carried out in DNFS domain; and (iv) to highlight DNFS application subjects and domains. We believe that this study provides up-to-date guidance for future research in the DNFS domain, allowing for more effective advancement in techniques and processes. The analysis made in this review proves that DNFS-based research is actively growing with a substantial implementation and application scope in the future.","output":"Deep Neuro-Fuzzy System application trends, challenges, and future perspectives: a systematic survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite widespread concern regarding cytokine storms leading to severe morbidity in COVID-19, rapid cytokine assays are not routinely available for monitoring critically ill patients.

The platform comprises two low-cost modules: (i) a semi-automated fluidic dispensing/mixing module that can be operated inside a biosafety cabinet to minimize the exposure of the technician to the virus infection and (ii) a 12-12-15 inch compact fluorescence optical scanner for the potential near-bedside readout. The platform enabled daily cytokine analysis in clinical practice with high sensitivity (<0.4 pg mL-1), inter-assay repeatability (a??10% CV), and rapid operation providing feedback on the progress of therapy within 4 hours. This test allowed us to perform serial monitoring of two critically ill patients with respiratory failure and to support immunomodulatory therapy using the selective cytopheretic device (SCD).

To address the shortage of psychiatrists (and nurse practitioners and physician assistants) in emergency settings (ESs), the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry (AAEP) has established recommendations for utilizing nonprescribing mental health professionals in the evaluation and management of psychiatric patients in these contexts. METHODS Faced with limited research on the roles and competencies of nonprescribing psychiatric emergency clinicians (PECs), a multidisciplinary committee of members of AAEP was tasked with developing recommendations for use of PECs. RESULTS The committee developed eight recommendations regarding the role of PECs in evaluation and management of patients who present to ESs with behavioral emergencies. PECs should have the following competencies: conducting independent psychiatric and substance abuse evaluations; managing behavioral emergencies; aiding in the recognition of confounding medical illnesses, intoxication and withdrawal states, and adverse drug reactions; developing appropriate treatment plans; recognizing when consultation from a psychiatrist or emergency physician is indicated; possessing self-awareness and recognizing clinician-patient dynamics; understanding medicolegal issues, such as involuntary holds and decision-making capacity; and collaborating with clinical teams in ESs. PECs are not meant to replace psychiatrists but to extend the psychiatrist's reach. Use of PECs has already been implemented in some areas of the country. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of the AAEP recommendations, ESs can address staffing shortages while ensuring safe management of patients with behavioral emergencies.

Their wide use, though, is known to contribute to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Aiming at evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the distribution and characteristics of bacterial infections, and on the frequency of antimicrobial resistance, we investigated the microbial strains identified through laboratory tests on clinical specimens from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients accessing an Italian tertiary hospital over nearly one year. We highlighted that COVID+ patients bore a significantly higher number of bacterial species. Eight out of the 100 species identified were isolated exclusively from COVID+ and most of them are known to establish infections only in immunocompromised patients. Resistance to every tested antibiotic was seen in 8.3% of the isolates with a correlation with the positivity to COVID, but neither all COVID+ or COVID? isolates showed characteristic responses to the tested antibiotics. The predicted increase of antibiotic resistance is not observable yet, but the higher frequency of multi-resistant COVID+ isolates suggests that it is actually occurring, further calling for the definition of alternative treatments of COVID-19 infections. ABSTRACT: The global onset of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus infections happened suddenly, hence imposing a rapid definition of effective therapeutic approaches. Antibiotics were included among the prophylactic agents because of both the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and atypical pneumonia symptoms, and the immune-modulating and anti-inflammatory properties of such drugs. Although, this approach could exacerbate the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the spread and characteristics of bacterial infections, as well as on the frequency of antimicrobial resistance, we investigated and compared clinical bacterial strains isolated in an Italian hospital from COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients during and before the COVID-19 outbreak. Data clearly indicate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bacterial infections: not only some bacterial species were found in either COVID-19 positive or in COVID-19 negative patients, but isolates from COVID-19 patients also showed higher levels of antimicrobial resistance. Nevertheless, despite some bacterial species were isolated only before or over the pandemic, no differences were observed among the antimicrobial resistance levels. Overall, these results recapitulate the current situation of microbial infections and could also provide an overview of the impact of COVID-19 on bacterial pathogens spread and resistance.","output":"Profile of Bacterial Infections in COVID-19 Patients: Antimicrobial Resistance in the Time of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this online workshop is to familiarize biomedical faculties students with the principle of RT-PCR method.

Outlines of the torso in the frontal and anteroposterior planes were calculated from photographic images to determine continuous form gradients (m/m) for the anterior, posterior and lateral aspects of the torso. Torso cross-sectional areas at each vertical sample (0.001 m) were used to calculate maximal rate of change in cross-sectional area (m2/m) in the chest-waist and waist-hip segments. During the non-propulsive hand phase in middle-long distance front crawl, kicking propulsion is negligible and therefore the net force is equal to the drag. Drag coefficients were calculated at the instant of maximum horizontal deceleration of centre of mass during the non-propulsive hand phase of 400 m pace front crawl. Maximal rate of change in cross-sectional area (r = 0.44, p = 0.014) and posterior form gradient (r = 0.50, p = 0.006) of the waist-hip torso segment had moderate positive correlations with the maximal drag coefficient.

While a previous study demonstrated that health and eHealth literacy are related to COVID-19 prevention behaviors, few studies have focused on the relationship between health literacy, eHealth literacy, and COVID-19-related health behaviors. The latter includes not only preventative behaviors but also conventional health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop and verify a COVID-19-related health behavior questionnaire, explore its status and structure, and examine the associations between these behaviors and participants' health literacy and eHealth literacy. METHODS: A snowball sampling method was adopted to recruit participants to complete anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire surveys online that assessed sociodemographic information, self-reported coronavirus knowledge, health literacy, eHealth literacy, and COVID-19-related health behaviors. RESULTS: Of 1873 college students who were recruited, 781 (41.7%) had adequate health literacy; the mean eHealth literacy score was 30.16 (SD 6.31). The COVID-19-related health behavior questionnaire presented a two-factor structure-COVID-19-specific precautionary behaviors and conventional health behaviors-with satisfactory fit indices and internal consistency (Cronbach &#945;=.79). The mean score of COVID-19-related health behaviors was 53.77 (SD 8.03), and scores differed significantly (P<.05) with respect to residence, college year, academic major, family economic level, self-reported health status, having a family member or friend infected with coronavirus, and health literacy level. Linear regression analysis showed that health literacy and eHealth literacy were positively associated with COVID-19-specific precautionary behaviors (?health literacy=.149, ?eHealth literacy=.368; P<.001) and conventional health behaviors (?health literacy=.219, ?eHealth literacy=.277; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19-related health behavior questionnaire was a valid and reliable measure for assessing health behaviors during the pandemic. College students with higher health literacy and eHealth literacy can more actively adopt COVID-19-related health behaviors. Additionally, compared to health literacy, eHealth literacy is more closely related to COVID-19-related health behaviors. Public intervention measures based on health and eHealth literacy are required to promote COVID-19-related health behaviors during the pandemic, which may be helpful to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection among college students.","output":"Associations Between Health Literacy, eHealth Literacy, and COVID-19-Related Health Behaviors Among Chinese College Students: Cross-sectional Online Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: Our objective was to determine the ventricular arrhythmia burden in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) patients during COVID-19 Methods and results: In this multicentre, observational, cohort study over a 100-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA, we assessed ventricular arrhythmias in ICD patients from 20 centres in 13 states, via remote monitoring Comparison was via a 100-day control period (late 2019) and seasonal control period (early 2019) The primary outcome was the impact of COVID-19 on ventricular arrhythmia burden The secondary outcome was correlation with COVID-19 incidence During the COVID-19 period, 5963 ICD patients underwent remote monitoring, with 16 942 episodes of treated ventricular arrhythmias (2 8 events per 100 patient-days) Ventricular arrhythmia burden progressively declined during COVID-19 (P &lt; 0 001) The proportion of patients with ventricular arrhythmias amongst the high COVID-19 incidence states was significantly reduced compared with those in low incidence states [odds ratio 0 61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0 54-0 69, P &lt; 0 001] Comparing patients remotely monitored during both COVID-19 and control periods (n = 2458), significantly fewer ventricular arrhythmias occurred during COVID-19 [incident rate ratio (IRR) 0 68, 95% CI 0 58-0 79, P &lt; 0 001] This difference persisted when comparing the 1719 patients monitored during both the COVID-19 and seasonal control periods (IRR 0 69, 95% CI 0 56-0 85, P &lt; 0 001) Conclusions: During COVID-19, there was a 32% reduction in ventricular arrhythmias needing device therapies, coinciding with measures of social isolation There was a 39% reduction in the proportion of patients with ventricular arrhythmias in states with higher COVID-19 incidence These findings highlight the potential role of real-life stressors in ventricular arrhythmia burden in individuals with ICDs","output":"Ventricular arrhythmia burden during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Results suggest that the main motivations perceived to drive food intake were familiarity and liking. Two clusters were identified, based on food intake frequency, which were classified as healthier and unhealthier. The former was constituted by individuals with higher scholarity level, to whom intake was more motivated by health, natural concerns, and weight control, and less by liking, pleasure or affect regulation. The second cluster was constituted by individuals with a higher proportion of male and intake more influenced by affect-related motivations. During this period, a generalized lower concern with the convenience attributes of foods was noted (namely, choice of processed products and fast-food meals), alongside an increase in time and efforts dedicated to home cooking.

Parental CT26 colon cancer cells and CT26/PD-L1 cells engineered to stably overexpress PD-L1 underwent binding assays, flow cytometry, and Western blotting. In vivo pharmacokinetics was evaluated and tumor-bearing mice underwent biodistribution and PET studies after 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG injection. Results: 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG synthesis was straightforward and efficient. SDS PAGE showed that reduction with TCEP produced half-antibody fragments and MALDI-TOF analysis estimated 2.18 DFOs conjugated per antibody, indicting site-specific conjugation at the hinge region disulfide bonds. High expressing CT26/PD-L1 cells showed 102.2  6.7-fold greater 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG binding compared to weak expressing CT26 cells. Excellent target specificity was confirmed by a drastic reduction of CT26/PD-L1 cell binding to 3.0  0.8% by excess cold antibody. Intravenous 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG followed bi-exponential blood clearance. Tissue activity assessed by PET/CT demonstrated decreases in major organ activity over 7 days, whereas high CT26/PD-L1 tumor activity was maintained.

The study was conducted at a large Canadian health centre (1,133 beds) from 28 March to 30 June 2020. We included patients in the cohort review who were 18 yr of age, whose chart showed that the AMT was activated, and whose airway was managed outside the operating room. We reviewed both electronic medical records and paper chart documentation. Outcomes included intubation success, number of intubation attempts, intubation time, team response time, patient contact time, intubation complications, and breaches of personal protective equipment (PPE) protocol. The physicians survey evaluated the relevance, performance, reasonableness, and clinical utility of the AMT. RESULTS: The AMT intubated 231 patients. Charts showed that 91% of intubations were accomplished on first attempt. The mean (standard deviation) intubation time was 2.1 (0.2) min. The complication rate was minimal. The incidence of breaching PPE protocol items was less than 6%. No AMT members reported COVID-19 symptoms. The response rate for the physicians survey was 36%. The consensus among the participants was that the AMT had considerable clinical utility during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: An AMT assembled during the COVID-19 pandemic showed high competency and effectiveness, and had favourable impact on the main responsible physicians who activated the team.","output":"Performance and impact of an airway management team launched during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Faecal Immunochemical tests (FITs) in the assessment of patients presenting with symptoms have generally used a single sample. Little evidence pertains to the use of replicate, where a number of tests are done prior to decision-making or repeat FIT, where additional FIT are performed following clinical decision-making. Overwhelmingly, research has focussed on FIT to help identify colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this review is to assess the available literature concerning replicate and repeat FIT in symptomatic patients to help generate consensus and guide future research. METHODS: The terms 'faecal immunochemical test' or 'FIT' were combined with 'multiple' or 'repeat'. EMBASE, Medline and PubMed database and other searches were conducted. All papers published in English were included with no exclusion date limits until November 2021. RESULTS: Of the 161 initial papers screened, seven were included for review. Qualitative and quantitative FIT outcomes were assessed in the studies. The primary aims of most related to whether replicate FIT increased diagnostic yield of CRC, with colonoscopy used as the reference standard. One publication assessed the impact of a new COVID-adapted pathway on CRC detection. No consensus on replicate FIT was apparent. Some concluded that FITs may help minimise missed CRC diagnoses: others showed no increase in diagnostic yield of CRC. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence on replicate and repeat FIT is both minimal and conflicting. FIT is a superb clinical tool, but significant gaps surrounding application remain. Further studies relating to replicate and repeat FIT are required.","output":"Replicate and repeat faecal immunochemical tests in symptomatic patients: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY In 1984, children presented to the emergency department of a hospital in the small town of Promiss?o, S?o Paulo State, Brazil, with an acute febrile illness that rapidly progressed to death. Local clinicians and public health officials recognized that these children had an unusual illness, which led to outbreak investigations conducted by Brazilian health officials in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The studies that followed are an excellent example of the coordinated and parallel studies that are used to investigate outbreaks of a new disease, which became known as Brazilian purpuric fever (BPF). In the first outbreak investigation, a case-control study confirmed an association between BPF and antecedent conjunctivitis but the etiology of the disease could not be determined. In a subsequent outbreak, children with BPF were found to have bacteremia caused by Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius (H. aegyptius), an organism previously known mainly to cause self-limited purulent conjunctivitis. Molecular characterization of blood and other isolates demonstrated the clonal nature of the H. aegyptius strains that caused BPF, which were genetically distant from the diverse strains that cause only conjunctivitis. This led to an intense effort to identify the factors causing the unusual invasiveness of the BPF clone, which has yet to definitively identify the virulence factor or factors involved. After a series of outbreaks and sporadic cases through 1993, no additional cases of BPF have been reported.","output":"Emergence and disappearance of a virulent clone of Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius, cause of Brazilian purpuric fever."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Key steps of viral replication take place at host cell membranes, but the detection of membrane-associated protein-protein interactions using standard affinity-based approaches (e.g. immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, IP-MS) is challenging.

The aim of the current service evaluation was to examine the effectiveness of brief lifestyle interventions on glucose tolerance in people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In this pragmatic service evaluation clinical data on people deemed at risk of developing type 2 diabetes were evaluated from two GP clusters. Patients (n = 1207) received a single 15 to 30-min, face-to-face, consultation with a health care practitioner. Interventions were assessed by changes in HbA1c and distribution across the HbA1c ranges 12 months following intervention. Statistical significance of reversion to normoglycaemia and development of diabetes were assessed through comparison with expected rates without intervention. RESULTS: Between baseline and 12-month follow-up HbA1c fell from 43.85  1.57 mmol/mol (6.16  0.14%) to 41.63  3.84 mmol/mol (5.96  0.35%), a decrease of 2.22 mmol/mol (0.20%) (95% CI 2.01 (0.18%), 2.42 (0.22%); p < 0.0001).

METHODS: Coagulation results, medications, and outcomes of consecutive patients being classified as having severe COVID-19 in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The 28-day mortality between heparin users and nonusers were compared, as was a different risk of coagulopathy, which was stratified by the sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score or D-dimer result. RESULTS: There were 449 patients with severe COVID-19 enrolled into the study, 99 of them received heparin (mainly with low molecular weight heparin) for 7 days or longer. D-dimer, prothrombin time, and age were positively, and platelet count was negatively, correlated with 28-day mortality in multivariate analysis. No difference in 28-day mortality was found between heparin users and nonusers (30.3% vs 29.7%, P = .910).

They include transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and the human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), many of which seriously endanger human health and well-being. Only alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses harbor nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), which performs multiple functions in inhibiting antiviral host responses. The role of the C terminus of betacoronavirus nsp1 in virulence has been characterized, but the location of the alphacoronavirus nsp1 region that is important for virulence remains unclear. Here, using TGEV nsp1 as a model to explore the function of this protein in alphacoronaviruses, we demonstrate that alphacoronavirus nsp1 inhibits host gene expression. Solving the crystal structure of full-length TGEV at 1.85-? resolution and conducting several biochemical analyses, we observed that a specific motif (amino acids 91C95) of alphacoronavirus nsp1 is a conserved region that inhibits host protein synthesis. Using a reverse-genetics system based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology to construct a recombinant TGEV in which this specific nsp1 motif was altered, we found that this mutation does not affect virus replication in cell culture but significantly reduces TGEV pathogenicity in pigs. Taken together, our findings suggest that alphacoronavirus nsp1 is an essential virulence determinant, providing a potential paradigm for the development of a new attenuated vaccine based on modified nsp1.","output":"A conserved region of nonstructural protein 1 from alphacoronaviruses inhibits host gene expression and is critical for viral virulence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Determining the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in health care workers (HCWs) based on risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients.

The aim of our retrospective study was to report on the outcomes of cancer patients receiving radical surgery with curative intent during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from two cancer centres that were at the epicentre of the outbreak from March to September 2020 (as well as a comparator group in 2019) were utilised for this study. We observed that while there was a decline in number of surgeries performed, the implemented COVID-19 minimal pathways were safe for cancer patients requiring surgical treatment. ABSTRACT: The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a large effect on the management of cancer patients. This study reports on the approach and outcomes of cancer patients receiving radical surgery with curative intent between March and September 2020 (in comparison to 2019) in the European Institute of Oncology, IRCCS (IEO) in Milan and the South East London Cancer Alliance (SELCA). Both institutions implemented a COVID-19 minimal pathway where patients were required to self-isolate prior to admission and were swabbed for COVID-19 within 72 h of surgery. Positive patients had surgery deferred until a negative swab. At IEO, radical surgeries declined by 6% as compared to the same period in 2019 (n = 1477 vs. 1560, respectively). Readmissions were required for 3% (n = 41), and <1% (n = 9) developed COVID-19, of which only one had severe disease and died. At SELCA, radical surgeries declined by 34% (n = 1553 vs. 2336). Readmissions were required for 11% (n = 36), <1% (n = 7) developed COVID-19, and none died from it. Whilst a decline in number of surgeries was observed in both centres, the implemented COVID-19 minimal pathways have shown to be safe for cancer patients requiring radical treatment, with limited complications and almost no COVID-19 infections.","output":"Continuity of Cancer Care: The Surgical Experience of Two Large Cancer Hubs in London and Milan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Landmark discoveries in cancer research improve clinical therapies.

Methods: A multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted across all comprehensive thalassemia centers in Iran, from January to June 15th, 2020. RESULTS: Forty-three confirmed COVID-19 thalassemia patients (32 TDT, and 11 NTDT) were detected. The mean age of patients was 35.3  11.5 years (range 9 - 67); 21 females and 22 males. Overall, 78.1% of TDT and 90.9% of NTDT patients were complicated with at least one comorbidity (P: 0.656). The overall mortality rate of thalassemia patients with COVID-19 was 18.6% while 27.3% was in NTDT patients compared to 15.6% in TDT patients (P:0.401). The dead group had a non-significant higher frequency of endocrinopathies compared to the recovered group (62.5% versus 45.7% P:0.457). Ten female thalassemia patients with positive COVID-19 had hypogonadism, six patients were receiving hormone replacement therapy and all of them recovered (zero death) compared to two deaths from 4 patients who were not receiving hormone replacement therapy (P:0.133). Furthermore, the prevalence of COVID-19 in NTDT patients was significantly higher than the general population (45 per 10,000 versus 22.29 per 10,000 respectively, P:0.018) while the prevalence of TDT was almost similar to the normal population (P:0.539).

However, it suffers from limitations including the need of good image quality and of dedicated software with inter-vendor variability. We hypothesized that RV free wall longitudinal fractional shortening (LFS) could be used as a substitute to RVS, without suffering from the aforementioned limitations. Methods: We aimed to establish in a series of non-selected consecutive patients in sinus rhythm the value of LFS, calculated as [-(TAPSE/RVdiastolic length)] and of several common echocardiographic and Doppler parameters to predict an abnormal RV function, defined as RVS > ? 20.2%. Results: Among 144 consecutive patients, poor image quality precluded the assessment of RVS and of LFS in 31 and 4 patients, respectively (P = 0.0018), resulting in a final study group of 113 patients. The intraclass correlation coefficients for inter- and intra-observer variability were 0.97 (95% CI 0.92; 0.98) and 0.93 (CI 0.92; 0.98) for LFS and RVS, respectively. Among all tested RV function indices, LFS best correlated with RVS (R 0.97, 95% CI 0.81; 0.91). BlandCAltman analysis for the comparison between LFS and RVS showed no systematic bias. The area under the ROC-curve of the various RV function indices to detect abnormal RVS was best for LFS (0.97, 95% CI 0.94C1), with sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value of 83%, 96%, 96%, and 83%, respectively. Conclusion: LFS performs reasonably well to predict abnormal RVS and is more often feasible than RVS.","output":"Right ventricular longitudinal fractional shortening: a substitute to right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol and other drug nurses providing treatment for individuals presenting with problematic alcohol and other drug use. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has caused disruption to contemporary health service delivery, including alcohol and other drug treatment. Provisional research on drug and alcohol consumption patterns shows changes attributable to the pandemic, with implications for service delivery. Research also indicates the impact of the pandemic on healthcare staff is significant, leading to workforce challenges that threaten care provision. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study design. METHODS: Data were collected using semi-structured, individual telephone interviews with practising alcohol and other drug nurses from Australia and New Zealand (n = 19). COREQ reporting guidelines were used. RESULTS: After thematic analysis, three key themes emerged: 'No room at the inn: Changes to service delivery due to COVID-19', 'We are providing care to a very vulnerable group of people: Consumer factors during COVID-19' and 'Personally, we were very, very stressed: Workforce factors due to COVID-19'. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study indicate that the impact of the pandemic was felt by alcohol and other drug nurses, services and healthcare consumers alike. The experiences of alcohol and other drug nurses through the COVID-19 pandemic need further exploration both to ensure workforce sustainability and that disruptions to alcohol and other drug services do not occur in future outbreaks of communicable disease. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: COVID-19 has had a profound effect on nurses in all settings, and these effects are likely to be felt for some time after the pandemic: nursing specialties require support to ensure ongoing workforce sustainability and well-being of nursing staff. All nurses need to be aware of changes to alcohol and other drug use during the pandemic and screen healthcare consumers accordingly.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on alcohol and other drug nurses' provision of care: A qualitative descriptive study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Research shows promise for the use of mobile health interventions to improve access to care for mothers and infants.

There is an irrefutable need for better treatments with higher acceptability and efficacy. The treatment efficacy is influenced by many factors, including bioavailability. Hence, a straightforward strategy to improve vivax malaria treatment efficacy is the deployment of good quality formulations of primaquine and chloroquine. As these treatments were developed more than 70 years ago, many of the available data on blood levels of both drugs are based on obsolete analytical methodologies or pharmaceutical formulations, which are not available anymore. Herein, the results of three bioequivalence studies are presented, providing individual pharmacokinetic data on chloroquine and primaquine of more than a hundred healthy volunteers and using up-to-date analytical methods. Methods Three trials were designed as a single centre, randomized, single dose, open label, fasting, crossover bioequivalence studies comparing a new coated chloroquine tablet to the uncoated tablet, and 5 and 15 mg primaquine formulations to either an international reference product or the currently distributed tablets. Plasma concentrations of chloroquine and primaquine were measured using a validated HPLCCMS/MS method in accordance with current international regulatory requirements for bio-analytical methods. Results In total, a hundred eleven healthy volunteers of both genders were included in the three studies (n = 32;30 and 56 respectively). No serious adverse events occurred. Drugs levels were measured in 5,520 blood samples. The estimated ratio of the geometric means of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf of test and reference drugs and their 90% CI for chloroquine 150 mg, primaquine 15 mg and primaquine 5 mg were: 95.33% (89.18;101.90), 86. 85% (82.61;91.31), and 84.45% (76.95;92.67);93.28% (81.76;106.41), 94.52% (86.13;103.73) and 93.93% (85.83;102.79);97.44% (90.60;104.78), 93.70% (87.04;100.87) and 91.36% (85.27;97.89), respectively. As Cmax and AUC0-t 90% CI were within the acceptance interval of 80C125% in all cases, the formulations tested were bioequivalent. Conclusions In conclusion, the three studies provided detailed chloroquine and primaquine pharmacokinetic data in accordance with current regulatory standards. Together with other open data initiatives, this individual data may increase the accuracy of pharmacokinetic models guiding best dose, new combinations, regimens and formulations to optimize the current chloroquine and primaquine treatments for vivax malaria. The data presented here may support the deployment of high-quality drugs and evidence-based public health policies.

We conducted a study highlighting salient features of CT chest in patients with COVID-19 in a tertiary care center in Karachi, Pakistan. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study done at Aga khan university from April 2020 to December 2020. Adult patients who had a positive COVID-19 PCR and underwent CT scan chest were included in the study. Five hundred and eighteen patients who underwent CT scan chest were selected for screening. One hundred and twelve patients who were positive for COVID-19 PCR were selected for review. Two patients were later excluded as they had chronic changes on CT scan due to underlying comorbidities. RESULTS: Among the study cohort of 110 patients, 70 (63.7 %) were males and 40 (36.4 %) were females with a mean age of 56.5  14.8 years (range 46-67 years). Out of 110 patients, 79 underwent high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan and 31 underwent contrast-enhanced CT chest. The most common abnormality seen on CT was ground-glass opacities (79%), followed by consolidation (62%), crazy paving pattern (32%), vascular enlargement sign (27%) and fibrotic-like features or reticulations (21%). Furthermore, air bronchogram sign was seen in 21%, pleural effusion was seen in 8% and lymphadenopathy in 7% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: CT scan chest is a key tool of investigation in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Studies from across the world have identified specific CT scan patterns that can aid in the diagnosis of the disease. This is a study from a low to middle-income country that describes the spectrum of radiological features found in COVID-19 and has also focused on certain atypical features associated with COVID-19. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Certain radiological features like ground-glass opacities and consolidation are a known features of COVID-19. This study emphasizes on the most frequent radiological features of COVID seen in a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. Chest CT imaging has a high negative predictive value and high sensitivity for diagnosing COVID-19 and can be considered as an alternative primary screening tool for COVID-19 in epidemic areas. Moreover, a negative RT-PCR test and a positive CT chest finding can suggest COVID-19.

However, a large percentage of them do not seek help if this complaint occurs. We performed this study to gain more insight into the reasons why female athletes do not seek help when experiencing amenorrhea and how care for these women could be improved. METHOD: Qualitative focus group research. Female athletes were approached to take part in a focus group. They were asked about the main reasons for not reporting amenorrhea and how care for amenorrhea, in their opinion, would ideally be organised. The women were asked to make a list of their top five reasons for both subjects and discuss this among their peers. RESULTS: According to the participants, the five main reasons for not reporting the amenorrhea were: (1) normalizing of the subject, (2) the absence of menstruation is not perceived as a problem by the athletes themselves, (3) experienced shame and taboo, (4) prioritisation of sports performance, and (5) denial. Factors to improve care around menstrual cycle problems in female athletes were: (1) informing athletes, coaches, trainers and mentors, (2) informing doctors, (3) conducting more research on long-term consequences, (4) breaking the taboo on menstrual problems, and (5) having a multidisciplinary collaboration between different specialisms. CONCLUSION: By informing athletes, coaches, trainers, and mentors about menstrual cycle problems in athletes, more awareness among those groups can be created. According to the athletes, more research is needed on the long-term consequences of amenorrhea in sports, to enable them to make a better assessment of their possible future health risks.

Our hypothesis is that Clades, branches of the tree of life (e.g. primates and mammals), encompass signals that cannot be detected by PP using all eukaryotes. As such, integrating information from different clades should reveal local co-evolution signals and improve function prediction. Accordingly, we analyzed 1028 genomes in 66 clades and demonstrated that the co-evolutionary signal was scattered across clades. We showed that functionally related genes are frequently co-evolved in only parts of the eukaryotic tree and that clades are complementary in detecting functional interactions within pathways. We examined the non-homologous end joining pathway and the UFM1 ubiquitin-like protein pathway and showed that both demonstrated distinguished co-evolution patterns in specific clades.

CONCLUSIONS Clinical laboratories in developed countries have to rely more on expert guidelines and theoretical risk assessments than on practice in less-developed areas. Risk minimization for clinical laboratory workers is essential but may conflict with the laboratory's duty to provide standard of care. Patients can be put at risk not only from loss of laboratory services from restriction of testing but also from impairment of laboratory services in cases of spills or accidents.

COVID-19 has increased the risk due to very different economic developments in different countries in the euro zone, and Italy and Spain have to reckon with a dramatic increase in public debt, weak economic growth, and a deterioration on the labor market. The main problem is not that the euro zone would not help Italy or Spain, but rather that the people in these countries may feel that aid is not enough. Therefore, an exit could become a serious option. If these countries leave the euro, then they would likely opt for an orderly exit, which means Italy and/or Spain would join EMS II after a one-time devaluation and not leave the EU. However, if these countries do not opt for an orderly exit, a disorderly exit would result in a high risk of hyperinflation.","output":"Hyperinflation in the Euro Area?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study proposes organization of the activity of a radiotherapy service during the pandemic COVID-19 period.

Physiotherapists (PT) are core healthcare professionals who play a major role in the prevention of disease complications and in inspiring a healthy lifestyle. To identify challenges in the promotion of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (CR) in Lebanon, a survey was conducted among PT and physiotherapy students. The aim was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of CR in Lebanon. RESULTS: The response rate was 46.1% (N = 322). Results show that 24.5% of respondents have good to excellent knowledge about CR. More than 60% of the respondents indicate possible barriers to starting a CR program, and one of two respondents identify the absence of skills as a main barrier. Findings highlight the importance of the role of PT as a mediator to increase a healthy lifestyle among patients and to promote the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and pulmonary diseases in the country. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Our results support the evidence and clinical guidelines that PT play a major role by increasing the participation of patients in CR.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the ABP Certification Management System. We determined, within each subspecialty, the annual number of first-year fellows. We assessed for changes in the population using variables available throughout the study period (gender, medical school location, program region, and program size). We fit linear trendlines and calculated (2) statistics. RESULTS: The number of first-year pediatric medical subspecialty fellows increased from 751 in 2001 to 1445 in 2018. Fields with the growth of 3 or more fellows per year were Cardiology, Critical Care, Emergency Medicine, Gastroenterology, Neonatology, and Hematology Oncology (P value <0.05 for all). The number of fellows entering Adolescent Medicine, Child Abuse, Infectious Disease, and Nephrology increased at a rate of 0.5 fellows or fewer per year. Female American Medical Graduates represented the largest and growing proportions of several subspecialties. Distribution of programs by region and size were relatively consistent over time, but varied across subspecialties. CONCLUSIONS: The number of pediatricians entering medical subspecialty fellowship training is uneven and patterns of growth differ between subspecialties. IMPACT: The number of individuals entering fellowship training has increased between 2001 and 2018. Growth in the number of first-year fellows is uneven.

Through all the uncertainty, national governments based their responses to COVID-19 on beliefs and political ideas, which was reflected on the diversity of the responses: liberal, authoritarian, centralized, decentralized, transparent, or opaque. In this article we focus on one of these responses, populism, and seek to understand how populist beliefs drive bureaucratic actions taken by a populist government to handle the health crisis. We conducted a comparative case study between the Mexican populist federal government and the non-populist Jalisco state government. Our findings suggest that the administrative actions chosen by the Mexican populist government were based on negative beliefs towards expert scientific knowledge from outside the government; a disinterest in searching for more information from distant or unfamiliar sources; and a strengthening of flagship programs as the main way to address the upcoming economic crisis. We also found that the Mexican government shows a peculiar manifestation of populism, which we refer as downsizing populism.

Despite high survival and eye salvage as the result of various types of therapies, retinoblastoma remains a disease that places a considerable burden on developing countries. Our study attempted to analyse the research trends in retinoblastoma research and compare contributions from different countries, institutions, journals, and authors. Methods: We extracted all publications concerning retinoblastoma from 2001 to 2021 from the Web of Science database. Microsoft Excel and VOSviewer were employed to collect publication data, analyse publication trends, and visualize relevant results. Results: A total of 1,675 publications with 30,148 citations were identified. The United States contributed the most publications (643) and citations (16,931 times) with the highest H-index value (67) as of February 4, 2021. China ranked second in the number of publications (259), while ranking fourth in both citations (2,632 times) and the H-index (26) ranked fourth. The British Journal of Ophthalmology was the most productive journal concerning retinoblastoma, and Abramson DH had published the most papers in the field. Keywords were categorized into three clusters; tumor-related research, clinical research, and management-related research. The keywords intravitreal, intraarterial, and intravenous appeared the most frequently, with the average appearing year being 2018.1, 2017.7, and 2017.1, respectively. Management-related research has been recognized as a heavily researched topic in the field. Conclusion: We conclude that the United States, China, and India made the most exceptional contributions in the field of retinoblastoma research, while China still has a disparity between the quantity and quality of publications.

Co-morbid depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Depressive symptoms in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are associated with poorer survival, longer hospitalisation and impaired quality of life. Literature on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is largely derived from high-income countries; yet 90% of deaths related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease occur in low- and middle-income countries. We aimed to establish the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as the association with psychosocial outcomes. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients attending outpatient primary care clinics in Karachi, Pakistan. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to assess depression and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 scale was used for the assessment of anxiety. Health-related quality of life was assessed with EuroQolCFive Dimensions, social support with Oslo-3 and social stress with Life Events Checklist. We recruited 293 subjects. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression and anxiety in the sample was 51% (n = 149) and 20% (n = 59), respectively. Depressed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients reported significantly lower health-related quality of life scores as compared to non-depressed patients. Participants with depression had significantly higher levels of anxiety, less social support, higher social stress and more subjective impairment in quality of life. CONCLUSION: Given the association with reduced social support and increased perceived stress, the role of psychosocial interventions must be explored in improving outcomes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in Pakistan.","output":"Prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and their association with psychosocial outcomes: A cross-sectional study from Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior research using economic games has shown that personality drives cooperation in social dilemmas In this study, we tested the generalizability of these findings in a real-life social dilemma during the COVID-19 pandemic, namely stockpiling in the presence of low versus high resource scarcity Honesty-Humility was negatively related to stockpiling intentions and justifiability of stockpiling Moreover, we found a positive albeit weaker effect of Emotionality on stockpiling intentions Victim Sensitivity was mostly positively associated with stockpiling intentions None of the personality traits interacted with resource scarcity to predict stockpiling Our findings replicate established associations between personality and cooperation in a real-life social dilemma, and suggest that the characteristics of interdependent situations during a pandemic additionally afford the expression of Emotionality [120 words]","output":"Stockpiling during the COVID-19 pandemic as a real-life social dilemma: A person-situation perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Finding medications or vaccines that may decrease the infectious period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could potentially reduce transmission in the broader population.

Methods: 1,994 parents or guardians of school-aged children completed a cross-sectional survey one week after schools partially re-opened (8th -11th June 2020). We investigated factors associated with parental willingness to send children to school. These factors included demographic information, perceptions about the risks and benefits of re-opening, presence of COVID-19 symptoms in the family, and the psychological well-being of the child.Findings: Of children eligible to be in school, 46% (n=370 / 802) of children in reception, year one or year six and 13% (n=72 / 569) of children of key workers had attended school in the past seven days. The most common reasons for sending children to school were that the childs education would benefit, the child wanted to go to school, and the parent needed to work. A child was significantly more likely to attend if the parent believed the child had already had COVID-19, they had special educational needs, or a person in the household had COVID-19 symptoms. For children who were ineligible for school, 38% (n=230 / 610) of participants would want to send the child to school, if it were possible. Participants were more likely to want to send their child back if the child was bored and were less likely to want to do so if they felt there was too much coronavirus around, and that school would not be enjoyable.Interpretation: Emphasizing to parents and children that school will be safe, educational and enjoyable will be key to reducing absenteeism when schools fully re-open.

There is emerging evidence that vaccine hesitancy is higher in ethnic minorities and deprived areas, and that this may be caused by distrust and misinformation in the community. This study aims to understand COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in an ethnically diverse and deprived population of Bradford through the Born in Bradford (BiB) research programme. Methods: : Surveys were sent to parents in BiB who had taken part in a previous Covid-19 survey (n=1727). Cross tabulations explored variation by ethnicity and deprivation. Answers to a question asking the main reason for hesitancy was analysed using thematic analysis. Results: : 535 (31%) of those invited between 29 th October-9 th December 2020 participated. 48% were White British, 37% Pakistani heritage and 15% from other ethnicities;46% were from the most deprived quintile of the Index of Multiple Deprivation. 29% of respondents do want a vaccine, 10% do not. The majority had not thought about it (29%) or were unsure (30%). Vaccine hesitancy differed by ethnicity and deprivation: 43% (95% CIs: 37-54%) of White British and 60% (35-81%) in the least deprived areas do want a vaccine, compared to 13% (9-19%) of Pakistani heritage and 20% (15-26%) in the most deprived areas. Reasons for not wanting a vaccine were commonly explained by confusion and distrust which was linked to exposure to misinformation.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) enhances wound healing through several mechanisms including neovascularization, but research regarding its effect on soft tissue healing in VHR is lacking. We sought to study the effect of cross-linking on PRP-induced neovascularization in a rodent model of bridging VHR. We hypothesized that ADM cross-linking would negatively affect PRP-induced neovessel formation. PRP was extracted and characterized from pooled whole blood. Porcine cross-linked (cADM) and non-cross-linked ADMs (ncADM) were implanted in a rat model of chronic VHR after treatment with saline (control) or PRP. Neovascularization of samples at 2, 4, and 6 weeks was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining of CD 31. Adhesion severity at necropsy was compared using a previously validated scale. Addition of PRP increased neovascularization in both cADM and ncADM at 2- and 4-week time points but appeared to do so in a dependent fashion, with significantly greater neovascularization in the PRP-treated ncADMs compared to cADMs. Omental adhesions were increased in all PRP-treated groups. Results indicate that, for 2-week measurements when compared with the cADM group without PRP therapy, the mean change in neovascularization due to ncADM was 3.27 (Z = 2.75, p = 0.006), PRP was 17.56 (Z = 14.77, p < 0.001), and the combined effect of ncADM and PRP was 9.41 (Z = 5.6, p < 0.001). The 4-week data indicate that the average neovascularization change due to ncADM was 0.676 (Z = 0.7, p = 0.484), PRP was 7.69 (Z = 7.95, p < 0.001), and combined effect of ncADM and PRP was 5.28 (Z = 3.86, p < 0.001). These findings validate PRP as a clinical adjunct to enhance the native tissue response to implantable biomaterials and suggest that ncADM is more amenable than cADM to induced neovascularization. PRP use could be advantageous in patients undergoing VHR where poor incorporation is anticipated and early-enhanced neovascularization is desired.","output":"Cross-linking of porcine acellular dermal matrices negatively affects induced neovessel formation using platelet-rich plasma in a rat model of hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Obesity has been described as a protective factor in cardiovascular and other diseases being expressed as 'obesity paradox'. However, the impact of obesity on clinical outcomes including mortality in COVID-19 has been poorly systematically investigated until now. We aimed to compare clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients divided into three groups according to the body mass index (BMI). METHODS: We retrospectively collected data up to May 31st, 2020. 3635 patients were divided into three groups of BMI (<25 kg/m2; n = 1110, 25-30 kg/m2; n = 1464, and >30 kg/m2; n = 1061). Demographic, in-hospital complications, and predictors for mortality, respiratory insufficiency, and sepsis were analyzed. RESULTS: The rate of respiratory insufficiency was more recorded in BMI 25-30 kg/m2 as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m2 (22.8% vs. 41.8%; p < 0.001), and in BMI > 30 kg/m2 than BMI < 25 kg/m2, respectively (22.8% vs. 35.4%; p < 0.001). Sepsis was more observed in BMI 25-30 kg/m2 and BMI > 30 kg/m2 as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m2, respectively (25.1% vs. 42.5%; p = 0.02) and (25.1% vs. 32.5%; p = 0.006). The mortality rate was higher in BMI 25-30 kg/m2 and BMI > 30 kg/m2 as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m2, respectively (27.2% vs. 39.2%; p = 0.31) (27.2% vs. 33.5%; p = 0.004). In the Cox multivariate analysis for mortality, BMI < 25 kg/m2 and BMI > 30 kg/m2 did not impact the mortality rate (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.889-1.508; p = 0.27) (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.893-1.479; p = 0.27). In multivariate logistic regression analyses for respiratory insufficiency and sepsis, BMI < 25 kg/m2 is determined as an independent predictor for reduction of respiratory insufficiency (OR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.538-1.004; p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HOPE COVID-19-Registry revealed no evidence of obesity paradox in patients with COVID-19. However, Obesity was associated with a higher rate of respiratory insufficiency and sepsis but was not determined as an independent predictor for a high mortality.","output":"Does there exist an obesity paradox in COVID-19?

A rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective point-of-care virus detection device is crucial to the control and surveillance of the contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Here we demonstrate a solid phase isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification coupled CRISPR-based (spRPA-CRISPR) assay for on-chip multiplexed, sensitive, and visual COVID-19 DNA detection. By targeting the SARS-CoV-2 structure protein encoded genomes, two specific genes were simultaneously detected with the control sample without cross-interaction with other sequences. The endpoint signal can be directly visualized for rapid detection of COVID-19. The amplified target sequences were immobilized on the one-pot device surface and detected using the mixed Cas12a-crRNA collateral cleavage of reporter released fluorescent signal when specific genes were recognized. The system was tested with samples of a broad range of concentrations (20 to 2x105 copies) and showed analytical sensitivity down to 20 copies per reaction. Furthermore, a low-cost LED UV flashlight (~$12) was used to provide a visible SARS-CoV-2 detection signal of the spRPA-CRISPR assay which could be purchased online easily. Thus, our platform provides a sensitive and easy-to-read multiplexed gene detection method with the capacity to specifically identify low concentration genes.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether point-of-care (POC) PCR testing can be used to reduce staff sick days and improve diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. METHODS: Using a cross-over design, the cobas? Liat? Influenza A/B POC PCR test (Liat) was compared with standard clinical practice during the 2019/2020 influenza season. All adult patients (aged &#8805; 18 years) with fever (&#8805;38C) and respiratory symptoms were included. Primary end points were the prevalence of influenza infections in the ED and staff sick days. Secondary end points were frequency of antiviral and antibacterial therapy, time between admission and test result or treatment initiation, patient disposition, ED length of stay (LOS), and for inpatients mortality and LOS. Nurses were interviewed about handling and integration of POC testing. The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infections coincided with the second half of the study. RESULTS: A total of 828 patients were enrolled in the study. All 375 patients of the intervention group were tested with Liat, and 103 patients of them (27.6%) tested positive. During the intervention period, staff sick days were reduced by 34.4% (P = .023). Significantly, more patients in the intervention group received antiviral therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors (7.2% vs 3.8%, P = .028) and tested patients received antibiotics more frequently (40.0% vs 31.6%, P = .033). Patients with POC test were transferred to external hospitals significantly more often (5.6% vs 1.3%, P = .01).

We used a job-exposure matrix (JEM) linked to the UK Biobank to measure occupational characteristics and estimate associations with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.MethodsPeople reporting job titles at their baseline interview at assessment centers in England were included. We excluded healthcare workers and people 65 years old by March 2020. Jobs were linked to a JEM based on the US O*NET database. For each job, O*NET-based scores (range=1C5) were assigned for characteristics relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection: physical proximity, exposure to diseases/infection, outdoors-exposed to weather, and outdoors-under cover. O*NET variables were used to determine whether jobs could be done remotely based on two algorithms. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 tests occurring between August 5th and November 10th, 2020 (time when UK was not shutdown with a 5-day lag added). Cox regression was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) as estimates of associations with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test accounting for age, sex, race, education, deprivation, assessment center, household size, and income.ResultsOur inclusion/exclusion criteria identified 115,581 people, including 1746 with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.

Here we present viral dynamics analysis of Phase 2 clinical virology data to inform MOV Phase 3 study design and development strategy. METHODS: An Immune-Viral Dynamics Model (IVDM) was developed with mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication, and induced immunity, which together describe the dynamics of viral load (VL) during disease progression. Longitudinal virology data from ferret studies (Cox, et al. Nat. Microbiol 2021:6-11) were used to inform IVDM, which was further translated to human by adjusting parameter values to capture clinical data from MOVe-IN/MOVe-OUT studies. Different placements of drug effects (on viral infectivity vs. productivity) and representations of immune response were explored to identify the best ones to describe data. A simplified 95% drug effect was implemented to represent a highly effective dose of MOV. RESULTS: IVDM showed data were best described when MOV acts on viral infectivity, consistent with the error catastrophe mechanism of action. A cascade of innate and adaptive immune response and a basal level activation enabled durable immunity and continued viral decay after treatment end. IVDM reasonably describes VL and viral titer data from animals and humans. Influence of MOV start time was explored using simulations. Consistent with the ferret studies, simulations showed when treatment is started within the first week post infection, MOV reduces viral growth, resulting in a lower and shortened duration of detectable VL. When started later (e.g. >7 days since symptom onset), the magnitude of drug effect is substantially diminished in a typical patient with an effective immune response which reduces VL prior to treatment start. Further work is needed to model response in patients with longer term infection, where MOV drug effects may have more persistent utility. CONCLUSION: A COVID-19 IVDM developed using multiscale MOV virology data supports drug action on viral infectivity and importance of interplay of treatment and immune response and can describe infection time course and drug effect. IVDM provided mechanistic interpretations for VL drug effect in clinical studies. DISCLOSURES: Youfang Cao, PhD, Merck & Co. (Employee) Wei Gao, PhD, Merck & Co., Inc.

METHODS: Using COVID-19 case and death data from February to December 2020 offered by Johns Hopkins University, we generated time-associated balloon charts with multiple epidemiological indicators including crude case fatality rate (CFR), morbidity, mortality and the total number of cases, to compare the progression of the pandemic within a specific period across regions and countries, integrating seven related dimensions together. The area chart is used to supplement the display of the balloon chart in daily new COVID-19 case changes in UN geographic regions over time. Javascript and Vega-Lite were chosen for programming and mapping COVID-19 data in browsers for visualization. RESULTS: From February 1st to December 20th 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spread across UN subregions in the chronological order. It was first reported in East Asia, and then became noticeable in Europe (South, West and North), North America, East Europe and West Asia, Central and South America, Southern Africa, Caribbean, South Asia, North Africa, Southeast Asia and Oceania, causing several waves of epidemics in different regions. Since October, the balloons of Europe, North America and West Asia have been rising rapidly, reaching a dramatically high morbidity level ranging from 200 to 500/10 000 by December, suggesting an emerging winter wave of COVID-19 which was much bigger than the previous ones. By late December 2020, some European and American countries displayed a leading mortality as high as or over 100/100 000, represented by Belgium, Czechia, Spain, France, Italy, UK, Hungary, Bulgaria, Peru, USA, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico.

MEASUREMENTS: Age, sex, neighborhood deprivation index, comorbid conditions, acute physiology indices, and race/ethnicity; SARS-CoV-2 testing and incidence of positive test results; and hospitalization, illness severity, and mortality. RESULTS: Among 3 481 716 eligible members, 42.0% were White, 6.4% African American, 19.9% Hispanic, and 18.6% Asian; 13.0% were of other or unknown race. Of eligible members, 91 212 (2.6%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 3686 had positive results (overall incidence, 105.9 per 100 000 persons; by racial group, White, 55.1; African American, 123.1; Hispanic, 219.6; Asian, 111.7; other/unknown, 79.3). African American persons had the highest unadjusted testing and mortality rates, White persons had the lowest testing rates, and those with other or unknown race had the lowest mortality rates. Compared with White persons, adjusted testing rates among non-White persons were marginally higher, but infection rates were significantly higher; adjusted odds ratios [aORs] for African American persons, Hispanic persons, Asian persons, and persons of other/unknown race were 2.01 (95% CI, 1.75 to 2.31), 3.93 (CI, 3.59 to 4.30), 2.19 (CI, 1.98 to 2.42), and 1.57 (CI, 1.38 to 1.78), respectively. Geographic analyses showed that infections clustered in areas with higher proportions of non-White persons. Compared with White persons, adjusted hospitalization rates for African American persons, Hispanic persons, Asian persons, and persons of other/unknown race were 1.47 (CI, 1.03 to 2.09), 1.42 (CI, 1.11 to 1.82), 1.47 (CI, 1.13 to 1.92), and 1.03 (CI, 0.72 to 1.46), respectively.

The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the requisite binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell. Recognition that ACE2 is the coreceptor for the coronavirus has prompted new therapeutic approaches to block the enzyme or reduce its expression to prevent the cellular entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissues that express ACE2 including lung, heart, kidney, brain, and gut. ACE2, however, is a key enzymatic component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); ACE2 degrades ANG II, a peptide with multiple actions that promote CVD, and generates Ang-(1-7), which antagonizes the effects of ANG II. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that RAAS blockade by ACE inhibitors, ANG II type 1 receptor antagonists, and mineralocorticoid antagonists, as well as statins, enhance ACE2 which, in part, contributes to the benefit of these regimens. In lieu of the fact that many older patients with hypertension or other CVDs are routinely treated with RAAS blockers and statins, new clinical concerns have developed regarding whether these patients are at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether RAAS and statin therapy should be discontinued, and the potential consequences of RAAS blockade to COVID-19-related pathologies such as acute and chronic respiratory disease. The current perspective critically examines the evidence for ACE2 regulation by RAAS blockade and statins, the cardiovascular benefits of ACE2, and whether ACE2 blockade is a viable approach to attenuate COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19, ACE2, and the cardiovascular consequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) is considered as to be one of the most consumed beverages globally and a reservoir of phytochemicals with immense health benefits. Despite numerous advantages, tea compounds lack a robust multi-disease target study. In this work, we presented a unique in silico approach consisting of molecular docking, multivariate statistics, pharmacophore analysis, and network pharmacology approaches. Eight tea phytochemicals were identified through literature mining, namely gallic acid, catechin, epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate (ECG), quercetin, kaempferol, and ellagic acid, based on their richness in tea leaves. Further, exploration of databases revealed 30 target proteins related to the pharmacological properties of tea compounds and multiple associated diseases. Molecular docking experiment with eight tea compounds and all 30 proteins revealed that except gallic acid all other seven phytochemicals had potential inhibitory activities against these targets. The docking experiment was validated by comparing the binding affinities (Kcal mol(?1)) of the compounds with known drug molecules for the respective proteins. Further, with the aid of the application of statistical tools (principal component analysis and clustering), we identified two major clusters of phytochemicals based on their chemical properties and docking scores (Kcal mol(?1)). Pharmacophore analysis of these clusters revealed the functional descriptors of phytochemicals, related to the ligandCprotein docking interactions. Tripartite network was constructed based on the docking scores, and it consisted of seven tea phytochemicals (gallic acid was excluded) targeting five proteins and ten associated diseases. Epicatechin gallate (ECG)-hepatocyte growth factor receptor (PDB id 1FYR) complex was found to be highest in docking performance (10 kcal mol(?1)). Finally, molecular dynamic simulation showed that ECG-1FYR could make a stable complex in the near-native physiological condition.

Once solutions are developed, meeting capacities depends on the ability to mitigate technical, logistical and production issues. While it is difficult to predict the next outbreak, augmenting investments in preparedness, such as infectious disease surveillance, is far more effective than mustering last-minute response funds. Bringing research outputs into practice sooner rather than later is part of an agile approach to pivot and deliver solutions. Cooperative multi- country research programs, especially those funded by global biosecurity programs, develop capacity that can be applied to infectious disease surveillance and research that enhances detection, identification, and response to emerging and re-emerging pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential. Moreover, these programs enhance trust building among partners, which is essential because setting expectation and commitment are required for successful research and training. Measuring research outputs, evaluating outcomes and justifying continual investments are essential but not straightforward. Lessons learned include those related to reducing biological threats and maturing capabilities for national laboratory diagnostics strategy and related health systems. Challenges, such as growing networks, promoting scientific transparency, data and material sharing, sustaining funds and developing research strategies remain to be fully resolved.

IFN-&#954; inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2; and TFF2 is a small secreted polypeptide that promotes the repair of mucosal injury and reduces the inflammatory responses. We used the synergistic effect of both proteins to treat COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an open-label, randomized, clinical trial involving patients with moderate COVID-19. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either aerosol inhalation treatment with IFN-&#954; and TFF2 every 24 h for six consecutive dosages in addition to standard care (experimental group) or standard care alone (control group). The primary endpoint was the time until a viral RNA negative conversion for SARS-CoV-2 in all clinical samples. The secondary clinical endpoint was the time of CT imaging improvement. Data analysis was performed per protocol. This study was registered with chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000030262. Findings: Between March 23 and May 23 of 2020, 86 COVID-19 patients with symptoms of moderate illness were recruited, and 6 patients were excluded due to not matching the inclusion criteria (patients with pneumonia through chest radiography). Among the remaining 80 patients, 40 patients were assigned to experimental group, and the others were assigned to control group to only receive standard care. Efficacy and safety were evaluated for both groups. The time of viral RNA negative conversion in experimental group (Mean, 380 days, 95% CI 207-553), was significantly shorter than that in control group (740 days, 95% CI 457 to 1023) (p = 0.031), and difference between means was 360 days. The percentage of patients in experimental group with reversion to negative viral RNA was significantly increased compared with control group on all sampling days (every day during the 12-day observation period) (p = 0037). For the secondary endpoint, the experimental group had a significantly shorter time until improvement was seen by CT (Mean 621 days, N = 38/40, 95% CI 511-731) than that in control group (876 days, N = 34/40, 95% CI 757-996) (p = 0.002), and difference between means was 255 days. No discomfort or complications during aerosol inhalation were reported to the nurses by any experimental patients. Interpretation: In conclusion, we found that aerosol inhalation of IFN-&#954; plus TFF2 in combination with standard care is safe and superior to standard care alone in shortening the time up to viral RNA negative conversion in all clinical samples. In addition, the patients in experimental group had a significantly shortened CT imaging improvement time than those in control group. This study suggested that this combination treatment is able to facilitate clinical improvement (negative for virus, improvement by CT, reduced hospitalization stay) and thereby result in an early release from the hospital. These data support the need for exploration with a large-scale trial of IFN-&#954; plus TFF2 to treat COVID-19.

This single-center, retrospective, observational study included 55 patients with COVID-19 who were transferred to Shenyang Sixth People's Hospital between January 20 and March 15, 2020. Data on demographics, symptoms, laboratory indicators, treatment processes, and clinical outcomes were collected. Administered drugs and intervention times were compared in 47 and 8 patients with mild and severe symptoms, respectively. All 55 patients recovered. Fifty-three patients (96.36%) received antiviral therapy, including 45 in the mild group (median treatment: 14 days; 17 received umifenovir) and all 8 severe-group patients (median treatment: 17.5 days; 4 received lopinavir/ritonavir). Twenty-nine patients (52.72%) were administered antibiotics, including 21 in the mild group (median treatment: 13.5 days; 15 received moxifloxacin) and all 8 in the severe group (median treatment: 9 days; 2 received linezolid). Moreover, 7 patients (12.72%) were treated with glucocorticoids and 9 (16.36%) with immunomodulators. Given the 100% recovery rate, early administration of antiviral drugs can be considered. Umifenovir may benefit patients with mild symptoms, while lopinavir/ritonavir may benefit those with severe symptoms. Prophylactic administration of common antibiotics may reduce the risk of co-infection. The use of glucocorticoids is usually not necessary.

The global outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in early 2020 has not only caused serious economic and social losses to various countries but also put the current public health event governance system to a severe test. The cross-regional character and spillover effects of public health outbreak governance often make it difficult to coordinate cross-regional governance. In this context, this paper adopts a regional evolutionary game analysis framework and studies the cross-regional governance of public health emergencies by constructing a symmetric game of peripheral regions and an asymmetric game of core-peripheral regions. The marginal contribution of this paper is to attempt to construct a symmetric game model for peripheral regions and an asymmetric game model for core and peripheral regions using an evolutionary game approach to study the behavioral strategies of multiple regions in the governance of public health emergencies, and it is found that when the regional spillover effects and governance costs are small or the economic and social damages caused by public health emergencies are large, all regions will choose to conduct coordinated governance. Otherwise, there will be regions that choose to \\"free-ride.\\" This \\"free-rider\\" mentality has led to the failure in achieving good cross-regional collaborative governance of public health emergencies, resulting in a lack of efficiency in the overall governance of public health in society. However, when the spillover effect of regional governance exceeds a certain critical value, the result of the regional governance game is also the socially optimal result, when public health emergencies are effectively governed. At the same time, the relevant findings and analytical framework of this paper will provide a policy reference for the cross-regional governance of the current new crown epidemic.

Households in particular present a close-contact environment with high probability of transmission between persons of different ages and with different roles in society. Methods Complete households with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive case in the Netherlands (March-May 2020) were included. At least three home visits were performed during 4-6 week of follow-up, collecting naso- and oropharyngeal swabs, oral fluid, faeces and blood samples for molecular and serological analyses of all household members. Symptoms were recorded from two weeks before the first visit up to the last visit. Secondary attack rates (SAR) were estimated with logistic regression. A transmission model was used to assess transmission routes in the household. Results A total of 55 households with 187 household contacts were included. In 17 households no transmission took place, and in 11 households all persons were infected. Estimated SARs were high, ranging from 35% (95%CI: 24%-46%) in children to 51% (95%CI: 39%-63%) in adults. Estimated transmission rates in the household were high, with reduced susceptibility of children compared to adolescents and adults (0.67; 95%CI: 0.40-1.1). Conclusion Estimated SARs were higher than reported in earlier household studies, presumably owing to a dense sampling protocol. Children were shown to be less susceptible than adults, but the estimated SAR in children was still high. Our results reinforce the role of households as main multiplier of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population.","output":"High infection attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 in Dutch households revealed by dense sampling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: England, UK has one of the highest rates of confirmed COVID-19 mortality globally. Until recently, testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus focused mainly on healthcare and care home settings. As such, there is far less understanding of community transmission. Protocol: The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) programme is a major programme of home testing for COVID-19 to track progress of the infection in the community. REACT-1 involves cross-sectional surveys of viral detection (virological swab for RT-PCR) tests in repeated samples of 100,000 to 150,000 randomly selected individuals across England. This examines how widely the virus has spread and how many people are currently infected. The age range is 5 years and above. Individuals are sampled from the England NHS patient list. REACT-2 is a series of five sub-studies towards establishing the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in England as an indicator of historical infection. The main study (study 5) uses the same design and sampling approach as REACT-1 using a self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG antibodies in repeated samples of 100,000 to 200,000 adults aged 18 years and above. To inform study 5, studies 1-4 evaluate performance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 LFIAs (study 1) and different aspects of feasibility, usability and application of LFIAs for home-based testing in different populations (studies 2-4). Ethics and dissemination: The study has ethical approval. Results are reported using STROBE guidelines and disseminated through reports to public health bodies, presentations at scientific meetings and open access publications. Conclusions: This study provides robust estimates of the prevalence of both virus (RT-PCR, REACT-1) and seroprevalence (antibody, REACT-2) in the general population in England. We also explore acceptability and usability of LFIAs for self-administered testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibody in a home-based setting, not done before at such scale in the general population.","output":"REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) of SARS-CoV-2 virus: Study protocol."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo: analisar casos acumulados da COVID-19 em Brasil, Espanha, Itlia, China e EUA Mtodos: estudo ecolgico, com uso de dados secundrios Realizou-se srie temporal de casos cumulativos de COVID-19 por 28 dias, aps o 100o caso confirmado de cada pas (baseado nas estatsticas do Worldometer 2020) Modelos de tendncia linear, exponencial, potencial e logaritmo foram testados, sendo escolhido o melhor coeficiente de determina??o (R2) No Brasil, a linha de tendncia foi segmentada em 1o-14o dia e 15o-28o dia Resultados: no 100o dia, os EUA possuam maior nmero de casos e o Brasil, o menor Houve linha de tendncia em sua maioria exponencial, com maior velocidade de crescimento nos EUA No Brasil, houve tendncia de crescimento mais lento no segundo perodo Conclus?o: as linhas de tendncia calculadas demonstraram pior prognstico para os EUA No Brasil, o crescimento do nmero cumulativo de casos foi mais lento na no segundo perodo do estudo Objective: to examine cumulative cases of COVID-19 in Brazil, Spain, Italy, China, and USA Method: in this ecological study, secondary data were used to produce time series of cumulative cases of COVID-19 over 28 days after the 100th case confirmed in each country (from Worldometer 2020 statistics) Linear, exponential, potential and logarithmic trend models were tested, and the best coefficient of determination (R2) was chosen In Brazil, the trend line was segmented into days 1-14 and 15-28 Results: on day 100, the USA had the highest number of cases and Brazil, the lowest The trend lines were mostly exponential, with highest growth rate in the USA In Brazil, the growth trend was slower in the second period Conclusion: the calculated trend lines showed a worse prognosis for the USA In Brazil, the cumulative number of cases grew more slowly in the second period of the study Objetivo: examinar casos acumulados de COVID-19 en Brasil, Espa?a, Italia, China y Estados Unidos Mtodo: en este estudio ecolgico, se utilizaron datos secundarios para producir series de tiempo de casos acumulados de COVID-19 durante 28 das despus del 100o caso confirmado en cada pas (de las estadsticas del Worldometer 2020) Se probaron modelos de tendencia lineal, exponencial, potencial y logartmica y se eligi el mejor coeficiente de determinacin (R2) En Brasil, la lnea de tendencia se segment en los das 1-14 y 15-28 Resultados: el da 100, EE UU tuvo el mayor nmero de casos y Brasil, el menor Las lneas de tendencia fueron en su mayora exponenciales, con la tasa de crecimiento ms alta en los EE UU En Brasil, la tendencia de crecimiento fue ms lenta en el segundo perodo Conclusin: las lneas de tendencia calculadas mostraron un peor pronstico para EE UU En Brasil, el nmero acumulado de casos creci ms lentamente en el segundo perodo del estudio","output":"Historical data series of COVID-19 in different countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sialic acids (Sia) are the primary receptors for influenza viruses, and are widely displayed on cell surfaces and in secreted mucus. Sia may be present in variant forms that include O-acetyl modifications at C4, C7, C8, and C9 positions, and N-acetyl or N-glycolyl at C5. They can also vary in their linkages, including 2-3 or 2-6-linkages. Here, we analyzed the distribution of modified Sia in cells and tissues of wild-type mice, or in mice lacking cytidine 5-monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) enzyme that synthesizes N-glycolyl modifications (Neu5Gc). We also examined the variation of Sia forms on erythrocytes and saliva from different animals. To determine the effect of Sia modifications on influenza A virus (IAV) infection, we tested for effects on hemagglutinin (HA) binding and neuraminidase (NA) cleavage. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl, 7,9-O-acetyl, 4-O-acetyl, and Neu5Gc modifications are widely but variably expressed in mouse tissues, with the highest levels detected in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Secreted mucins in saliva and surface proteins of erythrocytes showed a great degree of variability in display of modified Sia between different species. IAV HA from different virus strains showed consistently reduced binding to both Neu5Gc and O-acetyl modified Sia; however, while IAV NA were inhibited by Neu5Gc and O-acetyl modifications, there was significant variability between NA types. The modifications of Sia in mucus may therefore have potent effects on the functions of IAV, and may affect both pathogens and the normal flora of different mucosal sites. Sialic acids (Sia) are involved in many different cellular functions and are receptors for many pathogens. Sia come in many chemically modified forms but we lack a clear understanding of how they alter the interactions with microbes. Here we examine the expression of modified Sia in mouse tissues, on secreted mucus in saliva, and on erythrocytes, including those from IAV host species and animals used in IAV research. These Sia forms varied considerably between different animals, and their inhibitory effects on IAV NA and HA activities and on bacterial sialidases (neuraminidases) suggest a host-variable protective role in secreted mucus.","output":"The effects of modified sialic acids on mucus and erythrocytes on influenza A virus HA and NA functions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) is still a major health issue.

METHODS/AIMS: An international survey of oncology pharmacists and technicians was conducted via the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners and collaborating global pharmacy organisations to determine the impact that the coronavirus of 2019 has had on pharmacy service delivery, pharmacy practitioners and oncology practice. RESULTS: The survey received 862 responses from 40 different countries from September to October 2020. The majority of respondents were pharmacists (n = 841, 97.6%), with 24% involved in the direct care of patients with the coronavirus of 2019. Of the survey participants, 55% increased their time working remotely, with remote activities including dispensing, patient assessment/follow-up and attending multi-disciplinary rounds. Respondents reported a 72% increase in the use of technology to perform remote patient interaction activities and that participation in educational meetings and quality improvement projects was reduced by 68% and 44%, respectively. Workforce impacts included altered working hours (50%), cancelled leave (48%) and forced leave/furloughing (30%). During the pandemic, respondents reported reduced access to intensive care (19%) and anti-cancer (15%) medications. In addition, 39% of respondents reported reduced access to personal protective equipment, including N95 masks for chemotherapy compounding. Almost half of respondents (49%) reported that cancer treatments were delayed or intervals were altered for patients being treated with curative intent. A third of practitioners (30%) believed that patient outcomes would be adversely impacted by changes to pharmacy services. Sixty-five percent of respondents reported impacts on their mental health, with 12% utilising support services. CONCLUSION: The coronavirus of 2019 pandemic has altered the way oncology pharmacy services are delivered.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the moderating effect of race on the relationship between vitamin D status and the risk of COVID-19 test positivity, and to compare propensity score (PS) model results to those obtained from classical bivariate and multivariable models, which have primarily comprised the literature to date. METHODS Electronic health record (EHR) data from TriNetX (unmatched n = 21,629; matched n = 16,602) were used to investigate the effect of vitamin D status, as measured by 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], on the odds of experiencing a positive COVID-19 test using multivariable logistic regression models with and without PS methodology. RESULTS Having normal ( 30 ng/mL) versus inadequate 25(OH)D (< 30 ng/mL) was not associated with COVID-19 positivity overall (OR = 0.913, p = 0.18), in White individuals (OR = 0.920, p = 0.31), or in Black individuals (OR = 1.006, p = 0.96). When 25(OH)D was analyzed on a continuum, a 10 ng/mL increase in 25(OH)D lowered the odds of having a positive COVID-19 test overall (OR = 0.949, p = 0.003) and among White (OR = 0.935, p = 0.003), but not Black individuals (OR = 0.994, p = 0.75). CONCLUSIONS Models which use weighting and matching methods resulted in smaller estimated effect sizes than models which do not use weighting or matching.

METHODS The OTG cohort contained 35 cases, which were performed from April 2003 to October 2005. The LATG cohort contained 46 cases, which were performed from November 2005 to November 2008. Postoperative changes over time in various parameters relating to minimal invasiveness were evaluated. We used the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale to evaluate pain. Vital signs and a face scale were analyzed using daily maximum values on postoperative days (POD) 1-7. A hematological examination was performed on the preoperative day and POD 1, 4, 7, and 10. The number of days until oxygen saturation level (SaO2) was 95% or more in room air was used to evaluate respiratory function. RESULTS Significantly lower pain scores were obtained in the LATG group on POD 1, 4, 5, and 7. There was a significantly lower body temperature in the LATG group on POD 7. A significantly lower white blood cell count was revealed for LATG patients on POD 10, and for C-reactive protein on POD 1. Significantly higher serum total protein values were observed in the LATG group on POD 1, 4, and 7. Significantly lower blood sugar level was found in the LATG group on POD 4 and 7. The number of days until SaO2 was 95% or more in room air was significantly fewer in the LATG group.

DESIGN A retrospective analysis. SETTING An academic hospital. PARTICIPANTS Patients older than 18 years of age undergoing thoracic surgery requiring DLT placement between 2005 and 2011. INTERVENTIONS Patients without airway predictors of difficult intubation who were intubated under DL with Macintosh (DL-MAC, n = 40) or Miller (DL-MIL, n = 44) blades and VL with McGrath MAC (Aircraft Medical, Edinburgh, UK) and C-MAC (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) laryngoscopes (n = 46) were included in the study. Patients who were intubated with both VL devices were grouped into a VL group. MEASUREMENTS Patients in all 3 groups had comparable preoperative demographics. Mallampati scores and ease of manual ventilation after the induction of anesthesia were also similar in all groups. The Cormack Lehane (C-L) grade views were significantly higher in patients in the DL-MAC than in the DL-MIL and VL groups (p < 0.006). The number of intubation attempts was similar in all 3 groups; however, the percentage of intubation reported to be difficult was higher in the DL-MAC than in the other 2 groups (p = 0.014). No damage to the airway was found in any of the groups. CONCLUSION DLT placement using VL appeared to overcome some of the limitations of DL-MAC but was similar to DL-MIL. The authors speculated that the ease of placement was related to the improved visualization of the vocal cords because there was a significantly greater number of C-L views 3 and 4 in the DL-MAC group as compared with the VL and DL-MIL groups. Hence, the authors advocate using VL, particularly when the laryngoscopist is inexperienced using DL-MIL for DLT placement.","output":"Video laryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy for double-lumen endotracheal tube intubation: a retrospective analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Testing the Common-Sense Model, this random telephone survey examined the associations between illness representations of COVID-19 and behavioral intention to visit hospitals for scheduled medical consultations (BI-VHSMC), and the mediations via coping and fear of nosocomial infection among 300 Chinese adults.

Since the onset of infections, several full-length sequences of viral genome have been made available which have been used to gain insights into viral dynamics. We utilised a meta-data driven comparative analysis tool for sequences (Meta-CATS) algorithm to identify mutations in 829 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from around the world. The algorithm predicted sixty-one mutations among SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We observed that most of the mutations were concentrated around three protein coding genes viz nsp3 (non-structural protein 3), RdRp (RNA-directed RNA polymerase) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We used various computational tools including normal mode analysis (NMA), C-&#945; discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations (MD) to study the effect of mutations on functionality, stability and flexibility of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins including envelope (E), N and spike (S) proteins. PredictSNP predictor suggested that four mutations (L37H in E, R203K and P344S in N and D614G in S) out of seven were predicted to be neutral whilst the remaining ones (P13L, S197L and G204R in N) were predicted to be deleterious in nature thereby impacting protein functionality. NMA, C-&#945; DMD and all-atom MD suggested some mutations to have stabilizing roles (P13L, S197L and R203K in N protein) where remaining ones were predicted to destabilize mutant protein. In summary, we identified significant mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes as well as used computational approaches to further characterize the possible effect of highly significant mutations on SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

COVID\\\\19 can lead to myocardial damage and vascular injury. We hypothesised that COVID\\\\19 patients frequently develop a HFpEF\\\\like syndrome, and designed this study to explore this. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac function was assessed in 64 consecutive, hospitalized, and clinically stable COVID\\\\19 patients from April C November 2020 with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 50% (age 5619 years, females: 31%, severe COVID\\\\19 disease: 69%). To investigate likelihood of HFpEF presence, we used the HFA\\\\PEFF score. A low (0\\\\1 points), intermediate (2\\\\4 points), and high (5\\\\6 points) HFA\\\\PEFF score was observed in 42%, 33%, and 25% of patients, respectively. In comparison, 64 subjects of similar age, sex, and comorbidity status without COVID\\\\19, showed these scores in 30%, 66%, and 4%, respectively (between groups: p=0.0002). High HFA\\\\PEFF scores were more frequent in COVID\\\\19 patients than controls (25% vs. 4%, p=0.001). In COVID\\\\19 patients, HFA\\\\PEFF score significantly correlated with age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT), haemoglobin, QTc interval, LVEF, mitral E/A ratio, and H(2)FPEF score (all p<0.05). In multivariate, ordinal regression analyses, higher age and hsTnT were significant predictors of increased HFA\\\\PEFF scores.

The E-S-FLU virus is a single-cycle influenza virus coated with Ebolavirus glycoprotein, and it encodes enhanced green fluorescence protein as a reporter that replaces the influenza virus hemagglutinin. MDCK-SIAT1 cells were transduced to express Ebolavirus glycoprotein as a stable transmembrane protein for E-S-FLU virus production. Infection of cells with the E-S-FLU virus was dependent on the Niemann-Pick C1 protein, which is the well-characterized receptor for Ebola virus entry at the late endosome/lysosome membrane. The E-S-FLU virus was neutralized specifically by an anti-Ebolavirus glycoprotein antibody and a variety of small drug molecules that are known to inhibit the entry of wild-type Ebola virus. To demonstrate the application of this new Ebola virus pseudotype, we show that a single laboratory batch was sufficient to screen a library (LOPAC(1280); Sigma) of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds for inhibition of virus entry. A total of 215 compounds inhibited E-S-FLU virus infection, while only 22 inhibited the control H5-S-FLU virus coated in H5 hemagglutinin. These inhibitory compounds have very dispersed targets and mechanisms of action, e.g., calcium channel blockers, estrogen receptor antagonists, antihistamines, serotonin uptake inhibitors, etc., and this correlates with inhibitor screening results obtained with other pseudotypes or wild-type Ebola virus in the literature. The E-S-FLU virus is a new tool for Ebola virus cell entry studies and is easily applied to high-throughput screening assays for small-molecule inhibitors or antibodies. IMPORTANCE Ebola virus is in the Filoviridae family and is a biosafety level 4 pathogen. There are no FDA-approved therapeutics for Ebola virus. These characteristics warrant the development of surrogates for Ebola virus that can be handled in more convenient laboratory containment to study the biology of the virus and screen for inhibitors. Here we characterized a new surrogate, named E-S-FLU virus, that is based on a disabled influenza virus core coated with the Ebola virus surface protein but does not contain any genetic information from the Ebola virus itself. We show that E-S-FLU virus uses the same cell entry pathway as wild-type Ebola virus. As an example of the ease of use of E-S-FLU virus in biosafety level 1/2 containment, we showed that a single production batch could provide enough surrogate virus to screen a standard small-molecule library of 1,280 candidates for inhibitors of viral entry.","output":"Characterization of Influenza Virus Pseudotyped with Ebolavirus Glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research note analyses the evolving geographies of coronavirus disease research before and during the first three months of the 2020 epidemic outbreak.

Although previous studies have focused on the sexual risk behaviours among men who have sex with men (MSM), studies regarding binge alcohol drinking among MSM in Myanmar are scarce. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to identify the alcohol consumption patterns among MSM aged over 18 years in two major cities of Myanmar where the MSM population is higher than other regions. Purposive sampling was applied and sampling was made through Myanmar MSM network. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire. Patterns of alcohol consumption were described as frequency/percentage and mean/median as appropriate. Bivariate analysis was also done to find out the association between types of MSM and binge drinking. Results: A total of 256 MSM included in the study (mean age, 27.337.7 years). Of 256 participants, 225 MSM had the experience of alcohol consumption in their lifetime (225/256, 87.9%). Among ever drinkers, 152 MSM consumed alcohol within three months (152/225, 67.6%). Regarding beer consumption, the highest proportions of MSM from both groups (42.8%, 36.8%) consumed 1-3 times per week. Overall, 57.2% of young MSM and 41.2% of adult MSM consumed beer together with their friends. Nearly 34% of young MSM and nearly 38% of adult MMS consumed beer at gatherings of friends. At different time periods, higher proportions of Thange (partners of MSM) had experienced of binge drinking than apwint (open) and apone (hidden) (p<0.05).

In this paper, we aim at estimating the average causal effect (ACE) from observational data (patient trajectories) that are collected over time. For this, we propose DeepACE: an end-to-end deep learning model. DeepACE leverages the iterative G-computation formula to adjust for the bias induced by time-varying confounders. Moreover, we develop a novel sequential targeting procedure which ensures that DeepACE has favorable theoretical properties, i.e., is doubly robust and asymptotically efficient.

The risk of a widespread epidemic is especially high when pathogens are introduced to naive host populations, often leading to high morbidity and mortality. Prevention and control of these epidemics is based on knowledge of what drives pathogen transmission among hosts. Previous disease outbreaks suggest the spread of directly transmitted pathogens is determined by host contact rates and local host density. While theoretical models of disease spread typically assume a constant host density, most wildlife populations occur at a variety of densities across the landscape. We explored how spatial heterogeneity in host density influences pathogen spread by simulating the introduction and spread of rabies and canine distemper in a spatially heterogeneous population of Channel Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis), coupling fox density and contact rates with probabilities of viral transmission. For both diseases, the outcome of pathogen introductions varied widely among simulation iterations and depended on the density of hosts at the site of pathogen introduction. Introductions into areas of higher fox densities resulted in more rapid pathogen transmission and greater impact on the host population than if the pathogen was introduced at lower densities. Both pathogens were extirpated in a substantial fraction of iterations. Rabies was over five times more likely to go locally extinct when introduced at low host density sites than at high host-density sites, leaving an average of >99% of foxes uninfected. Canine distemper went extinct in >98% of iterations regardless of introduction site, but only after >90% of foxes had become infected.

In November 2021, the Omicron variant was discovered and classified as a variant of concern (VOC). Omicron shows substantially more mutations in the spike protein than any previous variant, mostly in the receptor binding domain (RBD). We analyzed the binding of the Omicron RBD to the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2) and the ability of human sera from COVID-19 patients or vaccinees in comparison to Wuhan, Beta or Delta RBDs variants. All RBDs were produced in insect cells. RBD binding to hACE2 was analyzed by ELISA and microscale thermophoresis (MST). Similarly, sera from 27 COVID-19 patients, 58 fully vaccinated individuals and 16 booster recipients were titrated by ELISA on the fixed RBDs from the original Wuhan strain, Beta, Delta and Omicron VOC. Surprisingly, the Omicron RBD showed a weaker binding to ACE2 compared to Beta and Delta, arguing that improved ACE2 binding is not a likely driver of Omicron evolution. Serum antibody titers were significantly lower against Omicron RBD compared to the original Wuhan strain. However, a difference of 2.5 times was observed in RBD binding while in other studies the neutralization of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 was reduced by a magnitude of 10x and more. These results indicate an immune escape focused on neutralizing antibodies. The reduced binding of sera to Omicron RBD adds evidence that current vaccination protocols may be less efficient against the Omicron variant.","output":"Human serum from SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated and COVID-19 patients shows reduced binding to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in comparison to the original Wuhan strain and the Beta and Delta variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present work aims to identify the predictors of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality testing a set of Machine Learning Techniques (MLTs), comparing their ability to predict the outcome of interest.

METHODS: We conducted a three\\\\year comparative retrospective cohort analysis of data from the National EMS Information System. Data were included if care was provided between the 40(th) and 21(st) week of the next year and compared over three\\\\years. We included incidents identified through 9\\\\1\\\\1 where patient contact was made. The total number of EMS incidents per week was used as the denominator to calculate the rate of patient deaths and possible injury. We assessed for temporal and seasonal trends. RESULTS: Starting in the 10(th) week of 2020 there was a decrease in the number of EMS activations in the United States compared to the prior weeks and the same time period in previous years. The number of activations between week 10 and 16 decreased by 140,292 or 26.1%. The portion of EMS activations reporting a patient disposition of death nearly doubled between the 11(th) and 15(th) week of 2020 (1.49% to 2.77% of all activations). The number of EMS activations documenting a possible injury decreased from 18.43% to 15.27% between weeks 10 and 13.

There are few reports of endovascular management of spinal aneurysms associated with SAVM. OBJECTIVE To present endovascular management of aneurysms associated with SAVM. METHODS Of 91 patients with SAVMs,eight (9%) presented with aneurysms. Of these, three were male and five were female with a median age of 18 years (range 11-38). We evaluated the presenting pattern, lesion level, type of the target aneurysm related to the presenting pattern and AVM nidus, and the result obtained after embolization or open surgery. Clinical status was evaluated by Aminoff-Logue (ALS) gait and micturition scale scores. RESULTS The presenting patterns were subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH, n=3) or mass effect caused by extrinsic (n=4) or intrinsic (n=1) cord compression. Aneurysms were located in four cervical, two thoracic, and two lumbar enlargement areas. There were two prenidal (arterial), three nidal, and three postnidal (venous) aneurysms. The mean diameter of the aneurysms was 9 mm (range 3-27). Glue embolization (n=6), open surgery (n=1), and combined surgery and embolization (n=1) was performed to obliterate the aneurysms. Obliteration of the target aneurysms resulted in improvement of symptoms and clinical stabilization of SAVMs in all patients during a mean of 55 months (range 7-228) of follow-up.

Understanding the impact of schools on the number of incident and cumulative COVID-19 cases is critical for decision-making. Objective: To determine the quantitative effect of schools being open relative to community-based non-pharmaceutical interventions on the number of COVID-19 cases. Design: An agent-based transmission model. Setting: A synthetic population of one million individuals based on the characteristics of the population of Ontario, Canada. Participants: Members of the synthetic population clustered into households, neighborhoods or rural districts, cities or a rural region, day care facilities, classrooms (primary, elementary or high school), colleges or universities and workplaces. Exposure: School reopening on September 15, 2020, versus schools remaining closed under different scenarios for non-pharmaceutical interventions. Main Outcome and Measures: Incident and cumulative COVID-19 cases between September 1, 2020 and October 31, 2020. Results: The percentage of infections among students and teachers acquired within schools was less than 5% across modelled scenarios. Incident case numbers on October 31, 2020, were 4,414 (95% credible interval, CrI: 3,491, 5,382) and 4,740 (95% CrI 3,863, 5,691), for schools remaining closed versus reopening, respectively, with no other community-based non-pharmaceutical intervention; 714 (95%, CrI: 568, 908) and 780 (95% CrI 580, 993) for schools remaining closed versus reopening, respectively, with community-based non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented; 777 (95% credible CrI: 621, 993) and 803 (95% CrI 617, 990) for schools remaining closed versus reopening, respectively, applied to the observed case numbers in Ontario in early October 2020. Contrasting the scenarios with implementation of community-based interventions versus not doing so yielded a mean difference of 39,355 cumulative COVID-19 cases by October 31, 2020, while keeping schools closed versus reopening them yielded a mean difference of 2,040 cases. Conclusions and relevance: Our simulations suggest that the majority of COVID-19 infections in schools were due to acquisition in the community rather than transmission within schools and that the effect of school reopening on COVID-19 case numbers is relatively small compared to the effects of community-based non-pharmaceutical interventions.","output":"The potential impact of School Closure Relative to Community-based Non-pharmaceutical Interventions on COVID-19 Cases in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread and led to global health crises.

Thus, human gastrointestinal cell models are urgently needed for COVID-19 research; however, it is difficult to obtain primary human intestinal cells. In this study, we examined whether human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived small intestinal epithelial cells (iPSC-SIECs) could be used as a SARS-CoV-2 infection model. We observed that iPSC-SIECs, such as absorptive and Paneth cells, were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and remdesivir treatment decreased intracellular SARS-CoV-2 replication in iPSC-SIECs. SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased expression levels of tight junction markers, ZO-3 and CLDN1, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), which evaluates the integrity of tight junction dynamics. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection increased expression levels of proinflammatory genes, which are elevated in patients with COVID-19.

Much research has been published on this virus, and discoveries indicate that oxidative stress contributes to the possibility of getting sick from the new SARS-CoV-2. It follows that free radical scavengers may be useful for the treatment of coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19). This report investigates the antioxidant properties of nine antivirals, two anticancer molecules, one antibiotic, one antioxidant found in orange juice (Hesperidin), one anthelmintic and one antiparasitic (Ivermectin). A molecule that is apt for scavenging free radicals can be either an electron donor or electron acceptor. The results I present here show Valrubicin as the best electron acceptor (an anticancer drug with three F atoms in its structure) and elbasvir as the best electron donor (antiviral for chronic hepatitis C). Most antiviral drugs are good electron donors, meaning that they are molecules capable of reduzing other molecules. Ivermectin and Molnupiravir are two powerful COVID-19 drugs that are not good electron acceptors, and the fact that they are not as effective oxidants as other molecules may be an advantage. Electron acceptor molecules oxidize other molecules and affect the conditions necessary for viral infection, such as the replication and spread of the virus, but they may also oxidize molecules that are essential for life. This means that the weapons used to defend us from COVID-19 may also harm us. This study posits the idea that oxide reduction balance may help explain the toxicity or efficacy of these drugs. These results represent a further advance on the road towards understanding the action mechanisms of drugs used as possible treatments for COVID-19.

Accordingly, we aimed to examine the link between engaging in activities during COVID-19 and psychological distress among Holocaust survivors with varying levels of post-traumatic symptoms (PTS) and comparisons (not directly exposed to the Holocaust). DESIGN A cross-sectional design composed of Holocaust survivors and a comparison group. SETTING Participants were interviewed face-to-face, over the telephone, or filled the scales online at their leisure. PARTICIPANTS Data were collected from 131 older Jewish Israelis (age range 76-94, M = 82.73, SD = 4.09), who were divided into three groups (comparisons; low-PTS survivors; high-PTS survivors). MEASUREMENTS Participants completed scales assessing PTS, activity engagement, and psychological distress and provided additional sociodemographic, medical, and COVID-19-related information. RESULTS When activity engagement was low, high-PTS survivors reported extremely high levels of psychological distress relative to low-PTS survivors and comparisons. However, when activity engagement was high, these group differences were considerably reduced, as the psychological distress of high-PTS survivors was significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS The study highlights the importance of daily planning and activity engagement for Holocaust survivors with high PTS levels in reducing psychological distress. Clinicians are urged to take this factor into account when dealing with the psychological effects of COVID-19 on survivors and on traumatized older adults in general.","output":"Activity engagement and psychological distress among Holocaust survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter considers three radical and different examples of the heritage industry.

Twenty-eight dogs were classified in four groups: (i) control group received 1 mL of sterile 0.9% saline solution; (ii) LBSap group received 600 g of Leishmania braziliensis promastigotes protein and 1 mg of saponin adjuvant; (iii) Leishmune(?); and (iv) Leish-Tec(?). The safety and toxicity of the vaccines were measured before and after three immunizations by clinical, biochemical, and hematological parameters. The clinical examinations revealed that some dogs of LBSap and Leishmune(?) groups presented changes at the site of vaccination inoculum, such as nodules, mild edema, and local pain, which were transient and disappeared seventy-two hours after vaccination, but these results indicate that adverse changes caused by the immunizations are tolerable. The immunogenicity results demonstrate an increase of B lymphocytes CD21(+) regarding the Leishmune(?) group and monocytes CD14(+) concerning LBSap and Leishmune(?) groups. In the in vitro analyses, an increase in lymphoproliferative activity in LBSap and Leishmune(?) groups was observed, with an increase of antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes in the LBSap group. A second approach of in vitro assays aimed at evaluating the percentage of antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes producers of IFN- and IL-4, where an increase in both IFN- producing subpopulations in the LBSap group was observed, also showed an increase in IFN- producers in CD8(+) lymphocytes in the Leish-Tec(?) group. Our data regarding immunogenicity indicate that the vaccination process, especially with the LBSap vaccine, generated a protective immune response compatible with L. infantum parasite control.

However, although SARS infected some 10,000 individuals, killing around 1000, it did not lead to the devastating health impact that many feared, but a rather disproportionate economic impact. The disproportionate scale and nature of this impact has caused concern that outbreaks of more serious disease could cause catastrophic impacts on the global economy. Understanding factors that led to the impact of SARS might help to deal with the possible impact and management of such other infectious disease outbreaks. In this respect, the role of riskits perception, communication and managementis critical. This paper looks at the role that risk, and especially the perception of risk, its communication and management, played in driving the economic impact of SARS. It considers the public and public health response to SARS, the role of the media and official organisations, and proposes policy and research priorities for establishing a system to better deal with the next global infectious disease outbreak. It is concluded that the potential for the rapid spread of infectious disease is not necessarily a greater threat than it has always been, but the effect that an outbreak can have on the economy is, which requires further research and policy development.","output":"Responding to global infectious disease outbreaks: Lessons from SARS on the role of risk perception, communication and management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are plenty of parking spaces in big cities, but we often find nowhere to park The reason is the lack of prediction of parking behavior If we could provide parking behavior in advance, we can ease this parking problem that affects human well-being We observe that parking lots have periodic parking patterns, which is an important factor for parking behavior prediction Unfortunately, existing work ignores such periodic parking patterns in parking behavior prediction, and thus incurs low accuracy To solve this problem, we propose PewLSTM, a novel periodic weather-aware LSTM model that successfully predicts the parking behavior based on historical records, weather, environments, weekdays, and events PewLSTM consists of two parts: a periodic weather-aware LSTM prediction module and an event prediction module, for predicting parking behaviors in regular days and events Based on 910,477 real parking records in 904 days from 13 parking lots, PewLSTM yields 93 84% parking prediction accuracy, which is about 30% higher than the state-of-the-art parking behavior prediction method We have also analyzed parking behaviors in events like holidays and COVID-19;PewLSTM can also handle parking behavior prediction in events and reaches 90 68% accuracy IEEE","output":"Periodic Weather-Aware LSTM with Event Mechanism for Parking Behavior Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elderly people are the most sensitive and delicate part of society who must bear the major burn of disruptive social behavior of human being amidst the 2019 coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

We explored the impact of local and national events on students ability to name racism on a public health exam highlighting the impact of racism on maternal and infant health disparities for Black mothers. METHODS: We undertook this research within the context of an undergraduate introductory public health course at a primarily white institution in the Northeastern part of the United States. A qualitative content analysis of undergraduate student responses to a final exam question soliciting the importance of racism to health outcomes among Black mothers in the United States was undertaken. ANOVA tests were run to assess differences on naming racism, using semantic alternatives, and providing alternative explanations during three main time periods: prior to the election of the 45th president of the United States (pre-Trump), after the election (post-Trump), and after a nationally recognized racist campus incident. RESULTS: Between the pre- and post-Trump periods we see no differences in naming racism or providing alternative explanations. We do see a reduction in the proportion of students providing semantic alternatives for racism in the post-Trump period (32.2 vs. 25.2%, p = 0.034).

It is widely accepted that using low-discrepancy sequences instead of pseudorandom numbers in most cases increases the accuracy. It is important to understand and quantify the reasons for this effect. In this work, we use Global Sensitivity Analysis in order to study one widely used model for pricing of options, namely the Heston model. The Heston model is an important member of the family of the stochastic volatility models, which have been found to better describe the observed behaviour of option prices in the financial markets. By using a suitable numerical scheme, like those of Euler, Milstein, Kahl-J?ckel, Andersen, one has the flexibility needed to compute European, Asian or exotic options. In any case the problem of evaluating an option price can be considered as a numerical integration problem. For the purposes of modelling and complexity reduction, one should make the distinction between the model nominal dimension and its effective dimension. Another notion of average dimension has been found to be more practical from the computational point of view. The definitions and methods of evaluation of effective dimensions are based on computing Sobol sensitivity indices. A classification of functions based on their effective dimensions is also known. In the context of quantitative finance, Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) can be used to assess the efficiency of a particular numerical scheme. In this work we apply GSA based on Sobol sensitivity indices in order to assess the interactions of the various dimensions in using the above mentioned schemes.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a stepped wedge pre-implementation and post-implementation design, including all 106 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England implementing a local CO@h programme. All symptomatic people with a positive COVID-19 PCR test result from 1 October 2020 to 3 May 2021, and who were aged 65 years or identified as clinically extremely vulnerable were included. Care home residents were excluded. A pre-intervention period before implementation of the CO@h programme in each CCG was compared with a post-intervention period after implementation. Five outcome measures within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test: (i) death from any cause; (ii) any ED attendance; (iii) any emergency hospital admission; (iv) critical care admission and (v) total length of hospital stay. RESULTS: 217 650 people were eligible and included in the analysis. Total enrolment onto the programme was low, with enrolment data received for only 5527 (2.5%) of the eligible population. The period of implementation of the programme was not associated with mortality or length of hospital stay. The period of implementation was associated with increased health service utilisation with a 12% increase in the odds of ED attendance (95% CI: 6% to 18%) and emergency hospital admission (95% CI: 5% to 20%) and a 24% increase in the odds of critical care admission in those admitted (95% CI: 5% to 47%). In a secondary analysis of CO@h sites with at least 10% or 20% of eligible people enrolled, there was no significant association with any outcome measure. CONCLUSION: At a population level, there was no association with mortality before and after the implementation period of the CO@h programme, and small increases in health service utilisation were observed. However, lower than expected enrolment is likely to have diluted the effects of the programme at a population level.","output":"Population-level impact of a pulse oximetry remote monitoring programme on mortality and healthcare utilisation in the people with COVID-19 in England: a national analysis using a stepped wedge design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, various digestive symptoms have been frequently reported in patients infected with the virus. In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms. METHODS: In this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment. Data were followed up until March 18, 2020. RESULTS: In the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed. The average age was 52.9 years (SD  16), including 107 men and 97 women. Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases). If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days). In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms. As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced. Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms. DISCUSSION: We found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels. Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms. However, further large sample studies are needed to confirm these findings.","output":"Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients With Digestive Symptoms in Hubei, China: A Descriptive, Cross-Sectional, Multicenter Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: RNA vaccines against Covid-19 have demonstrated a??95% efficacy in Phase III clinical trials. Although complete vaccination consisted of two-doses, the onset of protection for both licensed RNA vaccines was observed as early as 12 days after a single dose.

Methods: Serological and T cell analysis was performed in a cohort of 20 healthcare workers after receiving the first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine. The primary endpoint was the adaptive immune responses detectable at Days 7 and 10 after dosing. Results: Spike-specific T cells and binding antibodies were detectable 10 days after the first dose of vaccine, in contrast to receptor-blocking and SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies which were mostly undetectable at this early time-point.

We used theoretical, NMR, fluorescent-dye binding, and electrophoretic mobility methods to comprehensively measure protonation of both the ionizable lipid and the formulated LNP. The pKa of the ionizable lipid was 2-3 units higher than the pKa of the LNP primarily due to proton solvation energy differences between the LNP and aqueous medium. We exploited these results to explain a wide range of delivery efficiencies in vitro and in vivo for intramuscular (IM) and intravascular (IV) administration of different ionizable lipids at escalating ionizable lipid-to-mRNA ratios in the LNP. In addition, we determined that more negatively charged LNPs exhibit higher off-target systemic expression of mRNA in the liver following IM administration. This undesirable systemic off-target expression of mRNA-LNP vaccines could be minimized through appropriate design of the ionizable lipid and LNP.","output":"Ionization and structural properties of mRNA lipid nanoparticles influence expression in intramuscular and intravascular administration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 epidemic in the United States has been characterized by two stark disparities. COVID-19 burden has been unequally distributed among racial and ethnic groups and at the same time the mortality rates have been sharply higher among older age groups. These disparities have led some to suggest that higher equity could be attained by vaccinating front-line workers before vaccinating older individuals, who in the US are disproportionately Non-Hispanic White. Methods: We compare the performance of two distribution policies, one allocating vaccines to front-line workers and another to older individuals aged 65-74-year-old. We estimate both the number of lives saved and the number of years of life saved under each of the policies, overall and in every race/ethnicity groups, in the United States and every state. Findings: We show that prioritizing COVID-19 vaccines for 65-74-year-olds saves both more lives and more years of life than attributing vaccines front-line workers in each racial/ethnic group, in the United States as a whole and in nearly every state. Interpretation: When evaluating equity in vaccine allocation policies, the overall benefit to impact of each population subgroup should be considered, not only the proportion of doses that is distributed to each subgroup.

Its apparent endemicity and the wide spread of its reservoir host (dromedary camels) in the Arabian Peninsula highlight the ongoing public health threat of this virus. Therefore, development of effective prophylactic vaccine needs to be urgently explored given that there are no approved prophylactics or therapeutics for humans or animals to date. Different vaccine candidates have been investigated but serious safety concerns remain over protein or full-length spike (S) protein-based vaccines. Here, we investigated the immunogenicity of naked DNA vaccines expressing different fragments of MERS-CoV S protein in mice. We found that plasmids expressing full-length (pS) or S1-subunit (pS1) could induce significant levels of S1-specific antibodies (Abs) but with distinct IgG isotype patterns. Specifically, pS1 immunization elicited a balanced Th1/Th2 response and generally higher levels of all IgG isotypes compared to pS vaccination. Interestingly, only mice immunized with pS1 demonstrated significant S1-specific cellular immune response. Importantly, both constructs induced cross-neutralizing Abs against multiple strains of human and camel origins. These results indicate that vaccines expressing S1-subunit of the MERS-CoV S protein could represent a potential vaccine candidate without the possible safety concerns associated with full-length protein-based vaccines.","output":"Immunogenicity of Candidate MERS-CoV DNA Vaccines Based on the Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nearly all patients arrived wearing no masks due to their injuries and all were confined together in emergency departments.

Such hazards involve significant uncertainty, which must be translated into concrete plans able to be implemented by disaster workers. Little research has explored how disaster managers incorporate different forms of knowledge and uncertainty into preparations for simultaneous hazards or disaster events, or how front-line disaster workers respond to and implement these plans. In this paper I draw on ethnographic research working as a wildland firefighter, interviews with firefighters and fire managers, and state and agency planning documents to examine preparations for two events occurring in Central Oregon in August 2017: (1) the height of wildfire season and (2) hundreds of thousands of anticipated visitors for a total solar eclipse. I find that different qualities of risk, hazard, and uncertainty across these two events were central to the development and implementation of disaster plans. Agency leaders devised worst-case scenario plans for the eclipse based on uncertain predictions regarding hazards from the eclipse and the occurrence of severe wildfires, aiming to eliminate the potential for unknown hazards. These plans were generally met with skepticism by front-line disaster workers. Despite the uncertainties that dominated eclipse-planning rhetoric, firefighters largely identified risks from the eclipse that were risks they dealt with in their daily work as firefighters. I conclude by discussing implications of these findings for conceptual understandings of disaster planning as well as contemporary concerns about skepticism and conspiracy theories directed at government planning and response to disaster events.","output":"Staring at the Sun during Wildfire Season: Knowledge, Uncertainty, and Front-Line Resistance in Disaster Preparation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To identify factors important to patients for their return to elective imaging during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: In all, 249 patients had elective MRIs postponed from March 23, 2020, to April 24, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of these patients, 99 completed a 22-question survey about living arrangement and health care follow-up, effect of imaging postponement, safety of imaging, and factors important for elective imaging. Mann-Whitney U, Fishers exact, (2) tests, and logistic regression analyses were performed. Statistical significance was set to P  .05 with Bonferroni correction applied. RESULTS: Overall, 68% of patients felt imaging postponement had no impact or a small impact on health, 68% felt it was fairly or extremely safe to obtain imaging, and 53% thought there was no difference in safety between hospital-based and outpatient locations. Patients who already had imaging performed or rescheduled were more likely to feel it was safe to get an MRI (odds ratio [OR] 3.267, P = .028) and that the hospital setting was safe (OR 3.976, P = .004). Staff friendliness was the most important factor related to an imaging center visit (95% fairly or extremely important). Use of masks by staff was the top infection prevention measure (94% fairly or extremely important). Likelihood of rescheduling imaging decreased if a short waiting time was important (OR = 0.107, P = .030).

This exploratory study examines mothers and fathers' perceptions of their child's empathy and individual factors, such as age, gender, and personality, which are related to cognitive and affective empathy in 63 typically developing preschoolers. Links between children's individual characteristics (empathy and personality) and their social adjustment on the one hand and risk of developing internalized vs. externalized behaviors on the other were also investigated. Parents completed four questionnaires about their child's empathy, personality, and social (mal)adjustment. The results showed that mothers and fathers perceived their children's cognitive and affective empathy, attention to others' feelings, and social actions (such as helping), in the same way, except for emotion contagion. Gender differences appeared specifically for some components of empathy: girls were said to pay more attention to others' emotions while boys had better cognitive empathy. Moreover, children's empathy as perceived by mothers or fathers was positively linked with their age, and with personality factors (extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, and openness to experience). Cognitive empathy and personality were found to be partly related to higher social skills and lower externalized and internalized behaviors.

However, a second wave of the epidemic is expected in the fall if neither vaccine nor antiviral drugs become available. This study investigated the impact of non-pharmaceutical measures on short- and long-term outbreak dynamics. METHODS: A mathematical model based on Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model is developed considering isolated and behavior-changed groups. Using the least-squares fitting method, transmission and behavior change rates were estimated using cases reported from February 16 to April 20, 2020. FINDINGS: The estimated transmission rate of COVID-19 was 46180 and behavior change rate was 26044. The model predicted the number of new cases to continuously decrease, with less than one case expected after May 6, 2020. Concurrently, a 25% reduction in behavioral changes during the outbreak would increase the case count by 60,000, resulting in 4,000 cases at maximum, exceeding the medical systems capacity. As behavioral restrictions are eased, local transmission will likely increase, with forecasted second wave peak in October 2020. INTERPRETATION: Social distancing and public behavior changes have curbed the spread of COVID-19 in the ROK. Mathematical modeling demonstrates the importance of these measures in reducing and delaying outbreaks. Nevertheless, non-pharmaceutical interventions cannot eliminate the disease.

If airlines are to resume flying at commercially sustainable levels, they must work to restore passengers confidence and sense of security. This study examined commercial airline passengers' health concerns and attitudes towards infection prevention and control measures for travel health and safety in the current COVID-19 global pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted inviting adult members of 39 frequent flyer groups across three social media platforms to participate in an online survey. RESULTS: A total of 205 respondents completed the survey. The majority (75.6%) reported feeling 'somewhat' to 'extremely concerned' about contracting an infectious disease while flying, particularly respiratory-related. Few (9.8%) reported perceiving their health as an 'essential priority' for their preferred airline. Most respondents agreed airlines should provide complimentary hand sanitisers (86.8%), sanitary wipes (82.9%) and masks (64.4%) for passengers to use while flying as well as more information about preventing the spread of infections (90.7%), which would make the majority feel safer to fly.

DIC is a difficult complication for clinicians to manage as it is due to multiple underlying complications of pathophysiologic abnormalities in diverse disease states. Ongoing research continues to define the meaning of DIC, evaluate therapeutic options, and how it presents with the complex paradigm of systemic activation of coagulation. In this review we introduce the current topis regarding this tough situation. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Online search of published medical literature through MEDLINE and Web of Sience using the term \\"disseminated intravascular coagulation\\", \\"coagulopathy\\", \\"coagulation disorder\\", \\"hemostasis\\", \\"fibrinolysis\\", \\"thrombus\\" and \\"anticoagulants\\". EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Articles were chosen for inclusion based on their relevance to disseminated intravascular coagulation, coagulopathy, hemostasis and thrombosis in sepsis, COVID-19, trauma, and obstetrics. Reference lists were reviewed to identify additional relevant articles. CONCLUSIONS: DIC is recognized as a pathologically triggered and dysregulated systemic activation of coagulation in response to various noxious stimuli. DIC's phenotype and clinical manifestations can vary from prothrombotic to hemorrhagic, depending on the underlying diseases. However, the fundamental mechanisms of systemic and vascular endothelial dysfunction can be explained as different phases of the acute response, with an initial prothrombotic phase that can commonly change to hemostatic insufficiency. Thrombin is the key initiator of the pathophysiologic process along with endothelial injury and initially fibrinolysis activation followed by fibrinolysis suppression. There is no established approach for managing DIC beyond initially treating the underlying disease and replacement therapy for the management of coagulopathy. Targeting anticoagulation therapy with antithrombin concentrates and recombinant thrombomodulin for the prevention of microthrombus formation, and antifibrinolytic therapy using tranexamic acid for the coagulopathy after massive bleeding, continue to be studied as therapeutic options.","output":"Therapeutic strategies in patients with coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation: awareness of the phase-dependent characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The majority of catches by fishermen in Aceh, Indonesia are sold raw, directly to consumers, and in the local market This contributes to the low price of fish and low income for the fishermen, and the COVID-19 outbreak has made this situation even worse One solution could be the establishment of a cold storage business in the area This study assessed the financial feasibility of a 200-ton cold storage business in Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh province Using secondary data collected from online sources, we applied the most common financial indicators used in feasibility studies, namely Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) A sensitivity test was also performed to predict the feasibility of the cold storage business if the basic assumptions are changed We found that cold storage in Banda Aceh is financially feasible as the NPV was positive, the IRR was higher than the interest rate (i e , the discount rate), and the BCR was higher than 1 Besides, the sensitivity test also suggested that cold storage would still be feasible even if there were a 20% increase or decrease in storage capacity and project costs ?

More importantly, intimacy in romantic relationships is known to influence children's well-being and mental health. Couples who suffer from a lack of intimacy in their relationship are more vulnerable to psychophysiological disorders, depression and other non-psychiatric disorders and these disorders may have an impact on the children living with them. Under today's circumstances, little is known about the link of intimacy in romantic relationships with children's anxiety particularly within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study examines the relationship between intimacy in romantic and children's anxiety levels during COVID-19 disease. Participants were 12,126 Turkish couples (mean age=35.27 +/- 5.37) who completed the intimacy in romantic relationship scale and state-trait anxiety inventory for children online. Socio-demographic data form was created to measures variables such as age, gender, and the COVID-19 experiences. The results suggest that single couples were found to have a better romantic relationship than married couples. Self-disclosure, physical attraction, support, and trust were found to be related to anxiety levels of children. This pattern of results highlights the importance of intimacy in a romantic relationship on children anxiety levels in the face of adversity which have important implications for research and practice.","output":"Examining the Impact of Turkish Couples' Intimacy Levels in Romantic Relationship on Children's Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, was discovered as the agent of COVID-19 disease. Cardiac arrhythmias have been reported as frequent but their incidence is unknown. The aim of this research was to assess the real incidence of cardiac arrhythmias among COVID-19 patients admitted to Portuguese hospitals and to understand the underlying prognostic implications. METHODS: The Portuguese Association of Arrhythmology, Pacing and Electrophysiology (APAPE) conducted a survey in Portuguese hospitals to assess the occurrence of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients, their clinical characteristics, the use of experimental therapies and the impact on QT interval. RESULTS: Twenty hospitals participated, reporting 692 hospitalized patients. An arrhythmic episode occurred in 81 (11.7%) and 64 (79%) had detailed information on these episodes. New onset arrhythmias occurred in 41 (64%) patients, 45 (70.3%) male, median age 73.5 (61-80.3) years. There were 51 (79.7%) with associated comorbidities, mainly arterial hypertension (41, 64.1%). Of 53 patients (82.3%) on experimental therapy, 7 (10.9%) had an increased QTc interval. Regarding arrhythmias, two patients (3.1%) had ventricular tachycardia, 5 (7.8%) sinus bradycardia, 17 (26.6%) paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 40 (62.5%) atrial fibrillation or flutter. At the time of reporting, there had been no deaths due to arrhythmic syndrome or related complications. CONCLUSIONS: In a population of COVID-19 patients. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is high but not associated with increased cardiac mortality although it does though occur frequently in extremely ill patients and with multiple organ failure. Regardless of the use of experimental drugs, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is low and atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular arrhythmias are the most prevalent arrythmias.","output":"Cardiac arrhythmias in patients presenting with COVID-19 treated in Portuguese hospitals: A national registry from the Portuguese Association of Arrhythmology, Pacing and Electrophysiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data is already recognized as an essential piece for unlocking maximum value within a transportation system and it has the potential to create more efficient passenger mobility.

METHODS AND MATERIALS A total of 184 patients underwent radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. ORC cases (n = 94) were performed between June 2005 and July 2014 while iRARC cases (n = 90) were performed between June 2011 and July 2014. Primary outcome was recurrence free survival (RFS). Secondary outcomes were sites of local and metastatic recurrence, cancer specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Median follow-up for patients without recurrence was 33.8 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 20.5-45.4) for ORC; and 16.1 months (IQR: 11.2-27.0) for iRARC. No significant difference in age, sex, precystectomy T stage, precystectomy grade, or lymph node yield between ORC and iRARC was observed. The ORC cohort included more patients withpT2 (64.8% ORC vs. 38.9% iRARC) but fewer pT0 status (8.5% ORC vs.vs. 22.2% iRARC) due to lower preoperative chemotherapy use (22.3% ORC vs. 34.4% iRARC). Positive surgical margin rate was significantly higher in the ORC cohort (19.3% vs. 8.2%; P = 0.042). Kaplan-Meir analysis showed no significant difference in RFS (69.5% ORC vs. 78.8% iRARC), cancer specific survival (80.9% ORC vs. 84.4% iRARC), or OS (73.5% ORC vs.vs. iRARC 83.8%) at 24 months. Cox regression analysis showed RFS, cancer specific survival and OS were not influenced by cystectomy technique. No significant difference between local and metastatic RFS between ORC and iRARC was observed. CONCLUSION This study has found no difference in recurrence patterns or oncological outcomes between ORC and iRARC.

METHODS We conducted a prospective observational study in healthy volunteers (n = 50) and ICU septic shock patients (n=19). Brachioradialis (forearm) rSO2 measurements in healthy volunteers at rest and in ICU septic shock patients were compared. Pulmonary artery catheter monitoring was used in ICU patients. RESULTS Significant differences in rSO2 were observed between healthy volunteers and ICU septic shock patients at ICU admission (68.74.9 vs. 55.013.0; p<0.001). When comparing septic shock survivors and nonsurvivors, significant differences were observed in rSO2 at baseline (64.58.9 vs. 47.510.7; p<0.01), 12 hours (67.39.6 vs. 45.014.9; p<0.01), and 24 hours (65.77.0 vs. 50.110.3; p<0.01).

Nevertheless, resolving the importance of indirect and environmental transmission in the ecology of epidemics remains a persistent challenge. It requires accurately measuring the free-living survival of pathogens across reservoirs of various kinds and quantifying the extent to which interaction between hosts and reservoirs generates new infections. These questions are especially salient for emerging pathogens, where sparse and noisy data can obfuscate the relative contribution of different infection routes. In this study, we develop a mechanistic, mathematical model that permits both direct (host-to-host) and indirect (environmental) transmission and then fit this model to empirical data from 17 countries affected by an emerging virus (SARS-CoV-2). From an ecological perspective, our model highlights the potential for environmental transmission to drive complex, nonlinear dynamics during infectious disease outbreaks. Summarizing, we propose that fitting alternative models with indirect transmission to real outbreak data from SARS-CoV-2 can be useful, as it highlights that indirect mechanisms may play an underappreciated role in the dynamics of infectious diseases, with implications for public health.","output":"Variation in microparasite free-living survival and indirect transmission can modulate the intensity of emerging outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Here, we investigate the genetic architecture of MG via a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the largest MG data set analysed to date. METHODS We performed GWAS meta-analysis integrating three different data sets (total of 1401 cases and 3508 controls). We carried out human leucocyte antigen (HLA) fine-mapping, gene-based and tissue enrichment analyses and investigated genetic correlation with 13 other autoimmune disorders as well as pleiotropy across MG and correlated disorders. RESULTS We confirmed the previously reported MG association with TNFRSF11A (rs4369774; p=1.0910-13, OR=1.4). Furthermore, gene-based analysis revealed AGRN as a novel MG susceptibility gene. HLA fine-mapping pointed to two independent MG loci: HLA-DRB1 and HLA-B. MG onset-specific analysis reveals differences in the genetic architecture of early-onset MG (EOMG) versus late-onset MG (LOMG). Furthermore, we find MG to be genetically correlated with type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), late-onset vitiligo and autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD). Cross-disorder meta-analysis reveals multiple risk loci that appear pleiotropic across MG and correlated disorders. DISCUSSION Our gene-based analysis identifies AGRN as a novel MG susceptibility gene, implicating for the first time a locus encoding a protein (agrin) that is directly relevant to NMJ activation. Mutations in AGRN have been found to underlie congenital myasthenic syndrome. Our results are also consistent with previous studies highlighting the role of HLA and TNFRSF11A in MG aetiology and the different risk genes in EOMG versus LOMG. Finally, we uncover the genetic correlation of MG with T1D, RA, ATD and late-onset vitiligo, pointing to shared underlying genetic mechanisms.","output":"Myasthenia gravis genome-wide association study implicates AGRN as a risk locus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A signifcant concern of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the dramatic decrease in the number of blood donation drives across Malaysia The pandemic is putting a strain on the blood inventory and supply, especially to transfusion-dependent patients;i e , thalassemia major, sickle cell disease and cancer patients This is a retrospective cross-sectional study carried out at the Transfusion Medicine Unit, Hospital USM from December 2019 to April 2020 Data on blood donation and blood component usage were collected and tabulated three months (18th December 2019 to 17th March 2020) before movement control order (MCO) and during the frst phase of MCO (18th March to 17th April 2020) Whole blood units that were donated via mobile drives were predominantly affected with the number of blood donors in blood mobiles decreased by 80 7% during MCO The decreasing pattern was due to the cancellation of 25 mobile drives, which targeted 1267 blood donors Blood usage was also escalating down to 840 during the CO, which was due to no elective operations, admissions, or procedures done during the MCO Routine blood donation and collection thus need to be resumed in less affected areas to meet the clinical needs with greater precaution against COVID-19 infections ? 2021, Penerbit UMT All Rights Reserved","output":"Blood Collection and Usage during Coronavirus Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Arginine-glycine(-glycine) (RG/RGG) regions are highly abundant in RNA-binding proteins and involved in numerous physiological processes. Aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and stress granule (SGs) association of RG/RGG regions in the cytoplasm have been implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders. LLPS and SG association of these proteins is regulated by the interaction with nuclear import receptors, such as transportin-1 (TNPO1), and by post-translational arginine methylation. Strikingly, many RG/RGG proteins harbour potential phosphorylation sites within or close to their arginine methylated regions, indicating a regulatory role. Here, we studied the role of phosphorylation within RG/RGG regions on arginine methylation, TNPO1-binding and LLPS using the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) as a paradigm. We show that the RG/RGG region of CIRBP is in vitro phosphorylated by serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1), and discovered two novel phosphorylation sites in CIRBP. SRPK1-mediated phosphorylation of the CIRBP RG/RGG region impairs LLPS and binding to TNPO1 in vitro and interferes with SG association in cells. Furthermore, we uncovered that arginine methylation of the CIRBP RG/RGG region regulates in vitro phosphorylation by SRPK1.

This study explores the ethnobotanical uses of plants used to make wooden bowls to understand their sustainability, cultural significance, and current status of related traditional knowledge in Gyirong Town, which is one of the most famous places for wooden bowl making. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2019 and 2021, key informant interviews, semi-structured interviews, and participatory observations were used to conduct ethnobotanical field surveys in Gyirong Valley. The field work was performed with the assistance of local guides. In this study, we utilized a use-report (UR) to reflect the number of mentions of a species by locals. RESULTS: Our results show that 16 different plants are used during the wooden bowl making process, of which nine are used as raw materials, three for dyeing, and four for varnishing. Although communities rely heavily on these plants, good management and collection methods were observed. We also documented the use of Fallopia denticulata as a red dye and four species of Impatiens as wood varnishes for the first time. CONCLUSION: The wooden bowl craftsmen and their housewives have a wealth of traditional knowledge of using plants to make wooden bowls in Gyirong Town.

As such, the identification and precise quantification of mosaic mutations is essential for a wide range of research applications, clinical diagnoses, and early detection of cancers. Currently, the low-throughput nature of single allele assays (e.g., allele-specific ddPCR) commonly used for genotyping known mutations at very low alternate allelic fractions (AAFs) have limited the integration of low-level mosaic analyses into clinical and research applications. The growing importance of mosaic mutations requires a more rapid, low-cost solution for mutation detection and validation. METHODS: To overcome these limitations, we developed Multiple Independent Primer PCR Sequencing (MIPP-Seq) which combines the power of ultra-deep sequencing and truly independent assays. The accuracy of MIPP-seq to quantifiable detect and measure extremely low allelic fractions was assessed using a combination of SNVs, insertions, and deletions at known allelic fractions in blood and brain derived DNA samples. RESULTS: The Independent amplicon analyses of MIPP-Seq markedly reduce the impact of allelic dropout, amplification bias, PCR-induced, and sequencing artifacts. Using low DNA inputs of either 25 ng or 50 ng of DNA, MIPP-Seq provides sensitive and quantitative assessments of AAFs as low as 0.025% for SNVs, insertion, and deletions. CONCLUSIONS: MIPP-Seq provides an ultra-sensitive, low-cost approach for detecting and validating known and novel mutations in a highly scalable system with broad utility spanning both research and clinical diagnostic testing applications. The scalability of MIPP-Seq allows for multiplexing mutations and samples, which dramatically reduce costs of variant validation when compared to methods like ddPCR. By leveraging the power of individual analyses of multiple unique and independent reactions, MIPP-Seq can validate and precisely quantitate extremely low AAFs across multiple tissues and mutational categories including both indels and SNVs. Furthermore, using Illumina sequencing technology, MIPP-seq provides a robust method for accurate detection of novel mutations at an extremely low AAF.","output":"MIPP-Seq: ultra-sensitive rapid detection and validation of low-frequency mosaic mutations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery? (FES) program consists of online materials and didactic and skills-based tests. All components were designed to measure the skills and knowledge required to perform safe flexible endoscopy. The purpose of this multicenter study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the hands-on component of the FES examination, and to establish the pass score. METHODS Expert endoscopists identified the critical skill set required for flexible endoscopy. They were then modeled in a virtual reality simulator (GI Mentor? II, Simbionix? Ltd., Airport City, Israel) to create five tasks and metrics. Scores were designed to measure both speed and precision. Validity evidence was assessed by correlating performance with self-reported endoscopic experience (surgeons and gastroenterologists [GIs]). Internal consistency of each test task was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Test-retest reliability was determined by having the same participant perform the test a second time and comparing their scores. Passing scores were determined by a contrasting groups methodology and use of receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS A total of 160 participants (17 % GIs) performed the simulator test. Scores on the five tasks showed good internal consistency reliability and all had significant correlations with endoscopic experience. Total FES scores correlated 0.73, with participants' level of endoscopic experience providing evidence of their validity, and their internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.82. Test-retest reliability was assessed in 11 participants, and the intraclass correlation was 0.85. The passing score was determined and is estimated to have a sensitivity (true positive rate) of 0.81 and a 1-specificity (false positive rate) of 0.21. CONCLUSIONS The FES hands-on skills test examines the basic procedural components required to perform safe flexible endoscopy. It meets rigorous standards of reliability and validity required for high-stakes examinations, and, together with the knowledge component, may help contribute to the definition and determination of competence in endoscopy.","output":"Fundamentals of endoscopic surgery: creation and validation of the hands-on test."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the COVID-19 pandemic affects the emergency medical service (EMS) system, little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prognosis of emergency patients.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between neighbourhood-level material deprivation and immunologic and virologic response to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) among people living with HIV in Canada. METHODS: The Canadian Observational Cohort (CANOC) is a longitudinal cohort of people living with HIV, containing data from 2000C2016 from 5 Canadian provinces. We defined response to combination ART as positive if the CD4 cell count increased by 50 cells/mm(3) (0.05 cells  10(9)/L) or more (CD4+) and viral load decreased to 50 copies/mL or less (VL+) within 6 months of treatment initiation. We further categorized response to therapy as concordant positive (CD4+/VL+), concordant negative (CD4?/VL?) or discordant (CD4+/VL? or CD4?/VL+). We used adjusted multinomial logistic regression to quantify the relation between neighbourhood-level material deprivation and immunologic and virologic response. RESULTS: This study included 8274 people living with HIV, of which 1754 (21.2%) lived in the most materially deprived neighbourhoods. Most individuals (62.2%) showed a concordant positive response to combination ART. After adjustment, living in the most materially deprived neighbourhoods was associated with a CD4?/VL+ discordant response (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06C1.62) and a concordant negative response (adjusted OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.13C1.86), using a concordant positive response as the reference. No other deprivation quartile was independently associated with a particular response.

Sputum samples from 20 COVID-19 patients and healthy controls were collected, respectively. During the isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus, exosome-like vesicles were found associated with virions under transmission electron microscope. Next, the expression of IL6 and TGF- increased in exosomes derived from the sputum of patients, and these were highly correlated with the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Further, proximity barcoding assay (PBA) was used to investigate the immune related proteins in the exosomes, as well as the relationship between exosomes and SARS-CoV-2 N protein in COVID-19 patients samples. Particularly, to investigate the differential contribution of the specific exosome subsets, the protein expression of a single exosome was detected and analyzed for the first time. Among the 40 exosome subpopulations, 18 were found to have significant differences.

Patients who were admitted to the ED were triaged as COVID-19 infected and who agreed to undergo LUS/LCT (lung computed tomography) were included in the study. Results: Included in the study were 40 patients who had been prediagnosed with COVID-19. Pneumonia was detected with LCT in 32 (80%) patients, while the LUS examination identified pneumonia in 23 patients. The most common finding in LCT was ground-glass opacity (na?= 29, 90.6%). Of the 23 patients with pneumonia findings in LUS, 15 (65.2%) had direct consolidation. Among the 32 patients who were found to have pneumonia as a result of LCT, 20 (62.5%) had signs of pneumonia on LUS examination, and 12 had no signs of pneumonia. In addition, 3 patients showed no signs of pneumonia with LCT, but they were misdiagnosed with pneumonia by LUS. The sensitivity of LUS in the diagnosis of pneumonia in the COVID-19 patients was 62.5%, while its specificity was 62.5%.

While the imbalanced innate immune response of end-stage COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the mucosal entry site have remained unexplored. Here we employed SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection in native multi-cell-type human nasal turbinate and lung tissues ex vivo, coupled with genome-wide transcriptional analysis, to investigate viral susceptibility and early patterns of local-mucosal innate immune response in the authentic milieu of the human respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected the nasal turbinate tissues, predominantly targeting respiratory epithelial cells, with rapid increase in tissue-associated viral sub-genomic mRNA, and secretion of infectious viral progeny. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered robust antiviral and inflammatory innate immune responses in the nasal mucosa. The upregulation of interferon stimulated genes, cytokines and chemokines, related to interferon signaling and immune-cell activation pathways, was broader than that triggered by influenza virus infection. Conversely, lung tissues exhibited a restricted innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, with a conspicuous lack of type I and III interferon upregulation, contrasting with their vigorous innate immune response to influenza virus. Our findings reveal differential tissue-specific innate immune responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract, that are distinct to SARS-CoV-2. The studies shed light on the role of the nasal-mucosa in active viral transmission and immune defense, implying a window of opportunity for early interventions, whereas the restricted innate immune response in early-SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues could underlie the unique uncontrolled late-phase lung damage of advanced COVID-19. IMPORTANCE In order to reduce the late-phase morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, there is a need to better understand and target the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human respiratory tract. Here we have studied the initial steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent innate immune responses within the natural multicellular complexity of human nasal-mucosal and lung tissues. Comparing the global innate response patterns of nasal and lung tissues, infected in parallel with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, we have revealed distinct virus-host interactions in the upper and lower respiratory tract, which could determine the outcome and unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies in the nasal-mucosal infection model can be employed to assess the impact of viral evolutionary changes, and evaluate new therapeutic and preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory pathogens.","output":"Human nasal and lung tissues infected ex vivo with SARS-CoV-2 provide insights into differential tissue-specific and virus-specific innate immune responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) a seronegative inflammatory disease that often presents with co-existing issues like bilateral hip replacements, nephrolithiasis, skin lesions, peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease..

The levels of particulate matter have been shown to have decreased after regional and national lockdowns in a number of countries. COVID-19 possesses an elevated reproduction number (R(0)) due to its high transmission rate. COVID-19 genes have been found adherent to particulate matter which has been suggested as a vector for this virus transmission. Following lockdown in China, the original viral Clade D steadily decreased mirroring the decline in particulate matter. Two months after the COVID-19 index case was reported in Wuhan early December 2019, a persistent mutation was noted at the D614 gene position of the viral spike protein establishing the Clade G variant. Clade G started to appear early in February and steadily attained predominance after lockdown in late February. It may be postulated that the changes in the source of airborne particulate matter, possibly derived from tobacco smoking, may have contributed to the appearance of Clade G. Once the pandemic spread beyond China, in all countries affected except for Iceland, a consistent pattern arose whereby the initial viral Clade D outbreak was rapidly displaced by Clade G. It is hypothesized that changes in the source of COVID-19s vector in the form of particulate matter may have contributed to natural selection favouring Clade G. The open orientation of Clade G spike proteins three peptides as opposed to the closed orientation of the Clade D may have allowed easier adherence of the viral mutant to cells and as a corollary also to particulate matter. There may also have been differences between both viral Clades in the spike proteins hydrophobic properties. Experimental research on the hypothesis that particulate matter may potentially act as a COVID-19 vector needs to be undertaken. Besides the potential vector effect, the deleterious effects of particulate matter on respiratory immunity and cardiovascular health are well known and consequently airborne pollution in all its forms should be addressed on a global scale.","output":"Could changes in the airborne pollutant particulate matter acting as a viral vector have exerted selective pressure to cause COVID-19 evolution?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo: analisar a incidncia e mortalidade por COVID-19 na popula??o idosa no Brasil e sua rela??o com variveis contextuais Mtodos: foram includas as 22 Unidades Federativas brasileiras que apresentaram 50 bitos ou mais por COVID-19 at o dia 25 de maio de 2020 Considerou-se como variveis dependentes as taxas de incidncia acumulada, mortalidade acumulada e letalidade acumulada em idosos Entre as variveis contextuais, foram includas a oferta de servi?os e profissionais de sade, indicadores demogrficos, de renda e desenvolvimento As variveis foram analisadas de forma descritiva e bivariada pela correla??o de Spearman Resultados: o estado do Par apresentou a maior taxa de incidncia e mortalidade em idosos As maiores taxas de letalidade acumulada entre os idosos foram observadas na Bahia (56,46%), Rio de Janeiro (48,10%) e Pernambuco (40,76%) Observou-se correla??o moderada negativa significativa entre a taxa de incidncia acumulada e o ndice de envelhecimento (rho= -0,662;p=0,001) e a propor??o de idosos (rho= -0,659;p=0,002);e entre a taxa de mortalidade e o ndice de envelhecimento (rho= -0,520;p=0,013) e a propor??o de idosos (rho= -0,502;p=0,017) A taxa de incidncia acumulada e a taxa de mortalidade tambm apresentaram, respectivamente, correla??o moderada positiva significativa com a propor??o de pretos e pardos (rho=0,524;p=0,018 e rho=0,558;p=0,007) e com a raz?o de renda (rho=0,665;p=0,0001 e rho=0,683;p&lt;0,001) Conclus?es: a situa??o epidemiolgica brasileira mostra que a mortalidade de idosos por COVID-19 no Brasil est relacionada a aspectos demogrficos e de distribui??o de renda Objective: to analyze the incidence of and mortality caused by COVID-19 in the older population in Brazil and its relationship with contextual variables Methods: the 22 Brazilian states (including the Federal District) with 50 deaths or more due to COVID-19 by May 25th, 2020 were included The rates of accumulated incidence, accumulated mortality and accumulated lethality among older adults were considered as dependent variables Among the contextual variables, the provision of health services and professionals, and demographic, income and development indicators were included The variables were analyzed in a descriptive and bivariate manner using Spearman&#039;s correlation Results: the state of Par had the highest incidence and mortality rate among older adults The highest accumulated lethality rates among this population were observed in Bahia (56 46%), Rio de Janeiro (48 10%) and Pernambuco (40 76%) There was a significant negative moderate correlation between the accumulated incidence rate and the aging index (rho=-0 662;p=0 001) and the proportion of older adults (rho=-0 659;p=0 002);and between the mortality rate and the aging index (rho=-0 520;p=0 013) and the proportion of older adults (rho=-0 502;p=0 017) The accumulated incidence rate and mortality rate also revealed, respectively, a significant positive correlation with the proportion of black (AfroBrazilian) and brown (mixed race) skinned people (rho=0 524;p=0 018 and rho=0 558;p=0 007) and with the income ratio (rho=0 665;p=0 0001 and rho=0 683;p&lt;0 001) Conclusions: the Brazilian epidemiological situation shows that the mortality of older adults due to COVID-19 in Brazil is related to demographic and income distribution aspects","output":"Incidncia e mortalidade por COVID-19 na popula??o idosa brasileira e sua rela??o com indicadores contextuais: um estudo ecolgico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has been recognized as a global threat, and several studies are being conducted using various mathematical models","output":"Assessment of Lockdown Effectiveness in the Wake of COVID-19 in India Using ARIMA Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Previous studies have indicated inferior responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients.

We evaluated sensitivity and specificity of five different widely used commercial serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2Cspecific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies using reverse transcriptase-PCR assay in nasopharyngeal swab as reference standard test. Methods: A total of 337 plasma samples collected in the period AprilCJune 2020 from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive (n = 207) and negative (n = 130) subjects were investigated by one point-of-care lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA IgG and IgM, Technogenetics) and four fully automated assays: two chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA-iFlash IgG and IgM, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech and CLIA-LIAISON(?) XL IgG, DiaSorin), one electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA-Elecsys(?) total predominant IgG, Roche), and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA IgA, Euroimmune). Results: The overall sensitivity of all IgG serological assays was >80% and the specificity was >97%. The sensitivity of IgG assays was lower within 2 weeks from the onset of symptoms ranging from 70.8 to 80%. The LFIA and CLIA-iFlash IgM showed an overall low sensitivity of 47.6 and 54.6%, while the specificity was 98.5 and 96.2%, respectively. The ELISA IgA yielded a sensitivity of 84.3% and specificity of 81.7%. However, the ELISA IgA result was indeterminate in 11.7% of cases. Conclusions: IgG serological assays seem to be a reliable tool for the retrospective diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgM assays seem to have a low sensitivity and IgA assay is limited by a substantial rate of indeterminate results.","output":"Recent Advances in the Evaluation of Serological Assays for the Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to a marked increase in the prevalence and severity of mental health problems among college students over the last decade, colleges and universities have been expanding their well-being initiatives and programs No longer limited to health services departments, the support of student well-being has been taken up by multiple campus units, including academic libraries As well-being has been shown to impact academic outcomes, the well-being initiatives libraries develop fit in with their commitment to enhance learning and student educational experience overall A comprehensive review of wellness interventions in academic libraries, this article presents findings on student well-being and provides a rationale for institutional responses to the crisis It describes well-being initiatives across library collections, services, and spaces It then critiques the trend and includes recommendations for implementing effective and assessable well-being initiatives The article ends with a brief discussion of library well-being initiatives during COVID-19","output":"Student well-being matters: Academic library support for the whole student"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"201912£人зԭ򲡶Էף֯òԭΪ2019͹״2019-nCoVɴ˲ȾµļΪ2019״COVID-19״ɷΪ4Ц֪ͦɸȾࡣ2019-nCoVΪص㣬֪ļֺ״ȾٴԼʺƵĹһΪʺͷҽٴ϶ؼļԤṩο.","output":"[Clinical features of respiratory coronavirus infections and relationship to otolaryngology]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of oral supplementation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation products (SCFP; SmartCare and NutriTek; Diamond V, Cedar Rapids, IA) on immune function and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infection in preweaned dairy calves. Twenty-four Holstein  Angus, 1- to 2-d-old calves (38.46  0.91 kg initial body weight [BW]) were assigned two treatment groups: control or SCFP treated, milk replacer with 1 g/d SCFP (SmartCare) and calf starter top-dressed with 5 g/d SCFP (NutriTek). The study consisted of one 31-d period. On days 19 to 21 of the supplementation period, calves were challenged via aerosol inoculation with BRSV strain 375. Calves were monitored twice daily for clinical signs, including rectal temperature, cough, nasal and ocular discharge, respiration effort, and lung auscultation. Calves were euthanized on day 10 postinfection (days 29 to 31 of the supplementation period) to evaluate gross lung pathology and pathogen load. Supplementation with SCFP did not affect BW (P = 0.762) or average daily gain (P = 0.750), percentages of circulating white blood cells (P < 0.05), phagocytic (P = 0.427 for neutrophils and P = 0.460 for monocytes) or respiratory burst (P = 0.119 for neutrophils and P = 0.414 for monocytes) activity by circulating leukocytes either before or following BRSV infection, or serum cortisol concentrations (P = 0.321) after BRSV infection. Calves receiving SCFP had reduced clinical disease scores compared with control calves (P = 0.030), reduced airway neutrophil recruitment (P < 0.002), reduced lung pathology (P = 0.031), and a reduced incidence of secondary bacterial infection. Calves receiving SCFP shed reduced virus compared with control calves (P = 0.049) and tended toward lower viral loads in the lungs (P = 0.051). Immune cells from the peripheral blood of SCFP-treated calves produced increased (P < 0.05) quantities of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in response to toll-like receptor stimulation, while cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of SCFP-treated calves secreted less (P < 0.05) proinflammatory cytokines in response to the same stimuli. Treatment with SCFP had no effect on virus-specific T cell responses in the blood but resulted in reduced (P = 0.045) virus-specific IL-17 secretion by T cells in the BAL. Supplementing with SCFP modulates both systemic and mucosal immune responses and may improve the outcome of an acute respiratory viral infection in preweaned dairy calves.","output":"Supplementing a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product modulates innate immune function and ameliorates bovine respiratory syncytial virus infection in neonatal calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we review the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the justification for the elimination strategy adopted by New Zealand, and some of the actions required to maximize the chances of success During the current COVID-19 pandemic, there have been many efforts to predict the infection cases, number of fatalities, and other medical indicators, using a range of statistical or epidemiological models During the current COVID-19 pandemic, there have been many efforts to forecast the infection cases, deaths and other medical indicators including hospital capacity calculation, with a variety of predictive epidemiological models These forecasting projects have influenced policies in some countries However, the prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic as a 'wicked problem' is uncertain by nature The uncertainty is deep-rooted in the many unknown unknowns about the communicable virus itself and the complexity, heterogeneity and dynamism of human behaviors, government interventions and testing protocols As there are no set standards between and sometimes within the countries, it makes it a 'wicked problem', nearly impossible to predict The wicked and uncertain nature of this pandemic makes the aim for prediction accuracy deceptive Herein, we propose to be cautious about the intent for 'accurate' predictions or models Instead of making inaccurate predictions let us try to understand the data that is available to us to explore the significant indicators of the uncertainty Such indicators are expected to make the planning and policy more 'future-informed' and possibly introduce and guide pre-cautionary actions now to shape the real future Also, we have proposed here a Power Apps-based app for organizational users to do a check in on their known location(s) to facilitate contact tracing if needed in an event of Novel Coronavirus suspected case as the countries move between different lockdown levels ? 2020 IEEE","output":"A Data Driven Decision Making and Contract Tracing App for Organizations to Combat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Advance care planning (ACP) conversations represent an important physician skill, a need further highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most resident ACP training occurs in inpatient, settings, often featuring goals of care (GOC) conversations during a crisis. Outpatient clinics are valuable but underutilized settings to provide skills training for residents, yet little research has been done in these spaces. OBJECTIVE: We sought to 1) create an ACP curriculum harnessing the principles of a community of practice in a virtual format, and 2) obtain residents' perspectives regarding their skills and confidence in having early GOC conversations in the outpatient setting. METHODS: We interviewed 48 internal medicine residents using questionnaires, reflective narratives, and transcripts of debriefing conversations. We created a virtual curriculum during the ambulatory week which included didactics, virtual role plays, ACP phone conversations with five patients, and group debriefings. Quantitative data were analyzed for changes in resident confidence. Qualitative data were coded using thematic analysis, guided by instructor field notes. RESULTS: Residents reported decreased confidence in navigating advance directive conversations following training [Z=2.24, P=0.03, ra?=a?0.33]. Resident reflections indicated that they felt more practiced at inpatient late GOC conversation skills, and that these skills were not fully transferable to the outpatient early GOC setting. Residents also endorsed the ambulatory environment as the best space for ACP conversations. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the feasibility of a virtual format for ACP curriculum. The virtual community of practice created space for a metacognitive unmasking of prior resident unconscious incompetence. Also, inpatient, crisis-oriented late GOC conversation skills may translate poorly to the outpatient setting requiring early and ongoing GOC skills. Residents need more training to navigate ACP conversations in ambulatory environments.","output":"Training Residents in Virtual Advance Care Planning: A New Twist in Telehealth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the structural similarities of the viral enzymes of different coronaviruses (CoVs), we investigated the potency of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents boceprevir and GC376 for counteracting seasonal coronavirus infections.

Initial reports focused on classical immune functions of microglia in pathological contexts, however, immunological concepts from these studies have been applied to describe neuro-immune interactions in the absence of disease, injury, or infection. Indeed, terms such as microglia activation or neuroinflammation are used ubiquitously to describe changes in neuro-immune function in disparate contexts; particularly in stress research, where these terms prompt undue comparisons to pathological conditions. This creates a barrier for investigators new to neuro-immunology and ultimately hinders our understanding of stress effects on microglia. As more studies seek to understand the role of microglia in neurobiology and behavior, it is increasingly important to develop standard methods to study and define microglial phenotype and function. In this review, we summarize primary research on the role of microglia in pathological and physiological contexts. Further, we propose a framework to better describe changes in microglia1 phenotype and function in chronic stress. This approach will enable more precise characterization of microglia in different contexts, which should facilitate development of microglia-directed therapeutics in psychiatric and neurological disease.","output":"The semantics of microglia activation: neuroinflammation, homeostasis, and stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019 a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and spread throughout the world over a short period of time causing a pandemic of a respiratory disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Technological advancements are transforming how healthcare knowledge is expanding and accelerating the outreach of critical medical services delivery (Jamal et al. in Health Information Management Journal 38(3):26C37, 2009). While this transformation facilitates new opportunities simultaneously it also introduces challenges (Jacobzone and Oxley, 2001). Appropriate Health Technology (HT) is vital to new and existing global health care programs. Therefore, qualified professionals who can safely guide the development, evaluation, installation, integration, performance assurance, and risk mitigation of HT must be in position to lead. Trained Clinical Engineers (CE) and Biomedical Engineers (BE) have been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the essential practitioners to providing this critically needed guidance. Over the past four years, a senior professional group participated in an international project that seeks evidence for the hypothesis - that the engagement of CE and BE in guiding HT - impacts positively on patient outcomes, while the alternative is that there is no difference. The group collected published data that was subjected to peer review screening; additional data qualification conditions are described in this paper. The project was initiated at the Global CE Summit during the first International Clinical Engineering and Health Technology Management Congress (ICEHTMC) in Hangzhou, China in October 2015 (Global Clinical Engineering Summit at the First International Clinical Engineering and Health Technology Management Congress, 2015). Following the adoption of a resolution to investigate CE contributions to the improvement of world health status, an international survey and literature survey were initiated. During the first two years of this project 150 case studies from 90 countries were identified covering the previous ten years. The results of this survey were presented to health leaders at the World Health Organization (WHO) World Health Assembly in 2016. Last year, 250 case studies were added including 35 more countries covering the 2016C2017 period. The combined project contains 400 qualified submissions from 125 countries.

This study estimates the association between case counts of COVID-19 infection and social vulnerability in the U.S., identifying counties at increased vulnerability to the pandemic. METHODS: Using Social Vulnerability Index and COVID-19 case count data, an ordinary least squares regression model was fitted to assess the global relationship between COVID-19 case counts and social vulnerability. Local relationships were assessed using a geographically weighted regression model, which is effective in exploring spatial nonstationarity. RESULTS: As of May 12, 2020, a total of 1,320,909 people had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the U.S. Of the counties included in this study (91.5%, 2,844 of 3,108), the highest case count was recorded in Trousdale, Tennessee (16,525.22 per 100,000) and the lowest in Tehama, California (1.54 per 100,000). At the global level, overall Social Vulnerability Index (e?=1.65, p=0.03) and minority status and language (e?=6.69, p<0.001) were associated with increased COVID-19 case counts. However, on the basis of the local geographically weighted model, the association between social vulnerability and COVID-19 varied among counties. Overall, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 infection.

METHODS: Patients with HGG who underwent preoperative and postoperative 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT were prospectively enrolled in the study. Postoperative MRI was classified as complete versus incomplete resection. Postoperative 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT was classified as negative (complete) or positive for metabolic residual tumor (incomplete resection) using a 5-point score system. The correlation of positive locations on PET/CT with the sites of subsequent tumor recurrence was evaluated. The concordance of postoperative imaging techniques (Cohen ) and their relation with progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-one studies, belonging to 47 patients, were assessed. Four patients underwent 2 postoperative 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT scans as they needed a second tumor resection for recurrence. In the follow-up, 42 patients progressed, and 37 died. Concordance between postoperative PET/CT and MRI assessment was poor. Resection grade on MRI did not show any significant association with prognosis. In multivariate analysis, only age and postoperative PET/CT showed significant association with progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03 [1.01-1.06, P = 0.006] and 1.88 [0.96-3.71, P = 0.067], respectively) and overall survival (HR, 1.04 [1.01-1.07, P = 0.004] and 2.63 [1.22-5.68, P = 0.014], respectively).

There have been limited published studies to date documenting the performance of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. METHODS: We compared the DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and Roche Diagnostics Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays using 228 samples spanning patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, patients with compatible symptoms but negative PCR, pre-COVID specimens, and potential cross-reactives. RESULTS: Both assays detected antibodies in 18/19 samples collected at least one week after a positive PCR result. Neither method consistently detected antibodies in specimens collected within one week of a positive PCR result (sensitivity < 50%), but antibodies were detected by only Roche in four samples in this time frame. Using 139 pre-COVID and 35 PCR-negative samples, the Roche and DiaSorin assays demonstrated specificities of 100.0% and 98.9%, respectively.

Minor discrepancies in sensitivity and specificity were observed between methods, with the differences in specificity more clinically significant for our low-prevalence population. For the DiaSorin assay, all disagreements with the Roche assay occurred in samples with quantitative signals near the cut-off determining positivity.","output":"Head-to-Head Comparison of Two SARS-CoV-2 Serology Assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is a hallmark symptom of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). We monitored the evolution of 1157 plasma metabolites in 60 ME/CFS (45 female, 15 male) and 45 matched healthy control participants (30 female, 15 male) before and after 2 maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) challenges separated by 24 hours, with the intent of provoking PEM in patients. Four time points allowed exploration of the metabolic response to maximal energy-producing capacity and the recovery pattern of participants with ME/CFS compared with the healthy control group. Baseline comparison identified several significantly different metabolites, along with an enriched percentage of yet-to-be identified compounds. Additionally, temporal measures demonstrated an increased metabolic disparity between cohorts, including unknown metabolites. The effects of exertion in the ME/CFS cohort predominantly highlighted lipid-related as well as energy-related pathways and chemical structure clusters, which were disparately affected by the first and second exercise sessions. The 24-hour recovery period was distinct in the ME/CFS cohort, with over a quarter of the identified pathways statistically different from the controls. The pathways that are uniquely different 24 hours after an exercise challenge provide clues to metabolic disruptions that lead to PEM. Numerous altered pathways were observed to depend on glutamate metabolism, a crucial component of the homeostasis of many organs in the body, including the brain.","output":"Plasma metabolomics reveals disrupted response and recovery following maximal exercise in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Korean CDC experts first reported the likelihood of reactivation in COVIOD-19 patients. They hypothesized that like childhood chicken pox infections which lie dormant for tens of years only to cause shingles in seniors, SARS-CoV-2 can reactivate. However, as testing for the virus had been flawed at that time, U.S. infectious disease experts were skeptical about the reports of second COVID-19 infections. New reports have addressed the urgent need to conduct large-scale studies to better understand the potential recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, some case studies show possible reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in a family cluster. Given this consideration, major space stressors such as microgravity and space radiation and their interactions which are not fully known, so far can increase the risk of reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in future space missions, an event that can easily impact the success of any space mission. Since about 80% of infected people are either asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms, in a near future, it would be likely that astronauts who start their mission even after complex medical examinations, experience reactivation of the virus during their mission. Moreover, we have previously addressed the potential higher fatality of COVID-19 infections in space due to 1) uselessness of social distancing due to microgravity 2) immune system dysregulation 3) possibly higher mutation rates of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as a RNA virus 4) higher risk of reactivation of the virus 5) existence of strong selective pressure and 6) decreased maximum oxygen uptake. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Can Reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 Decrease the Chance of Success of Future Deep Space Missions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is usually an iatrogenic and potentially life-threatening disease.

However, there have been few investigations to clarify the compounds in ZZX for the treatment of anxiety. AIM OF THE STUDY: Our previous study has identified five anti-anxiety components, including hesperidin, isochlorogenic acid A, isochlorogenic acid B and isochlorogenic acid C and chlorogenic acid, from extract of ZZX. In order to find the optimal combination and the underlying mechanism of these five components in the treatment of anxiety disorder, researches were designed based on uniform design method and proteomic technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The samples with different proportion and content of the five active components were arranged by uniform design method. Then a mathematical model was formulated using partial least square method and stepwise regression analysis. Moreover, the empty bottle stress-induced anxiety rat model was established, and the anti-anxiety effect was recorded by the unconditioned reflex elevated maze test and the open field test. In addition, the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technique, along with the multidimensional liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry were applied in proteomic study. At last, the result of proteomic analysis was further confirmed by Western blot. RESULTS: The optimal combination of the components from the extract of ZZX was 1.153 mg/kg hesperidin, 2.197 mg/kg Isochlorogenic acid A, 0.699 mg/kg Isochlorogenic acid B and 1.249 mg/kg Chlorogenic acid. Total 6818 proteins were identified using proteomic analysis and 80 differentially expressed proteins were used for further bioinformatic analysis. These proteins were involved in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, protein digestion and absorption, cholesterol metabolism, Chagas disease, and AGE/RAGE signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The composition and proportion of anti-anxiety components in extract of ZZX was disclosed, and there was an anti-anxiety effect for the combined components of flavonoids and phenolic acids. Through proteomic analysis and Western blot, it was found that the effective components of extract of ZZX can exert synergistic anti-anxiety effects via the regulation of multi-signaling pathways. These findings could provide a preliminary research basis for the development of new low-toxic, efficient, stable and controllable anti-anxiety drugs.","output":"Discovery and Proteomics Analysis of Effective Compounds in Valeriana jatamansi Jones for the Treatment of Anxiety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.2196/19424.].","output":"CorrectionDiagnostic Accuracy of Chest Computed Tomography Scans for Suspected Patients With COVID-19: Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The growth of populist radical right parties at the expense of Berlusconis Forza Italia (FI) has recently reconfigured the right in Italy Changes in power relations created for the Lega (League), Fratelli dItalia (Brothers of Italy, FdI) and FI, different competitive pressures, resulting in distinctiveCand often conflictingCresponses to the pandemic Based on the analysis of these parties Twitter accounts and on survey data, this article examines how right-wing actors positioned themselves vis  vis the government, and each other, throughout 2020 Eventually, the League became the governments most vocal critic, forcing FdI to follow suit;meanwhile, FI reinvented itself as a moderate, pro-EU party Despite these changes, our analysis also stresses continuity, insofar as the alliance continued to craft its message around taxation, the EU, immigration and law/order, as it had done in the past It also continued to enjoy electoral support similar to that of recent decades ?, The Founding Editors, Contemporary Italian Politics","output":"The right-wing alliance at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic: all change?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We live and to do so we must breathe and eat, so are we a combination of what we eat and breathe?

We propose, therefore, that oxygen supply to the body is aligned with not only the quantity we eat, but also nutrient-based diet selection, and that the cell-specific expression pattern of AMPK subunit isoforms is critical to appropriate system alignment in this respect.

A SARS-CoV-2 infectivity assay was conducted in Vero-E6 and Calu-3 epithelial cell lines. The antiviral effect of hemin, and chloroquine as a control, against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection was quantified by RT-qPCR using specific oligonucleotides for the N gene. Chloroquine induced a marked reduction of viral genome copies in kidney epithelial Vero-E6 cells but not in lung cancer Calu-3 cells. Hemin administration to the culture medium induced a high induction in the expression of the HO-1 gene that was stronger in Vero-E6 macaque-derived cells than in the human Calu-3 cell line. However, hemin treatment did not modify SARS-CoV-2 replication, as measured by viral genome quantification 48 h post-infection for Vero-E6 and 72 h post-infection for the Calu-3 lineages.

GBS is known to be postinfectious following several types of infections. Although causality can only be proven through large epidemiological studies, we intended to study this association by a thorough review of the literature. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Google scholar and included all papers with English or Spanish full text and original data of patients with GBS and recent COVID infection. Variables of interest were demographics, diagnostic investigations, and the latency between arboviral and neurological symptoms. Further variables were pooled to identify GBS clinical and electrophysiological variants, used treatments, and outcomes. The certainty of GBS diagnosis was verified using Brighton criteria. RESULTS: We identified a total of 109 GBS cases. Ninety-nine cases had confirmed COVID-19 infection with an average age of 56.07 years. The average latency period between the arboviral symptoms and neurologic manifestations for confirmed COVID-19 cases was 12.2 d. The predominant GBS clinical and electromyography variants were the classical sensorimotor GBS and acute demyelinating polyneuropathy respectively. Forty cases required intensive care, 33 cases required mechanical ventilation, and 6 cases were complicated by death. CONCLUSIONS: Studies on COVID-19-related GBS commonly reported sensorimotor demyelinating GBS with frequent facial palsy. The time between the onset of infectious and neurological symptoms suggests a postinfectious mechanism.

RESULTS In 12 studies (N = 1787), researchers relying on a categorical diagnosis showed that both VP/VLBW and EP/ELBW subjects have a higher ADHD risk (odds ratio [OR] = 3.04 higher than controls; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.19 to 4.21).

When human or animal cases are first recognised, molecular or serological diagnostic assays specific to them do not yet exist, causing a delay in the identification of an outbreak's aetiologic agent as well as its source. Preparing for the next virus to emerge is a major public health challenge, impeded by a poor understanding of the diversity of potential candidates that exist in wildlife reservoirs. Characterising the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response in an outbreak situation, and inform public health strategies that reduce the risk of spillover from animal reservoirs. Pathogen discovery techniques such as consensus polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been used to identify known and novel viruses in animals and humans, but have not been widely used in surveillance programmes. Metagenomic studies have identified novel viruses, new strains of known viruses, and have characterised host microbiomes. While NGS represents an unbiased approach to viral sequence detection, it is constrained by lower sensitivity than conventional PCR, requires substantial bioinformatics capabilities, and is cost prohibitive and therefore not widely available in the regions of the world that are most vulnerable to zoonotic disease emergence. In contrast, consensus PCR uses standard and widely available technologies, has greater sensitivity than NGS, and has also been used to identify novel viruses in wildlife, livestock and humans, though it is limited to detecting target genetic sequences conserved across known groups of viruses. The use of cPCR, in combination, if possible, with NGS and serology, can offer a powerful approach to rapidly identifying aetiologic agents in an outbreak and characterising the virome of key wildlife known to carry zoonotic viruses.

Objectives: The objective of the current study was to determine the impact of authentic leadership on the engagement of nurses in the mediating role of moral emotions. The perceived threat of coronavirus was considered to be a boundary condition of the relationship. Design Method: The study was conducted in accordance with the Positivism Research Philosophy Guidelines, followed by a deductive approach and data was collected through self-directed questionnaires. 134 responses were collected from nurses working in various public sector hospitals operating in twin cities in Pakistan, in particular public sector hospitals where coronavirus patients are being treated. There are 277,402 confirmed cases of Coronavirus, being treated in 11 designation hospitals in twin cities of Pakistan. Results: : The result was produced with the help of Amos. Path diagrams for mediation and moderation hypotheses were obtained and interpreted accordingly. The results showed that compassionate individuals were selfless even in the Covid-19 pandemic. Elevation and gratitude as a moral emotion have a more serious effect on the perceived threat to coronavirus. Conclusion: In the current scenario, the organization should identify the nursing staff with full compassion as it has been identified that the compassionate individual performs his or her duties even in the worst situation or during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The classification and corrective methods for constricted ears continue to be controversial. In order to identify them, the authors have reviewed and analyzed cases operated in a Chinese specialty clinic. METHODS: Correction of constricted ears from January of 2017 to June of 2021 was retrospect through medical records. Data of patients variables (including sex, age, laterality, type of constricted ear, presence of other ear anomalies), surgical techniques, esthetic outcomes, and postoperative complications have been collected. RESULTS: The deformed ears were classified into four graded types by three criteria including deficiency of auricle cartilage, vertical height in dorsal view, and surgical outcome. A total of 68 constricted ears of 57 patients (type I, n = 6; type IIA, n = 41; type IIB, n = 19, and type III, n = 2) were enrolled in the study. Of the 66 constricted ears undergoing surgical correction, most of them were performed with helical expansion through auricular/costal cartilage graft, Mustard-type mattress sutures, and tumbling cartilage flap. External molding using Vaseline gauze rolls was implemented on every case to assist reshaping the scapha. A triangular superficial temporal fascial flap was elevated to prevent the reoccurrence of lidding in some cases. Corrective techniques and esthetic outcomes for deformed cases of each graded type were described. Based on a four-point Likert scale, the average esthetic outcome score was 3.7. CONCLUSIONS: The classification was practical and the constricted ears were effectively corrected by simple surgical procedures without removal of deformed auricular cartilage. All corrections were performed in one stage. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

We adopted a mixed-methods approach (via narrative literature review [101 articles] and 9 semi-structured interviews) to evaluate policy development in response to shifting measles epidemiology in six European countries (Italy, Belgium, Germany, Romania, UK, and Ukraine); where policies and strategies have evolved in response to country-specific disease and vaccination patterns. Periodic outbreaks have occurred in all countries against a background of declining measles-containing-vaccine (MCV) uptake and increasing public vaccine hesitancy (with substantial regional or social differences in measles burden and vaccine uptake). Health-care worker (HCW) vaccine skepticism is also seen. While many outbreaks arise or involve specific susceptible populations (e.g., minority/migrant communities), the broader pattern is spread to the wider (and generally older) population; often among incompletely/non-vaccinated individuals as a legacy of previous low uptake. Immunization policy and strategic responses are influenced by political and social factors, where public mistrust contributes to vaccine hesitancy. A strong centralized immunization framework (allied with effective regional implementation and coherent political commitment) can effectively increase uptake. Mandatory vaccination has increased childhood MCV uptake in Italy, and similar benefits could be anticipated for other countries considering vaccine mandates. Although possible elsewhere, socio-political considerations render mandating impractical in other countries, where targeted immunization activities to bolster routine uptake are more important. Addressing HCW skepticism, knowledge gaps, improving access and increasing public/community engagement and education to address vaccine hesitancy/mistrust (especially in communities with specific unmet needs) is critical.","output":"Evolving measles status and immunization policy development in six European countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is one of the causes of STAT3 hyperimmunoglobulin E (IgE) syndrome (STAT3-HIES), while gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in STAT3 lead to immune dysregulation diseases. We retrospectively analyzed the age, common clinical symptoms, immunologic and molecular manifestations in 11 patients with LOF STAT3 mutations and 1 patient with a GOF STAT3 mutation. METHODS: Twelve patients were enrolled in our study. Serum immunoglobulin measurements, lymphocyte subset detection and whole-exome sequencing were performed. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis of STAT3-HIES patients was 4.74 years. Eczema, recurrent respiratory infections, fevers, abscesses and Staphylococcus aureus infections were the classic manifestations. Elevated serum IgE levels are not always observed in conjunction with high eosinophil counts. A moderate viral DNA load was also measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We noticed that c. 1144C>T was the most common mutation site, followed by c.1311C>A. Additionally, c.1311C>A and c. 1826G>C are two novel mutations. Eight patients achieved notable improvement after receiving intravenous immunoglobulin. CONCLUSION: We updated the current knowledge of this topic.

In recent years, great strides have been made in the fight against M. tuberculosis, especially in the Russian Federation. However, the emergence of a new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has led to the long-term isolation of the population on the one hand and to the relevance of using personal protective equipment on the other. Our knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation and tissue destruction is rapidly expanding, while our understanding of the pathology of human pulmonary tuberculosis gained through more the 100 years of research is still limited. This paper reviews the main molecular and cellular differences and similarities caused by M. tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2 infections, as well as their critical immunological and pathomorphological features. Immune suppression caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus may result in certain difficulties in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Furthermore, long-term lymphopenia, hyperinflammation, lung tissue injury and imbalance in CD4+ T cell subsets associated with COVID-19 could propagate M. tuberculosis infection and disease progression.","output":"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of M. tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2 InfectionsUnexpected Similarities of Pathogenesis and What to Expect from Co-Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides a comparative analysis of the clinical and laboratory parameters of the moderate course of COVID-19 in Republic of Uzbekistan in March-April and October-November 2020 of the pandemic period For the late stage of the pandemic, compared with the early stage, the most frequent clinical symptoms of the disease were weakness (92,4% and 85,0%), listlessness (88,6% and 6,25%), cough (81,0% and 68,7%), decreased appetite (61,0% and 18,7%), increased body temperature (50,6% and 38,7%), anosmia (34,2% and 11,2%), agenesis (38,0% and 12,5%), respectively In 32,5% and 81,0% of the examined patients, respectively, the disease proceeded with lung damage (pneumonia) The incidence of pneumonia was higher in the group of patients receiving treatment in October-November 2020 Leukocytosis and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were often (22,8% and 36,7%) observed in patients with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia","output":"Clinical and laboratory manifestations of moderate course of covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research work, a non-linear dynamical modified SEIR model of the recent pandemic, due to Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) for different countries like Malaysia and Pakistan, is considered under nonsingular fractional order derivative For this model, some qualitative results, existence theory, and numerical solution are studied by using fixed point approach and fractional Adams-Bashforth method The results are simulated corresponding to some real data of various fractional order by using Matlab Hence, the suitability of the considered COVID-19 model for the current outbreak in two different countries Malaysia and Pakistan are shown by simulation","output":"A Comparative Study of spreading of Novel Corona Virus Disease By Using Fractional Order Modified SEIR Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan started in December 2019 and was under control by the end of March 2020 with a total of 50,006 confirmed cases by the implementation of a series of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) including unprecedented lockdown of the city. This study analyzes the complete outbreak data from Wuhan, assesses the impact of these public health interventions, and estimates the asymptomatic, undetected and total cases for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. METHODS: By taking different stages of the outbreak into account, we developed a time-dependent compartmental model to describe the dynamics of disease transmission and case detection and reporting. Model coefficients were parameterized by using the reported cases and following key events and escalated control strategies. Then the model was used to calibrate the complete outbreak data by using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method. Finally we used the model to estimate asymptomatic and undetected cases and approximate the overall antibody prevalence level. RESULTS: We found that the transmission rate between Jan 24 and Feb 1, 2020, was twice as large as that before the lockdown on Jan 23 and 67.6% (95% CI [0.584,0.759]) of detectable infections occurred during this period. Based on the reported estimates that around 20% of infections were asymptomatic and their transmission ability was about 70% of symptomatic ones, we estimated that there were about 14,448 asymptomatic and undetected cases (95% CI [12,364,23,254]), which yields an estimate of a total of 64,454 infected cases (95% CI [62,370,73,260]), and the overall antibody prevalence level in the population of Wuhan was 0.745% (95% CI [0.693%,0.814%]) by March 31, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan was achieved via the enforcement of a combination of multiple NPIs: the lockdown on Jan 23, the stay-at-home order on Feb 2, the massive isolation of all symptomatic individuals via newly constructed special shelter hospitals on Feb 6, and the large scale screening process on Feb 18.

Although considerable research has been conducted on source localization in steady-state indoor environments, very few studies have dealt with the more challenging source localization problems in dynamic indoor environments. This paper presents a comprehensive particle swarm optimization (CPSO) method to locate a contaminant source in dynamic indoor environments with mechanical ventilation and develops a multi-robot source localization system to experimentally validate the method. Three robots were used to test the presented method in a typical dynamic indoor environment with periodic swinging of the air supply louvers of a cabinet air conditioner. The presented method was validated with two typical source locations, DS (in the downwind zone) and RS (in the recirculation zone). For DS and RS, 15 and 14 experiments out of 15 experiments were successful, with success rates of 100% and 93.3%, and each robot moved an average of 24.4 and 23.6 steps, respectively. The presented method was also compared with the standard particle swarm optimization (SPSO) and wind utilization II (WUII) methods for locating the source at DS. For the SPSO and WUII methods, only 3 and 6 experiments out of 15 experiments were successful, with success rates of 20% and 40% and averages of 33.0 and 38.0 steps, respectively.

Method: The present is a cross-sectional study that included a non-probabilistic sample of mostly highly educated young adults. Socio-demographic and mental health data were collected through an online survey, between May and June 2020, when confinement was mandatory in Ecuador. Data on mobility was extracted from Google Community Mobility Reports. Four aspects of the participants mental health were evaluated: eating behavior (emotional eating), depression, sleep quality and sense of coherence as a proxy of resilience, using previously validated instruments. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression models in R. Results: Sample included 8426 young adults, with a mean age of 22.85 (standard deviation: 4.43), most of whom were women (n = 5943, 70.53%). During mandatory confinement, in Ecuador mobility in general was reduced by nearly 50% in comparison to January/February, 2020. Less healthy eating behavior, depression, worse sleep quality and lower sense of coherence were associated with higher mobility restriction to workplaces and groceries/pharmacies. Women and youngsters more often showed depression, less healthy eating behavior, worse quality of sleep and lower sense of coherence in comparison with men and older respondents. Conclusions: Mobility restrictions during COVID-19 pandemic were associated with worse self-reported mental health in a sample of young highly-educated Ecuadorian adults.

Tocilizumab reduced progression to mechanical ventilation and death in a trial population enriched for racial and ethnic minorities. We aimed to investigate whether tocilizumab treatment could prevent COVID-19 progression in the first multicentre randomised controlled trial of tocilizumab done entirely in a lower-middle-income country. METHODS: COVINTOC is an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial done at 12 public and private hospitals across India. Adults (aged &#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19 (Indian Ministry of Health grading) confirmed by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result were randomly assigned (1:1 block randomisation) to receive tocilizumab 6 mg/kg plus standard care (the tocilizumab group) or standard care alone (the standard care group). The primary endpoint was progression of COVID-19 (from moderate to severe or from severe to death) up to day 14 in the modified intention-to-treat population of all participants who had at least one post-baseline assessment for the primary endpoint. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients. The trial is completed and registered with the Clinical Trials Registry India (CTRI/2020/05/025369). FINDINGS: 180 patients were recruited between May 30, 2020, and Aug 31, 2020, and randomly assigned to the tocilizumab group (n=90) or the standard care group (n=90). One patient randomly assigned to the standard care group inadvertently received tocilizumab at baseline and was included in the tocilizumab group for all analyses. One patient randomly assigned to the standard care group withdrew consent after the baseline visit and did not receive any study medication and was not included in the modified intention-to-treat population but was still included in safety analyses. 75 (82%) of 91 in the tocilizumab group and 68 (76%) of 89 in the standard care group completed 28 days of follow-up. Progression of COVID-19 up to day 14 occurred in eight (9%) of 91 patients in the tocilizumab group and 11 (13%) of 88 in the standard care group (difference -371 [95% CI -1823 to 1119]; p=042). 33 (36%) of 91 patients in the tocilizumab group and 22 (25%) of 89 patients in the standard care group had adverse events; 18 (20%) and 15 (17%) had serious adverse events. The most common adverse event was acute respiratory distress syndrome, reported in seven (8%) patients in each group. Grade 3 adverse events were reported in two (2%) patients in the tocilizumab group and five (6%) patients in the standard care group. There were no grade 4 adverse events. Serious adverse events were reported in 18 (20%) patients in the tocilizumab group and 15 (17%) in the standard care group; 13 (14%) and 15 (17%) patients died during the study. INTERPRETATION: Routine use of tocilizumab in patients admitted to hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19 is not supported.

Different modeling approaches have been proposed in an attempt to predict the behavior of these local cycles. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a framework to characterize the different variables that drive the local, or epidemic, cycles of the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to provide a set of relatively simple, yet efficient, statistical tools to be used by local health authorities to support decision making. METHODS: Virtually closed cycles were compared to cycles in progress from different locations that present similar patterns in the figures that describe them. With the aim to compare populations of different sizes at different periods of time and locations, the cycles were normalized, allowing an analysis based on the core behavior of the numerical series. A model for the reproduction number was derived from the experimental data, and its performance was presented, including the effect of subnotification (ie, underreporting). A variation of the logistic model was used together with an innovative inventory model to calculate the actual number of infected persons, analyze the incubation period, and determine the actual onset of local epidemic cycles. RESULTS: The similarities among cycles were demonstrated. A pattern between the cycles studied, which took on a triangular shape, was identified and used to make predictions about the duration of future cycles. Analyses on effective reproduction number (R(t)) and subnotification effects for Germany, Italy, and Sweden were presented to show the performance of the framework introduced here. After comparing data from the three countries, it was possible to determine the probable dates of the actual onset of the epidemic cycles for each country, the typical duration of the incubation period for the disease, and the total number of infected persons during each cycle. In general terms, a probable average incubation time of 5 days was found, and the method used here was able to estimate the end of the cycles up to 34 days in advance, while demonstrating that the impact of the subnotification level (ie, error) on the effective reproduction number was &lt;5%. CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that, with relatively simple mathematical tools, it is possible to obtain a reliable understanding of the behavior of COVID-19 local epidemic cycles, by introducing an integrated framework for identifying cycle patterns and calculating the variables that drive it, namely: the R(t), the subnotification effects on estimations, the most probable actual cycles start dates, the total number of infected, and the most likely incubation period for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"A Framework for a Statistical Characterization of Epidemic Cycles: COVID-19 Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genome sequencing is a powerful tool for identifying SARS-CoV-2 variant lineages, however there can be limitations due to sequence drop-out when used to identify specific key mutations.

IPA is mainly noted in patients with immunosuppressed status, hematological malignancies and stem cell transplants. Diagnosis is challenging and requires a high index of suspicion. Current literature supports treating patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia with high dose dexamethasone therapy for a prolonged period of time which may cause significant immune suppression. Here, we present a case of a patient with covid-19 pneumonia who developed IPA after dexamethasone and tocilizumab therapy. Case report: Patient is a 75-year-old male who was admitted to the medical ICU with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to covid-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation immediately on presentation to the emergency room. The patient had a past history of cavitary lung disease secondary to tuberculosis in 2018 and had completed treatment with 4-drug therapy. During this hospitalization, three sputum samples were negative for acid fast bacillus. He was started on dexamethasone therapy of 6mg daily for 10 days and received a single dose of tocilizumab. The patient initially improved but started to worsen again on the ninth day requiring increased ventilatory support and pronation therapy. His sputum culture grew Aspergillus FLavus. CT chest showed increased parenchymal infiltrates around prior cavitary lung disease. Serum aspergillus galactomannan antigen returned positive. Patient was started on intravenous Voriconazole. After initial improvement, the patient developed hemoptysis and worsening oxygenation. As per the family's wishes, patient was transitioned to comfort care and he passed away after compassionate extubation. Discussion:Treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia with high dose dexamethasone therapy may inadvertently cause an immunosuppressed state. These immunosuppressive effects may be further compounded by concurrent use of tocilizumab. Relative immunosuppression combined with possible epithelial damage due to viral infection may be a mechanism for development of IPA. A case series from France reported possible IPA in 9 of 27 (33.3%) ICU patients with COVID-19 with an expectedly high observed mortality rate. Conclusion: Clinicians should carry a high index of suspicion and pursue early investigations for other infections in COVID-19 patients who are not recovering or have worsened after initial improvement. Careful use of steroids in patients with prior structural lung disease is also warranted as they may be at high risk of developing IPA due to pre-existing aspergillus colonization.","output":"Covid-19 Pneumonia and Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No routine laboratory biomarkers perform well enough in diagnosing COVID-19 in isolation for them to be used as a standalone diagnostic test or to help clinicians prioritize patients for treatment.

We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 25. We calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22 and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case.

Efficient PUI evaluation is needed to preserve scarce healthcare resources. We describe the development, implementation, and outcomes of an inpatient diagnostic algorithm and clinical decision support system (CDSS) to evaluate PUIs. METHODS: We conducted a pre-post study of CORAL (COvid Risk cALculator), a CDSS that guides frontline clinicians through a risk-stratified COVID-19 diagnostic workup, removes transmission-based precautions when workup is complete and negative, and triages complex cases to Infectious Diseases (ID) physician review. Pre-CORAL, ID physicians reviewed all PUI records to guide workup and precautions. Post-CORAL, frontline clinicians evaluated PUIs directly using CORAL. We compared pre- and post-CORAL frequency of repeat SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), time from NAAT result to PUI status discontinuation, total duration of PUI status, and ID physician work-hours, using linear and logistic regression, adjusted for COVID-19 incidence. RESULTS: Fewer PUIs underwent repeat testing after an initial negative NAAT post-CORAL than pre-CORAL (54% vs. 67%; aOR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.44-0.63, p<0.01). CORAL significantly reduced average time to PUI status discontinuation (adjusted difference: -7.4 [SE 0.8] hours/patient; p<0.01), total duration of PUI status (adjusted difference: -19.5 [SE 1.9] hours/patient; p<0.01), and average ID physician work-hours (adjusted difference: -57.4 [SE 2.0] hours/day; p<0.01). No patients had a positive NAAT within 7 days after discontinuation of precautions via CORAL.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyse the learning curve for two-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) segmentectomy in our institution. METHODS We retrospectively collected data from 86 consecutive patients who underwent two-port VATS segmentectomy between June 2019 and November 2019. The operative time (OT) and estimated blood loss and other complications were analysed. The learning curve was evaluated using the OT and the cumulative sum (CUSUM) value of OTs across all cases. RESULTS We generated a graph of the CUSUM of OTs and found that the learning curve could be differentiated into 3 phases: phase 1, the initial learning phase (1st to 27th operation); phase 2, the increased competence phase (28th to 54th operation); and phase 3, the experienced phase (55th to 86th operation). The CUSUM value inflected at patient number 47. There were significant reductions in the OT and bleeding in phase 3 relative to phases 1 and 2. There were also significant differences in OT and estimated blood loss between the simple and complex segmentectomy procedures. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the 3 phases identified using CUSUM analysis of the OT represented characteristic stages of the learning curve for two-port VATS segmentectomy.

Flavivirus replication depends on the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress that leads to activation of the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), an important signalling pathway that regulates many biological functions involved in viral pathogenesis and innate immunity. However, the mechanism of TMUV-induced UPR activation remains unclear. RESULTS In this study, we systematically investigated the three UPR pathways in TMUV-infected BHK-21 cells. Our results showed that expression of glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78) and GRP94 was upregulated during the course of TMUV infection. We then demonstrated that TMUV activated the PERK pathway in the early stage of infection, resulting in upregulation of ATF4, GADD34 and CHOP, with CHOP induction leading to caspase-3 activation. We also found the IRE1 pathway to be activated, leading to splicing of X box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA and enhanced expression of p58IPK. Finally, we observed increased expression of ATF6 and activity of ER stress-response elements, suggesting stimulation of the ATF6 pathway. In addition, ATF6 pathway activation correlated with the induction of downstream chaperones calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57 and PDI. UPR activity was also observed by the marked elevation in GRP78 and sXBP1 levels in TMUV-infected DF-1 cells.

In 2018 more respondents reported lack of social support, exposure to violence, and refrained from seeking health care because of economic reasons. Daily smoking, binge drinking, and use of narcotic drugs was lower 2018 than 2006. In 2018 a higher proportion reported problems in the EQ-5D-3L dimensions, the mean TTO index value and the VAS index value was significantly lower than in 2006. In the regression analysis of merged data there was no significant difference between the years. Conclusions: Homeless people are an extremely disadvantaged group, have high rates of illness and disease and report poor health in all EQ-5D-3L dimensions. The EQ VAS score among the homeless people in 2018 is comparable to the score among persons aged 95C104 years in the general Swedish population 2017. The EQ-5D-3L instrument was easily administered to this group, its use allows comparison with larger population groups. Efforts are needed regarding housing, but also intensified collaboration by public authorities with responsibilities for homeless people's health and social welfare. Further studies should evaluate the impact of such efforts by health and social care services on the health and well-being of homeless people.","output":"EQ-5D-3L Health Status Among Homeless People in Stockholm, Sweden, 2006 and 2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is the emerging health emergency ruining the well being of individuals and devastating the global economies. Sustained research focusing on the virus has been on throughout the world. However, no definitive remedies have yet been derived in the containment of the virus.

In order to restrain the negative information of public, the factor of policies and regulations with impulse and time delay is introduced. Furthermore, the system model is simulated and verified by the reported data of COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan. The main results are as follows: (1) When the implementation rate of the negative information generated by the confirmed cases gradually reduced to 0.4 times, the cumulative confirmed cases will be significantly reduced to about 37000, indicating that the popularization of pandemic related media information should be broad; (2) When the implementation rate affected by the amount of policies and regulations information gradually increases to 3 times, the cumulative confirmed cases will be significantly reduced to about 28000, indicating that the policies and regulations information should be continuously and incrementally reported; (3) When the inhibition rate of policies and regulation information on negative information gradually increases to 3 times, the cumulative confirmed cases will also be significantly reduced to about 27000 cases, indicating that the targeted policies and regulations information has a significant impact on inhibiting the corresponding negative emotions.","output":"Study on an SIHRS Model of COVID-19 Pandemic With Impulse and Time Delay Under Media Coverage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The characteristics and evolution of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been adequately studied.

Thromboembolic events after COVID-19 infection have been reported mainly in the pulmonary vasculature however; thromboembolic complications of the nervous system with subsequent cerebrovascular stroke have been increasingly reported. The most common cerebrovascular complication after COVID-19 infection is ischemic stroke however there is also reported cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in such patients as well. In the current report we present two cases with extensive cerebral venous sinus thrombosis as a potential complication for COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVE: Increase the awareness of neurological complications in patient with COVID-19 virus disease. METHODS: Reporting two cases with confirmed cerebral venous sinus obstruction in patient with confirmed COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Two young adult males less than 30 years old have no other risk factors of hypercoagulable state apart from being COVID-19 infection victims complicated by CVST. Both of them had progressive course of deterioration in conscious level, right hemiplegia and only one seizures attack has been reported in (Case-1).

This study examined the impact of different kinds of recreational activities on plant communities in a highly visited park in Mashhad, Iran. Vegetation in the park was sampled along 41 random 10-m transects with different human disturbances (trails, dirt roads, campsites) and undisturbed communities. Life form spectrum, species composition, species and phylogenetic diversity were determined for all communities. Disturbance increased the frequency of therophytes, but decreased the frequency of chamaephytes and percentage vegetated area. Recreational-mediated disturbance had variable impact on species composition, but decreased species and phylogenetic diversity compared with undisturbed areas. Roads and campsites caused the greatest damage, while trails had the smallest negative impact on vegetation. This study showed that damage to (semi-)natural park vegetation differs with recreation activity. This finding can help prioritise management activities to minimise negative impacts of recreation activities on local vegetation. The current visitor load to the urban park studied here appears too high to be sustainable over time, so better monitoring and restrictions on visitor numbers may be needed to minimise the negative impacts on park vegetation. The camping impacts can be managed by creating clusters of designated campsites to spatially concentrate the impact area. Low-impact practices should be communicated to visitors.","output":"Severe vegetation degradation associated with different disturbance types in a poorly managed urban recreation destination in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Candida albicans, a major human fungal pathogen associated with high mortality and/or morbidity rates in a wide variety of immunocompromised individuals, undergoes a reversible morphological transition from yeast to filamentous cells that is required for virulence. While previous studies have identified and characterized global transcriptional mechanisms important for driving this transition, as well as other virulence properties, in C. albicans and other pathogens, considerably little is known about the role of genome-wide translational mechanisms. Using ribosome profiling, we report the first global translational profile associated with C. albicans morphogenesis. Strikingly, many genes involved in pathogenesis, filamentation, and the response to stress show reduced translational efficiency (TE). Several of these genes are known to be strongly induced at the transcriptional level, suggesting that a translational fine-tuning mechanism is in place. We also identify potential upstream open reading frames (uORFs), associated with genes involved in pathogenesis, and novel ORFs, several of which show altered TE during filamentation. Using a novel bioinformatics method for global analysis of ribosome pausing that will be applicable to a wide variety of genetic systems, we demonstrate an enrichment of ribosome pausing sites in C. albicans genes associated with protein synthesis and cell wall functions. Altogether, our results suggest that the C. albicans morphological transition, and most likely additional virulence processes in fungal pathogens, is associated with widespread global alterations in TE that do not simply reflect changes in transcript levels. These alterations affect the expression of many genes associated with processes essential for virulence and pathogenesis.","output":"Global translational landscape of the Candida albicans morphological transition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare simulation may present risks to safety, especially when delivered in situin real clinical environmentswhen lines between simulated and real practice may be blurred.

Thus, treating these diseases in their early stages can improve the quality and quantity of the product. Recently, several robotic frameworks based on image processing and artificial intelligence have been used to treat these diseases in an automated way. However, incorrect diagnosis of the infected leaf can lead to the use of chemical treatments for normal leaf thereby the issue will not be solved, and the process may be costly and harmful. To overcome these issues, a modern deep learning framework in robot vision for the early detection of bean leaves diseases is proposed. The proposed framework is composed of two primary stages, which detect the bean leaves in the input images and diagnosing the diseases within the detected leaves. The U-Net architecture based on a pre-trained ResNet34 encoder is employed for detecting the bean leaves in the input images captured in uncontrolled environmental conditions. In the classification stage, the performance of five diverse deep learning models (e.g., Densenet121, ResNet34, ResNet50, VGG-16, and VGG-19) is assessed accurately to identify the healthiness of bean leaves. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using a challenging and extensive dataset composed of 1295 images of three different classes (e.g., Healthy, Angular Leaf Spot, and Bean Rust). In the binary classification task, the best performance is achieved using the Densenet121 model with a CAR of 98.31%, Sensitivity of 99.03%, Specificity of 96.82%, Precision of 98.45%, F1-Score of 98.74%, and AUC of 100%.

The aim of this study-based register is to support rapid and living evidence synthesis, including a project to build an evidence ecosystem of COVID-19 research (CEOsys). In November and December 2020 we conducted an evaluation of the CCSR for CEOsys, measured its performance and identified areas for improvement. Methods: For the evaluation we generated a purposive sample of 286 studies from 20 reviews to calculate the CCSR's sensitivity (comprehensiveness), accuracy (correctly classified and linked studies) and currency (time to publish and process references). Results: The CCSR had an overall sensitivity of 77.2%, with the highest sensitivity for interventional studies (94.4%) and lowest sensitivity for modelling studies (63.6%). The study register had 100% sensitivity for trial registry records, 86.5% for journal articles and 52.4% for preprints. 98.3% of references were correctly classified with regard to study type, and 93.4% with regard to study aim. 89% of studies were correctly linked. 81.4% of references were published to the register in under 30 days, with 0.5 day (median) for trial registry records, 2 days for journal articles and 56 days for preprints. Conclusion: The CCSR had high sensitivity, accurate study classifications and short publishing times for journal articles and trial registry records. We identified that the CCSR's coverage and publishing times for preprints needed improvement.

This study assessed the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare delivery for patients with hematologic malignancies with documented active treatment. Methods: Patients from the nationwide Flatiron Health electronic health record (EHR)-derived de-identified database with confirmed diagnosis of AML, DLBCL, FL, MCL, CLL or MM, and age  18 years at initial diagnosis were included. To be included in the study, documented receipt of at least one systemic, non-maintenance line of therapy between March 1, 2016 - February 28, 2021 was required. Patients were categorized into treatment types within lines of therapy: Oral therapy (OralTx); outpatient infusions (OutPtTx); and inpatient infusions, including hematopoietic transplants and CAR-T cell therapy (InPtTx). Monthly visit rates were calculated as the number of visits (telemedicine or in-person [in-clinic treatment administration, vitals, and/or labs]) per active patient per 30-day standardized month. Only visits occurring within a line of therapy were included (i.e. during active therapy, excluding surveillance). Telemedicine was only available for abstraction during the pandemic period. We used time-series forecasting methods on pre-pandemic monthly visit rate data (March 2016 - February 2020) to estimate projected counterfactual visit rates between March 2020 - February 2021 (expected in-person visit rates if the pandemic had not occurred) for all diseases combined, each disease, and each treatment type. Differences between projected and actual monthly visit rates during the pandemic period were considered statistically significant and related to the pandemic if the actual visit rate was outside of the 95% prediction interval (PI) surrounding the projected estimate. Results: A total of 22,559 patients were included in this analysis (6,241 OralTx, 14,501 OutPtTx, 7,675 InPtTx): 4,069 AML, 3,641 DLBCL, 2,004 FL, 1,899 MCL, 4,574 CLL and 6,701 MM. There was a gradual downward trend in in-person visit rates across all diseases over the study period (March 2016 - February 2021, Figure) and general visit frequencies were lower for OralTx and higher for OutPtTx and InPtTx overall. For all diseases combined, early pandemic months (March - May 2020) saw an 18% (95% PI 8.9% - 25%) reduction in in-person visit rates averaged across OralTx and OutPtTx, with the projected rate being 1.5 (95% PI 1.3 - 1.6) visits per patient per month, compared to an actual rate of 1.2. Reductions in the in-person visit rates were significant for all 3 treatment types for MM, for OralTx for CLL, and for OutPtTx for MCL and CLL. Telemedicine visit rates were greatest for patients who received OralTx, followed by OutPtTx, then InPtTx, with greater use in the early pandemic months and subsequent decrease in later months. All in-person visit rates increased close to predicted rates in the later half of the pandemic period. Conclusions: In treatment of hematologic malignancies, overall documented in-person visit rates for patients on OralTx and OutPtTx significantly decreased during early pandemic months, but returned close to the projected rates later in the pandemic. There were no significant reductions in the overall in-person visit rate for patients on InPtTx. Variability in these trends by disease type was observed, with significant reductions in in-person visits impacting MM, CLL, and MCL. Figure.

OBJECTIVES We compare two different methods of wound closure in elective plastic surgical cases: barbed 3/0 V-Loc?180 suture and smooth 3/0 Maxon? sutures, both polyglyconate monofilament synthetic absorbable sutures. We assessed the aesthetic long-term results with a minimum two year follow up. METHODS This is a prospective, randomized controlled study with internal control. A single surgeon performed all cases. Patients who underwent elective operations that involved long wound closure were enrolled in the study. Each patient acted as their own internal control with half their wound being sutured with 3/0 V-Loc?180 barbed suture and the other half with smooth 3/0 Maxon? deep dermal sutures and then a subcuticular skin closure. In both groups, the superficial fascial system was closed with 1 Vicryl interrupted sutures on both sides. Long-term cosmesis was evaluated using the modified Hollander cosmesis score by review of standardized postoperative photographs by 9 blinded plastic surgeons and specialist registrars. RESULTS The study reports on 33 female patients. The time taken for wound closure was significantly reduced using the barbed suture (p < 0.001). There was no difference in the complication ratio in either group. Two-year aesthetic outcome was significantly superior when using the barbed suture (p = 0.0075).

Since the pandemic began, many Canadians have reported consuming food away from home (FAFH) less often. FAFH tends to be less healthful than food prepared at home. Little is known about patterns of Canadians' FAFH consumption before the pandemic. This study used 2015 national-level nutrition data, the most recent available, to characterize patterns of FAFH consumption and selected markers of dietary intake. DATA AND METHODS National-level food intake data came from the first 24-hour dietary recall provided by 20,475 respondents aged 1 or older to the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey-Nutrition. Mean daily intakes of selected food subgroups and nutrients, adjusted for total energy intake, were compared between those who had consumed any food in a restaurant on the previous day and those who had not. Estimates were generated overall and for eight age and sex groups. RESULTS In 2015, overall, 21.8% of Canadians had consumed FAFH in a restaurant on the previous day. Eating out was most common among males aged 19 to 54 (27.7%) and least common among young children aged 1 to 5 (8.4%). Compared with Canadians who had not eaten out on the previous day, those who had eaten out had consumed, on that day, fewer servings of whole fruit; whole grains; dark green and orange vegetables; other vegetables (excluding potatoes); milk and fortified soy-based beverages; and legumes, nuts and seeds, on average. Those who had eaten out had consumed, on average, less fibre and total sugar, and more total fat, saturated fat and sodium on that day. There were few differences for meat and poultry, fish and seafood, and protein intake. DISCUSSION On the day that Canadians ate out in a restaurant, their dietary intake was generally less favourable than that of Canadians who did not eat out. If Canadians continue to eat at home more and to consume less FAFH, as early pandemic-period reports suggest, then results can be used to gauge the potential dietary implications of these shifts.","output":"Eating away from home in Canada: impact on dietary intake."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Due to the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) lockdown implemented by the government, we had to transform our classes into the online sphere.

Materials and Methods: A total of 342 Polymerase Chain Reaction positive patients were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups in terms of the presence of RMD. Chest Computed Tomography (CT) severity scores, demographic characteristics, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) requirement, length of stay at the hospital were compared between RMD and non-RMD groups. Typical and atypical findings on CT images were identified with their incidence in both groups of patients. Results: Age and female gender were significantly higher in the RMD group (p=0.001, p=0.041). The average CT-severity score was higher in the RMD group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.081). ICU transfer and mortality rates were higher in the RMD, whereas no difference was found in hospitalization rates and length of stay (p=0.002, p=0.036, p=0.280, p=0.168). Ground glass opacities, superimposed consolidation, and crazy paving patterns were the most common typical findings seen on both groups. Atypical CT findings for covid-19 pneumonia were found to be higher in the RMD group than in the non-RMD group. Conclusion: Chronic inflammation and the use of immunosuppressive drugs constitute a vulnerability to infections in RMD patients. In this study, mortality and ICU requirements were found to be higher in patients with RMD. Similarly, the higher rate of atypical chest CT findings in the RMD group may be of particular importance in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of covid-19 pneumonia in this patient group. ? 2021 Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University.

The present study aimed to design a process for xylitol production from OAIR via microbial fermentation with Pseudomonas gessardii VXlt-16. Parametric analysis with Taguchi orthogonal array approach resulted in a conversion factor of 0.64 g xylitol/g xylose available in untreated sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate (SBH). At bench scale, the product yield increased to 71.98/100 g (0.66 g/L h). 48.49 g of xylitol crystals of high purity (94.56%) were recovered after detoxification with 2% activated carbon. Cost analysis identified downstream operations as one of the cost-intensive parts that can be countered by adsorbent recycling. Spent carbon, regenerated with acetic acid washing can be reused for six cycles effectively and reduced downstream cost by about 32%. The strategy would become useful in the cost-effective production of several biomass-dependent products like proteins, enzymes, organic acids, as well.","output":"Xylitol production by Pseudomonas gessardii VXlt-16 from sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate and cost analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Existing research has shown that universityCindustry collaboration (UIC) helps a firm achieve superior innovation outcomes.

Ecological peril, both in the form of extreme weather events and slow-onset impacts of environmental degradation, has serious repercussions for the already prevailing conundrum that the conception of citizenship entails. Proliferation of natural disasters and acceleration of environmental degeneration in recent times have caused large-scale involuntary displacement and consequently a rupture in the sense of belonging, which is the cornerstone of citizenship. Thus, it is imperative that the notion of citizenship is reconceptualised in the light of the lived reality of environmental displacement that produces new forms of precarity while disrupting the sense of being-a-citizen. Displacement caused by a fragile and volatile ecology paves the path for a gradual waning of citizenship rights, often leading to loss of avenues for meaningful citizen engagement, thereby making environmental displacement an exemplary case for understanding how citizenship operates as a place-based relation. This article will discuss the precarious conditions of environmentally displaced people and delineate the intractable chasm between the ideas of administered citizenship and lived citizenship. I argue that drawing on processual aspects of citizenship becomes imperative against the backdrop of the rapid degradation of ecosystems which calls for a reworking of the political sphere and a reformulation of the idiom of citizenship.","output":"Fragile environment, fractured citizenship: Environmental displacement and the erosion of citizenship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Delirium is the most common postoperative neurological complication and some evidence suggests that dexmedetomidine is associated with a decreased incidence of delirium. This study is designed to assess the effect of dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Sixty geriatric patients with MCI were enrolled and ramdomly divided into two groups by a computer-generated randomisation sequence: dexmedetomidine group (D group) and normal saline group (C group). Patients in D group received a loading dose of 0.5 g/kg dexmedetomidine over 10 minutes before anesthesia induction, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.4 gkg-1h-1 until 30 minutes before the end of surgery; equal volume of normal saline was given in C group. Blood samples were extracted to detect the concentration of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin-10 (IL-10), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) before anesthesia induction (T1), before suture (T2), and 30 minutes after surgery (T3). Postoperative recovery times were recorded. Delirium was assessed with the 3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for confusion assessment method during the first 7 days postoperatively. RESULTS: POD occurred in 10 (33.3%) of 30 patients in C group, and in 3 (10%) of 30 patients given dexmedetomidine (odds ratio [OR] 0.222, 95% CI 0.054-0.914; P = 0.028). The serum concentrations of TNF-&#945;, MMP-9, and GFAP were significantly increased and IL-10 was decreased in the C group than in the D group at T2 and T3. No differences were observed between groups in the level of HO-1. Analysis using random-effect multivariable logistic regression indicated that POD was associated with GFAP (odds ratio [OR] 16.691, 95% CI 2.288-121.746; P = 0.005). The positive predictive ability of the multivariate logistic regression model tested by ROC analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.713 (95% CI, 0.584-0.842).

In emergency medicine, there is a new urgency around the clinical and ethical dilemmas clinicians face as they make decisions that impact upon the lives of their patients. Emergency clinicians are accustomed to upholding duty of care and acting in the best interests of patients. Clinical judgements are made every day about a patient's capacity to make their own decisions and act with free will. It is foreseeable that a duty of care owed to a patient may be in conflict with the responsibility to the health and safety of a community. What is particularly fraught for clinicians is the lack of clarity around this potential duty of care to the community, and navigating the potential conflict with duty of care to the patient. How much danger does the community need to be in, and how definable, imminent and specific does that risk need to be? An attempt to protect the community may well constitute either a breach of confidentiality or a breach of duty of care.

The aim of this research was to investigate the complex relationships between BMI, physical activity, psychological stress and resilience among United States Air National Guardsmen (USANG), specifically during the pandemic. Methods An online survey was distributed to USANG members. The survey included measures of resilience (CD-RISC-25), perceived psychological stress (PSS), perceived psychological stress brought on by COVID-19 (COVID-19 PSL), current levels of physical activity (IPAQ-SF), perceived impact on physical activity brought on by COVID-19 (COVID-19 PAL), and BMI. Pearsons correlation coefficients (r) were used to assess correlation significance (  0.05), direction, and magnitude. Results A total of 110 responses met inclusion criteria for data interpretation. A majority reported a decline in physical activity 54.5%, while 60% reported an increase in psychological stress. According to BMI classifications, 60.9% were considered overweight or obese. Seven meaningful (effect size  ;2.0;) and statistically significant salient associations were identified resilience-PSS r = -0.38;resilience-COVID-19 PAL r = 0.21;PSS-COVID-19 PSL r = 0.35;PSS-COVID-19 PAL r = -0.23;COVID-19 PSL COVID-19 PAL r = -0.24;IPAQ-SF-BMI r = -0.23;BMI-Covid-19 PAL r = -0.32.

METHOD: We analyzed publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets of human embryos for the known canonical and non-canonical receptors and spike protein cleavage enzymes for multiple coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, hCoV-229E, and hCoV-NL63. We also analyzed the expression of host genes involved in viral replication, host proteins involved in viral endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), genes of host proteins that physically interact with proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and the host genes essential for coronavirus infectivity. RESULTS: Of the known receptors of SARS viruses, ACE2, BSG, GOLGA7, and ZDHHC5 were expressed in different proportions in the zygote, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and blastocysts including the trophectoderm. The MERS-CoV receptor, DPP4, and hCoV-229E receptor, ANPEP, were expressed mainly from the compact morula to the blastocyst stages. Transcripts of the MERS-CoV alternate receptor LGALS1 were detected in most cells at all stages of development. TMPRSS2 transcripts were detected in the epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm, while transcripts of the endosomal proteases CTSL, CTSB, and FURIN were expressed in most cells at all stages of development. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were co-expressed in a proportion of epiblast and trophectoderm cells. The embryonic cells expressed genes involved in ESCRT, viral replication, SARS-CoV-2 interactions, and coronavirus infectivity. The ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells were enriched in genes associated with lipid metabolism, lysosome, peroxisome, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways.

METHODS: HCWs advised by their infection control or occupational health officer to self-isolate due to a high-risk SARS-CoV-2 exposure were enrolled between May and October 2020. The strategy consisted of symptom-triggered nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing from day 0 to day 7 after exposure and standardized home-based nasopharyngeal swab and saliva testing on day 7. The NPV of this strategy was calculated for (1) clinical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis from day 8-14 after exposure, and for (2) asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detected by standardized nasopharyngeal swab and saliva specimens collected at days 9, 10, and 14 after exposure.

METHODS: Two prospective longitudinal London-based cohorts of community SARS-CoV-2 contacts, recruited within 5 days of exposure, provided independent training and test datasets. Infected and uninfected contacts completed daily symptom diaries from the earliest possible time-points. Diagnostic information gained by adding symptoms to the CS was quantified using likelihood ratios and AUC-ROC. Improvements in sensitivity and time-to-detection were compared to penalties in terms of specificity and number-needed-to-test. RESULTS: Of 529 contacts within two cohorts, 164 (31%) developed PCR-confirmed infection and 365 (69%) remained uninfected.

Four symptoms (sore throat, muscle aches, headache and appetite loss) were identified as early-predictors (EP) which added diagnostic value to the CS. The broadened symptom criterion 1 of the CS, or 2 of the EP identified PCR-positive contacts in the test dataset on average 2 days earlier after exposure (p=0.07) than 1 of the CS, with only modest reduction in specificity (5.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Broadening symptom criteria to include individuals with at least 2 of muscle aches, headache, appetite loss and sore throat identifies more infections and reduces time-to-detection, providing greater opportunities to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","output":"Broadening symptom criteria improves early case identification in SARS-CoV-2 contacts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of mild-illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to determine whether early treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) would be more efficacious than no-treatment for outpatients with mild Covid-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, open label, randomized controlled trial in Catalonia (Spain) between March 17, and May 26, 2020. Eligible Covid-19 cases were non-hospitalized adult patients with recently confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and less than five days of symptoms. Patients were assigned to receive HCQ (800 mg on day 1, followed by 400 mg once daily for 6 days) or no antiviral treatment (not-placebo controlled). Study outcomes were the reduction of viral RNA load in nasopharyngeal swabs up to 7 days after treatment start, patient disease progression using the WHO scale up to 28 days, and time to complete resolution of symptoms. Adverse events were assessed up to 28 days. RESULTS: A total of 293 patients were eligible for intention-to-treat analysis: 157 in the control arm and 136 in the intervention arm. The mean age was 41.6 years (SD 12.6), mean viral load at baseline was 7.90 (SD 1.82) Log(10) copies/mL, and median time from symptom onset to randomization was 3 days. No significant differences were found in the mean reduction of viral load at day 3 (-1.41 vs. -1.41 Log(10) copies/mL in the control and intervention arm, respectively; difference 0.01 [95% CI -0.28;0.29]) or at day 7 (-3.37 vs. -3.44; d C0.07 [-0.44;0.29]). This treatment regimen did not reduce risk of hospitalization (7.1%, control vs. 5.9%, intervention; RR 0.75 [0.32;1.77]) nor shortened the time to complete resolution of symptoms (12 days, control vs. 10 days, intervention; p = 0.38).

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine changes in estimated sleep duration in 5 major metropolitan areas before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study using estimated sleep duration data obtained from a smartphone app. The data were obtained from regular users of the smartphone app before and after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. We compared within-subject estimated sleep duration before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using generalized linear mixed models. RESULTS: Among the 2,871,037 observations, 957,022 (33.3%) were from users in London; 549,151 (19.1%) were from users in Los Angeles; 846,527 (29.5%) were from users in New York City; 251,113 (8.7%) were from users in Seoul; and 267,224 (9.3%) were from users in Stockholm. The average age of the users in the sample was 35 years (SE 11 years). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, people residing in Seoul had the shortest estimated sleep duration (mean 6 hours 28 minutes, SE 11.6 minutes) and those residing in Stockholm had the longest estimated sleep duration (mean 7 hours 34 minutes, SE 9.9 minutes).

This study aimed to determine if a higher dose of RT was associated with improved symptoms response rates. METHODS We searched PubMed, Central and Embase for eligible studies published from 1990 to 2019. The primary outcomes were symptoms response rates for hematuria, dysuria and frequency. Secondary outcomes included treatment-related adverse events and quality of life. RESULTS We found one randomized, four prospective and eight retrospective non-comparative observational studies including 1320 patients who received palliative bladder radiotherapy for symptom relief. The dose fractionation schedules varied across studies ranging from 8 Gy single fraction to 60 Gy in 2 to 8 Gy per fraction. The pooled response rates for hematuria, dyuria and frequency symptoms were 74%, 58% and 71% respectively. A higher dose of RT was not associated with improved response rates of hematuria and frequency. However, a higher dose of RT was associated with a longer duration of hematuria response and reduced response of dysuria. Grade 3 gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity occurred in up to 26% of patients. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes were reported in one study. CONCLUSION This systematic review demonstrates that a higher dose of bladder RT was not associated with improved response rates of hematuria and frequency symptoms but was associated with reduced response of dysuria. Higher doses of bladder RT was associated with more durable hematuria response.

The coronavirus analysis over the contaminated area and its speed of transmission if examined can prevent the spread of COVID-19. A wide range of such problems could be simplified through finite element analysis for a better solution. Many computational fluid dynamics problems could be solved by the finite element method (FEM) effectively by utilizing finite elements. A remarkable linear triangular element meshing over the transmission region between the individuals has been generated by triangular unstructured meshes to analyze the velocity of the virus. The flow intensity of the coronavirus has been analyzed within the standard specified distance recommended by WHO between two individuals at 1.83 m to hinder the spread of COVID-19. Extended work has fabulously extracted the element and nodal information from the discretization region. Moreover, it has been effectively utilized to simplify the numerical solutions of FEM and improve its efficiency to a larger extent. We have discretized the region of transmission of respiratory cough droplets carrying coronavirus from an infected person and the intensity and the speed of the transmission have been computed. The velocity of the transmission of coronavirus has been analyzed by solving an elliptical partial differential equation (PDE) over the region around the mask of an infected individual at a specified distance of 1.83m. Infectious transmission of COVID-19 in different environmental conditions is of numerous complexities to work on and analyze the growth of the infectious coronavirus. Mathematical models formulated for respiratory cough droplets carrying coronavirus can be very efficiently simplified through FEM when the information of the velocity of flow and existence of the coronavirus at the particular stage of transmission region is known. The present study of different temperatures and analysis of wind factors during the transmission process can help to reduce the infection risk between individuals if the recommended specified distance is maintained within the individuals.

We summarise the available evidence for in-flight transmission of wild type SARS-CoV-2 during 2020, and for imported COVID-19 clusters to cause outbreaks. This paper provides a data baseline prior to the emergence of new mutations causing SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, whose characteristics may increase the potential risk of in-flight transmission and imported outbreaks. The evidence on in-flight transmission of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 is limited, and is described in a small number of published reports. Most of the available evidence pertains to the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, during a period without non-pharmaceutical interventions such as distancing and in-flight mask wearing. There is considerable potential for outbreaks of COVID-19 from imported cases or clusters when public health guidance around quarantine of travellers and self-isolation of cases is not adhered to. Risks can be mitigated by measures such as: avoiding non-essential travel, targeted testing and quarantine of travellers from high incidence regions or regions of concern, managed quarantine processes, and protocols for rapid investigation and control of transmission from a possible variant of concern. Measures should be dynamically assessed and proportionate to the level of risk.

Commonly, this fungal infection is caused by Rhizopus spp., Mucor spp., and Lichtheimia spp., although the genera of other Mucorales such as Saksenaea, Rhizomucor, Cunninghamella, and Apophysomyces may also be involved. A number of factors such as high concentration of zinc, iron and hypoxia induced acidosis promote the growth of fungi, thereby increasing the risk of mucormycosis multiple folds. Iron chelators (deferasirox and deferiprone) and zinc chelators (clioquinol, phenanthroline and N,N,N,N-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine) have been reported to inhibit the growth of fungi in a number of in vitro and animal studies. Correction of metabolic acidosis by administration of bicarbonate or glycine reduces the susceptibility of patients to the invasion by fungal species.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes of body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), Pao2/Fio2, viral load, serum antibody titer, routine blood biochemical index, ARDS, and ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) supports before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Results: All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion. Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.","output":"Treatment of 5 Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 With Convalescent Plasma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurodegenerative diseases are deteriorating conditions of the nervous system that are rapidly increasing in the ageing population. Increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation, largely mediated by microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, microglia are considered a major therapeutic target that could potentially yield effective disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the interest in studying microglia as drug targets, the availability of cost-effective, flexible, and patient-specific microglia cellular models is limited. Importantly, the current model systems do not accurately recapitulate important pathological features or disease processes, leading to the failure of many therapeutic drugs. Here, we review the key roles of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases and provide an update on the current microglial plaforms utilised in neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on human microglia-like cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as human-induced pluripotent stem cells. The described microglial platforms can serve as tools for investigating disease biomarkers and improving the clinical translatability of the drug development process in neurodegenerative diseases.","output":"Recent Advances in Microglia Modelling to Address Translational Outcomes in Neurodegenerative Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) is posing a global health emergency and has led to more than 380,000 deaths worldwide The cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on two host proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) There is currently no vaccine available and also no effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19 Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a novel gasotransmitter has been shown to protect against lung damage via its anti-inflammation, antioxidative stress, antiviral, prosurvival, and antiaging effects In light of the research advances on H2S signaling in biology and medicine, this review proposed H2S as a potential defense against COVID-19 It is suggested that H2S may block SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells by interfering with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by attenuating virus assembly/release, and protect SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage by suppressing immune response and inflammation development Preclinical studies and clinical trials with slow-releasing H2S donor(s) or the activators of endogenous H2S-generating enzymes should be considered as a preventative treatment or therapy for COVID-19","output":"H2S as a potential defense against COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Expression of the astrovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been hypothesized to be regulated by (? 1) ribosomal frameshifting.

Political leaders rarely can exchange this initial rally-around-effect into long-term support, however. The central question addressed in this paper is, why political leaders cannot maintain this increase in support over time. Based on three-wave panel data collected during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden (N = 1716), this paper investigates why political leaders cannot maintain initial popular support in the long run. Empirically, we find that perceptions of how Sweden is affected by the crisis and political ideology are both important drivers to understand the declining government approval following a rally-around-the-flag effect.

The intestinal microbiota is an important barrier against invaders entering the gastrointestinal route. In this study, we examined the differences between intestinal microbiota of PEDV-infected and healthy piglets. According to the viral copy numbers, 16 crossbred (Landrace-Yorkshire) piglets were divided into three groups: uninfected, low virus load, and high virus load groups. Next, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to determine the microbiota composition in jejunal content and jejunal mucosal samples from the three groups. PEDV infection induced an imbalance in the microbiota of both jejunal content and jejunal mucosa. The abundance of phylum Firmicutes was higher in uninfected piglets than in infected piglets, whereas the abundance of Proteobacteria was lower in uninfected piglets. Principal coordinate analysis showed significant separation of jejunal microbiota between different groups. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) identified Lactobacillus salivarius as a potential biomarker among three groups at the level of species. Then, in vitro, L. salivarius was able to suppress the infection of PEDV to IPEC-J2 cells and decreased the expression of GRP78 (Glucose-regulating protein 78). In addition, we detected the mRNA expression of genes involved in the FAK/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. When IPEC-J2 cells were treated with L. salivarius before PEDV infection, the mRNA expression levels of ITGA1, ITGA5, ITGB5, FAK, PIK3R1, PIK3CA and AKT1 were significantly higher than those in the control cells (without treatment) at different times post-infection, indicating that L. salivarius may upregulate the FAK/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in IPEC-J2 cells to resist PEDV infection. In summary, PEDV infection altered microbial communities in both jejunal content and jejunal mucosa. L. salivarius has a protective effect against PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells. This study provides a potentially effective strategy to prevent the occurrence and control the spread of PED in the pig production.","output":"Alterations of Suckling Piglet Jejunal Microbiota Due to Infection With Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus and Protection Against Infection by Lactobacillus salivarius"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Germ-free piglets were orally infected with virulent rotavirus to collect jejunal mucosal scrapings at 12 and 18 hours post infection (two piglets per time point). IFN-gamma mRNA expression was stimulated in the mucosa of all four infected piglets, indicating that they all responded to the rotavirus infection. RNA pools prepared from two infected piglets were used to compare whole mucosal gene expression at 12 and 18 hpi to expression in uninfected germ-free piglets (n = 3) using a porcine intestinal cDNA microarray. Microarray analysis identified 13 down-regulated and 17 up-regulated genes. Northern blot analysis of a selected group of genes confirmed the data of the microarray. Genes were functionally clustered in interferon-regulated genes, proliferation/differentiation genes, apoptosis genes, cytoskeleton genes, signal transduction genes, and enterocyte digestive, absorptive, and transport genes. Down-regulation of the transport gene cluster reflected in part the loss of rotavirus-infected enterocytes from the villous tips. Data mining suggested that several genes were regulated in lower- or mid-villus immature enterocytes and goblet cells, probably to support repair of the damaged epithelial cell layer at the villous tips. Furthermore, up-regulation was observed for IFN- induced guanylate binding protein 2, a protein that effectively inhibited VSV and EMCV replication in vitro (Arch Virol 150:1213C1220, 2005).

However, the role of a teacher is equally vital in shaping students' career preference. OBJECTIVE This study therefore explored students' perspectives of their gerontological nurse teachers' abilities and its association with students' willingness to work in older people nursing. DESIGN A cross-sectional correlation study. SETTING Five Universities of Applied Sciences in Finland. PARTICIPANTS Undergraduate nursing students (N = 243). METHOD A self-administered survey using the Gerontological Nurse Teacher Scale (GeNTS) and the subscale (Willingness) of the Students' Interest in Nursing Older People Scale (SINOPS). Descriptive and inferential analysis were conducted using SPSS. RESULTS There was a moderate positive association (R = 0.25, N = 243, p = 0.000) between students' perspectives of their gerontological nurse teachers' abilities and students' willingness to work in older people nursing. The teachers' abilities to develop gerontological nursing course most influence students' willingness in older people nursing (r = 0.26, p = 0.001), whereas their knowledge and interest in gerontology, least influenced students' willingness in older people nursing (r = 0.14, p = 0.025). Also, the teachers abilities to address students' concerns about aging, promote gerontology careers, and demonstrate leadership skills in gerontology all had a similar statistically significant moderate positive association (r = 0.23, p = 0.001) with students' willingness to work in older people nursing. CONCLUSION Faculty need to ensure that there is adequate personal with expertise in gerontological nursing to advocate for resources to establish a reputable gerontological nursing profile in nursing curriculum and to develop and sustain a positive attitude towards older people nursing among students and staff.

To understand this phenomenon, we used various bioinformatics approaches to analyze randomly selected genome sequences (one each) of the Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants submitted to NCBI from 15 to 31 December 2021. We show that: (i) Pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants decreases in the order: Wuhan > Gamma > Delta > Omicron; however, the antigenic property follows the order: Omicron > Gamma > Wuhan > Delta. (ii) Omicron Spike RBD has lower pathogenicity but higher antigenicity than other variants. (iii) Decreased disease severity by Omicron variant may be due to its decreased pro-inflammatory and IL-6 stimulation and increased IFN- and IL-4 induction efficacy. (iv) Mutations in N protein are associated with decreased IL-6 induction and human DDX21-mediated increased IL-4 production in Omicron. (v) Due to mutations, the stability of S, M, N, and E proteins decreases in the order: Omicron > Gamma > Delta > Wuhan. (vi) Stronger Spike RBD-hACE2 binding in Omicron is associated with increased transmissibility. However, the lowest stability of the Omicron Spike protein makes Spike RBD-hACE2 interaction weak for systemic infection and for causing severe disease. Finally (vii), the highest instability of Omicron E protein may also be associated with decreased viral maturation and low viral load leading to less severe disease and faster recovery. Our method may be used for other similar viruses, and these findings will contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the management of emerging variants.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 variants show a gradual declining pathogenicity and pro-inflammatory cytokine spur, an increasing antigenic and antiinflammatory cytokine induction, and rising structural protein instability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a result of major advances in deep learning algorithms and computer processing power, there have been important developments in the fields of medicine and robotics.

There is a huge bibliography on all types of residential load forecast in which researchers have struggled to reach smaller forecasting errors.

The original contribution of this paper regards the forecasting of loads that do not have reference historic data. As the most recent available scenario, we evaluated our forecast with respect to the database of consumption behavior altered by different COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and the cause and effect of the factors influencing residential consumption, both in urban and rural areas. To estimate and validate the results of the forecasts, multiyear hourly residential consumption databases were used. The main findings were related to the huge forecasting errors that were generated, three times higher, if the forecasting algorithm was not set up for atypical consumption. Among the forecasting algorithms deployed, the best results were generated by ANN, followed by ARIMA and LR. We concluded that the forecasting methods deployed retained their hierarchy and accuracy in forecasting error during atypical consumer behavior, similar to forecasting in normal conditions, if a trigger/alarm mechanism was in place and there was sufficient time to adapt/deploy the forecasting algorithm.

MHV-A59 virions use as a receptor a 110- to 120-kDa glycoprotein (MHVR) in the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family of glycoproteins (G. S. Dveksler, M. N. Pensiero, C. B. Cardellichio, R. K. Williams, G. S. Jiang, K. V. Holmes, and C. W. Dieffenbach, J. Virol. 65:6881-6891, 1991; and R. K. Williams, G. S. Jiang, and K. V. Holmes, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:5533-5536, 1991). The role of virus-receptor interactions in determining the species specificity of MHV-A59 was examined by comparing the binding of virus and antireceptor antibodies to cell lines and intestinal brush border membranes (BBM) from many species. Polyclonal antireceptor antiserum (anti-MHVR) raised by immunization of SJL/J mice with BALB/c BBM recognized MHVR specifically in immunoblots of BALB/c BBM but not in BBM from adult SJL/J mice that are resistant to infection with MHV-A59, indicating a major difference in epitopes between MHVR and its SJL/J homolog which does not bind MHV (7). Anti-MHVR bound to plasma membranes of MHV-susceptible murine cell lines but not to membranes of human, cat, dog, monkey, or hamster cell lines. Cell lines from these species were resistant to MHV-A59 infection, and only the murine cell lines tested were susceptible. Pretreatment of murine fibroblasts with anti-MHVR prevented binding of radiolabeled virions to murine cells and prevented virus infection. Solid-phase virus-binding assays and virus overlay protein blot assays showed that MHV-A59 virions bound to MHVR on intestinal BBM from MHV-susceptible mouse strains but not to proteins on intestinal BBM from humans, cats, dogs, pigs, cows, rabbits, rats, cotton rats, or chickens. In immunoblots of BBM from these species, both polyclonal and monoclonal antireceptor antibodies that block MHV-A59 infection of murine cells recognized only the murine CEA-related glycoprotein and not homologous CEA-related glycoproteins of other species. These results suggest that MHV-A59 binds to a mouse-specific epitope of MHVR, and they support the hypothesis that the species specificity of MHV-A59 infection may be due to the specificity of the virus-receptor interaction.","output":"Coronavirus species specificity: murine coronavirus binds to a mouse-specific epitope on its carcinoembryonic antigen-related receptor glycoprotein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) is a unique nucleic-acid modification possessing very high binding affinity and excellent specificity toward complementary RNA or DNA oligonucleotides.

This study aims to assess the relationship between treatment choices, including the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and the health levels of middle-aged and elderly patients with six chronic diseases. The sample data comes from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS 2018). Basic conditions, medical choices and health status of patients are incorporated. The ordered Logit and Logit regression models are used to analyze and compare the effects of six chronic disease patients medical options on their self-rated health (SRH) and depression. The overall average score of SRH is the highest in patients with heart disease (the worst in SRH), which is 3.433. Arthritis patients have the highest overall depression average score (depression) at 0.444. Under the premise of controlling a variety of socio-demographic factors, compared with the non-treatment group, taking TCM has a significant positive effect on SRH of patients with five diseases except hypertension. Both taking western medicine (WM) and taking integrated Chinese and Western medicine (IM) have a significant positive effect on SRH scores of patients with six chronic diseases in middle and old age. Taking TCM has effect on depression of patients with heart or stomach diseases, and taking WM and IM affects depression of middle-aged and elderly chronic patients except diabetes. Taking IM has a greater effect on SRH and depression of chronically ill patients, followed by taking WM, and the effect of taking TCM is relatively small, which is related to the development stage of the disease. Therefore, in the future, the control and treatment of chronic diseases in the middle and late stages can be discussed from the perspective of integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine, but attention should be paid to drug interactions. In order to improve the treatment rate and health level of patients with chronic diseases, their economic burden should be reduced, and they should be guided to choose more reasonable treatment methods.

Our study series aims at forwarding insights on the -cyclodextrin (-CD)CSSRI inclusion complexes by X-ray crystallography combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Here, we report a new crystal form (II) of the 1:1 -CDCparoxetine (PXT) complex, which is inspired by the reported 2:1 -CDCPXT complex (crystal form I), reflecting an elusive phenomenon of the polymorphism in CD inclusion complexes. The -CDCPXT polymorphism stems from the PXT conformational flexibility, which is defined by torsion angles ,  around the -CH(2)CO- group bridging the A- and CCD-rings, of which those of PXT in I and II are totally different. While PXT (II) in an open V-shaped conformation that has the B-ring shallowly inserted in the -CD cavity, PXT (I) in a closed U-shaped structure is mostly entirely embedded in the -CD dimeric cavity, of which the A-ring is deeply inserted in the main -CD cavity. However, PXT molecules in both crystal forms are similarly maintained in the CD cavity via hostCguest NCHO5/O6 H-bonds and C/OCH(B/C) interactions and -CDs have similar 3D arrangements, channel (II) vs. screw-channel (I). Further theoretical explorations on the -CDCPXT thermodynamic stabilities and the PXT conformational stabilities based on their potential energy surfaces (PESs) have been completed by DFT calculations. The 2:1 -CDCPXT complex with the greater presence of dispersion interactions is more energetically favorable than the unimolar complex. Conversely, whereas free PXT, PXT (II) and PXT in complex with serotonin transporter are more energetically stable, PXT (I) is least stable and stabilized in the -CD cavity. As SSRIs could lessen the COVID-19 severity, the CD inclusion complexation not only helps to improve the drug bioavailability, but also promotes the use of antidepressants and COVID-19 medicines concurrently.","output":"Inclusion Scenarios and Conformational Flexibility of the SSRI Paroxetine as Perceived from Polymorphism of -CyclodextrinCParoxetine Complex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has potentially increased the risk for adolescent depression.

Accordingly, this randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04634903 ) tested online single-session interventions (SSIs) during COVID-19 in adolescents with elevated depression symptoms (N = 2,452, ages 13-16). Adolescents from all 50 US states, recruited via social media, were randomized to one of three SSIs: a behavioural activation SSI, an SSI teaching that traits are malleable and a supportive control. We tested each SSI's effects on post-intervention outcomes (hopelessness and agency) and three-month outcomes (depression, hopelessness, agency, generalized anxiety, COVID-19-related trauma and restrictive eating). Compared with the control, both active SSIs reduced three-month depressive symptoms (Cohen's d = 0.18), decreased post-intervention and three-month hopelessness (d = 0.16-0.28), increased post-intervention agency (d = 0.15-0.31) and reduced three-month restrictive eating (d = 0.12-17).

Favipiravir is under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19 and given to patients in many countries following emergency use approval. Based on data from animal studies, favipiravir use is contraindicated during pregnancy. Currently, there is no human data except for a single case report on use of favipiravir in pregnancy. Study Design: This article includes the outcomes of 29 pregnancies reported to the Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology Unit regarding favipiravir use in pregnancy. For drug risk assessment, maternal characteristics were obtained at first contact. After the expected day of delivery, follow-up is conducted by phone call and all relevant data regarding pregnancy and newborn outcome were documented. RESULTS: Of the 29 pregnancies exposed to favipiravir, 5 were electively terminated and 24 resulted in live birth. There were no miscarriages or no stillbirths. There were 25 live births including one pair of twins. Three children were born premature, and one infant had patent foramen ovale. Birth weights, lengths and head circumferences of all infants were within normal range. CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate that favipiravir is unlikely to be a major human teratogen, but experience is still limited for a well-grounded risk assessment.

The aim of the current meta-analysis was to compare the incidence of hypoxemia associated with standard monitoring alone during gastrointestinal endoscopy to that associated with standard monitoring with the addition of capnography. Methods The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials scientific databases were searched to identify relevant studies. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials undertaken up to January 2018 that met our predefined inclusion criteria. The study outcome measures were incidence of hypoxemia, severe hypoxemia, apnea, the use of assisted ventilation, the use of supplemental oxygen, and change in vital signs. Results We included nine trials assessing a total of 3,088 patients who underwent gastrointestinal procedural sedation. Meta-analysis of study outcome revealed that capnography significantly reduced the incidence of hypoxemia (odds ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.49-0.77) and severe hypoxemia (odds ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.81). However, there were no significant differences in other outcomes including incidence of apnea, assisted ventilation, supplemental oxygen, and changes in vital signs. Early procedure termination and patient satisfaction-related outcomes did not differ significantly in the capnography group and the standard monitoring group. Conclusion This study indicates that capnography monitoring is an important addition with regard to the detection of hypoxemia during gastrointestinal procedural sedation, and should be considered in routine monitoring during gastrointestinal endoscopy.","output":"The addition of capnography to standard monitoring reduces hypoxemic events during gastrointestinal endoscopic sedation: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Given the increased use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), chloroquine (CQ), and azithromycin (AZM) during the early months of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is a need to evaluate associated safety concerns. The objective of the study was to summarize the adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with HCQ, CQ, and AZM use during the COVID-19 national emergency declaration and compare the results to known adverse reactions listed in the drugs package inserts. Methods A cross-sectional study design was used. The publicly available Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System quarterly data extract files from January 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020 were downloaded. A disproportionality analysis was conducted using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) to identify possible ADE signals. Poisson regression was used to assess if the number of ADE reports for the three drugs increased over time. Results There was a significant increasing trend in reported ADEs for both HCQ (p < 0.001) and AZM (p < 0.001). Before the national emergency declaration, there were 592 reported ADEs for the three drugs compared to 2,492 ADEs reported since March 13, 2020. Fifty-nine (51.8%) ADEs were listed in the prescribing information, and the remaining 55 (48.2%) were not listed representing possible signals. Conclusions Our results show the reported ADEs for HCQ and AZM have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Differences were observed in both the type of and frequency of the top reported ADEs for the three selected drugs before and after the national emergency declaration. Even though causation cannot be determined from ADE reports, further investigation of some reports may be warranted.

Considering with Erikson (1950) that generativity is a great vector of meaning in life, which allows an individual to ensure the continuity of society through transmission and care, caregivers usually have a higher generativity score than the general population (Grossman & Gruenewald, 2017). This study then looks for signs of generativity among caregivers, hypothesising that it was particularly mobilised during this health crisis. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of psychologists working in hospitals on somatic wards in order to identify the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and signs of generativity. Method: In this exploratory, qualitative, prospective, multicenter study, nine psychologists working in hospital wards were interviewed individually to explore their experiences during a semi-structured interview. Results: The markers of existential crisis linked to COVID-19, such as signs of exhaustion and anxiety, were prominent in their discourse. Strong elements of generativity are also found in the interviews. This reflects the testing of their resources.

A study by the Rossy Cancer Network (RCN) of McGill university assessed six aspects of the patient experience among cancer patients and found that emotional support is the aspect most lacking. To improve this support, trained patient advisors (PAs) can be included as full-fledged members of the healthcare team, given that PA can rely on their knowledge with experiencing the disease and from using health and social care services to accompany cancer patients, they could help to round out the health and social care services offer in oncology. However, the feasibility of integrating PAs in clinical oncology teams has not been studied. In this multisite study, we will explore how to integrate PAs in clinical oncology teams and, under what conditions this can be successfully done. We aim to better understand effects of this PA intervention on patients, on the PAs themselves, the health and social care team, the administrators, and on the organization of services and to identify associated ethical and legal issues. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct six mixed methods longitudinal case studies. Qualitative data will be used to study the integration of the PAs into clinical oncology teams and to identify the factors that are facilitators and inhibitors of the process, the associated ethical and legal issues, and the challenges that the PAs experience. Quantitative data will be used to assess effects on patients, PAs and team members, if any, of the PA intervention. The results will be used to support oncology programs in the integration of PAs into their healthcare teams and to design a future randomized pragmatic trial to evaluate the impact of PAs as full-fledged members of clinical oncology teams on cancer patients experience of emotional support throughout their care trajectory. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first to integrate PAs as full-fledged members of the clinical oncology team and to assess possible clinical and organizational level effects. Given the unique role of PAs, this study will complement the body of research on peer support and patient navigation. An additional innovative aspect of this study will be consideration of the ethical and legal issues at stake and how to address them in the health care organizations.

Over the last 8 years, we have witnessed, in our institution, several cases of severe UPE requiring immediate postoperative extracorporeal life support after MICS. Reviewing the available literature, data regarding this complication after MICS are rare. Consequently, we decided to retrospectively analyse patients scheduled for MICS in our institution. METHODS After approval by our institutional review board, 256 MICS patients were analysed. As a primary end-point, we defined a newly developed UPE, radiographically evident within the first 24 h postoperatively. Secondary end-points were length of stay in the intensive care unit, length of stay in the hospital and in-hospital mortality. Chest radiographs were analysed by an independent consultant of radiology. RESULTS Fifty-one (19.9%) patients showed increased right-sided pulmonary vascular congestion in the 1st postoperative chest radiography performed in the intensive care unit. Five (1.95%) patients immediately required extracorporeal life support after admission to the intensive care unit. Cardiopulmonary bypass time was significantly longer in the UPE group [UPE vs non-UPE 213 (49) vs 196 (43) min; P = 0.013]. More patients with UPE showed a preoperative increase of C-reactive protein >0.4265 mg/dl (P = 0.05). Logistic regression analysis identified a preoperative increase in C-reactive protein >0.4265 mg/dl as well as a prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (odds ratio 1.009, 95% confidence level 1.002-1.016; P = 0.014) independent risk factors, significantly associated with the development of UPE (odds ratio 2.583, 95% confidence interval 1.275-5.233; P = 0.008), a prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (odds ratio 1.009, 95% confidence interval 1.002-1.016; P = 0.014). The presence of pulmonary hypertension (odds ratio 0.273, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.84; P = 0.02) seemed to be a protective factor regarding the genesis of UPE. CONCLUSIONS In accordance with the rarely available literature regarding UPE after MICS, our analysis led us to hypothesize the possibility of an inflammatory disposition for UPE.

We studied if ovariectomy in the model of insulin resistance causes cardiovascular changes, to what extent are these changes reversible by estradiol substitution and if they are accompanied by changes in other organs and tissues. METHODS: Hereditary hypertriglyceridemic female rats were divided into three groups: ovariectomized at 8th week (n = 6), ovariectomized with 17-? estradiol substitution (n = 6), and the sham group (n = 5). The strain of abdominal aorta measured by ultrasound, expression of vascular genes, weight and content of myocardium and also non-cardiac parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: After ovariectomy, the strain of abdominal aorta, expression of nitric oxide synthase in abdominal aorta, relative weight of myocardium and of the left ventricle and circulating interleukin-6 decreased; these changes were reversed by estradiol substitution. Interestingly, the content of triglycerides in myocardium did not change after ovariectomy, but significantly increased after estradiol substitution while adiposity index did not change after ovariectomy, but significantly decreased after estradiol substitution. CONCLUSION: Vascular and cardiac parameters under study differed in their response to ovariectomy and estradiol substitution.

However, an easy-to-use clinically predictive tool for predicting the mortality risk in older individuals with COVID-19 is limited.Objective: To explore an easy-to-use clinically predictive tool that may be utilized in predicting mortality risk in older patients with COVID-19.Methods: A retrospective analysis of 118 older patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Union Dongxihu Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China from January 12 to February 26, 2020. The main results of epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory tests on admission were collected and compared between dying and discharged patients.Results: No difference in major symptoms was observed between dying and discharged patients. Among the results of laboratory tests, NLR, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, urea nitrogen, and D-dimer (NLAUD) show greater differences and have better regression coefficients () when using hierarchical comparisons in a multivariate logistic regression model. Predictors of mortality based on better regression coefficients () included NLR (OR =31.2, 95% CI 6.7-144.5, p < 0.0001), lactate dehydrogenase (OR =73.4, 95% CI 11.8-456.8, p < 0.0001), albumin (OR <0.1, 95% CI <0.1-0.2, p < 0.0001), urea nitrogen (OR =12.0, 95% CI 3.0-48.4, p = 0.0005), and D-dimer (OR =13.6, 95% CI 3.4-54.9, p = 0.0003).

Twenty (7.6%) episodes resulted in transfer to hospital and 136 patients provided responses to feedback surveys and reported their experience as very good (61.7%, n=87) or good (34.8%, n=49). Implementation success was high, with the model widely accepted and adopted across the health service. The service delivery model was considered to be low-cost in comparison to inpatient hospital-based care.ConclusionsOverall, as a rapidly developed and implemented low-tech model of care, the virtual ward was found to provide an effective, accessible and low-cost solution to managing low-acuity COVID-19-positive patients in the community. This model should be considered in future pandemics as a hospital-avoidance response, with the ability to minimise patient-to-healthcare worker transmission, reduce personal protective equipment use and enhance patient adherence with isolation requirements. Targeted remote telemonitoring should be considered as a future modification to improve patient care.What is known about this topic?Virtual wards aim to reduce hospital demand by providing hospital-level care in community settings such as the patients' home.

AIM: To investigate the relation between perfectionism; the quality of family, peer, and college relationships; and media usage and content interests. METHODS: The research was implemented in 2020 with 203 students (134 female, 66%) aged 18-25 years, enrolled at the University of Osijek in Croatia. The questionnaire had five parts: A) sociodemographic data; B) the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale; C) the general life satisfaction and current situational life satisfaction scale; D) family, peer, and college relationships quality scale; and E) media usage and content interests scale. All of the implemented instruments showed satisfactory reliability. A hierarchical regression analysis was implemented with the aim of establishing significant perfectionism predictors. RESULTS: Age and gender were significant predictors of perfectionism. Participants with lower family relationship quality reported higher parental expectations and complaining as well as significantly higher doubts in personal performance and concern about mistakes. Similarly, a lower peer relationship quality predicted doubts in personal performance and stronger concerns about mistakes. The quality of college relationships positively predicted higher perfectionist personal standards and organization. General life satisfaction predicted higher concerns about mistakes, while current situational life satisfaction predicted higher levels of perfectionist organization. Media usage intensity had no significant effect. Adolescent interest in information-educational media predicted higher personal standards as well as concern about mistakes and organization. Higher interests in entertainment media content predicted more concern about mistakes, while interest in negative media content negatively predicted organization in adolescents. CONCLUSION: Sociodemographic traits, relationships with family, peers and colleagues, as well as life satisfaction and media content interests represent significant adolescent perfectionism predictors, explaining 14%-28% of individual perfectionism dimensions.","output":"Predicting adolescent perfectionism: The role of socio-demographic traits, personal relationships, and media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, led to strict domestic quarantine, social isolation policies, and consequently significant psycho-emotional and lifestyle changes. The individual and societal fear and anxiety cause significant stress affecting health-related quality of life (HRQOL). There is evidence of the psychological and mental health effects of the current pandemic on students, who are known to be a vulnerable population. A decrease in physical activity was reported among students, and it is known to contribute to stress levels, which is strongly associated with HRQOL. This study is aimed at evaluating the validity and reliability of SF-12 Health Survey version 2 (SF-12v2) in the assessment of self-perceived quality of life of Italian students following lifestyle changes due to the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with university students attending the faculty of Medicine and Surgery or Health Professions. The Physical Component Summary (PCS12) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS12) of SF-12v2 were compared to the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Internal consistency was examined using Cronbach's Alpha Coefficient. Concurrent validity was evaluated comparing SF-12v2 values to PSS scores, and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) was calculated. Cross-cultural validity was investigated through several analyses for correlations between SF-12v2 scores and the gender of participants, University of Italy, body mass index (BMI), and time spent sitting and exercising. RESULTS: The SF-12v2 questionnaire was administered to 583 medical and health professionals' students in July 2020. Cronbach's Alpha showed acceptable reliability for PCS12 and MCS12. In line with expectations, PCS12 scores differed by BMI groups, while the MCS12 was associated with PSS score and showed differences between genders, BMI groups, time spent sitting, and time spent exercising.

However, their role in patients with brain metastases, which affects over 20% of patients and cause significant morbidity, is less clear. METHODS: We reviewed patients with EGFR/ALK wild-type mNSCLC with CNS metastases. Serial MRIs were reviewed to determine the time to intracranial progression (iPFS). Multivariate regression was performed to adjust for the disease-specific graded prognostic score (ds-GPA). RESULTS: We identified 36 ICI- and 33 chemotherapy-treated patients with baseline CNS metastases and available serial MRIs (average frequency:3.5 months). Baseline radiation was given except for 2 chemotherapy-treated patients with asymptomatic solitary metastasis. The CNS burden of disease was higher in the ICI-treated group (ICI:22% vs. chemotherapy:0% had >10 lesions; p = 0.02), but the utilization of WBRT was not (ICI:31% vs. chemotherapy:45%; p = 0.09). At the time of progression, CNS involvement was identified in 30 % of ICI-treated patients compared to 64 % of chemotherapy controls (p = 0.02). ICI-treated patients had superior iPFS (13.5 vs 8.4 months) that remained significant in multivariate analysis (HR 1.9; 95%CI 1.1--3.4).

Current T1 cancer treatment does not differ according to anatomic location. We therefore compared the disease-free survival of T1 cancer arising from rectum versus colon. METHODS The hospital-based study included subjects with T1 cancer at National Taiwan University Hospital from 2005 to 2014. Clinical, colonoscopy, and histopathology were reviewed for patients with a mean follow-up time of 7.1 (0.7-12.9) years. We conducted Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the risk of recurrence by cancer location and Cox-regression analysis to identify risk factors for T1 cancer recurrence. RESULTS The final cohort included a total of 343 subjects with T1 cancer (mean age, 64.9  11.7 years; 56.1% males), of whom 25 underwent endoscopic resection alone. Of the subjects who underwent surgery, 50 had lymph node metastasis and 268 did not. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the risk of recurrence was higher in T1 rectal cancer than T1 colon cancer (p =0.022). Rectal location, and larger neoplasm size were independent risk factors for recurrence, with hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of 4.84 (1.18-19.92), and 1.32 (1.06-1.65), respectively.

MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was hospitalization status due to COVID-19. Severity of infection was measured using a 4-point ordinal scale: 1. home care; 2. hospitalization without mechanical ventilation; 3. hospitalization and mechanical ventilation, and 4. death. RESULTS: Of 474 patients in the study, 63.3% had confirmed COVID-19 infection and 93.9% were diagnosed with an MS phenotype. Mean age was 4513 (meanSD) years, 72% were female, and 86% were treated with a DMT at the time of infection. 58 patients (12.2%) were hospitalized. 24 patients (5.1%) were critically ill (requiring ICU care or outcome of death), of which 15 patients (3.2%) died. Higher neurological disability and older age independently predicted hospitalization. 85% (102/120) of patients with known antibody results not treated with anti-CD20 therapies were seropositive while only 39.5% (17/43) of patients treated with anti-CD20 demonstrated seropositivity (p<0.0001).

Polyclonal antibodies from hyperimmunized or convalescent animals reacted only with the recombinant proteins identified by MAbs, and the hyperimmune serum bound to the same set of peptides. This suggests that this highly conserved linear antigenic determinant corresponds to an immunodominant region. This region resembles both in location and immunodominance the linear determinant defined on the infectious bronchitis virus S2 subunit. The presence of similar regions in the N-terminal region of the S2 subunit of other coronaviruses is discussed.","output":"Bovine coronavirus spike glycoprotein: localization of an immunodominant region at the amino-terminal end of S2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gamma Coronaviruses (GCoVs) are distributed worldwide, affecting a wide range of bird species, the beluga whale, and bottlenose dolphins.

Social media provides a learning platform that enables students to easily communicate with their peers and subject specialists, and is conducive to students' CL. This study addresses the key concept of CL during the COVID-19 pandemic by assessing social media use among students in higher education. The relationship between social media use and students' performance is crucial to understanding the role of social media during a pandemic. This study is based on constructivism theory and the technology acceptance model. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the conceptual model using SmartPLS. The research findings indicate that social media plays an important role during the pandemic because it provides opportunities for students to enhance CL under the aforementioned situations.

A most common way to estimate jobs that can be performed from home is by carrying out surveys, but this method is time and cost-intensive. Moreover, using US-based O*NET surveys to estimate work from home (WFH) index in a home country, other than the US, can potentially lead to large measurement errors. In this paper, we propose a rating based methodology to estimate the WFH index. The ratings are provided for occupation-wise work activities according to their likelihood of getting performed from home by experts. This method is time and cost-effective and can easily be replicated in any country accounting for indigenous reality.

Globally, it highlights ways in which COVID-19 has further exacerbated the already worrying inequality levels. Specifically, it addresses issues such as vaccine nationalism, rising income inequality levels, while the minority become richer, some from the manufacturing and selling of COVID-related products. From a governance perspective, it is argued that the reliance on liberal democracies to deliver equality is proving to be insufficient as these have been noted to pursue and prioritise market-based strategies that ultimately perpetuate inequality. Ultimately, it is forwarded that there needs to be a rethinking of the global political economy policies, including debt, health systems, intellectual property laws and trade, in order to directly address how such systems perpetuate inequality. In the context of the African continent, the article highlights the difficulty in accessing vaccines, posing a major threat to the continent, which is experiencing waves of the pandemic that are more disturbing than those that went before. It also highlights the extent to which paucity of research affects vaccine efficiency on the continent. COVID-19 has further worsened the already precarious political and economic situation in most of Africa, characterised by countries being unable to pay debt, electoral political violence, COVID-19 denialism, exploiting COVID-19 to clamp down on opposition, and misuse of COVID-19 funds. Thus, it is recommended that there needs to be an overhaul of the already broken fiscal and political environments rather than the adoption of piecemeal economic solutions such as debt freezes, or politically-flawed ones, that ultimately do not work. ? 2021, Pretoria University Law Press.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility of ETAP, with a particular focus on postoperative and oncological results and on functional outcomes. METHODS This study was a multicenter prospective study of unselected consecutive patients with low rectal cancer requiring proctectomy and coloanal anastomosis. All patients underwent a standardized procedure. The study endpoints were the safety and adequacy of the oncological resection criteria. All patients were evaluated with the Wexner Fecal Incontinence Questionnaire after stoma closure. RESULTS Fifty-six consecutive patients (41 men) underwent ETAP between February 2010 and June 2012. The median age was 65 years (39-83), and the median body mass index was 27 (20-42). No intraoperative complications were encountered. There was no postoperative mortality, and the morbidity rate was 26%. The mesorectum was complete in 47 cases (84%) and nearly complete in 9 cases (16%). The median number of lymph nodes retrieved was 12 (range, 7-29) per patient. The median radial and distal margins were 8 mm (0-20) and 10 mm (3-40), respectively. R0 resection was achieved in 53 patients (94.6%). The median Wexner score was 4 (3-12). Thirteen (28%) patients reported stool fragmentation and difficult evacuation.

We used a structured protocol based on clinical, biochemical, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) criteria for the identification of the subset of patients with CRS and analyzed the use of tocilizumab for their treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We did a retrospective case-control analysis of all COVID-19 patients between 15 March and 15 May 2020 with severe to critical disease in ICU. They were evaluated for CRS, and 22 patients who met the criterion were given tocilizumab. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of tocilizumab on escalation of respiratory support and ICU mortality. The secondary objectives were ICU length of stay, trends of inflammatory markers, and any adverse effects. RESULTS: The need for escalation of respiratory support was significantly lower in the tocilizumab group as compared to standard treatment (p = 0.001). The mortality at day 7 and 28 was also significantly lower in the tocilizumab group (p = 0.007 and p = 0.001 respectively).

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Henry Ford Health System Multidisciplinary ICU, a total of 156 beds spread throughout the hospital in Detroit, MI. PATIENTS We obtained data from the electronic medical record of all adult severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2-positive patients managed in the ICU of Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI, between March 13, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Included patients were divided into two groups: people of color (including Black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, and Arab) and White. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 365 patients were evaluated: 219 were Black (60.0%), 129 were White (35.3%), two were Asian (0.6%), eight were Hispanic/Latino (2.2%), and seven were Arab (1.9%). People of color were younger (62.8 vs 67.1; p = 0.007), with equal distribution of sex. People of color had less coronary artery disease (34 [14.4%] vs 35 [27.1%]; p =0.003) and less self-reported use of regular alcohol consumption (50 [21.2%] vs 12 [9.3%]; p = 0.004) than Whites, with no differences in diabetes (125 [53.0%] vs 66 [51.2%]; p = 0.742), hypertension (188 [79.7%] vs 99 [76.8%]; p = 0.516), congestive heart failure (41 [17.4%] vs 32 [24.8%]; p = 0.090), or chronic kidney disease (123 [54.1%] vs 55 [42.6%]; p = 0.083).There was no difference in ICU length of stay between people of color (18 d [CI, 7-47 d]) and Whites (18 d [CI, 6-48 d]; p = 0. 0.979). Neither frequency (72.5% vs 71.3%; p = ns) nor median time to mechanical ventilation between people of color (9 d [CI, 6-15 d]) and Whites (10 d [CI, 5-16 d]; p = 0.733) was different. Overall, 188 patients (51.5 %) died in the hospital. The 28-day mortality was lower in people of color (107/236; 45.3%) versus Whites (73/129; 56.6%) (adjusted odds ratio 0.60; p = 0.034), and there was an increased median survival time in people of color (20 d) versus Whites (13.5 d; hazard ratio 0.62; p = 0.002). The inhospital mortality was lower in people of color versus White, but the difference was not statistically significant (113 [47.9%] vs 75 [58.1%], respectively; p = 0.061). Finally, there was no significant difference in days of symptoms prior to admission, frequency of presenting symptoms, or frequency or severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS In critically ill patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019, people of color had a lower 28-day mortality than Whites with no difference in hospital mortality, ICU length of stay, or rates of intubation.

Dociparstat sodium (DSTAT) is a glycosaminoglycan derivative of heparin with robust anti-inflammatory properties, with the potential to address underlying causes of coagulation disorders with substantially reduced risk of bleeding compared to commercially available heparin. METHODS: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 trial to determine the safety and efficacy of DSTAT added to standard of care in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen. Phase 2 will enroll 12 participants in each of two dose-escalating cohorts to confirm the safety of DSTAT in this population. Following review of the data, an additional 50 participants will be enrolled. Contingent upon positive results, phase 3 will enroll approximately 450 participants randomized to DSTAT or placebo. The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants who survive and do not require mechanical ventilation through day 28. DISCUSSION: Advances in standard of care, recent emergency use authorizations, and positive data with dexamethasone have likely contributed to an increasing proportion of patients who are surviving without the need for mechanical ventilation. Therefore, examining the time to improvement in the NIAID score will be essential to provide a measure of drug effect on recovery.

We aimed to investigate whether increases in the proportion of infections with this variant are associated with differences in symptoms or disease course, reinfection rates, or transmissibility. METHODS: We did an ecological study to examine the association between the regional proportion of infections with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant and reported symptoms, disease course, rates of reinfection, and transmissibility. Data on types and duration of symptoms were obtained from longitudinal reports from users of the COVID Symptom Study app who reported a positive test for COVID-19 between Sept 28 and Dec 27, 2020 (during which the prevalence of B.1.1.7 increased most notably in parts of the UK). From this dataset, we also estimated the frequency of possible reinfection, defined as the presence of two reported positive tests separated by more than 90 days with a period of reporting no symptoms for more than 7 days before the second positive test. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections with the B.1.1.7 variant across the UK was estimated with use of genomic data from the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium and data from Public Health England on spike-gene target failure (a non-specific indicator of the B.1.1.7 variant) in community cases in England. We used linear regression to examine the association between reported symptoms and proportion of B.1.1.7. We assessed the Spearman correlation between the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases and number of reinfections over time, and between the number of positive tests and reinfections. We estimated incidence for B.1.1.7 and previous variants, and compared the effective reproduction number, Rt, for the two incidence estimates. FINDINGS: From Sept 28 to Dec 27, 2020, positive COVID-19 tests were reported by 36 920 COVID Symptom Study app users whose region was known and who reported as healthy on app sign-up. We found no changes in reported symptoms or disease duration associated with B.1.1.7. For the same period, possible reinfections were identified in 249 (07% [95% CI 06-08]) of 36 509 app users who reported a positive swab test before Oct 1, 2020, but there was no evidence that the frequency of reinfections was higher for the B.1.1.7 variant than for pre-existing variants. Reinfection occurrences were more positively correlated with the overall regional rise in cases (Spearman correlation 056-069 for South East, London, and East of England) than with the regional increase in the proportion of infections with the B.1.1.7 variant (Spearman correlation 038-056 in the same regions), suggesting B.1.1.7 does not substantially alter the risk of reinfection. We found a multiplicative increase in the Rt of B.1.1.7 by a factor of 135 (95% CI 102-169) relative to pre-existing variants. However, Rt fell below 1 during regional and national lockdowns, even in regions with high proportions of infections with the B.1.1.7 variant. INTERPRETATION: The lack of change in symptoms identified in this study indicates that existing testing and surveillance infrastructure do not need to change specifically for the B.1.1.7 variant. In addition, given that there was no apparent increase in the reinfection rate, vaccines are likely to remain effective against the B.1.1.7 variant.

We examined short- and long-term results of surgery for MLBO after SEMS placement in our hospital. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 75 patients with MLBO who underwent resection after SEMS placement at our hospital from June 2013 to December 2018. Postoperative morbidity and mortality were evaluated by comparison with the surgical approach. RESULTS Tumor location was significantly higher in the left-side colon and rectum (n = 59, 78.7%) than right-side colon (n = 16, 21.3%). Technical and clinical success rates for SEMS placement were 97.3% and 96.0%, respectively.

PF, bodily pain (BP), and role-emotional (RE) were negatively associated with the female sex (p&lt;0.05). For mental health, the clinical subtypes were significant associated factors (p &lt; 0.05). Length of stay (LOS) was strongly negatively associated with RE and RP, and positively associated with VT (p&lt; 0.05). Logistical regression revealed that non-obese overweight (OR 3.71) and obesity (OR 3.94) were risk factors for a low PCS and female sex (OR 2.22) was a risk factor for a low MCS. Conclusions: Health-related quality of life was poor among COVID-19 patients at the 1 month follow-up. Patients suffered from significant physical and psychological impairment. Therefore, prospective monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 is needed in order to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, as well as to inform prompt and efficient interventions to alleviate suffering.","output":"Predictors of Health-Related Quality of Life and Influencing Factors for COVID-19 Patients, a Follow-Up at One Month"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) treatment aims to provide symptom relief, easing joint pain and enabling mobility. The COVID-19 pandemic affected healthcare systems globally, including ways OA patients were treated. Objectives: This study is to understand how treatment management of knee OA patients and prescribing behavior across US healthcare professionals (HCPs) was affected when COVID-19 impacted healthcare systems and regimes globally Methods: A multi-center online medical chart review study of patients with OA was conducted between May -July 2019 & 2020 among US rheumatologists (rheums), orthopedic surgeons (orthos), primary care physicians with a focus in sports medicine (SM PCPs), and pain specialists, practicing across hospital and private practices. Recruited from a large access panel, physicians were screened for duration of practice in their specialty (3-50 years) and caseload (35 or more knee OA patients personally managed, at least 10 of which must be classified as moderate-severe). Patient charts were recorded for the next 5 eligible patients seen during the screening period. Respondents abstracted patient demographics and treatment regimes used. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data Results: 275 physicians were recruited and collectively reported 1375 patients between May-Jul 2019;260 physicians were recruited and collectively reported 1300 patients between May-Jul 2020. Looking at treatments patients were receiving at time of reporting, oral medications, particularly NSAIDs, were widely used, regardless of the physician specialty. A directional increase of 6% in the proportion of reported patients deriving from sampled primary care SM PCPs from pre-COVID (Q219) to during COVID (Q220), whilst the same is not true for rheums, orthos, and pain specialists. Figure 1. Medication usage in reported knee OA patients across all sampled specialties -Q2 2019 vs Q2 2020 With regards to the usage of injectable therapy, the opposite pattern is seen -higher proportions of reported patients deriving from sampled rheums, orthos & pain specialists receiving injectables vs those deriving from sampled SM PCPs. While focusing on orthos, the proportion of reported patients deriving from them who receive injectables grew by 5% in Q220 (during COVID) vs Q219 (pre-COVID) -directionally more so than other specialties. This is possibly due to limited elective surgeries during the pandemic. Looking deeper into injectable usage amongst reported patients deriving from sampled rheums and orthos, the proportion of the total reported patient set receiving this treatment type is relatively similar across both specialties, prior to, and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, among reported patients who received surgery, a directionally higher proportion of this reported patient cohort deriving from orthos are noted to receive injectables vs those from rheums -this is true both pre-and during the pandemic. Conclusion: From the sample surveyed, it appears that primary care SM PCPs adopted their treatment adjustment during COVID-19 pandemic differently, by prescribing more orals, while other secondary care physicians (rheums, orthos, pain specialists) focused on injection treatment for longer pain relief. Considering movement restrictions and limited elective surgeries during the pandemic, the lack of targeted treatment options for knee OA has been made more apparent. With a burgeoning pipeline, many of which are targeted therapies, it is hopeful that knee OA treaters will be less reliant on symptom remedies and can readily offer patients' longer-acting pain relief or disease modifying options to combat joint deterioration.","output":"Understanding prescription behavior across healthcare professionals in treating knee osteoarthritis before and during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article focuses on SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has all but brought the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to a halt Topics include the global quest to stamp out the polio scourge provides a uniquely salient point of comparison for the ongoing battle against SARS-CoV-2, and the wild poliovirus (WPV) serotypes (WPV2 and WPV3) have been eliminated, and WPV1 remains endemic in only Afghanistan and Pakistan","output":"Vaccinating a Nation: Lessons from the Polio Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has led to more than 3.25 million recorded deaths worldwide as of May 2021. COVID-19 is known to be clinically heterogeneous, and whether the reported oral signs and symptoms in COVID-19 are related to the direct infection of oral tissues has remained unknown. Here, we review and summarize the evidence for the primary infection of the glands, oral mucosae, and saliva by SARS-CoV-2. Not only were the entry factors for SARS-CoV-2 found in all oral tissues, but these were also sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Furthermore, saliva from asymptomatic individuals contained free virus and SARS-CoV-2-infected oral epithelial cells, both of which were found to transmit the virus. Collectively, these studies support an active role of the oral cavity in the spread and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition to maintaining the appropriate use of personal protective equipment and regimens to limit microbial spread via aerosol or droplet generation, the dental community will also be involved in co-managing COVID-19 'long haulers'-now termed Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome.

We examined the modelled surge because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that was used to inform the early hospital-level response against cases as they transpired. METHODS To estimate hospital-level surge in March and April 2020, we simulated a range of scenarios of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada, using the best available data at the time. We applied outputs to hospital-specific data to estimate surge over 6 weeks at 2 hospitals (St. Michael's Hospital and St. Joseph's Health Centre). We examined multiple scenarios, wherein the default (R0 = 2.4) resembled the early trajectory (to Mar. 25, 2020), and compared the default model projections with observed COVID-19 admissions in each hospital from Mar. 25 to May 6, 2020. RESULTS For the hospitals to remain below non-ICU bed capacity, the default pessimistic scenario required a reduction in non-COVID-19 inpatient care by 38% and 28%, respectively, with St. Michael's Hospital requiring 40 new ICU beds and St. Joseph's Health Centre reducing its ICU beds for non-COVID-19 care by 6%. The absolute difference between default-projected and observed census of inpatients with COVID-19 at each hospital was less than 20 from Mar. 25 to Apr. 11; projected and observed cases diverged widely thereafter. Uncertainty in local epidemiological features was more influential than uncertainty in clinical severity. INTERPRETATION Scenario-based analyses were reliable in estimating short-term cases, but would require frequent re-analyses. Distribution of the city's surge was expected to vary across hospitals, and community-level strategies were key to mitigating each hospital's surge.","output":"Estimated surge in hospital and intensive care admission because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada: a mathematical modelling study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses have a high mutation rate, and, thus, there is a continual emergence of new antiviral-resistant strains.

The search for pharmacological substances of plant origin that are effective against animal viruses, which have a high mortality rate or cause large economic losses, has garnered interest in the last few decades. This systematic review compiles 130 plant species that exhibit antiviral activity on 37 different virus species causing serious diseases in animals. The kind of extract, fraction, or compound exhibiting the antiviral activity and the design of the trial were particularly considered for review. The literature revealed details regarding plant species exhibiting antiviral activities against pathogenic animal virus species of the following families-Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Poxviridae, Nimaviridae, Coronaviridae, Reoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae-that cause infections, among others, in poultry, cattle, pigs, horses, shrimps, and fish. Overall, 30 plant species exhibited activity against various influenza viruses, most of them causing avian influenza. Furthermore, 30 plant species were noted to be active against Newcastle disease virus. In addition, regarding the pathogens most frequently investigated, this review provides a compilation of 20 plant species active against bovine herpesvirus, 16 against fowlpox virus, 12 against white spot syndrome virus in marine shrimps, and 10 against suide herpesvirus.

Herein, we report a plant virus exploiting an IRES and its 3'-untranslated region (UTR) to express its internal genes, notably the 3'-proximal viral coat protein gene. Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (HCRSV), a positive-strand non-polyadenylated RNA virus, was demonstrated to harbor a unique 100-nucleotide (nt) IRES, located 124 nt upstream of the coat protein gene, that could function in wheat germ extract, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and mammalian cells. In comparison with other known IRESs of picornaviruses and eukaryotic mRNAs, this 100-nt IRES is distinctively short and simple. The IRES activity was tested in homologous and heterologous bicistronic constructs, and the expression of the 3'-proximal gene was enhanced when the 3'-UTR was present. When the IRES element was bisected, each half still possessed IRES activity and could initiate internal translation on its own. Site-directed mutagenesis and deletion analyses revealed that the primary sequence within the 5' half was crucial for IRES activity, whereas the primary sequence of the second half and a GNRA motif were non-essential. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a mechanism whereby an IRES, located in the 3' portion of the virus genome, co-operates with the 3'-UTR to enhance gene expression differentially.","output":"Synergism of the 3'-untranslated region and an internal ribosome entry site differentially enhances the translation of a plant virus coat protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has led to hundreds of millions of cases and millions of deaths worldwide since its onset.

Due to the complexity of pre-transfusion compatibility testing, many MM patients in England are referred to Red Cell Immunohaematology (RCI) laboratories for investigation and provision of Red Blood Cell (RBC) components. METHODS Over a 4-month period, patients due to commence, or currently on anti-CD38 therapy were identified and flagged on the RCI Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). Data was identified and extracted for further analysis. Interrogation of data was performed independently by two subject matter experts, with discrepancies resolved through further enquiry. RESULTS Of 734 English MM patients, we report an alloimmunisation rate of 0.4% whilst on an anti-CD38 TMAb. This is in line with other smaller cohort studies.

Although the application of big data technology for COVID-19 warning and monitoring remain important tasks, prevention of the diseases rapid spread and reduction of its impact on society are currently the most pressing challenges for the application of big data technology during the COVID-19 pandemic. After the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, the Chinese government and nongovernmental organizations actively used big data technology to prevent, contain, and control the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to discuss the application of big data technology to prevent, contain, and control COVID-19 in China; draw lessons; and make recommendations. METHODS: We discuss the data collection methods and key data information that existed in China before the outbreak of COVID-19 and how these data contributed to the prevention and control of COVID-19. Next, we discuss Chinas new data collection methods and new information assembled after the outbreak of COVID-19. Based on the data and information collected in China, we analyzed the application of big data technology from the perspectives of data sources, data application logic, data application level, and application results. In addition, we analyzed the issues, challenges, and responses encountered by China in the application of big data technology from four perspectives: data access, data use, data sharing, and data protection. Suggestions for improvements are made for data collection, data circulation, data innovation, and data security to help understand Chinas response to the epidemic and to provide lessons for other countries prevention and control of COVID-19. RESULTS: In the process of the prevention and control of COVID-19 in China, big data technology has played an important role in personal tracking, surveillance and early warning, tracking of the viruss sources, drug screening, medical treatment, resource allocation, and production recovery. The data used included location and travel data, medical and health data, news media data, government data, online consumption data, data collected by intelligent equipment, and epidemic prevention data. We identified a number of big data problems including low efficiency of data collection, difficulty in guaranteeing data quality, low efficiency of data use, lack of timely data sharing, and data privacy protection issues. To address these problems, we suggest unified data collection standards, innovative use of data, accelerated exchange and circulation of data, and a detailed and rigorous data protection system. CONCLUSIONS: China has used big data technology to prevent and control COVID-19 in a timely manner. To prevent and control infectious diseases, countries must collect, clean, and integrate data from a wide range of sources; use big data technology to analyze a wide range of big data; create platforms for data analyses and sharing; and address privacy issues in the collection and use of big data.","output":"Application of Big Data Technology for COVID-19 Prevention and Control in China: Lessons and Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article focuses on the audio recording of the editors' summary for articles within the issue on topics including interleukin-6 antagonists for COVID-19, ultraprocessed food consumption among youth, and screening for gestational diabetes.","output":"Audio Highlights."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main purpose of the present study was to determine the association of physical activity (PA) patterns prior to COVID-19 confinement with severe respiratory distress consistent with COVID-19 symptoms.

The contribution of an individual starter component (plant residue) is not experimentally substantiated for any traditional fermented food, but this data are very essential for the formulation of an effective starter. In this study, Asparagus racemosus, which used as a common ingredient of starter for preparation of rice fermented food in the Indian sub-continent, was used as a starter for the preparation of rice fermented food under laboratory scale, and its microbial and nutrient profile was evaluated.

Five fattening pigs (age ~ 17 weeks) additionally showed diarrhoea, not typical for PCMV infections, and one fattener had to be euthanized due to poor condition. Histopathologically, severe fibrinopurulent jejunoileitis with extensive atrophy and fusion of intestinal villi, loss of goblet cells and crypt abscesses associated to C. suis infection were present.

This study has, for the first time, provided comprehensive proteomics data on A. simplex s.s. response to IVM and might deliver new insight into the molecular mechanism by which IVM acts on invasive larvae of A. simplex s.s.","output":"Comparative Proteomics Analysis of Anisakis simplex s.s.-Evaluation of the Response of Invasive Larvae to Ivermectin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of antibodies is responsible for their protective function and long-lasting serum half-life via Fc-mediated effector function, transcytosis, and recycling through its interaction with Fc receptors (FcRs) expressed on various immune leukocytes, epithelial, and endothelial cells. Therefore, the FcCFcRs interaction is a control point of both endogenous and therapeutic antibody function. There are a number of reported genetic variants of FcRs, which include polymorphisms in (i) extracellular domain of FcRs, which change their affinities to Fc domain of antibodies; (ii) both cytoplasmic and intracellular domain, which alters the extent of signal transduction; and (iii) the promoter region of the FcRs gene, which affects the expression level of FcRs, thus being associated with the pathogenesis of disease indications. In this review, we firstly describe the correlation between the genetic variants of FcRs and immunological disorders by individual differences in the extent of FcRs-mediated regulations. Secondly, we discuss the influence of the genetic variants of FcRs on the susceptibility to infectious diseases or cancer in the perspective of FcRs-induced effector functions. Overall, we concluded that the genetic variants of FcRs are one of the key elements in the design of antibody therapeutics due to their variety of clinical outcomes among individuals.","output":"Fc Receptor Variants and Disease: A Crucial Factor to Consider in the Antibody Therapeutics in Clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Europeans are not only exposed to direct effects from climate change, but also vulnerable to indirect effects from infectious disease, many of which are climate sensitive, which is of concern because of their epidemic potential. Climatic conditions have facilitated vector-borne disease outbreaks like chikungunya, dengue, and West Nile fever and have contributed to a geographic range expansion of tick vectors that transmit Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. Extreme precipitation events have caused waterborne outbreaks and longer summer seasons have contributed to increases in foodborne diseases. Under the Green Deal, The European Union aims to support climate change health policy, in order to be better prepared for the next health security threat, particularly in the aftermath of the traumatic COVID-19 experience. To bolster this policy process we discuss climate change-related hazards, exposures and vulnerabilities to infectious disease and describe observed impacts, projected risks, with policy entry points for adaptation to reduce these risks or avoid them altogether.","output":"Climate change and infectious disease in Europe: Impact, projection and adaptation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis, and its ensuing periods of confinement, has generated high levels of social stress on a global scale. In Spain, citizens were isolated in their homes and were not able to interact physically with family members, friends or co-workers. Different resources were employed to face this new stressful and unexpected situation (fitness, reading, painting, meditation, mindfulness, dancing, listening to music, playing instruments, cooking, etc.). Humor was one of the most frequent and widely used strategies in an attempt to keep perspective, deal with the seriousness of the situation and make the day-to-day more bearable. Humor is cultural: it varies from one country to the next and is part of the idiosyncrasies of a culture. It is deemed a particularly important feature of the Spanish personality. During the COVID-19 crisis, the main means or channels of communication were social networks. Throughout the confinement period, there was an excessive flow of humorous memes concerning Coronavirus and related shared experiences during the National State of Emergency decreed by the Spanish Government. The memes draw on irony, ingenuity and creativity to make a difficult and stressful experience more bearable. In this paper, a qualitative methodology based on ethnography research is used and ethnographic fieldwork is carried out on the memes disseminated through WhatsApp during the lockdown period experienced in Spain (14 March to 21 June 2020). The memes are considered to be an example of Netlore, digital contemporary folklore, and a theoretical framework on memes and humor is presented that discusses its different functions in order to channel grief, fear and suffering or to play down specific situations. A corpus of 644 memes that have flooded social networks are categorized and analyzed to witness how the Spanish have managed to bring out their humorous and creative side in difficult times even as they have criticized political decisions, let out their frustrations, described their new normal lives, interacted with others and anticipated the future.","output":"Humor in Times of COVID-19 in Spain: Viewing Coronavirus Through Memes Disseminated via WhatsApp"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health careCacquired viral respiratory infections are common and cause increased patient morbidity and mortality.

METHODS: We screened 96 samples for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR, and 19 samples with Ct values <30 were sequenced using Illumina Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). The genomes were annotated and screened for mutations using the web tool 'coronapp'. Subsequently, different SARS-CoV-2 lineages were assigned using PANGOLIN and Nextclade. RESULTS: Eleven SARS-CoV-2 genomes were successfully sequenced and submitted to the GSAID database. All genomes carried the spike mutation D614 G and were classified as part of the GH clade. The Congolese SARS-CoV-2 sequences belong to lineage B1 and nextclade 20A and 20C, which split into distinct clusters, indicating two separate introductions of the virus into the Republic of Congo.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Ten-year period (2009C2018) in United States centers, from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry. PATIENTS: Pediatric (>30 d and <18 yr old) patients undergoing venovenous and venoarterial ECLS. INTERVENTIONS: The primary predictor was on versus off-hours cannulation. On-hours were defined as 0700C1859 from Monday to Friday. Off-hours were defined as 1900C0659 from Monday to Thursday or 1900 Friday to 0659 Monday or any time during a United States national holiday. The primary outcome was inhospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were complications related to ECLS and length of hospital stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In a cohort of 9,400 patients, 4,331 (46.1%) were cannulated on-hours and 5,069 (53.9%) off-hours. In the off-hours group, 2,220/5,069 patients died (44.0%) versus 1,894/4,331 (44.1%) in the on-hours group (p = 0.93). Hemorrhagic complications were lower in the off-hours group versus the on-hours group (hemorrhagic 18.4% vs 21.0%; p = 0.002). After adjusting for patient complexity and other confounders, there were no differences between the groups in mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.85C1.07; p = 0.41) or any complications (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89C1.17; p = 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Survival and complication rates are similar for pediatric patients when ECLS is initiated on-hours compared with off-hours. This finding suggests that, in aggregate, the current pediatric ECLS infrastructure in the United States provides adequate capabilities for the initiation of ECLS across all hours of the day.","output":"On-Hours Compared to Off-Hours Pediatric Extracorporeal Life Support Initiation in the United States Between 2009 and 2018An Analysis of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Recent SARS-COV2 pandemic put Healthcare System in severe overload. It is well demonstrated that malnutrition is related to worse outcomes in acute and chronic diseases. During this sanitary emergency the Clinical Nutrition Unit in Bologna developed an early nutrition protocol for hospital ad home COVID-19 patients. Methods and procedures Recently published recommendations regarding nutritional needs in COVID-19 patients and general Clinical Nutrition Guidelines were searched on PubMed. Results The hospital algorithm considered three different steps: oral feeding, enteral feeding and parenteral nutrition, recommending early nutrition therapy (within 24-48 hours of hospitalization). We arranged a modified oral \\"COVID diet\\" consisting in soft or creamy hypercaloric-hyperproteic meals in disposable packages . As far as artificial nutrition is concerned we chose hypercaloric, high-protein Oral Nutrition Supplements (ONS), enteral formulas and parenteral formulas, all enriched with EPA and DHA. Due to high micronutrients requirements each patient was recommended high-dose uniparenteral vitamin D and thiamine. For home COVID-19 patients screening using NRS-2003 was recommended: for those at low nutritional risk we provided general nutritional advice; for those at intermediate risk we suggested a dietitian consultation for personalized nutritional plan or ONS prescription. For those at high nutritional risk the nutritionist physician evaluation was suggested for disease-specific ONS or artificial nutrition prescription. All patients were suggested vitamin D 2000 IU / day and a multivitamin supplement. Conclusion During COVID-19 pandemic continuous clinical updating and adaptation to new clinical settings helped to develop an Early Nutrition Protocol for fast nutritional assessment and treatment in a large number of patients and emergency conditions.","output":"EARLY NUTRITION PROTOCOL FOR IN- AND OUT-PATIENTS DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Edible oyster mushroom Pleurotus sapidus was cultivated, on pea pod shell, cauliflower leaves, radish leaves, brassica straw in various combinations of paddy straw.

Total yield and biological efficiency of the mushroom cultivated on substrate containing 20% and 30% vegetable wastes mixed with 70% and 80% (w/w) of paddy straw was found to be better, when compared with yield and efficiency obtained with paddy straw alone (100%). The protein content in the fruit bodies was found to be higher in the mushroom grown on paddy straw mixed with vegetable wastes than that obtained with paddy straw alone. Similarly, six amino acids (Leu, Ile, Val, Thr, Met and Phe) showed a significant increase when the mushroom was grown on a mixed substrate containing both vegetable wastes and paddy straw.
